States Supreme Court\nANA MARIA SUGAR CO. v. QUINONES(1920)\nNo. 54\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Mr. E. Crosby Kindleberger, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Jorge v. Dominguez, of San Juan, P. R., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Quinones sued the Ana Maria Sugar Company, Incorporated, in a district court of Porto Rico to recover damages for breach of an oral contract to deliver sugar. Liability was denied on the ground that plaintiff had agreed to deposit the purchase price in a bank to defendant's credit before the time for delivery and failed to do so. The trial judge, sitting without a jury, found on conflicting testimony that this stipulation was part of the contract; and, as the deposit had not been made, entered judgment for the defendant. Quinones appealed to the Supreme Court of Porto Rico with a bill of exceptions which embodied all the proceedings taken and included the evidence. The Supreme Court did not, like the trial court, make specific findings, but it found as a fact upon a review of conflicting evidence that the stipulation relied upon by the company had not been made, reversed the judgment of the trial court, and itself entered judgment for Quinones in the full amount claimed with interest. 24 P. R. 614. From that judgment the company appealed to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit and assigned 15 errors. Ten of them charged in different forms that the findings of fact on the main issue were erroneous; three related to the measure of damages; the others were that the complaint did not set \n\n[254 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n forth a cause of action and that the facts found were insufficient to support the judgment. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that it could consider the last two errors assigned, since they appeared on the face of the record. It gave as the reason for declining to consider the others that the company had failed to submit to the Supreme Court any request for rulings and had taken no exceptions to rulings made. Concluding that the complaint set forth a good cause of action, that the Supreme Court had power to enter the judgment for Quinones and that the facts found supported its judgment, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed it. 251 Fed. 499, 163 C. C. A. 493. The case comes here on writ of certiorari. \n248 U.S. 555\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 11.\n First. The rule relied upon by the Circuit Court of Appeals for refusing to consider errors assigned is well settled. Errors in rulings of law occurring in the court of the trial cannot be considered on writ of error, unless incorporated into the record by bill of exceptions ( Rodriguez v. United States, \n198 \nU.S. 156, 165\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 617), because they are not part of the record proper (Newport News & Mississippi Valley Co. v. Pace, \n158 U.S. 36\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 743). Compare Nalle v. Oyster, \n230 U.S. 165\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 1043. But this rule applies only when the error complained of is that of the trial court. It has no application when the errors assigned are wholly those alleged to have been committed by an intermediate appellate court; for if the intermediate court has erred in its judgment, the error will appear by the record of that court without a bill of exceptions. Compare Morris v. Deane, 94 Va. 572, 27 S. E. 432. This is true, although the intermediate appellate court has, like the Supreme Court of Porto Rico, power to review the evidence, to make new findings of fact thereon and to enter such judgment as to it may seem proper. See Compilation of Revised Statutes and Codes of Porto Rico,  1141, p. 241; section 5350, p. 867. Compare Andrews v. Cohen, 221 N. Y. 148, 152, 153, 116 N. E. 862. No complaint was made by the company of any action taken by the court of first \n\n[254 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n instance, which had decided in its favor. The errors assigned in the Circuit Court of Appeals related wholly to action taken by the Supreme Court. The reason given by the Circuit Court of Appeals for refusing to consider the errors assigned was, therefore, unsound. But, for other reasons, which will be stated, its decision was right.\n Second. Under Section 35 of the Act of April 12, 1900, c. 191, 31 Stat. 77, 85 (Comp. St.  3791), the power to review final judgments and decrees of the Supreme Court of Porto Rico, then exercised exclusively by this court, was limited to matters of law. Garzot v. De Rubio, \n209 U.S. 283\n; Gonzales v. Buist, \n224 U.S. 126\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 463; Rosaly v. Graham, \n227 U.S. 584\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 333; Ochoa v. Hernandez, \n230 U.S. 139\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 1033; Porto Rico v. Emmanuel, \n235 U.S. 251\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 33. When that act was superseded by section 244 of the Judicial Code (see Comp. St.  1215), writs of error and appeals from the insular Supreme Court became subject to the same regulations which governed appeals from the district courts of the United States. Thereby this court acquired power to review questions of fact in cases coming to it on appeal in equity or admiralty (Elzaburu v. Chaves, \n239 \nU.S. 283, 285\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 47); but in actions at law which are reviewable on writ of error, there was no right in this court to review the facts, although the case was tried without a jury ( Behn v. Campbell, \n205 \nU.S. 403, 407\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 502). The jurisdiction to review judgments and decrees of the Porto Rico courts conferred upon the Circuit Court of Appeals by Act of January 28, 1915, c. 22, 38 Stat. 803, is subject to the same limitation. The cause of action here sued on is in its nature a legal one. The review should therefore have been prosecuted by writ of error instead of by appeal, although the case was tried without a jury. Oklahoma City v. McMaster, \n196 U.S. 529\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 324. By reason of section 4 of the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 727 (Comp. St.  1649a), this failure to adopt the proper appellate proceeding is no longer fatal. But the provision does not abolish the distinction between writs of error and appeals. It merely provides that the party seeking review \n\n[254 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n shall have it in the appropriate way, notwithstanding a mistake in choosing the mode of review. Gauzon v. Compania General, etc., \n245 U.S. 86\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 46.\n It was not contended in the insular Supreme Court that there was no legal evidence to support the finding of the District Court. Its judgment was reversed solely because the insular Supreme Court reached a different conclusion on the issue of fact raised by conflicting testimony. Nor was it contended in the Circuit Court of Appeals that there was no legal evidence on which the insular Supreme Court could properly rest its finding. Ten of the assignments of error were directed to findings of fact by the Supreme Court. As these assignments of error raised no question of law and as the Circuit Court of Appeals had no power to review findings of fact in an action at law, it properly denied consideration to these 10 assignments of error.\n Third. It is contended that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed because the Supreme Court adopted an erroneous measure of damages. The contract was made August 4, 1914, and the contract price was $3.22 1\/2 per hundred weight. All the sugar was to have been delivered before the close of the following week which ended on August 15. The Supreme Court allowed as damages the sum of $6,173.24, with interest. It is insisted here that the sugar was deliverable in installments; that there was a gradual rise in sugar between August 6 and August 15; and that the Supreme Court should have determined the amount recoverable by ascertaining the market price when each of the installments was deliverable.\n In the Circuit Court of Appeals the company likewise assigned as error that the Supreme Court had allowed compensation based upon the difference between the contract price of the sugar and its market price at the end of the term fixed for delivery. This assignment antitled \n\n[254 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n it to have that question considered in the Circuit Court of Appeals, although no exception had been taken in the Supreme Court. The Circuit Court of Appeals did not consider whether the Supreme Court had adopted the proper measure of damages. It decided only that the Supreme Court was not obliged to send the case back to the court of first instance to fix the damages; that it had power to do so itself upon a review of the evidence introduced below; and that its discretion in doing this could not be said to have been exercised unreasonably, since the question of damages had been tried fully below, citing Burnet v. Desmornes, \n226 \nU.S. 145, 148\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 63.\n The difficulty with the company's contention is that it does not appear that the Supreme Court fixed the amount of the recovery by applying the measure of damages objected to. The contention that it did so finds some support both in the complaint and in the evidence. But the opinion which discusses the subject of damages at length rests the allowance on other grounds. The court found that the company had, during the month of August, sold at $6.52 large quantities of sugar, including the lot in question, and justified its allowance of damages on three grounds: (1) That on the facts the profits through sale at increased market prices were in contemplation of the parties when the contract was entered into, and the profit which would have been earned, being ascertainable, could be recovered at common law; (2) that the profits were earned by the company on sugar actually belonging to Quinones, and that under Civil Code of Porto Rico,  1073, he was entitled to these profits either 'as damages or as the proceeds of a resulting trust'; and (3) that if the company wished to limit the damages by the market price on August 6, it must have proved that other sugar was obtainable on that day in Porto Rico, at what it contended was the then market price, but that it had not done so. These rulings by the Supreme Court on the \n\n[254 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n measure of damages were not assigned as error in the Circuit Court of Appeals and so far as appears objection to them was not otherwise called to its attention. Under rule 11 of that court (150 Fed. xxvii, 79 C. C. A. xxvii) errors not assigned are to be disregarded, except that the court, in its discretion, may notice a plain error not assigned. As the above rulings of the Supreme Court on the measure of damages were not assigned as errors in the Circuit Court of Appeals and were not considered by it they cannot be insisted upon here as grounds for reversal. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Davis v.

C., and William J. Fallon, of White Plains, N. Y., for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Holding that the petition failed to disclose adequate grounds therefor, the court below denied appellant's \n\n[254 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n application for a writ of habeas corpus, through which he sought release from confinement for contempt. The cause is here by reason of the Constitutional question involved.\n The petition alleges:\n That, having been adjudged an involuntary bankrupt, Arndstein was called before special commissioners for examination under section 21a, Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9605). He refused to answer a long list of questions, claiming that to do so might tend to degrade and incriminate him. The District Judge upheld this contention, and denied a motion to punish for contempt.\n That subsequent to such examination, and under the direction of the court, the bankrupt filed schedules under oath, which purported to show his assets and liabilities. When interrogated concerning these, he set up his constitutional privilege, and refused to answer many questions, which are set out. Thereupon he was committed to jail.\n The writ was refused upon the theory that by filing schedules without objection the bankrupt waived his constitutional privilege, and could not thereafter refuse to reply when questioned in respect of them. This view of the law we think is erroneous. The schedules, standing alone, did not amount to an admission of guilt or furnish clear proof of crime, and the mere filing of them did not constitute a waiver of the right to stop short whenever the bankrupt could fairly claim that to answer might tend to incriminate him. See Brown v. Walker, \n161 \nU.S. 591, 597\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 644; Foster v. People, 18 Mich. 266, 274; People v. Forbes, 143 N. Y. 219, 230, 38 N. E. 303; Regina v. Garbett, 2 C. & K. 474, 495.

U.S.(1920)\nNo. 212\nArgued: January 30, 1920Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Cornelius B. Nolan and William Scallon, both of Helena, Mont., for appellant and plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 159, 162]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Nebeker, for the United States. \n\n[252 U.S. 159, 163]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These two cases were argued and will be decided together. \n No. 212\n is an appeal from a decree, entered in a suit in equity, in favor of the government granting a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from trespassing upon described lands in Montana by grazing sheep thereon and for nominal damages for such trespass.\n No. 285 is a proceeding in error, in which reversal is sought of a judgment rendered in an action at law against plaintiff in error, appellant in the equity suit, for a penalty for the same trespass.\n The validity of the right asserted by the government, in both cases, turns upon whether the lands involved were 'Indian lands' or 'public lands.' If they were the former, the decree in the equity case should be affirmed, but in the law case there would remain the question as to whether 'sheep' were within the terms of the act under which the penalty was imposed.\n In both cases the government contends that the appellant violated section 2117 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  4107), which reads as follows:\n'Every person who drives or otherwise conveys any stock of horses, mules, or cattle, to range and feed on any land belonging to any Indian or Indian tribe, without the consent of such tribe, is liable to a penalty of one dollar for each animal of such stock.'\n\n The company admits that it pastured 5,000 sheep on the described lands without the consent of the Crow Tribe of Indians or of the United States, but denies that they were 'Indian lands' and contends that they were 'public lands,' upon which it was lawful for it to pasture its stock.\n Whether the described lands were Indian or public lands depends upon the construction to be given the act of Congress, approved April 27, 1904 ( 33 Stat. 352, c. 1624), entitled \n\n[252 U.S. 159, 164]\n\u00a0\n 'An act to ratify and amend an agreement with the Indians of the Crow Reservation in Montana, and making appropriations to carry the same into effect.'\n The agreement embodied in this act of Congress provided for a division of the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana on boundary lines which were described, and the lands involved in this case were within the part of the reservation as to which the Indians, in terms, 'ceded, granted and relinquished' to the United States all of their 'right, title and interest.'\n The argument of the Sheep Company is that the United States being owner of the fee of the land before the agreement, the effect of this grant and release of their possessory right by the Indians was to vest the complete and perfect title in the government, and thereby make the territory a part of the public lands with the interest of the Indians transferred to the proceeds to be derived from them. For this conclusion the following cases are cited: United States v. Choctaw Nation and Chickasaw Nation, \n179 U.S. 494\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 149; Bean v. Morris, 159 Fed. 651, 86 C. C. A. 519; Id., \n221 U.S. 485\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 703. But in the first of these cases the Indians parted with their possessory rights for a cash payment by the United States (\n179 U.S. 527\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 149), and in the second the character of the agreement under which the Indian title was said, incidentally, to have terminated, does not appear.\n Whether or not the government became trustee for the Indians or acquired an unrestricted title by the cession of their lands, depends in each case upon the terms of the agreement or treaty by which the cession was made. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 394\n, 398 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 650; United States v. Mille Lac Band of Chippewa Indians, \n229 \nU.S. 498, 509\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 811\n\n\n The agreement we have in this case is elaborate and, in consideration of the grant by the Indians of their possessory right, the government assumed many obligations with respect to the lands and the proceeds of them-notably, \n\n[252 U.S. 159, 165]\n\u00a0\n that it would sell the land to settlers, except sections 16 and 36, for not less than $4 per acre and would pay the proceeds to the Indians, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in a manner prescribed. Thus, the government contracted to expend $90,000 of the proceeds of the land in the extension of the irrigation system on the reservation remaining, $295,000 in the purchase of stock to be placed on the reservation, with a further contingent purchase in contemplation of $200, 000, $40,000 in fencing, $100,000 for schools, and $10,000 for a hospital for the Indians, for the maintenance of which $50,000 additional was to be held in trust. It was further provided that, to the extent that feasible irrigation prospects could be found, parts of the released lands should be withdrawn under the Reclamation Act and be disposed of within five years, but not for less than $4 an acre. $There were many other like provisions, all intended to secure to the Indians the fullest possible value for what are referred to in the agreement as 'their lands' and to make use of the proceeds for their benefit.\n It was provided that semiannual reports should be made by the Secretary of the Interior to the Indians, showing the amounts expended from time to time and the amounts remaining in each of the several funds.\n It is obvious that the relation thus established by the act between the government and the tribe of Indians was essentially that of trustee and beneficiary and that the agreement contained many features appropriate to a trust agreement to sell lands and devote the proceeds to the interests of the cestui que trust. Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 394\n, 398 S., 22 Sup. Ct. 650. And that this was precisely the light in which the Congress regarded the whole transaction, is clear from the terms of the concluding section, the eighth:\n'That nothing in this act contained shall in any manner bind the United States to purchase any portion of the land \n\n[252 U.S. 159, 166]\n\u00a0\n herein described, except sections sixteen and thirty-six or the equivalent in each township, or to dispose of said land except as provided herein, or to guarantee to find purchasers for said lands or any portion thereof, it being the intention of this act that the United States shall act as trustee for said Indians to dispose of said lands and to expend and pay over the proceeds received from the sale thereof only as received, as herein provided.' 33 Stat. pp. 352, 361, c. 1624.\n\n Taking all of the provisions of the agreement together, we cannot doubt that, while the Indians by the agreement released their possessory right to the government, the owner of the fee, so that, as their trustee, it could make perfect title to purchasers, nevertheless, until sales should be made, any benefits which might be derived from the use of the lands would belong to the beneficiaries and not to the trustee, and that they did not become 'public lands' in the sense of being subject to sale, or other disposition, under the General Land Laws. Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Harris, \n215 \nU.S. 386, 388\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 138. They were subject to sale by the government, to be sure, but in the manner and for the purposes provided for in the special agreement with the Indians, which was embodied in Act April 27, 1904 (33 Stat. 352), and as to this point the case is ruled by the Hitchcock and Chippewa Cases, supra. Thus we conclude that the lands described in the bill were 'Indian lands' when the company pastured its sheep upon them, in violation of section 2117 of Revised Statutes, and the decree in No. 212 must be affirmed.\n There remains the question as to the construction of R. S.  2117.\n In the law case it is admitted in the bill of exceptions that the Sheep Company, without the permission of the Crow Tribe of Indians or of the United States, drove, ranged, and grazed 5,000 head of sheep on the land described in the complaint, and that at the time no settlement \n\n[252 U.S. 159, 167]\n\u00a0\n or entries thereon had been authorized under acts of Congress. The judgment against the company was for $5,000-$1 for each sheep pastured on the land.\n The company contends that the judgment should be reversed for the reason that R. S.  2117, imposes the penalty prescribed, only, for ranging and feeding on the lands of an Indian tribe without permission 'any stock of horses, mules, or cattle,' and that 'sheep' are not within its terms.\n If this were a recent statute, and if we were giving it a first interpretation, we might hesitate to say that by the use of the word 'cattle' Congress intended to include 'sheep.'\n But the statute is an old one, which has been interpreted in published reports of the courts for almost 50 years, and in an opinion by the Attorney General of the United States, rendered in 1884, as fairly comprehending 'sheep' within the meaning of the word 'cattle' as used in it.\n The statute first appears as section 2 of an 'Act to regulate trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes, and to preserve peace on the frontiers,' enacted in 1796 and was then applicable only to 'any stock of horses or cattle,' etc. 1 Stat. 469, 470. The section was re-enacted without change in 1802. 2 Stat. 139, 141. In 1834 it was given its present form, which was carried into the Revised Statutes, without change in the wording we are considering. R. S.  2117.\n In 1871 suit was brought in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, claiming that penalties under the section had been incurred by pasturing 'sheep,' as in this case, on Indian lands without the consent of the tribe. In a carefully prepared and clearly reasoned opinion Judge Deady overruled a demurrer to the complaint, and held that 'sheep' were clearly within the mischief to be remedied and fairly within the language of the act. \n\n[252 U.S. 159, 168]\n\u00a0\n This case has not been overruled or modified by any later decision. The court quotes definitions of the word 'cattle' from several dictionaries, emphasizing especially, this from the 1837 edition of Webster:\n'In its primary sense, the word includes, camels, horses, asses, all the varieties of domesticated horned beasts of the bovine genus, sheep of all kinds and goats, and perhaps swine. ... Cattle in the United States, in common usage, signifies only beasts of the bovine genus.'\n\n Upon this authority, and applying the rule that in determining the legislative intent the mischief to be prevented should be looked to, and saying that 'it will not be denied that sheep are as much within the mischief to be remedied as horses or oxen,' the court concludes:\n'I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the word cattle, as used in the Indian Intercourse Act of 1834 [Comp. St.  4107] includes, and was intended to include, sheep, as well as cows and oxen.' United States v. Mattock, 2 Sawy. 148, Fed. Cas. No. 15, 744.\n\n Twelve years later, in 1884, the Attorney General of the United States, in an opinion to the Secretary of War, regarded the question as so little doubtful that he disposed of it in this single sentence:\n'The standard lexicographers place sheep under the head of cattle, and it would seem to be in derogation of the manifest intention of Congress to take the word in a more confined sense.' 18 Opinions of Attorneys General, p. 91.\n\n In 1874, in Decatur Bank v. St. Louis Bank, 21 Wall. 294, this court held that the word 'cattle,' in a letter of credit guaranteeing 'drafts on shipments of cattle,' was comprehensive enough to justify the giving of credit on shipments of 'hogs.' This pertinent paragraph is from the opinion:\n'That stock of some kind formed part of the guarantee is quite plain, but is the word 'cattle' in this connection to be confined to neat cattle alone; that is, cattle of the bovine genus? It is often so applied, but it is [quotin g \n\n[252 U.S. 159, 169]\n\u00a0\n from Worcester's Dictionary] 'also a collective name for domestic quadrupeds generally, including not only the bovine tribe, but horses, asses, mules, sheep, goats, and swine.' In its limited sense, it is used to designate the different varieties of horned animals, but it is also frequently used with a broader signification as embracing animals in general which serve as food for man. In England, even in a criminal case, where there is a greater strictness of construction than in a civil controversy, pigs were held to be included within the words 'any cattle.\"\n\n The most recent definitions of the dictionaries are as follows:\n Webster's New International Dictionary defines 'cattle' thus:\n'Collectively, live animals held as property or raised for some use, now usually confined to quadrupeds of the bovine family, but sometimes including all domestic quadrupeds, as sheep, goats, horses, mules, asses, swine,' etc.\n\n The Standard Dictionary defines the word as meaning:\n'Domesticated bovine animals, as oxen, cows, bulls, and calves; also, though seldom now as compared with former times, any live stock, kept for use or profit, as horses, camels, sheep, goats, swine' etc.\n\n Thus, although the word 'sheep' is not in the section, and although in present day usage the word 'cattle' would rarely be used with a signification sufficiently broad to include them, nevertheless, since the pasturing of sheep is plainly within the mischief at which this section aimed, since the word 'cattle,' which is used, may be given, say all the authorities, a meaning comprehensive enough to include them, and since the courts and the Department of Justice for almost 50 years have interpreted the section as applicable to 'sheep,' we accept this as the intended meaning of the section, for, had it been otherwise, Congress, we must assume, would long since have corrected it. \n\n[252 U.S. 159, 170]\n\u00a0\n It is argued that the rule that penal statutes must be strictly construed forbids such latitude of construction. But this is sufficiently and satisfactorily answered by repeated decisions of this court.\n'The admitted rule that penal statutes are to be strictly construed, is not violated by allowing their words to have full meaning, or even the more extended of two meanings, where such construction best harmonizes with the context, and most fully promotes the policy and objects of the Legislature.' United States v. Hartwell, 6 Wall. 385; United States v. Freeman, 3 How. 556, 565; United States v. Lacher, \n134 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 625.\n\n It is also contended far from confidently, that the recovery of nominal damages in the equity suit is a bar to the recovery of the penalty in the case at law. While the amount of the statutory penalty for the trespass was prayed for in the equity suit, yet the trial court, saying that equity never aids the collection of such penalties (Marshall v. Vicksburg, 15 Wall. 146, 149), and that no evidence of substantial damage had been introduced, limited the recovery to one dollar and costs. Rejection of a claim because pursued in an action in which it cannot be entertained does not constitute an estoppel against the pursuit of the same right in an appropriate proceeding. We agree with the Court of Appeals that--\n'A judgment is not conclusive of any question which, from the nature of the case or the form of action, could not have been adjudicated in the case in which it was rendered.'\n\n It results that the decree in No. 212 and the judgment in No. 285 must both be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nASKREN v. CONTINENTAL OIL CO.(1920)\nNo. 521\nArgued: Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 444, 445]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. B. Renehan, of Santa Fe, N. M., for appellants.\n Messrs. Charles R. Brock, of Denver, Colo., and E. R. Wright, of Santa Fe, N. M., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These suits were brought by the three companies, appellees, in the District Court of the United States for the \n\n[252 U.S. 444, 446]\n\u00a0\n District of New Mexico to enjoin the enforcement of an act of the Legislature of the state entitled:\n'An act providing for an excise tax upon the sale or use of gasoline and for a license tax to be paid by distributors and retail dealers therein; providing for collection and application of such taxes; providing for the inspection of gasoline and making it unlawful to sell gasoline below a certain grade without notifying purchaser thereof; providing penalties for violations of this act and for other purposes.'\n\n The law is found in Session Laws of New Mexico 1919, c. 93, p. 182.\n The cause came before three judges upon an application for temporary injunction and a counter motion to dismiss the bills of complaint. The temporary injunction was granted, and a direct appeal taken to this court.\n The provisions of the act, so far as necessary to be considered, define a distributor of gasoline as meaning:\n'Every person, corporation, firm, copartnership and association who sells gasoline from tank cars, receiving tanks or stations, or in or from tanks, barrels or packages not purchased from a licensed distributor of gasoline in this state.'\n\n A retail dealer is defined as meaning:\n'A person, other than a distributor of gasoline, who sells gasoline in quantities of fifty gallons or less.'\n\n Every distributor is required to pay an annual license tax of $50 for each distributing station, or place of business, and agency. Every retail dealer is required to pay an annual license tax of $5 for every place of business or agency. An excise tax is imposed upon the sale or use of gasoline sold or used in the state after July 1, 1919; such tax to be 2 cents per gallon on all gasoline so sold or used. Any distributor, or dealer, who shall fail to make return or statement as required in the act, or shall refuse, neglect or fail to pay the tax upon all sales or use of gasoline, or who shall make any false return or statement, or shall knowingly sell, distribute or use any gasoline without the tax upon the sale or use thereof \n\n[252 U.S. 444, 447]\n\u00a0\n having been paid as provided in the act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and punished by a fine and forfeiture of his license. It is made unlawful for any person (except tourists or travelers to the extent provided in the act) to use any gasoline not purchased from a licensed distributor or retail dealer without paying the tax of 2 cents per gallon. Inspectors are provided for each of the eight judicial districts of the state, who are required to see that the provisions of the act are enforced, and privileged to examine books and accounts of distributors and retail dealers, or warehousemen or others receiving and storing gasoline and of railroad and transportation companies, relating to purchases, receipts, shipments, or sales of gasoline; their salarie are provided, and salaries and expense bills are to be paid out of the state road fund. Any person who shall engage or continue in the business of selling gasoline without a license or after such license has been forfeited, or shall fail to render any statement, or make any false statement therein, or who shall violate any provision of the act the punishment for which has not been theretofore provided, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine or imprisonment, or both. The state treasurer is required to set aside from the license fees and taxes collected under the provisions of the act a sufficient sum to pay the salaries and traveling expenses of the inspectors out of the money received from such collections, and to place the balance to the credit of the state road fund, to be used for the construction, improvement and maintenance of public highways.\n It is evident from the provisions of the act thus stated that it is not an inspection act merely; indeed, the inspectors do not seem to be required to make any inspection beyond seeing that the provisions of the act are enforced, and the excess of the salaries and fees of the inspectors is to be used in making roads within the state. Considering \n\n[252 U.S. 444, 448]\n\u00a0\n its provisions and the effect of the act, it is a tax upon the privilege of dealing in gasoline in the state of New Mexico.\n The bills in the three cases are identical except as to the number of distributing stations alleged to belong to the companies respectively. As there was no answer, and the bills were considered upon application for injunction, and motion to dismiss, their allegations must be taken to be true.\n Plaintiffs are engaged in the business of buying and selling gasoline and other petroleum products. The bills state that they purchase gasoline in the states of Colorado, California, Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas, and ship it into the state of New Mexico, there to be sold and delivered. The bills describe two classes of business:\n First, that they purchase in the states mentioned, or in some one of said states, gasoline, and ship it in tank cars from the state in which purchased into the state of New Mexico, and there, according to their custom and the ordinary method in the conduct of their business, they sell in tank cars the whole of the contents thereof to a single customer, before the package or packages, in which the gasoline was shipped have been broken. In the usual and regular course of their business they purchase gasoline in one of the states, other than the state of New Mexico, and ship it, so purchased from that state, in barrels and packages containing not less than two 5-gallon cans into the state of New Mexico, and there, in the usual and ordinary course of their business, without breaking the barrels and packages, containing the cans, it is their custom to sell the gasoline in the original packages and barrels. The gasoline is sold and delivered to the customers in precisely the same form and condition as when received in the state of New Mexico; that this manner of sale makes the plaintiffs distributors of gasoline as the term is defined in the statute, and they are required to pay the sum of $50 per annum for each of their stations \n\n[252 U.S. 444, 449]\n\u00a0\n as an annual license tax for purchasing, shipping and selling gasoline as aforesaid.\n A second method of dealing in gasoline is described in the bills: That the gasoline shipped to the plaintiffs from the other states, as aforesaid, is in tank cars, and plaintiff, or plaintiffs, sell such gasoline from such tank cars, barrels and packages in such quantities as the purchaser requires.\n As to the gasoline brought into the state in the tank cars, or in the original packages and so sold, we are unable to discover any difference in plan of importation and sale between the instant case and that before us in Standard Oil Co. v. Graves, \n249 U.S. 389\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 320, in which we held that a tax, which was in effect a privilege tax, as is te one under consideration, providing for a levy of fees in excess of the cost of inspection, amounted to a direct burden on interstate commerce. In that case we reaffirmed, what had often been adjudicated heretofore in this court, that the direct and necessary effect of such legislation was to impose a burden upon interstate commerce; that under the federal Constitution the importer of such products from another state into his own state for sale in the original packages, had a right to sell the same in such packages without being taxed for the privilege by taxation of the sort here involved. Upon this branch of the case we deem it only necessary to refer to that case, and the cases therein cited, as establishing the proposition that the license tax upon the sale of gasoline brought into the state in tank cars, or original packages, and thus sold, is beyond the taxing power of the state.\n The plaintiffs state in the bills that their business in part consists in selling gasoline in retail in quantities to suit purchasers. A business of this sort, although the gasoline was brought into the state in interstate commerce, is properly taxable by the laws of the state.\n Much is made of the fact that New Mexico does not produce gasoline, and all of it that is dealt in within that \n\n[252 U.S. 444, 450]\n\u00a0\n state must be brought in from other states. But, so long as there is no discrimination against the products of another state, and none is shown from the mere fact that the gasoline is produced in another state, the gasoline thus stored and dealt in, is not beyond the taxing power of the state. W. F. Wagner & Sons v. City of Covington, \n251 U.S. 95\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 93, 64 L. Ed. --, decided December 8, 1919, and the cases from this court cited therein.\n Sales of the class last mentioned would be a subject of taxation within the legitimate power of the state. But from the averments of the bills it is impossible to determine the relative importance of this part of the business as compared with that which is nontaxable, and at this preliminary stage of the cases we will not go into the question whether the act is separable, and capable of being sustained so far as it imposes a tax upon business legitimately taxable. That question may be reserved for the final hearing. The District Court did not err in granting the temporary injunctions, and its orders are\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBATES v.

The case was sent to a master who found for the defendants; but the District Court entered a decree against all of them. 229 Fed. 772. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decree, dismissed the bill as against all except the administrator of Edwin Dresser, the president, cut down the amount with which he was charged1 and refused to add interest from the date of the decree of the District Court. Dresser v. Bates, 250 Fed. 525, 162 C. C. A. 541. Dresser's administrator and the receiver both appeal, the latter contending that the decree of the District Court should be affirmed with interest and costs.\n The bank was a little bank at Cambridge with a capital of $100,000 and average deposits of somewhere about $300,000. It had a cashier, a bookkeeper, a teller and a messenger. Before and during the time of the losses Dresser was its president and executive officer, a large stockholder, with an inactive deposit of from $35,000 to $50,000. From July, 1903, to the end, Frank L. Earl was cashier. Coleman, who made the trouble, entered the service of the bank as messenger in September, 1903. In January, 1904, he was promoted to be bookkeeper, being then not quite eighteen but having studied bookkeeping. In the previous August an auditor employed on the retirement of a cashier had reported that the daily balance book was very much behind, that it was impossible to \n\n[251 U.S. 524, 527]\n\u00a0\n prove the deposits, and that a competent bookkeeper should be employed upon the work immediately. Coleman kept the deposit ledger and this was the work that fell into his hands. There was no cage in the bank, and in 1904 and 1905 there were some small shortages in the accounts of three successive tellers that were not accounted for, and the last of them, Cutting, was asked by Dresser to resign on that ground. Before doing so he told Dresser that someone had taken the money and that if he might be allowed to stay he would set a trap and catch the man, but Dresser did not care to do that and thought that there was nothing wrong. From Cutting's resignation on October 7, 1905, Coleman acted as paying and receiving teller, in addition to his other duty, until November, 1907. During this time there were no shortages disclosed in the teller's accounts. In May, 1906, Coleman took $2,000 cash from th vaults of the bank, but restored it the next morning. In November of the same year he began the thefts that come into question here. Perhaps in the beginning he took the money directly. But as he ceased to have charge of the cash in November, 1907, he invented another way. Having a small account at the bank, he would draw checks for the amount he wanted, exchange checks with a Boston broker, get cash for the broker's check, and, when his own check came to the bank through the clearing house, would abstract it from the envelope, enter the others on his book and conceal the difference by a charge to some other account or a false addition in the column of drafts or deposits in the depositors' ledger. He handed to the cashier only the slip from the clearing house that showed the totals. The cashier paid whatever appeared to be due and thus Coleman's checks were honored. So far as Coleman thought it necessary, in view of the absolute trust in him on the part of all concerned, he took care that his balances should agree with those in the cashier's book. \n\n[251 U.S. 524, 528]\n\u00a0\n By May 1, 1907, Coleman had abstracted $17,000, concealing the fact by false additions in the column of total checks, and false balances in the deposit ledger. Then for the moment a safer concealment was effected by charging the whole to Dresser's account. Coleman adopted this method when a bank examiner was expected. Of course when the fraud was disguised by overcharging a depositor it could not be discovered except by calling in the passbooks, or taking all the deposit slips and comparing them with the depositors's ledger in detail. By November, 1907, the amount taken by Coleman was $30,100, and the charge on Dresser's account was $20,000. In 1908 the sum was raised from $33,000 to $49,671. In 1909 Coleman's activity began to increase. In January he took $6,829.26; in March, $10, 833.73; in June, his previous stealings amounting to $83,390.94, he took $ 5,152.06; in July, $18,050; in August, $6,250; in September, $17,350; in October, $47,277.08; in November, $51,847; in December, $46,956.44; in January, 1910, $27,395.53; in February, $6,473.97; making a total of $310, 143.02, when the bank closed on February 21, 1910. As a result of this the amount of the monthly deposits seemed to decline noticeably and the directors considered the matter in September, but concluded that the falling off was due in part to the springing up of rivals, whose deposits were increasing, but was parallel to a similar decrease in New York. An examination by a bank examiner in December, 1909, disclosed nothing wrong to him.\n In this connection it should be mentioned that in the previous semi- annual examinations by national bank examiners nothing was discovered pointing to malfeasance. The cashier was honest and everybody believed that they could rely upon him, although in fact he relied too much upon Coleman, who also was unsuspected by all. If Earl had opened the envelopes from the clearing house, and had seen the checks, or had examined the deposit \n\n[251 U.S. 524, 529]\n\u00a0\n ledger with any care he would have found out what was going on. The scrutiny of anyone accustomed to such details would have discovered the false additions and other indicia of fraud that were on the face of the book. But it may be doubted whether anything less than a continuous pursuit of the figures through pages would have done so except by a lucky chance.\n The question of the liability of the directors in this case is the question whether they neglected their duty by accepting the cashier's statement of liabilities and failing to inspect the depositors' ledger. The statements of assets always were correct. A bylaw that had been allowed to become obsolete or nearly so is invoked as establishing their own standard of conduct. By that a committee was to be appointed every six months 'to examine into the affairs of the bank, to count its cash, and compare its assets and liabilities with the balances on the general ledger, for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the books re correctly kept, and the condition of the bank in a sound and solvent condition.' Of course liabilities as well as assets must be known to know the condition and, as this case shows, peculations may be concealed as well by a false understatement of liabilities as by a false show of assets. But the former is not the direction in which fraud would have been looked for, especially on the part of one who at the time of his principal abstractions was not in contact with the funds. A debtor hardly expects to have his liability understated. Some animals must have given at least one exhibition of dangerous propensities before the owner can be held. This fraud was a novelty in the way of swindling a bank so far as the knowledge of any experience had reached Cambridge before 1910. We are not prepared to reverse the finding of the master and the Circuit Court of Appeals that the directors should not be held answerable for taking the cashier's statement of liabilities to be as correct as the \n\n[251 U.S. 524, 530]\n\u00a0\n statement of assets always was. If he had not been negligent without their knowledge it would have been. Their confidence seemed warranted by the semiannual examinations by the Government examiner and they were encouraged in their belief that all was well by the president, whose responsibility, as executive officer; interest, as large stockholder and depositor; and knowledge, from long daily presence in the bank, were greater than theirs. They were not bound by virtue of the office gratuitously assumed by them to call in the pass books and compare them with the ledger, and until the event showed the possibility they hardly could have seen that their failure to look at the ledger opened a way to fraud. See Briggs v. Spaulding, \n141 U.S. 132\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 924; Warner v. Penoyer, 91 Fed. 587, 33 C. C. A. 222, 44 L. R. A. 761. We are not laying down general principles, however, but confine our decision to the circumstances of the particular case.\n The position of the president is different. Practically he was the master of the situation. He was daily at the bank for hours, he had the deposit ledger in his hands at times and might have had it at any time. He had had hints and warnings in addition to those that we have mentioned, warnings that should not be magnified unduly, but still that taken with the auditor's report of 1903, the unexplained shortages, the suggestion of the teller, Cutting, in 1905, and the final seeming rapid decline in deposits, would have induced scrutiny but for an invincible repose upon the status quo. In 1908 one Fillmore learned that a package containing $ 150 left with the bank for safe keeping was not to be found, told Dresser of the loss, wrote to him that he could not conclude that the package had been destroyed or removed by someone connected with the bank, and in later conversation said that it was evident that there was a thief in the bank. He added that he would advise the president to look after Coleman, that he believed he was living at a pretty fast pace, and that he \n\n[251 U.S. 524, 531]\n\u00a0\n had pretty good authority for thinking that he was supporting a woman. In the same year or the year before, Coleman, whose pay was never more than twelve dollars a week, set up an automobile, as was known to Dresser and commented on unfavorably, to him. There was also some evidence of notice to Dresser that Coleman was dealing in copper stocks. In 1909 came the great and inadequately explained seeming shrinkage in the deposits. No doubt plausible explanations of his conduct came from Coleman and the notice as to speculations may have been slight, but taking the whole story of the relations of the parties, we are not ready to say that the two courts below erred in finding that Dresser had been put upon his guard. However little the warnings may have pointed to the specific facts, had they been accepted they would have led to an examination of the depositors' ledger, a discovery of past and a prevention of future thefts.\n We do not perceive any ground for applyi g to this case the limitations of liability ex contractu adverted to in Globe Refining Co. v. Landa Cotton Oil Co., \n190 U.S. 540\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 754. In accepting the presidency Dresser must be taken to have contemplated responsibility for losses to the bank, whatever they were, if chargeable to his fault. Those that happened were chargeable to his fault, after he had warnings that should have led to steps that would have made fraud impossible, even though the precise form that the fraud would take hardly could have been foreseen. We accept with hesitation the date of December 1, 1908, as the beginning of Dresser's liability, but think it reasonable that interest should be charged against his estate upon the sum found by the Circuit Court of Appeals to be due. It is a question of discretion, not of right, Lincoln v. Claflin, 7 Wall. 132; Drumm-Flato Commission Co. v. Edmission, \n208 \nU.S. 534, 539\n, 28 S. Sup.

U S(1920)\nNo. 260\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles J. Williamson and Frank S. Appleman, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General, Mr. Frank Davis, Jr., Asst. Atty. Gen., and Messrs. Daniel L. Morris, and Edward G. Curtis, Sp. Asst. Attys. Gen., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover damages for the infringement of 5 of the 41 claims of letters patent No. 1,057,397, applied for March 23, 1907, and granted on March 25, 1913\n\n\n The specification describes the claimed invention as an improvement in photographing and developing apparatus, and as designed primarily for reproducing writings, drawings, pictures or the like, 'novel means being also provided to convey the sensitized film through a series of receptacles containing suitable developing and fixing fluids or though suitable baths, according to requirements.' \n\n[253 U.S. 447, 448]\n\u00a0\n The patent is for a machine made up of a combination of elements all of which were old, to produce a result which was old but by a method of co- ordination and operation which it is claimed is new and useful. The invention is declared in the specification to consist in 'the details of construction and in the arrangement and combination of the parts,' as 'set forth and claimed' by the inventor.\n Figure 1 of the drawings, forming a part of the specification, will aid in explaining the construction and function of the invention as claimed and in determining the character and extent of the disclosures of the patent.\n The described mode of operation is substantially as follows:\n W is a roll of sensitized paper or film placed immediately below the exposure chamber F of a camera, with its sensitized surface uppermost to receive the desired image, reflected from the mirror H. This film is fed into the chamber between the rolls b, and thence along the floor to the rollers D where it emerges from the camera and is seized by 'clips' or clamps N. These clamps are supported and carried by a rack M, and may be moved to and fro (reciprocated) by turning the pinions L on the shaft K, by means of a crank.\n I, J and J' are shallow pans or 'tanks' in which suitable 'developing,' 'fixing,' and 'washing' solutions or fluids are placed and the whole of the construction to the right of the camera, as we face the print, is inclosed in a light-proof case E, referred to in the patent sometimes as a 'compartment' and sometimes as a 'chamber.' The rack M, and the clamps which hold and support the film, move above the tanks and necessarily above the level of the liquid within them. By turning the pinion L, the rack M is moved outwardly away from the camera, and the clamps draw the film after them until the required length is attained, when it is severed from the roll by a manually operated cutter, O. When the film is thus cut to the \n\n[253 U.S. 447, 449]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n desired length, obviously only the free end will fall to the surface of the solution in the tank I, and by continuing the outward movement of the rack M, the specification declares, 'the film is carried through the several tanks.' The 'clips' or clamps are set and released automatically and at the limit of the outward movement the film is released and falls into the tank J'. By reversing the turning of the pinions L the rack and clamps are returned inwardly to the camera, so that the oe ration, just detailed, may be repeated.\n The Court of Claims carries into its findings of fact fourteen patents as illustrative of the prior art, and with this exhibit before us we fully agree with that court that the claim of invention of appellant must be restricted to the disclosed construction and operation of the mechanism for carrying the exposed section of film 'through the developing and other solutions or liquids' after it leaves the camera.\n In the description of the operation of the machine as we have just given it, there is no provision other than gravity for causing the free end of the film, when it is cut from the roll, to sink into the developing fluid, and the other end of it is held between the clamps, above the surface of the fluid, as it is drawn along from one tank to another. The Court of Claims found that under such conditions of operation all of the film would not be submerged with sufficient rapidity and uniformity to secure a proper and useful development of the image and this conclusion is not seriously disputed. But the appellant contends that the required submergence may be obtained by oscillating the rack and clamps (and thereby the film) back and forth within the range of a few inches when the film is over the first tank I, with the result that the free end of the film, first sinking into the fluid, is turned under and over and the exposed side of it wholly submerged and thereby developed. \n\n[253 U.S. 447, 451]\n\u00a0\n In reply to this it is contended by the Government that the disclosures of the patent do not contain any suggestion of a short, reciprocating movement of the rack, such as is thus relied upon, and that the drawings provide for a construction of the machine which would be inoperative if such movement were resorted to.\n Upon this subject the finding of the Court of Claims is, that the machine can be rendered operative only 'by resorting to a new oscillating mode of operation evolved by the claimant for submerging and developing the film,' and that such mode of operation is not disclosed in the patent. On the contrary, it is especially found that:\n'By the method contemplated and disclosed in the patent, the film with the exposed side up, held at one end by the clamps attached to the rack M and moving in a plane above the pans containing the developing and fixing fluids, is intended, by the outward movement of the rack, to be drawn successively through the developing and fixing fluids, the rack moving in one direction only through its entire course, the end of the film next the knife and away from the clamps falling, when severed by the knife, on the surface of the developer in the first pan and submerging by gravity.'\n\n Treating this finding by the court as an interpretation of the patent and therefore as a conclusion of law and subject to review, we are brought to the question whether the short, reciprocating movement of the rack, confessedly necessary to successful operation of the machine, is disclosed in the patent, as it must be to render it valid. R. S.  4888 (Comp. St.  9432).\n The only description of the mode of operation of appellant's machine, and the statute requires that this must be the best mode known to the patentee (R. S.  4888), is found in the specification and is as follows:\n'In order to draw the film through the several compartments, I provide a mechanism consisting of a shaft K, \n\n[253 U.S. 447, 452]\n\u00a0\n having toothed wheels L, which mesh with a rack M, the said rack being suitably guided in the compartment E, and being alternately reciprocated through the rotation of the shaft K, in opposite directions. When the shaft is turned to the right, the said rack will be projected from the compartment until the inner end thereof is nearly above the shaft K. When the shaft is rotated in the opposite direction, the said rack will, of course, be retracted and thrust into the compartment. It is the purpose of this invention that the said rack shall carry clips N, which are designed to clamp on th edges of the film Y and as the said rack is moved outwardly, the film is carried through the several tanks as indicated. The clips are automatically released and set through the contact with trips within the casing in the path of travel of said clips.'\n\n We agree with the Court of Claims that this language describes a movement of the rack M, carrying the clamps N, in one direction only- outwardly and progressively away from the camera-until the movement is completed and the film is released, and that the reciprocating movement referred to in the patent is the return of the mechanism for clamping and carrying the film to its initial position for the purpose of repeating the operation.\n There is nothing in the disclosure or in the claims to suggest the arresting of the outward movement of the clamps as soon as the film is severed from the roll and the initiating thereupon of a short oscillating movement of the mechanism to and fro, until the film shall have been immersed in the developing liquid sufficiently to bring out the image photographed. It is very clear that no such operation can be derived from the disclosure in the patent, and we agree with the further finding of the Court of Claims that in order to permit 'this new oscillating mode of operation evolved by the claimant' material changes would be required in the construction of the machine, from that disclosed in the description and drawings. \n\n[253 U.S. 447, 453]\n\u00a0\n The statutes, which are the source of all patent rights, provide that a valid patent may be granted for a new and useful machine, or for a new and useful improvement thereof (R. S.  4886 [Comp. St.  9430]), but they require that every applicant for a patent shall file a written description of the manner and process of making and using his invention 'in such full, clear, concise and exact' terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it relates to make and construct it, and in case of a machine the description must disclose the best mode in which the inventor has contemplated the application of his discovery. R. S.  4888.\n Ever since Grant et al. v. Raymond, 6 Pet. 218, 247, it has been consistently held that a correct and adequate description or disclosure of a claimed discovery (which, in the case of a machine, involves particularly the operation of it) is essential to the validity of a patent, for the reason that such a disclosure is necessary in order to give the public the benefit of the invention after the patent shall expire. The source of the power to grant patents, and the consideration for granting them, is the advantage which the public will derive from them, especially after the expiration of the patent monopoly, when the discoveries embodied in them shall become a part of the public stock of knowledge.\n The application of these requirements of the law to our conclusion that the only form of construction of the machine and the only method of operation of it which are disclosed in the patent would not produce a sufficiently uniform and rapid development of the film to render it useful, must result in the approval of the judgment of the Court of Claims, that the patent is invalid and void, for the reason that it fails to disclose a practical and useful invention.\n This result renders it unnecessary to consider the further conclusion of the court below that the use by the \n\n[253 U.S. 447, 454]\n\u00a0\n United States of photo-copying machines of a type known as 'Photostat,' manufactured and sold under warrant of letters patent issued to D. S. Green No. 1,001,019, would not have constituted an infringement of appellant's patent had it proved to be valid. However, for its bearing on future possible controversy we add that the construction and relation of the two appliances, designed to produce the same result or product, have been fully considered and that we agree with the conclusion of the Court of Claims.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","7":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERLIN MILLS CO. v.

Burchenal for a food product, issued on April 13, 1915, No. 1,135,351, to the Procter & Gamble Company, assignee. The District Court held the patent void for lack of invention, and also that the claims in suit were not infringed. The Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, held the patent valid and infringed. 256 Fed. 23, 167 C. C. A. 295.\n The patent in controversy relates to a lardlike food product, consisting of a vegetable oil partially hydrogenized to a homogeneous, whitish, yellowish product. The record discloses that the making of lard substitutes has been accomplished by mixing melted fat with vegetable oils.\n These oils contain glycerids-olein, linolin, and stearin. The hydrogenation, or hardening process, has the effect to increase the proportion of the solid glycerids of high saturation. Stearin is called a saturated glycerid, for the reason 'that there are present in the molecule as many hydrogen atoms as possibly can be joined to the carbon atoms.' Linolin and olein are called unsaturated glycerids, and can be converted by the addition of hydrogen into hardened glycerids.\n The patentee in the specifications of his patent states the object of his alleged invention, and what he intended to accomplish, as follows:\n'The special object of the invention is to provide a new food product for a shortening in cooking, in which the liability to become rancid is minimized, and in which the components of such vegetable oils which are inferior and detrimental to use as such a food product have been to a large extent converted into a higher and more wholesome form. All such vegetable oils contain glycerids of unsaturated fatty acids, and among these notable quantities of fatty glycerids of lower saturation than olein. It is the presence of these glycerids of lower saturation that seriously affects the rancidity of the material. Oxidation is \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 158]\n\u00a0\n largely the cause of rancidity, which oxidation weakens the fat at the point of absorption at the double bonds, and these glycerids of lesser saturation readily absorb oxygen from the air at ordinary temperatures, while the more highly saturated glycerids, as olein, only absorb oxygen at elevated temperatures. It is evident, therefore, that oils or fats containing notable quantities of glycerids of linolic acid, or of lesser saturation, are distinctly inferior as an edible product to those containing a minimum of these glycerids with a larger per cent. of olein. On the other hand, while it is important to get rid of the readily oxidizable glycerids of lower saturation, it is also important not to supply too large a per cent. of fully saturated glycerids. ... Oil, liquid at the ordinary temperatures, does not make the best shortening, because the oil remains liquid, keeping the food in a soggy condition, and the oil will even settle to the under part of the cooked product and soil the cloth, paper, or whatever it may come in contact with. Moreover, fats of a melting point above the temperature of the human body, 98\u00f8F., are not so digestible as fats which are liquid at this point, or which have a melting point below 98\u00f8F. It is therefore my object in the preparation of my new lardlike composition and food-product, and in preparing same from cottonseed oil, to change the chemical composition of the oil to obtain a product with a high percentage of olein, a low percentage of linolin and the lesser saturated fats, and with only sufficient stearin to make the product congeal at ordinary temperatures.\n\n'In manufacturing this product, cottonseed or other vegetable oil is caused to chemically absorb a limited amount of hydrogen by reacting on the oil with hydrogen in the presence of a catalytic agent and at an elevated temperature. The oil is preferably agitated in a closed vessel in the presence of an atmosphere of compressed hydrogen, a catalyzer of finely divided nickel carried by \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 159]\n\u00a0\n kieselguhr being maintained in suspension in the oil and its temperature being raised to about 155\u00f8 C.\n\n'According to the present invention, the amount of hydrogen absorbed is carefully regulated and limited. In practice, the operation is stopped when the oil has been converted into a product which cools to a white or yellowish semisolid more closely resembling lard than do the commercial mixtures of cottonseed oil and animal oleostearin, while in many respects the product is superior to the best leaf lard as a shortening. It is not so liable to become rancid, and the product can be heated to a considerably higher temperature than lard without smoking or burning. ... The high temperature to which my product can be raised without smoking or burning makes the product ideal for frying, inasmuch as a crust forms almost instantly on the food fried, which prevents any absorption of the shortening. A lardlike product thus prepared from cottonseed oil has a saponification value of about 195, and an iodin value ranging from about 55 to about 80. The product having an iodin value of 55 has a titer of about 42\u00f8 and a melting point of about 40\u00f8C.; that having an iodin value of 55 of 80 has a titer of about 35\u00f8 and a melting point of about 33\u00f8C. While but partially hydrogenized, containing from about 1.5 per cent. to 2.5 per cent. of additional hydrogen more than in the nonhydrogenized material, it shows no free cottonseed oil when subjected to the Halphen test, thereby differing from all commercial lard substitutes containing this oil. It contains from 20 to 25 per cent. of fully saturated glycerids, from 5 to 10 per cent. linolin, and from 65 to 75 per cent. olein, and an average of a number of samples gives 23 per cent. of saturated fats, 7.5 per cent. linolin, and 69.5 per cent. olein, while the cottonseed oil before treatment contained 17 per cent. saturated fats, 37 per cent. linolin, and 46 per cent. olein. It will thus be seen \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 160]\n\u00a0\n that I have produced an ideal food product, which is high in olein, low in linolin and lesser saturated fats, and with only enough stearin to make the product congeal at ordinary temperatures.'\n\n The patent has seven claims-two broad claims, which are the ones here involved:\n\n 1. \n'A homogeneous lardlike food product, consisting of an incompletely hydrogenized vegetable oil.'\n\n 2. \n'A homogeneous lardlike food product, consisting of incompletely hydrogenized cottonseed oil.'\n The five additional claims, more specific and limited, are not involved in this suit. Two of the four judges who considered this patent and the validity of the claims in suit reached the conclusion that they were void for want of invention; two judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals held the patent valid, and infringed.\n In deciding between these conflicting views, we must consider the genesis of the alleged invention, and what was theretofore known and disclosed in the art. Burchenal, the patentee, was not a chemist, and was the general manager of the Procter & Gamble Company, whose principal business had been the manufacture of soap. One Edwin C. Kayser, who had been in the employ of Crossfield & Son, an English firm, and familiar with the Normann process, to be hereinafter considered, came to this country in 1907, and saw Mr. Burchenal at the Procter & Gamble factory. A contract was made with Kayser, and an experimental plant was erected at the Procter & Gamble works for hydrogenating oil.\n It is the contention of the respondent that the merit of Burchenal's alleged invention arises from the fact that he was the first to originate and develop the process involved, so as to make a food product of the character described.\n The District Court found that Burchenal in fact invented nothing, and that all that was real invention, as established by the testimony, came from Kayser. But \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 161]\n\u00a0\n considering, for the purposes of this discussion, that the thought occurred to Burchenal, which he developed in the production of a food product, the subject-matter of this patent, the primary question is presented whether what Burchenal accomplished amounted to invention within the meaning and protection of the patent law.\n In considering the patentability of this alleged invention, it is to be remembered that this is not claimed to be a process patent. While the process is described in the specifications, Burchenal makes no claim that it is his invention, indeed, he concedes in the testimony that the process is not his, and counsel frankly say that the patent must stand or fall upon its validity as a product patent of a new and useful thing within the meaning of the patent law. If this product were the result of mechanical improvement only, when viewed in the light of that which was previously disclosed and open to public use, the step in advance being only that which one skilled in the art might well make, without the exercise of the originating or inventing faculty, then the achievement is not within the protection of the patent law.\n The English patent to Normann of October, 1903, disclosed to the world the process of converting unsaturated fatty acids, or their glycerids, into saturated compounds. After referring to other discoveries he says:\n'By causing acetylene, ethylene, or benzene vapour in mixture with hydrogen gas to pass over one of the said metals, the said investigators obtained from the unsaturated hydrocarbons saturated hydrocarbons, partly with simultaneous condensation.\n\n'I have found that it is easy to convert by this catalytic method unsaturated fatty acids into saturated acids. This may be effected by causing vapours of fatty acid together with hydrogen to pass over the catalytic metal, which is preferably distributed over a suitable support, such as pumice stone. It is sufficient, however, to expose \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 162]\n\u00a0\n the fat or the fatty acid in a liquid condition to the action of hydrogen and the catalytic substance.\n\n'For instance, if fine nickel powder, obtained by reduction in a current of hydrogen, is added to chemically pure oleic acid, then the latter heated over an oil bath, and a strong current of hydrogen is caused to pass through it for a sufficient length of time, the oleic acid may be completely converted into stearic acid.\n\n'The quantity of the nickel thus added and the temperature are immaterial and will only affect the duration of the process. Apart from the formation of small quantities of nickel soap, which may be easily decomposed by dilute mineral acids, the reaction passes off without any secondary reaction taking place. The same nickel may be used repeatedly. Instead of pure oleic acid, commercial fatty acids may be treated in the same manner. The yellowish fatty acids of tallow, which melt between 44 and 48\u00f8C. and whose iodine number is 35. 1, will, after hydrogenation, melt between 56.5 and 59\u00f8C., while their iodine number will be 9.8, and their colour slightly lighter than before, and they will be very hard.\n\n'The same method is applicable not only to free fatty acids, but also to their glycerids occurring in nature; that is to say, to fats and oils. Olive oil will yield a hard tallowlike mass; linseed oil and fish oil will give similar results.\n\n'By the new method, all kinds of unsaturated fatty acids and their glycerids may be easily hydrogenized.'\n\n An expert witness, called by petitioner, gives in his testimony certain views of this process which commend themselves to our judgment as entirely reasonable and accurate, and so well stated that we quote them in part:\n'Dr. Normann discovered, and sets forth in the patent, that unsaturated acids or unsaturated oils by the action of hydrogen in the presence of finely divided nickel may be converted into corresponding saturated compounds. He \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 163]\n\u00a0\n defines the reaction rather carefully in some regards. He says, for instance, if fine nickel powder obtained by reduction in a current of hydrogen is added to chemically pure oleic acid, then the latter heated over an oil bath, and a strong current of hydrogen is caused to pass through it for a sufficient length of time, the oleic acid may be completely converted into stearic acid.'\n\n Further on he says:\n\"Apart from the formation of small quantities of nickel soap, which may be easily decomposed by dilute mineral acids, the reaction passes off without any secondary reaction taking place.'\n\n'I think that those two sentences which I have read very well define the product which is obtained by such reduction, especially the second sentence, where he says that the reaction goes on in a quantitative way, we will say; that is, he says that there is no side reaction takes place. A chemist would know from this first paragraph, where he says that oleic acid goes to stearic acid, and from the second one, where he says that no side reaction takes, place, the chemist would know exactly what the product is which is formed by this reaction. ...\n\n'I would call attention particularly to the fact that he hardened olive oil to a hard, tallowlike mass. Tallow is a substance that is obtained from the fat of either cattle or of sheep, and is a substance of somewhat semisolid character; that is, its lower limit of melting point is within a lard range, and its upper limit is just slightly beyond the lard range, so that, if Normann hardened olive oil to a tallowlike mass, that means that he hardened it to a product of a semisolid character.\n\n'Q. 63. Does Normann specify anywhere in his patent any of the purposes for which his patents are intended?\n\n'A. He does not. He says nothing in the patent as to what these products should be used for. The presumption is that they might be used for any purpose for which fats of that general character could be utilized. They might be \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 164]\n\u00a0\n used for making candles; they might be used for soaps; they might be used for edible purposes.\n\n'By the passages I have read he has very carefully specified what the product is, so that any chemist would know for what particular purposes it might be useful.\n\n'Q. 64. In the process of hydrogenation as described in the Normann patent from which you made citations-that is, the British patent, No. 1,515 of 1903-what would your conclusion be as to the edibility of the resultant product when the material hydrogenated was among those suggested by him, olive oil?\n\n'A. If an edible olive oil was started with, one would certainly obtain an edible hydrogenated product.'\n\n It is in evidence that this method, shown by Normann, is a practicable one, and may be used for the making of edible food products of the kind here involved.\n With the knowledge disclosed in the Normann patent conclusively presumed to be known by the patentee, was it invention to apply the known process to vegetable oils? In this connection the history of the application for the patent in suit in the Patent Office is interesting and instructive. It is true that claims 1 and 2 were finally allowed, and the patentee is entitled to the presumption which arises from the granting of them. But it appears in the history of the application for the Burchenal patent, found in the record, that as originally presented it contained two claims not so broad as the ones now in suit, and a third claim for 'A semisolid hydrogenized oil,' was added by amendment. All of the claims were rejected; the examiner saying:\n'The composition of lard and of cottonseed oil, as to the glycerids olein and stearin that they contain, is well known. To make a product from cottonseed oil that shall simulate lard, the content of stearin should be increased. [Referring to patents.] It is thought, therefore, that if the problem of simulating lard from cottonseed oil were \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 165]\n\u00a0\n presented to an oil chemist, an incomplete hydrogenization of the cottonseed oil would at once suggest itself to him as a solution of the problem. All the claims are accordingly rejected on the above ground of lack of invention. Claim 3 is further rejected on the product formed by the above-cited patents.'\n\n Replying to the communication of the examiner, amendment was made canceling claim 3. Further consideration was requested on claims 1 and 2, upon arguments which were presented. The claims were afterwards rejected upon reference to patents to Kayser of September 26, 1911, and November 14, 1911, the examiner stating that these patents were adapted to hydrogenize glycerids, the latter one specifically mentioning its adaptability for cottonseed oil, and that the process could be arrested at any time during its progress, and thus an incompletely hydrogenized article be produced.\n Subsequently the specifications were amended, giving more definitely the percentages of olein, linolin and stearin. The patentee concludes the amended specifications, stating:\n'It will thus be seen that I have produced an ideal food product, which is high in olein, low in linolin, and lesser saturated fats, and with only enough stearin to make the product congeal at ordinary temperatures.'\n\n Additional and more limited claims were added, but ultimately the patent, containing the broad claims here involved, was granted.\n It is true, as the Circuit Court of Appeals states in its opinion, that the applicant never did acquiesce in the examiner's action rejecting his claims, and finally obtained what he had in the first place asked for.\n This record establishes that it was known before Burchenal took up the subject that a vegetable oil could be changed into a semisolid, homogeneous substance by a process of hydrogenation arrested before completion, and that it might be edible. This much of the art was public \n\n[254 U.S. 156, 166]\n\u00a0\n property and open to general use. The product of this process was known and open to public use. To supply such products as the patentee has described in the broad claims in suit may have been new and useful, but does not in our opinion rise to the dignity of invention, and is an advance step which would occur to one skilled in the art, when investigating and considering the subject. It follows that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court, with directions to dismiss the bill, on the ground that claims 1 and 2 are void for the reasons stated in this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBIRGE-FORBES CO. v. HEYE(1920)\nNo. 76\nArgued: Decided: January 12, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 317, 318]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry O. Head, of Sherman, Tex., for petitioner.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 317, 322]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Robert M. Rowland, of Ft. Worth, Tex., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by Heye, a cotton broker in Bremen, against the petitioner, a cotton exporter in Texas, to recover sums that Heye had to pay on its account. The payments were made upon cotton sold by Heye as the petitioner's agent, to different buyers, for alleged failure of the cotton to correspond to the description upon which the price was based. In pursuance of the contracts and the rules of the Bremen Cotton Exchange the claims of the buyers were submitted to arbitration, which resulted in awards against the plaintiff for a total of 312,749.30 German marks, alleged to be equal to about $74,820.52. Before the present suit was brought another one had been carried to judgment in the same District, in which that amount was claimed. At that time Heye had paid only $36,610.96 of the awards. The judge directed a verdict for the sum that the plaintiff had paid and another item not now in issue. Heye now has paid the whole and brings this suit to recover the amount of the later payment not embraced in the former judgment. He prevailed in the District Court, and the judgment was affirmed with a modification as to payment by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 248 Fed. 636, 160 C. C. A. 536. The main question on the merits is whether the former judgment was conclusive as to the validity of the awards, but that upon which the certiorari was granted was a preliminary one, as is shown by the fact that certiorari was denied in the former suit. \n234 U.S. 759\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 676. After the case had been \n\n[251 U.S. 317, 323]\n\u00a0\n taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals a motion was made to dismiss or suspend the suit on the ground that Heye had become an alien enemy by reason of the declaration of war between Germany and the United States. The Circuit Court of Appeals, however, affirmed the judgment with the modification that it should be paid to the clerk of the trial court and by him turned over to the Alien Property Custodian, with further details not material here.\n Upon the last-mentioned question, although it seemed proper that it should be set at rest, we can feel no doubt. The plaintiff had got his judgment before war was declared, and the defendant, the petitioner, had delayed the collection of it by taking the case up. Such a case was disposed of without discussion by Chief Justice Marshall speaking for the Court in Owens v. Hanney, 9 Cranch, 180; Kershaw v. Kelsey, 100 Mass. 561, 564, 97 Am. Dec. 124, 1 Am. Rep. 142. There is nothing 'mysteriously noxious' (Coolidge v. Inglee, 13 Mass. 26, 37) in a judgment for an alien enemy. Objection to it in these days goes only so far as it would give aid and comfort to the other side. Hanger v. Abbott, 6 Wall. 532, 536; McConnell v. Hector, 3 B. & P. 113, 114. Such aid and comfort were prevented by the provision that the sum recovered should be paid over to the Alien Property Custodian, and the judgment in this respect was correct. When the alien enemy is defendant justice to him may require the suspension of the case. Watts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca di Navigazione, \n248 \nU.S. 9, 22\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 1, 3 A. L. R. 323.\n On the merits the first question is whether the former judgment was conclusive as to the validity of the awards, assuming them to have been identified as the same that were sued upon in the former case. Taking merely the former declaration and judgment it could not be said with certainty that some of the awards might not have been held invalid and that the defendant had not satisfied the \n\n[251 U.S. 317, 324]\n\u00a0\n whole obligation found to exist. But we have before us the fact that the Court directed a verdict and the charge. From the latter, as also from the answer, apart from a general denial, it appears that the awards were dealt with as a whole and that the objections to them were general. The objections were overruled, and the Court assumed that the awards were obligatory, but cut down the amount to be recovered to the sum that had been paid. The case went to the Circuit Court of Appeals and the same things appear in the report of the case there. Heye v. Birge-Forbes Co., 212 Fed. 112, 128 C. C. A. 628. (Certiorari denied. \n234 U.S. 759\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 676.) In the present case both parties moved the Court to direct a verdict. Beuttell v. Magone, \n157 \nU.S. 154, 157\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 566; Empire State Cattle Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n210 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 607, 15 Ann. Cas. 70. Taking that and the fact that the same judge seems to have presided in both suits into account we should be slow to disturb his decision that the issue was determined in the former one if we felt more doubt than we do. But we are satisfied the decision of the two Courts below was right.\n We shall deal summarily with two or three highly technical arguments urged against the affirmation of the judgment. One is that the depositions of Heye and a witness were not returned as required by the Texas statute providing for taking them, with a suggestion that, as Heye was a party, his deposition could not be taken at all. As to the latter point it is to be noticed that it did not present an attempt to fish for information from the opposite party and that an agreement was made that 'time notice and copy are hereby waived,' and that 'the officer may proceed to take and return the depositions of the witness on the original direct and cross interrogatories, but commission is not waived.' Whatever may be the general rule (as to which see Blood v. Morrin [C. C.] 140 Fed. 918), we think that this objection is not fairly open. As to the mode of return not having followed strictly the Texas \n\n[251 U.S. 317, 325]\n\u00a0\n statute, because the officer to whom the commission was directed did not put the depositions into the mail and certify on the envelopes that he had done so, a sufficient answer is that that course was impossible owing to the war, and that the officer did transmit the depositions in the only practicable way. He gave them to an American consul and had them transmitted to the Department of State and then through the mail to the clerk. The integrity of the depositions is not questioned, the statute was complied with in substance, and justice is not to be defeated now by a matter of the barest form.\n We see no error in the finding that section 477 of the German Civil Code did not bar the claim. Assuming the question to be open the Court was warranted in finding that a six months' limitation to claims for defect of quality did not apply where the claims had been submitted to arbitration and passed upon. The same is true with regard to the taking the value of the German mark at par in the absence of evidence that it had depreciated at the time of the plaintiff's payments. On the whole case our conclusion is that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBLUMENSTOCK BROS. v. CURTIS PUB. CO.(1920)\nNo. 197\nArgued: Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n Mr. Colin C. H. Fyffe, of Chicago, Ill., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Amos C. Miller, of Williamsport, Pa., for defendant in error. \n\n[252 U.S. 436, 437]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the Blumenstock Bros. Advertising Agency against the Curtis Publishing Company in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois to recover treble damages under section 7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (26 Stat. 209 [Comp. St.  8829]). The case here concerns the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court. Judicial Code,  238. The plaintiff is a corporation of the state of Missouri; the defendant a corporation of the state of Pennsylvania. The defendant appeared specially in the District Court and moved to dismiss the complaint for want of jurisdiction; the grounds stated being:\n\n\n (1)\n 'That in each of the counts of plaintiff's original declaration, and in the additional count thereof, it appears that the plaintiff is a citizen and resident of the state of Missouri, and that this defendant is a citizen and resident of the state of Pennsylvania.'\n\n\n (2)\n 'That in none of said counts is a cause of action stated by plaintiff within the provisions of the act of Congress approved July 2, 1890, entitled 'An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies.\"\n The court entered judgment dismissing the suit for want of jurisdiction over the defendant or the action.\n The record contains a certificate stating that the court found that it had no jurisdiction of the defendant and no jurisdiction to entertain the action. The certificate further states that the question involved is whether the transaction set forth in the several counts of the declaration involves a question of interstate commerce, and whether the averments in said several counts of the declaration state a cause of action within the provisions of the Act of July 2, 1890 (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830).\n The declaration is voluminous, containing five counts \n\n[252 U.S. 436, 438]\n\u00a0\n and an additional count. So far as it is necessary for our purpose, the cause of action of the plaintiff may be said to rest upon the allegations: That the plaintiff is engaged at Chicago in conducting an advertising agency. That when customers or principals desire to place advertisements in the magazines and periodicals of the trade they make plaintiff their agent, and plaintiff contracts with the defendant and other publishers and distributors of magazines; that plaintiff had many customers with whom it placed advertisements in the periodicals published and distributed by the defendant and in other periodicals of other publishers, all of which were distributed throughout the United States and the several states thereof; that the defendant was the owner and publisher of three periodicals sold and distributed throughout the United States, known as the Saturday Evening Post, the Ladies Home Journal, and the Country Gentleman; that the business of the defendant in publishing, selling, and distributing said periodicals was interstate commerce. The character of each of the several publications is described, and a large circulation is attributed to each of them; and it is stated that in publishing and distributing said periodicals defendant held itself out as desirous of taking, receiving, printing, publishing, and distributing throughout the United States its publications and advertisements to persons, firms, and corporations concerning their business and occupation; that in the course of the business the defendant dealt with the plaintiff and other advertising agencies; that the defendant in the regular course of its business dealt with not only advertisers, but with advertising agencies such as the plaintiff, and it is alleged that such dealings were transaci ons of interstate commerce, and that the business of editing, publishing and distributing throughout the United States the advertising matter contained in said publications, pursuant to contracts made with its customers and advertising \n\n[252 U.S. 436, 439]\n\u00a0\n agencies was interstate commerce; that such commerce is dependent for its operation and growth upon advertising facilities offered by magazines and periodicals such as those of the defendant, and that such publications constitute the chief method of presenting to the buying public the articles held out for sale; that the advertising facilities were necessary to dealers, merchants, and manufacturers in order to bring their products to the notice and attention of purchasers; that the defendant's periodicals, particularly 'The Saturday Evening Post,' have an important position among such publications, and are largely read throughout the United States; that 'The Saturday Evening Post' is the most necessary of such advertising mediums to the customers of the plaintiff; that the defendant's periodicals, together with certain other magazines, periodicals and publications owned by persons other than the defendant, had, to a certain extent, exclusive control of a certain field of advertising; that the magazines and other publications which control and do all the advertising business of the field in question are few in number; that for the advertising of goods and merchandise offered for sale in commerce there were no adequate facilities except those offered by the defendant and other publishers of similar magazines; that the defendant was desirous of using its preponderant position in this special field of advertising as a means of acquiring for itself and its publications, especially for 'The Saturday Evening Post,' a monopoly of the publication and distribution of advertising matter in this restricted field of advertising throughout the United States in violation of the Anti-Trust Act; that the defendant refused without any reasonable cause to accept proper and ordinary advertising matter or copy offered in the usual way to the defendant by the plaintiff and other advertising agencies unless the plaintiff, and other advertising agencies, would agree to allow the defendant to increase crease its preponderance \n\n[252 U.S. 436, 440]\n\u00a0\n in said advertising field by permitting it to control and limit and reduce, at the will of the defendant, the amount of advertising given by the plaintiff and other advertising agencies to the owners and publishers of other magazines, journals, periodicals and other publications aforesaid, which were competing with the defendant in the field of advertising mentioned and described; that by reason of the illegal and wrongful acts, done by the defendant in pursuance of its attempt and scheme to create a monopoly for its own benefit in, and to monopolize the advertising business, plaintiff lost the business of its customers for whom it had been acting as agent in placing of advertisements with defendant's and other publications, and was prevented from making further contracts for the placing of advertising matter in publications of the defendant, and in consequence thereof, in any other publication of a like or similar character, to the damage of the plaintiff in the sum of $25,000.\n The declaration contains an alleged cause of action at common law, but, as neither the plaintiff nor the defendant reside in the district in which the suit was brought, it is conceded that such cause of action could not be maintained in that court against the defendant's objection. Section 51, Judicial Code (Comp St.  1033).\n The Sherman Anti-Trust Act (section 7) created a cause of action in favor of any person to recover by suit in any District Court of the United States, in the district in which the defendant resides or is found, threefold damages for injury to his business or property by reason of anything forbidden and declared unlawful in the act. In order to maintain a suit under this act the complaint must state a substantial case arising thereunder. The action is wholly statutory, and can only be brought in a District Court of the United States, and it is essential to the jurisdiction of the court in such cases that a substantial cause of action within the statute be set up. \n\n[252 U.S. 436, 441]\n\u00a0\n In some cases it is difficult to determine whether a ruling dismissing the complaint involves the merits of the cause of action attempted to be pleaded or only a question of the jurisdiction of the court. In any case alleged to come within the federal jurisdiction it is not enough to allege that questions of a federal character arise in the case, it must plainly appear that the averments attempting to bring the case within federal jurisdiction are real and substantial. Newburyport Water Co. v. City of Newburyport, \n193 \nU.S. 562, 576\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 553.\n In cases where, as here, the controversy concerns a subject-matter limited by federal law, for which recovery can be had only in the federal courts, the jurisdiction attaches only when the suit presents a substantial claim under an act of Congress. This rule has been applied in bankruptcy cases (Grant v. Laird, \n212 U.S. 445\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 332), in copyright cases (Globe Newspaper Co. v. Walker, \n210 U.S. 356\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 726), in patent cases (Healy v. Sea Gull Specialty Co., \n237 U.S. 479\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 658), in admiralty cases (The Jefferson, \n215 U.S. 130\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 54, 17 Ann. Cas. 907).\n We come then to inquire whether the cause of action stated was a substantial one within section 7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. It is not contended that any combination, conspiracy, or contract in restraint of trade is alleged such as would bring the case within the first section of the act. The second section is relied upon which in terms punishes persons who monopolize or attempt to monopolize, or combine with others to monopolize any part of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations.\n The Anti-Trust Act, it is hardly necessary to say, derives its authority from the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states. It declares unlawful combinations, conspiracies, and contracts and attempts to monopolize which concern such trade or commerce. It follows that if the dealings with the defendant, which \n\n[252 U.S. 436, 442]\n\u00a0\n form the subject-matter of complaint, were not transactions of interstate commerce, the declaration states no case within the terms of the act.\n Commerce, as defined in the often quoted definition of Chief Justice Marshall, in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 189 (6 L. Ed. 23) is not traffic alone; it is intercourse;\n'it describes the commercial intercourse between nations and parts of nations in all its branches, and is regulated by prescribing rules for carrying on that intercourse.'\n\n In the present case, treating the allegations of the complaint as true, the subject-matter dealt with was the making of contracts for the insertion of advertising matter in certain periodicals belonging to the defendant. It may be conceded that the circulation and distribution of such publications throughout the country would amount to interstate commerce, but the circulation of these periodicals did not depend upon or have any direct relation to the advertising contracts which the plaintiff offered and the defendant refused to receive except upon the terms stated in the declaration. The advertising contracts did not involve any movement of goods or merchandise in interstate commerce, or any transmission of intelligence in such commerce.\n This case is wholly unlike International Text-book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 U.S. 91\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 481, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103, wherein there was a continuous interstate traffic in text-books and apparatus for a course of study pursued by means of correspondence, and the movements in interstate commerce were held to bring the subject- matter within the domain of federal control, and to exempt it from the burden imposed by state legislation. This case is more nearly analogous o such cases as Ficklen v. Taxing District of Shelby County, \n145 U.S. 1\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 810, wherein this court held that a broker engaged in negotiating sales between residents of Tennessee and nonresident merchants of goods situated in another state, was not engaged in interstate commerce; and within that line of \n\n[252 U.S. 436, 443]\n\u00a0\n cases in which we have held that policies of insurance are not articles of commerce, and that the making of such contracts is a mere incident of commercial intercourse. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168; Hooper v. California, \n155 U.S. 648\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 207; N. Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Deer Lodge County, \n231 U.S. 495\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 167. We held in Hopkins v. United States, \n171 U.S. 579\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 40, that the buying and selling of live stock in the stockyards of a city by members of the stock exchange was not interstate commerce, although most of the live stock was sent from other states. In Williams v. Fears, \n179 U.S. 270\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 128, we held that labor agents engaged within the state of Georgia in hiring persons to be employed outside the state were not engaged in interstate commerce. In Ware & Leland v. Mobile Co., \n209 U.S. 405\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 526, 14 Ann. Cas. 1031, we held that brokers taking orders and transmitting them to other states for the purchase and sale of grain or cotton upon speculation were not engaged in interstate commerce; that such contracts for sale or purchase did not necessarily result in any movement of commodities in interstate traffic, and the contracts were not, therefore, the subjects of interstate commerce.\n In the recent case of United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. v. Kentucky, \n231 U.S. 394\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 122, we held that a tax upon a corporation engaged in the business of inquiring into and reporting upon the credit and standing of persons in the state, was not unconstitutional as a burden upon interstate commerce as applied to a nonresident engaged in selecting and distributing a list of guaranteed attorneys in the United States, and having a representative in the state. The contention in that case, which this court denied, was that the service rendered through the representatives in Kentucky, and other representatives of the same kind acting as agents of merchants engaged in interstate commerce, to furnish them with information through the mails, or by telegraph, or telephone, as a result of which merchandise might be transported in interstate commerce, \n\n[252 U.S. 436, 444]\n\u00a0\n or withheld from such transportation, according to the character of the information reported, was so connected with interstate commerce as to preclude the state of Kentucky from imposing a privilege tax upon such business.\n Applying the principles of these cases, it is abundantly established that there is no ground for claiming that the transactions which are the basis of the present suit, concerning advertising in journals to be subsequently distributed in interstate commerce, are contracts which directly affect such commerce. Their incidental relation thereto cannot lay the groundwork for such contentions as are undertaken to be here maintained under section 7 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. The court was right in dismissing the suit.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COM'RS v.

Under the Spanish law as enforced in the Philippine Islands before the American domination the duty of free carriage as stated existed. Upon the cession of the Islands to the United States and the establishment there of a military government the existing condition of the subject was continued in force. It thus continued until the government passed into the hands of the Philippine Commission and was by that body specifically recognized and its furthe enforcement directed. Thus it prevailed without interruption until 1902 when the first act of Congress providing a general system of civil government for the Islands was passed, and it further remained operative until 1904 when Congress passed the act of that year specifically dealing with the authority of the Philippine government to provide for the coastwise trade, as follows (33 Stat. 181):\n'Until Congress shall have authorized the registry as vessels of the United States of vessels owned in the Philippine Archipelago the government of the Philippine Islands is hereby authorized to adopt, from time to time, and enforce regulations governing the transportation of merchandise and passengers between ports or places in the Philippine Archipelago.' Section 3.\n\n In fact the continued operation of the obligation to \n\n[251 U.S. 401, 403]\n\u00a0\n carry the mails free which arose from engaging in the coastwise trade, it may be taken for granted, remained in force until 1916, since the obligation was recognized as being yet in existence and the duty to enforce it for the future was directed by article 310 of the Administrative Code of that year, in which Code were also stated the existing provisions as to the registry, licensing, etc., of Philippine vessels. That the requirement continued operative thereafter results from the further fact that it was re-expressed in section 658 of the Administrative Code of 1917, which Code was adopted to meet the exigencies created by the later Organic Act of the Philippine Islands enacted by Congress in August, 1916 (39 Stat. 545 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3804a et seq.]).\n We have not stopped to refer to the Spanish law, to the military orders to the reports of civilian officials, and to the action of the Philippine Commission on the subject, as above stated, because the references to them were made below in marginal note A, which Mr. Justice Carson made a part of his dissenting opinion (-- P. I. --).\n It is undoubted that during all this period vessels were permitted to engage in the coastwise trade only upon the issuance to and the acceptance by them of licenses the enjoyment of which depended upon the performance of the legal duty of the free carriage of the mails.\n The respondents were in 1916 the owners of steam vessels of Philippine registry licensed to engage in the coastwise trade upon the condition stated, and the controversy before us arose in consequence of a notice given by them to the Philippine Director of Posts that after a date designated they would no longer comply with the duty to carry the mails free. That official sought its enforcement at the hands of the Board of Public Utility Commissioners. Before that Board the respondents, the licensees, relied upon the assertion that the section of the Administrative Code imposing the duty of free mail carriage was in conflict with the provisions of the Philippine Bill of Rights, \n\n[251 U.S. 401, 404]\n\u00a0\n guaranteeing due process and prohibiting the taking of private property for public use without just compensation. The Board overruled the defense and awarded an order directing compliance with the law and therefore prohibited the carrying out of the intention to discontinue. In reaching this conclusion the Board held that its sole duty was to ascertain whether the law imposed the obligation to carry the mails free, and, if it did, to enforce it without regard to the defense as to the repugnancy of the statute to the Bill of Rights, since that question was proper only to be disposed of by judicial action.\n The Supreme Court, to which the controversy was taken, not differing as to the existence of the statutory duty, reversed the order on the ground that such duty could not be exacted consistently with the clauses of the Bill of Rights relied upon. No opinion stating the reasons for this conclusion was expressed, but a member of the court dissented and stated his reasons in an elaborate opinion.\n It is impossible to conceive how either the guaranty by the Bill of Rights of due processo r its prohibition against the taking of private property for public use without compensation can have the slightest application to the case if the Philippine government possessed the plenary power, under the sanction of Congress, to limit the right to engage in the coastwise trade to those who agree to carry the mails free. It must follow that the existence of such power is the real question which is required to be decided. In saying this we put out of view as obviously erroneous the contention that, even though the Bill of Rights applied and limited the authority of the government so as to prevent the exaction by law of the free carriage of the mails, that result is not applicable here because by accepting a license the shipowners voluntarily assumed the obligation of free carriage. Southern Pacific Co. v. Denton, \n146 \nU.S. 202, 207\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 44; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 1\n, 27- 30, 30 Sup. Ct. 190; Pullman Co. \n\n[251 U.S. 401, 405]\n\u00a0\n v.

Ct. 261; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278\n\n\n To what extent the Bill of Rights limits the authority of the government of the Philippine Islands over the subject of the free carriage of the mails is, then, the deter minative factor. Beyond doubt Congress, in providing a Bill of Rights for those Islands, intended its provisions to have there the settled construction they have received in the United States. But it must be and is indisputable that, when the provisions of such Bill come to be applied to governmental powers in the Philippine Islands, the result of their application must depend upon the nature and character of the powers conferred by Congress upon the government of the Islands. To illustrate, where a particular activity in the Philippine Islands is, as the result of power conferred by Congress, under governmental control to such an extent that the right to engage in it can be made by the Philippine government dependent upon the performance of a particular duty, it is obvious that the exaction of such a duty, as such prerequisite condition, can be neither a denial of due process or a taking of property without compensation.\n Coming to the proposition to which the case is therefore ultimately reduced, we see no reason to doubt that the Philippine government had the power to deal with the coastwise trade so as to permit its enjoyment only by those who were willing to comply with the condition as to free mail carriage, and therefore that no violation of individual right could have resulted from giving effect to such condition. We reach this conclusion because the possession and exercise of such power in the Islands before their cession to the United States, its exertion under the military government of the United States which followed the cession, and its continuance by every form of civil \n\n[251 U.S. 401, 406]\n\u00a0\n government created by Congress for the Islands, compels to that view in the absence of any law expressly providing to the contrary or which by reasonable implication leads to that result.\n Indeed the conclusion that the power was possessed does not rest alone upon the general consideration stated, since it is additionally sustained by recalling the express provision of the act of Congress of 1904, to which we have previously referred, giving authority for the registry of Philippine vessels and recognizing the power of the government of the Philippine Islands to deal with the coastwise trade, an authority which, as it contains no provision tending to the contrary, must be construed as applicable to and sanctioning the power which had been exerted from the very inception of the American domination, to provide as to that trade for the free carriage of the mails. In other words, in view of the power to impose the u rden in question, exerted in the Philippine Islands from the beginning and which was then being exerted under the authority of Congress, the conferring by Congress upon the Philippine government by the act of 1904 of the authority to make regulations concerning such trade was a recognition of the right to make the regulation theretofore made, which was then in force, and which continued to be in force up to the time of the bringing of this suit, without disapproval or change by Congress.\n When the authority which the act of 1904 gave is borne in mind it makes it clear that the mistake which underlies the entire argument as to the nonexistence of power here relied upon arises from the erroneous assumption that the constitutional limitations of power which operate upon the authority of Congress when legislating for the United States are applicable and are controlling upon Congress when it comes to exert, in virtue of the sovereignty of the United States, legislative power over territory not forming part of the United States because not \n\n[251 U.S. 401, 407]\n\u00a0\n incorporated therein.

Ct. 712.\n The error which thus underlies the whole argument becomes more conspicuously manifest by recalling that Congress in the act of 1904 expressly provided that the authority which that act gave should exist only until Congress should otherwise provide, and, besides, that before the passage of that act, Act July 1, 1902,  86 (32 Stat. 691, 712), provided 'that all laws passed by the government of the Philippine Islands shall be reported to Congress, which hereby reserves the power and authority to annul the same.'\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOEHMER v.

St.  8657- 8665), petitioner sought damages for personal injuries sustained by him November 8, 1915, while employed by respondent as brakeman. He claimed that the railroad was negligent in using a freight car not equipped with handholds or grabirons on all four outside corners, and also in failing to instruct him that he would be required to work about cars not so equipped. The car in question had secure and adequate handholds on the diagonally opposite corners. Being of opinion that this equipment sufficed to meet the commands of the statute and that under the circumstances disclosed, failure to instruct the petitioner concerning possible use of such car did not constitute negligence, the trial court directed verdict for respondent.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the consequent judgment. 252 Fed. 553, 165 C. C. A. 3. \n\n[252 U.S. 496, 498]\n\u00a0\n Section 4 of the Safety Appliance Act of 1893 (27 Stat. 531 [Comp.

That while it did not specifically command that these should be placed at all four corners, this was the obvious intent, But the courts below concurred in rejecting that construction, and we cannot say they erred in so doing. Section 4 must be interpeted and applied in view of practical railroad operations; and having considered these the courts below ruled against petitioner's theory.\n Likewise we accept the concurrent judgment of the lower courts that the carrier was not negligent in failing to give warning concerning the use of cars with handholds only at two diagonal corners. Whether this constituted negligence depended upon an appreciation of the peculiar facts presented, and the rule is well settled that in such circumstances where two courts have agreed we will not enter upon a minute analysis of the evidence.

C., for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellants owned and utilized in their business of stock raising a large tract of land lying in Sweetwater Valley, Wyo. In June, 1909, much hay was stored upon the land and a thousand head of cattle were there confined. Under the Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 (32 Stat. 389, c. 1093,  7 [Comp. St.  4706]), the United States constructed the Pathfinder Dam. This arrested the flood waters and caused inundation of appellants' lands. The hay was destroyed, and it became necessary to remove the animals and sell them at prices below their fair value.\n Proceedings to condemn the land were instituted by the appellee, in the United States Circuit Court for Wyoming before the overflow. It is said the right to enter was not acquired until thereafter. The value of the land was ascertained and paid, but the court denied appellants' claim for the hay, and for loss consequent upon forced sale of the cattle and destruction of the business. No appeal was taken. The present suit was instituted to recover for the items so disallowed. The court below gave judgment for value of the hay only, and the cause is here upon claimants' appeal.\n Certainly appellants' position in respect of the items in question is no better than it would have been if no condemnation proceedings had been instituted. In the circumstances supposed there might have been a recovery 'for what actually has been taken, upon the principle that the government by the very act of taking impliedly has promised to make compensation because the dictates of \n\n[254 U.S. 231, 233]\n\u00a0\n justice and the terms of the Fifth Amendment so require.' United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 329\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 380, 385 (61 L. Ed. 746). But nothing could have been recovered for destruction of business of loss sustained through enforced sale of the cattle. There was no actual taking of these things by the United States, and consequently no basis for an implied promise to make compensation. We need not consider the effect of the judgment in the condemnation proceedings.\n It is suggested that although the United States did not appeal they may now contest the judgment upon the ground that there was no contractual obligation to make compensation for the hay.

Barrow, of Baton Rouge, La., for respondent. \n\n[251 U.S. 396, 397]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the Brooks-Scanlon Company, a Minnesota corporation organized to manufacture and deal in lumber and to carry on other incidental business, against the Railroad Commission of Louisiana. It seeks to set aside an order (Number 2228) of the Commission requiring the plaintiff either directly or through arrangements made with the Kentwood and Eastern Railway Company, to operate its narrow gauge railroad between Kentwood and Hackley in Louisiana upon schedules and days to be approved by the Commission. The plaintiff alleges that the order cannot be complied with except at a loss of more than $1,500 a month, and that to compel compliance would deprive the plaintiff of its property without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, with other objections not necessary to be mentioned here. The defendant denies the plaintiff's allegations and in reconvention prays for an injunction against the tearing up or abandoning of the road and for a mandate upholding the order. In the Court of first instance a preliminary injunction was issued in favor of the Commission, but was dissolved upon bond. Subsequently a judgment was entered denying a motion of the Commission to set aside the order dissolving the injunction, and after a trial on the merits judgment was entered for the plaintiff, declaring the order void. The defendant appealed from both judgments to the Supreme Court of the State. That Court reversed the decision below and reinstated the injunction granted on the defendant's prayer. \n\n[251 U.S. 396, 398]\n\u00a0\n It seems that the Banner Lumber Company, a Louisiana corporation, formerly owned timber lands, sawmills and this narrow gauge railroad. The road was primarily a logging road but it may be assumed to have done business for third persons as a common carrier. The Banner Lumber Company sold the whole property to the Brooks-Scanlon Lumber Company on November 1, 1905, the stockholders of which obtained a charter for the railroad as the Kentwood and Eastern Railway Company on December 5 of the same year. In the interim it was managed by them with separate accounts. An oral lease of the road was made to the new company and soon afterwards the Brooks- Scanlon Lumber Company transferred its property to the Brooks-Scanlon Company, the plaintiff in error. On the first of July, 1906, the Brooks- Scanlon Company made a written lease of the road to the Railway Company and sold to it all the rolling stock and personal property used in connection with the road. Thereafter the road was run as before, doing a small business as a common carrier but depending upon the carrying of logs and lumber to make it a profitable rather than a losing concern. In course of time the timber of the Brooks-Scanlon Company was cut and it terminated the lease to the Railway Company, which discontinued business on April 22, 1918, with the assent of the Railroad Commission, and sold its rolling stock. At that time the Commission being advised that it had no power did nothing more. But later, subsequent to a decision by the Supreme Court in May, it issued notice to the Brooks-Scanlon Company and the Railway to show cause why the road should not be operated, gave a hearing, and issued the order complained of here. The Supreme Court, after saying that the two corporations were one under different names stated that the only question left for determination was whether the plaintiff could be compelled by the Commission to operate \n\n[251 U.S. 396, 399]\n\u00a0\n its railroad, and concluded that although the railroad showed a loss, the test of the plaintiff's rights was the net result of the whole enterprise- the entire business of the corporation-and on that ground made its decree.\n We are of opinion that the test applied was wrong under the decisions of this Court. A carrier cannot be compelled to carry on even a branch of business at a loss, much less the whole business of carriage. On this point it is enough to refer to Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 595\n, 599 S., 600, 604, 35 Sup. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1, and Norfolk & Western Ry. Co. v. West Virginia, \n236 \nU.S. 605, 609\n, 614 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 437. It is true that if a railroad continues to exercise the power conferred upon it by a charter from a State, the State may require it to fulfill an obligation imposed by the charter even though fulfilment in that particular may cause a loss. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 262, 276\n, 278 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 330. But that special rule is far from throwing any doubt upon a general principle too well established to need further argument here. The plaintiff may be making money from its sawmill and lumber business but it no more can be compelled to spend that than it can be compelled to spend any other money to maintain a railroad for the benefit of others who do not care to pay for it. If the plaintiff be taken to have granted to the public an interest in the use of the railroad it may withdraw its grant by discontinuing the use when that use can be kept up only at a loss. Munn v. Illinois, \n94 U.S. 113\n, 126. The principle is illustrated by the many cases in which the constitutionality of a rate is shown to depend upon whether it yields to the parties concerned a fair return.\n While the decision below goes upon the ground that we have stated, it is thrown in at the end as a makeweight that the order of the Commission calls upon the plaintiff 'to submit a new schedule for transportation which may be operated at much less expense to it than \n\n[251 U.S. 396, 400]\n\u00a0\n the former schedule cost, and at a profit for plaintiff.' This is merely the language of hope. We cannot take it to be a finding of fact, for we perceive nothing in the evidence that would warrant such a finding. The assumption upon which the Court made its ruling was that the plaintiff's other business was successful enough to stand a loss on the road.\n Finally a suggestion is made in argument that the decision rested also upon another ground that cannot be reconsidered here. At the end of the opinion it is stated that the plaintiff has not petitioned the Railroad Commission for leave to discontinue this business and that until it has done so the courts are without jurisdiction of the matter. It is not impossible that this is an oversight since it seems unlikely that after the Commission has called the plaintiff before it on the question and against its strenuous objection has required it to go on, such an empty form can be required. But in any case it cannot be meant that the previous discussion which occupies the whole body of the opinion is superfluous and irrelevant to the result reached; nor can the words be taken literally, since the court proceeded to take jurisdiction and reinstated an injunction in favor of the defendant. Whatever may be the forms required by the local law it cannot give the Court or Commission power to do what the Constitution of the United States forbids, which is what the order and injunction attempt.

C., for appellant. \n\n[252 U.S. 512, 514]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On July 1, 1910, Burnap entered upon duty in the office of public buildings and grounds as landscape architect at the salary of $2400 a year, having been appointed to that position by the Secretary of War. On September 14, 1915, he was suspended, upon charges, from duty and pay, and on August 3, 1916, he was discharged 'in order to promote the efficiency of the service.' His successor was not p pointed until July 28, 1917. Burnap contends that his suspension and discharge were illegal, and hence inoperative; that he retained his position until his successor was appointed; and that until such appointment he was entitled to his full salary. United States v. Wickersham, \n201 U.S. 390\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 469. His claim for such salary was rejected by the Auditor of the War Department (of which the office of public buildings and grounds is a part), and, upon appeal, also by the Comptroller of the Treasury. Then this suit was brought in the Court of Claims. There his petition was dismissed, and the case comes here on appeal.\n Burnap rests his claim mainly upon the fact that he was appointed by the Secretary of War, contending that therefore only the Secretary of War could remove him (21 Op. Attys. Gen. 355), and that no action tantamount to a removal by the Secretary was taken until his successor was appointed. Before discussing the nature and effect of the action taken, it is necessary to consider the general rules of law governing appointment and removal in the civil service of the United States, the statutes relating to the office of public buildings and grounds, and those providing for the appointment of a landscape architect therein.\n First. The Constitution (article 2,  2, subd. 2) confers upon the \n\n[252 U.S. 512, 515]\n\u00a0\n President the power to nominate, and with the advice and consent of the Senate to appoint, certain officers named and all other officers established by law whose appointments are not otherwise therein provided for; but it authorizes Congress to vest the appointment of inferior officers either in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments (6 Op. Attys. Gen. 1). The power to remove is, in the absence of statutory provision to the contrary, an incident of the power to appoint. Ex parte Hennen, 13 Pet. 230, 259, 260; Blake v. United States, \n103 U.S. 227\n, 231; United States v. Allred, \n155 \nU.S. 591, 594\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 231; Keim v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 294 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 574; Reagan v.

And the power of suspension is an incident of the power of removal.\n Section 169 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  248) provides that:\n'Each head of a department is authorized to employ in his department such number of clerks of the several classes recognized by law, and such messengers, assistant messengers, copyists, watchmen, laborers, and other employes, and at such rates of compensation, respectively, as may be appropriated for by Congress from year to year.'\n\n The term 'head of a department' means, in this connection, the Secretary in charge of a great division of the executive branch of the government, like the State, Treasury, and War, who is a member of the Cabinet. It does not include heads of bureaus or lesser divisions. United States v. Germaine, \n99 U.S. 508\n, 510. Persons employed in a bureau or division of a department are as much employes in the department within the meaning of Section 169 of the Revised Statutes as clerks or messengers rendering service under the immediate supervision of the Secretary. Manning's Case, 13 Wall. 578, 580; United States v. Ashfield, \n91 U.S. 317\n, 319. The term 'employ' is used as the equivalent of appoint. 21 Op. Attys. Gen. 355, 356. The term 'clerks and other employes,' as there \n\n[252 U.S. 512, 516]\n\u00a0\n used, is sufficiently broad to include persons filling positions which require technical skill, learning and professional training. 29 Op. Attys. Gen. 116, 123; 21 Op. Attys. Gen. 363, 364; 20 Op. Attys. Gen. 728. The distinction between officer and employe in this connection does not rest upon differences in the qualifications necessary to fill the positions or in the character of the service to be performed. Whether the ic umbent is an officer or an employe is determined by the manner in which Congress has specifically provided for the creation of the several positions, their duties and appointment thereto. 15 Op.

A. 484.\n Second. The powers and duties of the office of public buildings and grounds had their origin in the Act of July 16, 1790, c. 28, 1 Stat. 130,  2, which authorized the President to appoint three Commissioners to lay out a district for the permanent seat of the government. By Act of May 1, 1802, c. 41, 2 Stat. 175, the offices of Commissioners were abolished and their duties devolved upon a Superintendent, to be appointed by the President. By Act of April 29, 1816, c. 150, 3 Stat. 324, the office of Superintendent was abolished and his duties devolved upon a Commissioner of Public Buildings. By Act of March 2, 1867, c. 167,  2, 14 Stat. 466, the office of Commissioner was abolished and his duties devolved upon the Chief of Engineers. By section 1797 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by Act of April 28, 1902, c. 594, 32 Stat. 152 (Comp. St.  3308), it is declared that the Chief of Engineers has 'charge of the public buildings and grounds in the District of Columbia, under such regulations \n\n[252 U.S. 512, 517]\n\u00a0\n as may be prescribed by the President through the War Department.' And section 1812 (Comp. St.  3327) requires the Chief of Engineers, as Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, to submit annual reports to the Secretary of War to accompany the annual message of the President to Congress.\n Third. There is no statute which creates an office of landscape architect in the office of public buildings and grounds nor any which defines the duties of the position. The only authority for the appointment or employment of a landscape architect in that office is the legislative, executive, and judicial appropriation Act of June 17, 1910, c. 297, 36 Stat. 504 (and later appropriation acts in the same form, 36 Stat. 1207; 37 Stat. 388, 766; 38 Stat. 482, 1024; 39 Stat. 93), which reads as follows:\n'Public Buildings and Grounds.\n\n'Office of Public Buildings and Grounds: Assistant engineer, two thousand four hundred dollars; assistant and chief clerk, two thousand four hundred dollars; clerk of class four; clerk of class three; clerk and stenographer, one thousand four hundred dollars; messenger; landscape architect, two thousand four hundred dollars; surveyor and draftsman, one thousand five hundred dollars; in all, fourteen thousand three hundred and forty dollars.'\n\n Then follow the foremen and night and day watchmen in the parks.\n Prior to July 1, 1910, similar appropriation acts had provided for a 'landscape gardener' at the same salary. There is no statute which provides specifically by whom the landscape architect in the office of public buildings and grounds shall be appointed. As the office of public buildings and grounds is a part of the bureau of the Chief of Engineers, and that bureau is in the War Department, the Secretary of War would, under section 169, have the power to appoint the landscape architect as an employe in his department, in the absence of other provision dealing with \n\n[252 U.S. 512, 518]\n\u00a0\n the subject. 21 Op. Attys. Gen. 355. But section 1799 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  3310) provides that:\n'The Chief of Engineers in charge of public buildings and grounds is authorized to employ in his office and ao ut the public buildings and grounds under his control such number of persons for such employments, and at such rates of compensation, as may be appropriated for by Congress from year to year.'\n\n This more specific provision excludes positions in the office of public buildings and grounds from the operation of the general provision of section 169 conferring the power of appointment upon the heads of departments. Compare 10 Dec. of Comptroller of Treas., 577, 583. The appointment of Burnap by the Secretary of War, instead of by the Chief of Engineers, was without authority in law.\n Fourth. As the power to remove is an incident of the power to appoint, the Chief of Engineers would clearly have had power to remove Burnap, if the appointment had been made by him instead of by the Secretary of War. The fact that Burnap was, by inadvertence, appointed by the Secretary, does not preclude the Chief of Engineers from exercising in respect to him the general power to remove employes in his office conferred, by implication, in section 1799 of the Revised Statutes. The defect in Burnap's original appointment was cured by the acquiescence of the Chief of Engineers throughout five years, so that Burnap's status was better than that of a mere do facto officer. But it was not superior to what it would have been if he had been regularly appointed by the Chief of Engineers. United States v. Mouat, \n124 U.S. 303\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 505.\n Fifth. The question remains, whether there was a legal exercise by the Chief of Engineers of his power of removal. The suspension of Burnap was by letter from his immediate superior, the officer in charge of the office of public buildings and grounds under the Chief of Engineers; and to the latter the papers were promptly transmitted. The \n\n[252 U.S. 512, 519]\n\u00a0\n discharge was by direct command of the Chief of Engineers. Both the suspension and the discharge purported to be ordered pursuant to paragraph 13 of section 5 of General Orders No. 5 of the Office of Chief of Engineers, 1915, being regulations governing the classified civil service as applied to the Engineer Department at Large, approved by the Civil Service Commission and the Secretary of War. \n1\n Burnap contends that the provisions of that paragraph were inapplicable to his position: (1) Because these regulations relate to the Engineer Department at Large and the office of public buildings and grounds is not included therein; and (2) because they relate to employes, and that the landscape architect was an officer, not an employe. As has been shown, Burnap was an employe. But the maincontention was an employe. But the main contention not apply to the position of landscape architect, the exercise of the right of removal which rested in the Chief of Engineers was governed only be the provisions of the Act of August 24, 1912, c. 389,  6, 37 Stat. 555 (Comp. St.  3287), 2 and civil service rule XII. For no regulations \n\n[252 U.S. 512, 520]\n\u00a0\n relating to the matter appear to have been 'prescribed by the President, through the War Department' under the authority reserved in Revised Statutes,  1797, as amended. It is not contended that the procedure adopted in suspending and removing Burnap disregarded any requirement of the act of 1912 or of the civil service rule. Nor are we asked to review the discharge as having been made without adequate cause. The power of removal was legally exercised by the Chief of Engineers; and no irregularity has been pointed out in the suspension which was incident to it.\n Sixth. As the power of discharge was vested in the Chief of Engineers and was unaffected by the fact that the appointment had been inadvertently made by the Secretary of War, we have no occasion to consider the contention of Burnap, that it was beyond the Secretary's power to delegate to the Chief of Engineers authority to remove employes in his bureau. Nor need we consider the contention of the government, that the action taken was tantamount to a removal by the Secretary, because the discharg was ordered by the Chief of Engineers after consideration of the matter at Burnap's request by the Secretary of War, a reference of it by him to the Judge Advocate General, and a return of the papers by the Secretary of War to the Chief of Engineers for action in accordance with the Judge Advocate Generral's suggestions.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Paragraph 13: 'Discharge for Cause.-Discharge for cause of any regularly appointed classified employe will be subject to the provisions of civil service rule XII and cannot be made without the approval of the Chief of Engineers. An employe may be suspended without pay by the officer in charge, who should at once furnish the employe with a statement in writing of the charges against him and give him a reasonable time within which to make answer thereto in writing. As soon as reply is received, or in case no reply is received within the time given him, all papers should be submitted to the Chief of Engineers, with full statement of the facts in the case and the officer's recommendations.' \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Chapter 389,  6: 'No person in the classified civil service of the United States shall be removed therefrom except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of said service and for reasons given in writing, and the person whose removal is sought shall have notice of the same and of any charges preferred against him, and be furnished with a copy thereof, and also be allowed a reasonable time for personally answering the same in writing; and affidavits in support thereof;' etc. \n\n\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCALDWELL v. PARKER(1920)\nNo. 636\nArgued: Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 376, 377]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry E. Davis, of Washington, D. C., and Charles D. Kline, of Anniston, Ala., for appellant.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 376, 379]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Neil P. Sterne, of Anniston, Ala., and J. Q. Smith, of Birmingham, Ala., for appellee. \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 380]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Pending the existence of a state of war with Germany the appellant, a soldier in the army of the United States serving in a camp in Alabama, was tried and convicted for the murder of a civilian at a place within the jurisi ction of the state and not within the confines of any camp or place subject to the control of the civil or military authorities of the United States. The conviction was reviewed and affirmed by the Supreme Court of Alabama and was re-examined and reaffirmed on rehearing.\n The case is here to reverse the action of the court below in refusing on writ of habeas corpus a discharge which was prayed on the ground that, under the circumstances stated, the sentence was void because the state court had no jurisdiction whatever over the subject of the commission of the crime, since under the Constitution and laws of the United States that power was exclusively vested in a court-martial.\n As there was no demand by the military authorities for the surrender of the accused, what would have been the effect of such a demand, if made, is not before us. The contention of a total absence of jurisdiction in the state court is supported in argument, not only by the appellant, but also by the United States in a brief which it has filed as amicus curiae. These arguments, while differing in forms of expression, rest upon the broad assumption that Congress in re-enacting the Articles of War in 1916 (Comp. St.  2308a), by an exercise of constitutional authority, vested in the military courts during a state of war exclusive jurisdiction to try and punish persons in the military service for offenses \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 381]\n\u00a0\n committed by them which were violative of the law of the several states. In other words, the proposition is that under the act of 1916, by mere operation of a declaration of war, the states were completely stripped of authority to try and punish for virtually all offenses against their laws committed by persons in the military service. As in both arguments differences between the provisions of the act of 1916 and the previous Articles are relied upon to sustain the accomplishment of the result contended for, we must briefly consider the prior Articles before we come to test the correctness of the conclusion sought to be drawn from the Articles of 1916\n\n\n The first Articles of War were adopted in 1775. By them the generic power of courts-martial was established as follows:\n'L. All crimes, not capital, and all disorders and neglects, which officers and soldiers may be guilty of, to the prejudice of good order and military discipline, though not mentioned in the Articles of War, are to be taken cognizance of by general or regimental court- martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and be punished at their discretion.'\n\n It cannot be disputed that the effect of this grant was to confer upon courts-martial as to offenses inherently military an exclusive authority to try and punish. In so far, however, as acts which were criminal under the state law but which became subject to military authority because they could also appropriately be treated as prejudicial to good order and military discipline, a concurrent power necessarily arose, although no provision was made in the Articles regulating its exercise. But this omission was provided for in article 1 of section X of the revised Articles adopted in 1776, as follows:\n'Whenever an officer or soldier shall be accused of a capital crime, or of having used violence, or of having committed any offense against the persons or property of the good people \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 382]\n\u00a0\n of any of the United American States, such as is punishable by the known laws of the land, the commanding officer and officers of every regiment, troop, or party, to which the person or persons so accused shall belong, are hereby required, upon application duly made, or in behalf of the party or parties, to use his utmost endeavors to deliver over such accused person or persons to the civil magistrate; and likewise to be aiding and assisting to the officers of justice in apprehending and securing the person or persons so accused, in order to bring them to a trial. If any commanding officer or officers shall willfully neglect or shall refuse, upon the application aforsaid, to deliver over such accused person or persons to the civil magistrates, or to be aiding or assisting to the officers of justice in apprehending such person or persons, the officer or officers so offending shall be cashiered.'\n\n In view of the terms of this article and the fact that it was drawn from the British Articles, where the supremacy of the civil law had long prevailed, it results that its provisions gave the civil courts, if not supremacy of jurisdiction, at least a primary power to proceed against military offenders violating the civil law, although the same acts were concurrently within the jurisdiction of the military courts because of their tendency to be prejudicial to good order and military discipline.\n And in harmony with this view, the articles in question were applied up to 1806, in which year they were re-enacted without change as articles 99 and 33 of that revision, and were in force in 1863, in the Enrollment Act of which year it was provided (Act of March 3, 1863,  30, 12 Stat. 736):\n'That in time of war, insurrection, or rebellion, murder, assault and battery with an intent to kill, manslaughter, mayhem, wounding by shooting or stabbing with an intent to commit murder, robbery, arson, burglary, rape, assault and battery with an intent to commit \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 383]\n\u00a0\n rape, and larceny, shall the punishable by the sentence of a general court-martial or military commission, when committed by persons who are in the military service of the United States, and subject to the articles of war; and the punishments for such offenses shall never be less than those inflicted by the laws of the state, territory, or district in which they may have been committed.'\n\n It is to be observed that by this section there was given to courts- martial, under the conditions mentioned, power to punish for capital crimes, from which their authority had been from 1775 expressly excluded; and power was also given to deal, under the conditions stated and in the manner specifled, with other enumerated offenses over which they had not prior to the passage of the act had jurisdiction, presumably because such acts had not in practice been treated as within the grant of authority to deal with them as prejudical to good order and military discipline.\n In 1874, when the Articles of War were revised and re-enacted (Rev. Stat. U. S.  1342), the generic grant of power to punish acts prejudicial to good order and military discipline was re-expressed in artice 62, substantially as it existed from 1775. The provisions of section 30 of the act of 1863, supra, were in so many words made to constitute article 58, and the duty put upon military officials to surrender to state officers on demand persons in the military service charged with offenses against the state, was re-enacted in article 59, qualified, however, with the words, 'except in time of war.' Thus the Articles stood until they were re- enacted in the revision of 1916, as follows:\n The general grant of authority as to acts prejudicial to good order and military discipline was re-enacted in article 96, substantially as it had obtained from the beginning. The capital offenses of murder and rape, as enumerated in section 30 of the act of 1863, were placed in a distinct article \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 384]\n\u00a0\n and power was given to military courts to prosecute and punish them, as follows:\n'Article 92. Murder-Rape.-Any person subject to military law who commits murder or rape shall suffer death or imprisonment for life, as a court-martial may (be) direct; but no person shall be tried by court-martial for murder or rape committed within the geographical limits of the states of the Union and the District of Columbia in time of peace.' 39 Stat. 664.\n\n The remaining offenses enumerated in the act of 1863 were placed in a separate article, as follows:\n'Art. 93. Various Crimes.-Any person subject to military law who commits manslaughter, mayhem, arson, burglary, robbery, larceny, embezzlement, perjury, assault with intent to commit any felony, o assault with intent to do bodily harm, shall be punished as a court- martial may direct.' 39 Stat. 664.\n\n And, finally, the duty to respond to the demand of the state authorities for the surrender of military offenders against the state criminal laws was re-enacted as it had prevailed from the beginning, subject, however, to express regulations to govern in case of conflict between state and federal authority, and again subject to the qualification, 'except in time of war,' as first expressed in the revision of 1874; the article being as follows:\n'Art. 74. Delivery of Offenders to Civil Authorities.-When any person subject to military law, except one who is held by the military authorities to answer, or who is awaiting trial or result of trial, or who is undergoing sentence for a crime or offense punishable under these articles, is accused of a crime of offense committed within the geographical limits of the states of the Union and the District of Columbia, and punishable by the laws of the land, the commanding officer is required, except in time of war, upon application duly made, to use his utmost endeavor to deliver over such accused person to the civil \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 385]\n\u00a0\n authorities, or to aid the officers of justice in apprehending and securing him, in order that he may be brought to trial. Any commanding officer who upon such application refuses or willfully neglects, except in time of war, to deliver over such accused persons to the civil authorities or to aid the officers of justice in apprehending and securing him shall be dismissed from the service or suffer such other punishment as a court-martial may direct.' 39 Stat. 662.\n\n Comprehensively considering these provisions, it is apparent that they contain no direct and clear expression of a purpose on the part of Congress, conceding for the sake of the argument that authority existed under the Constitution to do so, to bring about, as the mere result of a declaration of war, the complete destruction of state authority and the extraordinary extension of military power upon which the argument rests. This alone might be sufficient to dispose of the subject for, as said in Coleman v. Tennessee, \n97 U.S. 509\n, 514 (24 L. Ed. 1118):\n'With the known hostility of the American people to any interference by the military with the regular administration of justice in the civil courts, no such intention should be ascribed to Congress in the absence of clear and direct language to that effect.'\n\n Certainly, it cannot be assumed that the mere existence of a state of war begot of necessity the military power asserted, since the Articles of War, originally adopted in 1775 were, as we have seen, in the very midst of the War for Independence, modified in 1776 to make certain the preservation of the civil power.\n But the contention relied upon is directly based upon the words, 'except in time of war,' as qualifying the duty of the military officers to respond to the demand by state authority for the surrender of military offenders against the state criminal laws, imposed by article 74, and the grant in article 92, expressed in the form of a negative pregnant, of authority to courts-martial to try capital \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 386]\n\u00a0\n crimes when committed by an officer or soldier within the geographical limits of the United States and the District Columbia in time of war. Both these provisions took their origin in the act of 1863 and were drawn from the terms of that act as re-expressed in the revision of 1874. By its very terms, however, the act of 1863 was wholly foreign to the destruction of state and the enlargement of military power here relied upon. It is true, indeed, that by the act authority was for the first time given, as pointed out in the Coleman Case, \n97 U.S. 508\n, 514, to courts- martial or military commissions to deal with capital and other serious crimes punishable under the state law. But the act did not purport to increase the general powers of courts-martial by defining new crimes, or by bringing enumerated offenses within the categr y of military crimes as defined from the beginning, as we have already pointed out, but, simply contemplated endowing the military authorities with power, not to supplant, but to enforce, the state law. As observed by Winthrop, in his work on Military Law (2d Ed.) p. 1033, it was intended to provide, through the military authorities, means of enforcing and punishing crimes against the state law committed by persons in the military service where as the result of the existence of martial law or of military operations, the courts of the state were not open and military power was therefore needed to enforce the state law. And it was doubtless this purpose indicated by the text, to which we have already called attention, which caused the court in the Coleman Case to say that that statute had no application to territory where 'the civil courts were open and in the undisturbed exercise of their jurisdiction.' \n97 U.S. 515\n.\n As in 1866 it was settled in Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 18, L. Ed. 281, that a state of war, in the absence of some occasion for the declaration of martial law or conditions consequent on military operations, gave no power to the military authorities where the civil courts were open and capable of performing \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 387]\n\u00a0\n their duties, to disregard their authority or frustrate the exercise by them of their normal and legitimate jurisdiction, it is indeed open to grave doubt whether it was the purpose of Congress, by the words 'except in time of war,' or the cognate words which were used with reference to the jurisdiction conferred in capital cases, to do more than to recognize the right of the military authorities, in time of war, within the areas affected by military operations or where martial law was controlling, or where civil authority was either totally suspended or obstructed, to deal with the crimes specified-a doubt which, if solved against the assumption of general military power, would demonstrate, not only the jurisdiction of the state courts in this case, but the entire absence of jurisdiction in the military tribunals. And this doubt becomes additionally serious when the revision of 1874 is considered, since in that revision the act of 1863 was in terms reenacted and the words 'except in time of war,' appearing for the first time in article 59 of that revision, could have been alone intended to qualify the time of war with which the act dealt; that is, a condition resulting from a state of war which prevented or interfered with the discharge of their duties by the civil courts.\n Into the investigation of the subject of whether it was intended by the provision 'except in time of war,' contained in the Articles of 1916, to do more than meet the conditions exacted by the actual exigencies of war like those contemplated by the act of 1863, and which were within the purview of military authority, as pointed out in Re Milligan, we do not feel called upon to enter. We say this because even though it be conceded that the purpose of Congress by the Articles of 1916, departing from everything which had gone before, was to give to military courts, as the mere result of a state of war, the power to punish as military offenses the crimes specified when committed by those in the military service, such admission is \n\n[252 U.S. 376, 388]\n\u00a0\n here negligible because, in that view, the regulations relied upon would do no more than extend the military authority, because of the state of war, to the punishment, as military crimes, of acts criminal under the state law, without the slightest indication of purpose to exclude the jurisdiction of state courts to deal with such acts as offenses against the state law.\n And this conclusion harmonizes with the principles of interpretation applied to the Articles of War previous to 1916 (Drury v. Lewis, \n200 U.S. 1\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 229; Grafton v. United States, \n206 U.S. 333\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 749, 11 Ann. Cas. 640; Franklin v. United States, \n216 U.S. 559\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 434; Steiner' Case, 6 Op. Atty. Gen. 413, and is, moreover, in accord with the decided cases which have considered the contention of exclusive power in the military courts as resulting from the Articles of 1916 which we have here considered. People v. Denman (Cal.) 177 Pac. 461; Funk v. State, 208 S. W. 509; United States v. Hirsch (D. C.) 254 Fed. 109.\n It follows, therefore, that the contention as to the enlargement of military power, as the mere result of a state of war, and the consequent complete destruction of state authority, are without merit and that the court was right in so deciding and hence its judgment must be and it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCALHOUN v.

Caskie, of Lynchburg, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Omnibus Claims Act (Act March 4, 1915, c. 140, 38 Stat. 962), made appropriations for the payment of 1,115 claims arising out of the Civil War which had, from time to time during the preceding 28 years, been referred by resolution of the House or of the Senate to the Court of Claims for investigation, either under the Bowman Act (Act March 3, 1883, c. 116, 22 Stat. 485), or under the Tucker Act (Act March 3, 1887, c. 359, 24 Stat. \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 172]\n\u00a0\n 505), or under section 151 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1142). Among the claims which that court reported favorably was one of Bland Massie, which had been referred to, it by resolution of the House on February 3, 1911.1 By section 1 of the Omnibus Claims Act (page 989), the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to pay Massie $1,900. Section 4 of the act (page 996), provided as follows:\n'That no part of the amount of any item appropriated in this bill in excess of twenty per centum thereof shall be paid or delivered to or received by any agent or agents, attorney or attorneys on account of services rendered or advances made in connection with said claim.\n\n'It shall be unlawful for any agent or agents, attorney or attorneys to exact, collect, withhold or receive any sum which in the aggregate exceeds twenty percentum of the amount of any item appropriated in this bill on account of services rendered or advances made in connection with said claim, any contract to the contrary notwithstanding. Any person violating the provisions of this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $1,000.'\n\n Massie had executed on April 18, 1911, an agreement as follows:\n'Fee Agreement.-This agreement witnesseth: That I, Bland Massie, of Tyro, Nelson county, Virginia, have employed C. C. Calhoun, of Washington, D. C., as my attorney to prosecute my claim against the government of the United States for property taken by the federal forces during the late Civil War, and in consideration of his professional services in the prosecution of said claim I hereby agree and bind my heirs and legal representatives, to pay him, his heirs or legal representatives as a fee a sum equal to 50 per cent. of the amount which may \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 173]\n\u00a0\n be collected upon said claim, said fee to be a lien on any warrant which may be issued in payment of said claim.'\n\n Calhoun prosecuted Massie's claim before the Court of Claims and secured the allowance of a motion to transmit its report to Congress,w hich thereafter made the appropriation above stated. On May 5, 1915, the government paid the $1,900 by means of two treasury warrants, one for $380 ( 20 per cent. thereof), made payable to Calhoun, the other for $1,520 (80 per cent. thereof), made payable to Massie. Calhoun demanded of Massie a further sum of $570, equal to 30 per cent. of the claim. Payment was refused; and he brought this suit in a state court of Virginia to recover the amount, claiming that the warrant for 20 per cent. had been accepted by him without waiving or releasing his right under the contract to the balance. A declaration setting forth in substance the above facts was demurred to on the ground that recovery was prohibited by section 4 of the act under which the appropriation was made. The demurrer was sustained and judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of Virginia (123 Va. 673, 97 S. E. 576). The case comes here on writ of certiorari (\n249 U.S. 596\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 289); Calhoun having contended in both lower courts, as here, that section 4 deprives him of liberty and property guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to the federal Constitution, and hence is void.\n For nearly three-quarters of a century Congress has undertaken to control in some measure the conditions under which claims against the government may be prosecuted. Its purpose has been in part to protect just claimants from extortion or improvident bargains and in part to protect the treasury from frauds and imposition. See United States v. Van Leuvan ( D. C.) 62 Fed. 52, 56. While recognizing the common need for the services of agents and attorneys in the presentation of such claims and that parties would often be denied the opportunity \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 174]\n\u00a0\n of securing such services if contingent fees were prohibited (Taylor v. Bemiss, \n110 \nU.S. 42, 45\n, 3 S. Sup. Ct. 441) Congress has manifested its belief that the causes which gave rise to laws against champerty and maintenance are persistent. By the enactment from time to time of laws prohibiting the assignment of claims and placing limitations upon the fees properly chargeable for services2 Congress has sought both to prevent the stirring up of unjust claims against the government and to reduce the temptation to adopt improper methods of prosecution which contracts for large fees contingent upon success have sometimes been supposed to encourage. The constitutionality of such legislation, although resembling in its nature the exercise of the police power, has long been settled. Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co., 16 How. 314, 336; United \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 175]\n\u00a0\n States v. Hall, \n98 \nU.S. 343, 354\n, 555 S.; Ball v. Halsell, \n161 \nU.S. 72, 82\n, 84 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 554.\n The provision in the contract sued on purporting to give a lien upon any warrant issued was void under section 3477 of the Revised Statutes ( Comp. St.  6383). Nutt v. Knut, \n200 \nU.S. 12, 20\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 216. It is urged that the act here in question should be construed as limiting only the proportion of the specific funds received from the government which may be applied to payment of attorney's fees; but the second paragraph of the law leaves no room for construction. It provides that:\n'It shall be unlawful for any ... attorney ... to ... receive any sum which in the aggregate exceeds twenty per centum' of the claim.\n\n Calhoun contends, however, that if the act is construed as limiting the amount recoverable from a claimant upon his personal obligation, it is void as applied to contracts in existence at the time of its passage, at least where, as here, the services contemplated had then been substantially performed.\n That an act limiting the compensation of attorneys in the prosecution of claims against the government is valid also as to contracts which had been entered into before its passage was expressly held in Ball v. Halsell, supra. The act there in question was passed 17 years after the date of the contract, and the attorney had performed important services before its enactment. Here, it is said, substantially all the services required of Calhoun had been performed when the act was passed. The difference in the percentage of services performed cannot here affect the legal result. An appropriate exercise by a state of its police power is consistent with the Fourteenth Amendment although it results in serious depreciation of property values; and the United States may, consistently with the Fifth Amendment, impose for a permitted purpose restrictions upon property which produce like results.

Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 U.S. 146\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 106, 64 L. Ed. --. The sovereign right of the government is not less because the property affected happens to be a contract. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467, 484\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671; Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, \n248 U.S. 372\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 117. Here, unlike New York Central v. Gray, \n239 \nU.S. 583, 587\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 176, a performance of a substitute for the obligation undertaken and later prohibited by the statute is impossible, because the act forbids the collection or receipt of any compensation in excess of 20 per cent.\n In the case at bar there are special reasons why the contract cannot prevail over the statute enacted later. At the time when the contract was entered into there was no legislation, general or special, which conferred upon Massie any right of recovery even if he should establish to the satisfaction of Congress that his claim was equitable. A statute making an appropriation to pay the claim was thus a condition precedent to liability on the part of Massie to Calhoun; and the thing contracted for was Calhoun's aid in securing its enat ment. The aid was to be given by representing Massie before the Court of Claims. But both of the parties knew that, although Calhoun might have success before the Court of Claims, Congress would still be free to refuse both to recognize the claim as an equitable one and to make an appropriation for its payment. They also knew that, if it concluded to grant relief, Congress was free to do so upon such conditions as it deemed proper. Compare Ball v. Halsell, supra, \n161 \nU.S. 82, 84\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 554; Kendall v. United States, 7 Wall. 113, 117. In view of the past action of Congress limiting attorney's fees, referred to above, it was at least conceivable when the contract was made that Congress might, as it proved,3 be unwilling to enact any legislation without assuring itself that the benefits thereof would not inure \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 177]\n\u00a0\n largely to others than those named in the act. Assent by Calhoun to the insertion in the act of a condition such as this, which he might reasonably have contemplated would be required to insure its passage, was therefore, implied in the contract to aid in securing the legislation. Compare The Kronprinzessin Cecilie, \n244 \nU.S. 12, 22\n, 23 S., 37 Sup. Ct. 490.\n Furthermore, Calhoun accepted and received from the treasury a warrant for 20 per cent. of the sum appropriated. The money was paid and it was received under the act which provided that it was unlawful to collect any sum in excess of 20 per cent., 'any contract to the contrary notwithstanding.' Calhoun cannot take under the act and repudiate its provisions. Compare Shepard v. Barron, \n194 \nU.S. 553, 567\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 737; Grand Rapids & Indiana Ry. Co. v. Osborn, \n193 \nU.S. 17, 29\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 310; Interstate Railway Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 U.S. 79\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 26, 12 Ann. Cas. 555. The allegation in the declaration that he accepted the 20 per cent. 'without waiving or releasing any of his rights under the aforesaid contract' was doubtless intended as a statement that the amount collected from the government was not accepted as a full settlement of his rights against the defendant under the contract. But it was a protestation totally at variance with his conduct. The payment to him by the treasury of the 20 per cent. could be made only under the act. It must be held to have been accepted according to the terms of the act. Any reservation which he may have made in words was futile. Capital Trust Co. v. Calhoun, \n250 \nU.S. 208, 218\n, 219 S., 39 Sup. Ct. 486.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissenting.\n In 1911 Calhoun made a lawful agreement with Massie to prosecute the latter's claim against the United States \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 178]\n\u00a0\n for property taken during the Civil War (Taylor v. Bemiss, \n110 U.S. 42\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 441); and Massie expressly bound himself to pay, as a fee for such services, 'a sum equal to 50 per cent. of the amount which may be collected, said fee to be a lien on any warrant,' etc.\n Calhoun performed his full part in strict accordance with the contract. As a result of his proper efforts, Congress finally approved the claim and appropriated $1,900 to pay it. Act March 4, 1915, c. 140, 38 Stat. 962, 989.\n But the same act (section 4, p. 996) provided that not more than 20 per cent. of the amount appropriated should be paid, or delivered to, or received by, any attorney for services, etc.; also:\n'It shall be unlawful for any agent or agents, attorney or attorneys to exact, collect, withhold or receive any sum which in the aggregate exceeds twenty per centum of the amount of any item appropriated in this bill on account of services rendered or advances made in connection with said claim, any contract to the contrary notwithstanding. Any person violating the provisions of this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $1,000.'\n\n Capital Trs t Co. v. Calhoun, \n250 U.S. 208\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 486, affirms the power of Congress to exempt the appropriated fund from any demand for counsel fees.\n In that case Calhoun, relying upon a contract like the one presently before us, recovered a judgment in the state court for the difference between 20 per cent. received from the treasury and fifty per cent. of the appropriation. The matter came here, and we expressly declared (\n250 U.S. 216\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 488):\n'If the judgment only establishes a claim against the administrator to be satisfied, not out of the moneys received from the United States, but from other assets of the estate, a situation is presented which it was said in Nutt v. Knut, \n200 U.S. 12\n, 21, would not encounter legal objection. In other words, the limitation \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 179]\n\u00a0\n in the act appropriating the money to 20 per cent. as the amount to be paid to an agent or attorney would have no application or be involved.'\n\n In effect, the court now holds that statement was obviously erroneous, and that Calhoun would have committed a misdemeanor if he had accepted a fee exceeding the 20 per cent.\n As to Certain 'Special Reasons Why the Contract Cannot Prevail Over the Statute Enacted Later.'\n\n\n (1)\n It is said that, when he executed the contract of employment, Calhoun impliedly assented to the insertion in any future appropriation act of a condition like the one under consideration; therefore he cannot recover. This assumes: First, a construction of the act in direct conflict with the meaning heretofore attributed to it; and, second, that so construed it is within the power of Congress. If these two assumptions are correct, of course there is no right to recover. This special reason can only serve to mislead.\n\n\n (2)\n It is further said that, as Calhoun received 20 per cent. of the amount appropriated by an act which declared unlawful the collection of anything more, he thereby in effect estopped himself from making a personal demand against his client. But this again assumes a construction of the act contrary to what we have declared, and further assumes that so construed it is valid. If these assumptions are correct, no further discussion is needed. This special reason lacks substance and can serve no good purpose.\n The Meaning of Section 4.\n Considering the definite statement concerning the true meaning of this section made 12 months ago in Capital Trust Co. v. Calhoun, \n250 U.S. 208\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 486, and quoted above, it would seem at least unusual now to announce a wholly different view accompanied by the mere assertion that there is 'no room for construction.' No mention \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 180]\n\u00a0\n is made of what was then said in very plain terms. Of course this has been accepted as authoritative both by lawyers and courts. The result is necessarily injurious both to the court and the public.\n In United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 408\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 527, 536 (53 L. Ed. 836) this was said:\n'Where a statute is susceptible of two constructions, by one of which grave and doubtful constitutional questions arise and by the other of which such questions are avoided, our duty is to adopt the latter.'\n\n As that statement has been repeated several times, it would seem worthy of some consideration now.\n I presume nobody doubts that Congress has power to prescribe reasonable rules concerning champerty, maintenance or kindred matters in United States courts, and to regulate assignments of claims against the government. But, under the adopted construction. section 4 (Act March 4, 1915) destroys an entirely lawful contract made long before its passage, deprives counsel of his right to enforce the personal liability of his client to pay for services already performed, and renders criminal the acceptance by him of more than an arbitrarily specified amount.\n Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., 16 How. 314, 316, United States v. Hall, \n98 \nU.S. 343, 354\n, 355 S., and Ball v. Halsell, 161 U. S.7 2, 84, 16 Sup. Ct. 554, are referred to as authority for such oppressive legislation. They give it no support.\n Marshall v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co. was an attempt to collect compensation for lobbying; and the holding was that a contract is void, as against public policy, and can have no standing in court by which one party stipulates to employ a number of secret agents in order to obtain the passage of a particular law by the Legislature of a state, and the other party promises to pay a large sum of money in case the law should pass. The case appears unimportant in connection with this controversy.\n In United States v. Hall the court ruled Congress has power to declare that embezzlement or fraudulent conversion \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 181]\n\u00a0\n to his own use by a guardian of pension money received on behalf of his ward from the Government is an offense against the United States. This case might be relevant if Calhoun were seeking to reach the fund appropriated by Congress; but he is not.\n In Ball v. Halsell, \n161 U.S. 82\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 556, an attorney sought to recover under a written agreement, concerning which this court said:\n'The instrument was an unilateral contract, not signed by the attorney, nor containing any agreement on his part, and-so long, at least, as it had not been carried into execution-might be revoked by the principal, or might be disregarded by him in making a settlement with the United States, or might be treated by him as absolutely null and void in any contest between him and the attorney. ... By the very terms of the contract, the attorney was to be paid only out of money recovered and received by him from the United States.'\n\n The case is wholly unlike the one now before us. Mr. Justice Gray took pains to explain the difference between it and Davis v. Commonwealth, 164 Mass. 241, 41 N. E. 292, 30 L. R. A. 743, where the Massachusetts court ruled that an agent of the state employed to prosecute a claim against the United States could recover compensation notwithstanding the act of Congress appropriating money to meet the claim provided that no part of such sum should be paid by the state to any attorney under previous contract.\n Davis v. Commonwealth and the language by Mr. Justice Gray in Ball v. Halsell, wherein he pointed out the clear distinction between the two cases, ought not to be lightly disregarded.\n It is certainly a very serious thing to decide that Congress, by its arbitrary fiat, may wholly deprive counsel of the right to enforce payment of compensation for long-continued efforts theretofore lawfully put forth, and prevent him, indeed, from accepting anything therefor. If a limit may be set at 20 per cent., any payment may \n\n[253 U.S. 170, 182]\n\u00a0\n be proscribed. We should follow Capital Trust Co. v. Calhoun, and reverse the judgment below.\n The Fifth Amendment was intended to protect the individual against arbitrary exercise of federal power. It declares no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law; and this inhibition protects every man in his right to engage in honest and useful work for compensation.

Prentiss, of Washington, D. C., and Joseph E. Morrison, of Phoenix, Ariz., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 450, 454]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Nebeker, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the United States to enjoin Ralph H. Cameron and others from occupying, using for business purposes, asserting any right to, or interfering with the public use of, a tract of land in Arizona, approximately 1,500 feet long and 600 feet wide, which Cameron is claiming as a lode mining claim, and to require the defendants to remove therefrom certain buildings, filth and refuse placed thereon in the course of its use by them as a livery stable site and otherwise. In the District Court there was a decree for the United States, and this was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 250 Fed. 943, 163 C. C. A. 193.\n The tract is on the southern rim of the Grand Canyon of the Colorado, is immediately adjacent to the railroad \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 455]\n\u00a0\n terminal and hotel buildings used by visitors to the canyon and embraces the head of the trail,1 over which visitors descend to and ascend from the bottom of the canyon. Formerly it was public land and open to acquisition under the public land laws. But since February 20, 1893, it has been within a public forest reserve2 eatablished and continued by proclamations of the President under the Acts of March 3, 1891,  24, 26 Stat. 1095, 1103 (Comp. St.  5121), and June 4, 1897, c. 2, 30 Stat. 34-36 (Comp. St .  5123-5134), and since January 11, 1908, all but a minor part of it has been within a monument reserve3 establish by a proclamation of the President under the act of June 8, 1906, c. 3060, 34 Stat. 225 (Comp. St .  5278-5281). The forest reserve remained effective after the creation of the monument reserve, but in so far as both embraced the same land the monument reserve became the dominant one. 35 Stat. 2175. The inclusion of the tract in the forest reserve withdrew it from the operation of the public land laws, other than the mineral land law; and the inclusion of the major part of it in the monument reserve withdrew that part from the operation of the mineral land law, but there was a saving clause in respect of any 'valid' mining claim theretofore acquired. The United States still has the paramount legal title to the tract, and also has the full beneficial ownership if Cameron's asserted mining claim is not valid.\n The defendants insist that the monument reserve should be disregarded on the ground that there was no authority for its creation. To this we cannot assent. The act under which the President proceeded empowered him toe stablish reserves embracing 'objects of historic or scientific interest.' The Grand Canyon, as stated in his proclamation, 'is an object of unusual scientific interest.' \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 456]\n\u00a0\n It is the greatest eroded canyon in the United States, if not in the world, is over a mile in depth, has attracted wide attention among explorers and scientists, affords an unexampled field for geologic study, is regarded as one of the great natural wonders, and annually draws to its borders thousands of visitors.\n The defendants also insist that in holding the United States entitled to the relief sought the courts below gave undue effect and weight to decisions of the Secretary of the Interior dealing with Cameron's asserted claim and pronouncing it invalid. Rightly to appreciate and dispose of this contention requires a further statement.\n The claim in question is known as the Cape Horn lode claim and was located by Cameron in 1902 after the creation of the forest reserve and before the creation of the monument reserve. To make the claim valid, or to invest the locator with a right to the possession, it was essential that the land be mineral in character and that there be an adequate mineral discovery within the limits of the claim as located, Rev. Stat.  2320 (Comp. St.  4615); Cole v. Ralph, \n252 U.S. 286\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 321, 64 L. Ed. --; and to bring the claim within the saving clause in the withdrawal for the monument reserve the discovery must have preceded the creation of that reserve.\n Cameron applied to the Land Department for the issue to him of a patent for the claim and similarly sought patents for other claims embracing other portions of the trail into the canyon. A protest was interposed charging that the land was not mineral, that there had been no supporting mineral discoveries and that the claims were located and used for purposes not contemplated by the mineral land law; and the Secretary of the Interior directed that a hearing be had in the local land office to enable the parties concerned-the protestant, Cameron and the government-to produce evidence bearing on the questions thus presented. Grand Canyon Ry. Co. v. Cameron, 35 Land Dec. 495; Id., 36 Land Dec. 66. After due notice the hearing was had, Cameron fully \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 457]\n\u00a0\n participating in it. This was shortly after the creation of the monument reserve. In due course the evidence was laid before the Commissioner of the General Land Office and he concluded therefrom that the claims were not valuable for mining purposes, and therefore were invalid. The matter was then taken before the Secretary of the Interior and that officer rendered a decision in which, after reviewing the evidence, he said:\n'It is not pretended that the applicant has as yet actually disclosed any body of workable ore of commercial value; nor does the evidence reveal such indications and conditions as would warrant the belief or lead to the conclusion that valuable deposits are to be found, save, apparently, in the case of the Magician lode claim. With that possible exception, the probabilities of such deposits occurring are no stronger or more evident at the present time than upon the day the claims were located. The evidence wholly fails to show that there are veins or lodes carrying valuable and workable deposits of gold, silver, or copper, or any other minerals within the limits of the locations. Sufficient time has elapsed since these claims were located for a fair demonstration of their mineral possibilities.'\n\n And further:\n'It follows from the foregoing that each of Cameron's applications for patent ... must be rejected and canceled, and it is so ordered.\n\n'It is the further result of the evidence, and the department holds, that the several mining locations, with the apparent exception of the Magician lode claim, do not stand upon such disclosures or indications of valuable mineral in rock in place therein, prior to the establishment of the national monument and the withdrawal of the lands therein embraced, as to bring them within the saving clause of the executive order. Th right of Cameron to continue possession or exploration of those claims \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 458]\n\u00a0\n is hereby denied, and the land covered thereby is declared to be and remain part of the Grand Canyon National Monument, as if such locations had not been attempted.'\n\n Directions were given for a further hearing respecting the Magician claim, but this is of no moment here.\n That decision was adhered to on a motion for review, and in a later decision denying a renewed application by Cameron for a patent for the claim here in question the Secretary said:\n'As the result of a hearing had after the creation of the national monument the department expressly found that no discovery of mineral had been made within the limits of the Cape Horn location, and that there was no evidence before the department showing the existence of any valuable deposits or any minerals within the limits of the location. ... So far as the portion of the claim included within the exterior limits of the national monument is concerned, no discovery which would defeat the said monument can have been made since the date of the previous hearing in this case, nor do I find that one is claimed to have been made since the former decision in any part of the alleged location.'\n\n After and notwithstanding these decisions Cameron asserted an exclusive right to the possession and enjoyment of the tract, as it the lode claim wer valid; and he and his codefendants, who were acting for or under him, continued to occupy and use the ground for livery and other business purposes, and in that and other ways obstructed its use by the public as a part of the reserves. In this situation, and to put an end to what the government deemed a continuing trespass, purpresture and public nuisance, the present suit was brought.\n The courts below ruled that the decisions of the Secretary of the Interior should be taken as conclusively determining the nonmineral character of the land and the absence of an adequate mineral discovery, and also as \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 459]\n\u00a0\n showing that the matter before the Secretary was not merely the application for a patent but also the status of the claim-whether it was valid or was wanting in essential elements of validity, and whether it entitled Cameron to the use of the land as against the public and the government. As before stated, the defendants complain of that ruling. The objections urged against it are, first, that the Secretary's decisions show that he proceeded upon a misconception of what under the law constitutes an adequate mineral discovery, and, second, that although the Secretary had ample authority to determine whether Cameron was entitled to a patent, he was without authority to determine the character of the land or the question of discovery, or to pronounce the claim invalid.\n As to the first objection little need be said. A reading of each decision in its entirety, and not merely the excerpts to which the defendants invite attention, makes it plain that the Secretary proceeded upon the theory that to support a mining location the discovery should be such as would justify a person of ordinary prudence in the further expenditure of his time and means in an errort to develop a paying mine. That is not a novel or mistaken test, but is one which the Land Department long has applied and this court has approved. Chrisman v. Miller, \n197 \nU.S. 313, 322\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 468.\n The second objection rests on the naked proposition that the Secretary was without power to determine whether the asserted lode claim, under which Cameron was occupying and using a part of the reserves to the exclusion of the public and the reserve officers, was a valid claim. We say 'naked proposition' because it is not objected that Cameron did not have a full and fair hearing, or that any fraud was practiced against him, but only that the Secretary was without any power of decision in the matter. In our opinion the proposition is not tenable.\n By general statutory provisions the execution of the \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 460]\n\u00a0\n laws regulating the acquisition of rights i the public lands and the general care of these lands is confided to the Land Department, as a special tribunal; and the Secretary of the Interior, as the head of the department, is charged with seeing that this authority is rightly exercised to the end that valid claims may be recognized, invalid ones eliminated, and the rights of the public preserved. Rev. Stat.  441, 453, 2478 (Comp. St.  681, 699, 5120); United States v. Schurz, \n102 \nU.S. 378, 395\n, 26 S. L. ed. 167; Lee v. Johnson, \n116 \nU.S. 48, 52\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 249; Knight v. United Land Association, \n142 \nU.S. 161, 177\n, 181 S., 12 Sup. Ct. 258; Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 U.S. 316\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 698\n\n\n A mining location which has not gone to patent is of no higher quality and no more immune from attack and investigation than are unpatented claims under the homestead and kindred laws. If valid, it gives to the claimant certain exclusive possessory rights, and so do homestead and desert claims. But no right arises from an invalid claim of any kind. All must conform to the law under which they are initiated; otherwise they work an unlawful private appropriation in derogation of the rights of the public.\n Of course, the Land Department has no power to strike down any claim arbitrarily, but so long as the legal title remains in the government it does have power, after proper notice and upon adequate hearing, to determine whether the claim is valid and, if it be found invalid, to declare it null and void. This is well illustrated in Orchard v. Alexander, \n157 \nU.S. 372, 383\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 635, 639 (39 L. Ed. 737), where in giving effect to a decision of the Secretary of the Interior canceling a pre- emption claim theretofore passed to cash entry, but still unpatented, this court said:\n'The party who makes proofs, which are accepted by the local land officers, and pays his money for the land, has acquired an interest of which he cannot be arbitrarily dispossessed. His interest is subject to state taxation. Carroll v. Safford, 3 How. 441 [11 L. Ed. 671]; Witherspoon v. Duncan, 4 Wall. 210 [18 L. Ed. 339]. Th e \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 461]\n\u00a0\n government holds the legal title in trust for him, and he may not be dispossessed of his equitable rights without due process of law. Due process in such case implies notice and a hearing. But this does not require that the hearing must be in the courts, or forbid an inquiry and determination in the Land Department.'\n\n And to the same effect is Michigan Land & Lumber Co. v. Rust, \n168 \nU.S. 589, 593\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 208, 209 (42 L. Ed. 591), where in giving effect to a decision of the Secretary canceling a swamp land selection by the state of Michigan, theretofore approved, but as yet unpatented, it was said:\n'It is, of course, not pretended that when an equitable title has passed the Land Department has power to arbitrarily destroy that equitable title. It has jurisdiction, however, after proper notice to the party claiming such equitable title, and upon a hearing, to determine the question whether or not such title has passed. Cornelius v. Kessel, \n128 U.S. 456\n [9 Sup. Ct. 122]; Orchard v. Alexander, \n157 U.S. 372\n, 383 [15 Sup. Ct. 635]; Parsons v. Venzke, \n164 U.S. 89\n [17 Sup. Ct. 27]. In other words, the power of the department to inquire into the extent and validity of the rights claimed against the government does not cease until the legal title has passed.'\n\n True, the mineral land law does not in itself confer such authority on the Land Department. Neither does it place the authority elsewhere. But this does not mean that the authority does not exist anywhere, for, in the absence of some direction to the contrary, the general statutory provisions before mentioned vest it in the Land Department. This is a necessary conclusion from this court's decisions. By an act of 1848 the title to public land in Oregon then occupied as missionary stations, not exceeding 640 acres in any instance, was confirmed to the several religious associations maintan ing those stations, but the act made no provision for determining where the stations were, by whom they were maintained or the area occupied. The Land Department proceeded to a determination of these questions in the \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 462]\n\u00a0\n exercise of its general authority, and in Catholic Bishop of Nesqually v. Gibbon, \n158 \nU.S. 155, 166\n, 167 S., 15 Sup. Ct. 779, 784 (39 L. Ed. 931), where that determination was challenged as to a particular tract, it was said:\n'While there may be no specific reference in the act of 1848 of questions arising under this grant to the Land Department, yet its administration comes within the scope of the general powers vested in that department. ... It may be laid down as a general rule that, in the absence of some specific provision to the contrary in respect to any particular grant of public land, its administration falls wholly and absolutely within the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of the General Land Office, under the supervision of the Secretary of the Interior. It is not necessary that with each grant there shall go a direction that its administration shall be under the authority of the Land Department. It falls there unless there is express direction to the contrary.'\n\n And in Cosmos Exploration Co. v. Gary Eagle Oil Co., \n190 \nU.S. 301, 308\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 692, 696 (47 L. Ed. 1064), where a claimant asserting a full equitable title under the lieu land provision of the Forest Reserve Act of 1897 (Comp. St.  5123-5134), questioning the authority of the Land Department to inquire into and pass on the validity of his claim and sought to have it recognized and enforced by a suit in equity, it was said:\n'There can be, as we think, no doubt that the general administration of the Forest Reserve Act, and also the determination of the various questions which may arise thereunder before the issuing of any patent for the selected lands, are vested in the Land Department. The statute of 1897 does not in terms refer any question that might arise under it to that department, but the subject-matter of that act relates to the relinquishment of land in the various forest reservations to the United States, and to the selection of lands, in lieu thereof, from the public lands of the United States, and the administration of the act is to be governed by the general system adopted by the United States for the administration of \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 463]\n\u00a0\n the laws regarding its public lands. Unless taken away by some affirmative provision of law, the Land Department has jurisdiction over the subject.'\n\n There is in the mineral land law a provision referring to the court's controversies between rival mineral claimants arising out of conflicting mining locations (Rev. Stat.  2325, 2326 [Comp. St.  4622, 4623]), but it does not reach or affect other controversies, and so is without present bearing (Creede & Cripple Creek Mining Co. v. Uinta Tunnel Mining Co., \n196 U.S. 337\n, 356, et seq., 25 Sup. Ct. 266).\n It is rightly conceded that in the case of a conflict between a mining location and a homestead claim the department has authority to inquire into and determine the validity of both and, if the mining location be found invalid and the homestead claim valid, to declare the former null and void and to give full effect to the latter; and yet it is insisted that the department is without authority, on a complaint preferred in the public interest, to inquire into an determine the validity of a mining location, and, if it be found invalid to declare it of no effect and recognize the rights of the public. We think the attempted distinction is not sound. It has no support in the terms of the mineral land law, is not consistent with the general statutory provisions before mentioned, and if upheld would encourage the use of merely colorable mining locations in the wrongful private appropriation of lands belonging to the public.\n Instances in which this power has been exercised in respect of mining locations are shown in the Yard Case, 38 Land Dec. 59, and the Nichols- Smith Case (on rehearing) 46 Land Dec. 20;i nstances in which its exercise has received judicial sanction are found in Lane v. Cameron, 45 App. D. C. 404, and Cameron v. Bass, 19 Ariz. 246, 168 Pac. 645, and an instance in which its existence received substantial, if not decisive, recognition by this court is found in Clipper Mining Co. v. Eli Mining Co., \n194 \nU.S. 220, 223\n, 234 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 632. \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 464]\n\u00a0\n The argument is advanced that the department necessarily is without authority to pronounce a mining location invalid, because it has within itself no means of executing its decision, such as dispossessing the locator. But this is not a proper test of the existence of the authority, for the department is without the means of executing most of its decisions in the sense suggested. When it issues a patent it has no means of putting the grantee in possession, and yet its authority to issue patents is beyond question. When it awards a tract to one of two rival homestead claimants it has no means of putting the successful one in possession or the other one out, and yet its authority to determine which has the better claim is settled by repeated decisions of this court. And a similar situation exists in respect of most of the claims or controversies on which the department must pass in regular course. Its province is that of determining questions of fact and right under the public land laws, of recognizing or disapproving claims according to their merits and of granting or refusing patents as the law may give sanction for the one or the other. When there is occasion to enforce its decisions in the sense suggested, this is done through suits instituted by the successful claimants or by the government, as the one or the other may have the requisite interest.\n Whether the tract covered by Cameron's location was mineral and whether there had been the requisite discovery were questions of fact, the decision of which by the Secretary of the Interior was conclusive in the absence of fraud or imposition, and none was claimed. Catholic Bishop of Nesqually v. Gibbon, supra; Burfenning v. Chicago, St. Paul, etc., Ry. Co., \n163 \nU.S. 321, 323\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 1018. Accepting the Secretary's findings that the tract was not mineral and that there had been no discovery, it is plain that the location was invalid, as was declared by the Secretary and held by the courts below. \n\n[252 U.S. 450, 465]\n\u00a0\n Of other complaints made by the defendants, it suffices to say that, in our opinion, the record shows that the government was entitled to the relief sought and awarded.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Bright Angel Trail. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Originally the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve and now the Tusayan National Forest. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Called the Grand Canyon National Monument. \n\n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCANADIAN NORTHERN RY. CO. v. EGGEN(1920)\nNo. 281\nArgued: March 1, 1920Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 553, 554]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. D. Mitchell, of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 553, 557]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ernest A. Michel, of Ninneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 553, 558]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The only question presented for decision in this case is as to the validity of section 7709 of the Statutes of Minnesota (General Statutes of Minnesota 1913), which reads:\n'When a cause of action has arisen outside of this state, and, by the laws of the place where it arose, an action thereon is there barred by lapse of time, no such action shall be maintained in this state unless the plaintiff be a citizen of the state who has owned the cause of action ever since it accrued.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the District \n\n[252 U.S. 553, 559]\n\u00a0\n Court, held this statute invalid for the reason that the exemption in favor of citizens of Minnesota rendered it repugnant to article 4, section 2, of the Constitution of the United States, which declares that--\n'The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.'\n\n The action was commenced in the District Court of the United States for the District of Minnesota, Second Division, by the respondent, a citizen of North Dakota, against the petitioner, a corporation organized under the laws of the Dominion of Canada, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him on November 29, 1913, when employed by the petitioner as a switchman in its yards at Humboldt, in the province of Saskatchewan. The respondent, a citizen and resident of North Dakota, went to Canada and entered the employ of the petitioner as a switchman a short time prior to the accident complained of. He remained in Canada for six months after the accident and then returned to live in North Dakota. He commenced this action on October 15, 1915, almost two years after the date of the accident. By the laws of Canada, where the cause of action arose, an action of this kind must be commenced within one year from the time injury was sustained. If the statute of Minnesota, above quoted, is valid, it is applicable to the action, which, being barred in Canada, cannot be maintained in Minnesota by a nonresident plaintiff. If, however, the statute is invalid, the general statute of limitations of Minnesota, allowing a period of six years within which to commence action, would be applicable. The record properly presents the claim of the petitioner that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in holding the statute involved unconstitutional and void.\n It is plain that the act assailed was not enacted for the purpose of creating an arbitrary or vexatious discrimination against nonresidents of Minnesota. \n\n[252 U.S. 553, 560]\n\u00a0\n It has been in force ever since the state was admitted into the Union in 1858; it is in terms precisely the same as those of several other states, and in substance it does not differ from those of many more. It gives a nonresident the same rights in the Minnesota courts as a resident citizen has, for a time equal to that of the statute of limitations where his cause of action arose. If a residet citizen acquires such a cause of action after it has accrued, his rights are limited precisely as those of the nonresident are, by the laws of the place where it arose. If the limitation of the foreign state is equal to or longer than that of the Minnesota statute, the nonresident's position is as favorable as that of the citizen.\n It is only when the foreign limitation is shorter than that of Minnesota, and when the nonresident who owns the cause of action from the time when it arose has slept on his rights until it is barred in the foreign state (which happens to be the respondent's case), that inequality results-and for this we are asked to declare a statute unconstitutional which has been in force for 60 years.\n This court has never attempted to formulate a comprehensive list of the rights included within the 'privileges and immunities' clause of the Constitution (article 4,  2), but it has repeatedly approved as authoritative the statement by Mr. Justice Washington, in 1825, in Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C. 371, 380, Fed. Cas. No. 3,230 (the first federal case in which this clause was considered), saying:\n'We feel no hesitation in confining these expressions to those privileges and immunities which are, in their nature, fundamental.' Slaughter-House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 75; Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 248\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 165; Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n207 \nU.S. 142, 155\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 34.\n\n In the Corfield Case the court included in a partial list of such fundamental privileges 'the right of a citizen of one state ... to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of' another. \n\n[252 U.S. 553, 561]\n\u00a0\n The state of Minnesota, in the statute we are considering, recognized this right of citizens of other states to institute and maintain suits in its courts as a fundamental right, protected by the Constitution, and for one year from the time his cause of action accrued the respondent was given all of the rights which citizens of Minnesota had under it. The discrimination of which he complains could arise only from his own neglect.\n This is not disputed, nor can it be fairly claimed that the limitation of one year is unduly short, having regard to the likelihood of the dispersing of witnesses to accidents such as that in which the respondent was injured, their exposure to injury and death, and the failure of memory as to the minute details of conduct on which questions of negligence so often turn. Thus, the holding of the Circuit Court of Appeals comes to this, that the privilege and immunity clause of the Constitution guarantees to a nonresident precisely the same rights in the courts of a state as resident citizens have, and that any statute which gives him a less, even though it be an adequate, remedy is unconstitutional and void.\n Such a literal interpretation of the clause cannot be accepted.\n From very early in our history, requirements have been imposed upon nonresidents in many, perhaps in all, of the states as a condition of resorting to their courts, which have not been imposed upon resident citizens. For instance, security for costs has very generally been required of a nonresident, but not of a resident citizen, and a nonresident's property in many states may be attached under conditions which would not justify the attaching of a resident citizen's property. This court has said of such requirements:\n'Such a regulation of the internal affairs of a state cannot reasonably be characterized as hostile to the fundamental rights of citizens of other states. ... \n\n[252 U.S. 553, 562]\n\u00a0\n It has never been supposed that regulations of that character materially interfered with the enjoyment by citizens of each state of the privileges and immunities secured by the Constitution to citizens of the several states.' Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 256\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 165, 172 (43 L. Ed. 432).\n\n The principle on which this holding rests is that the constitutional requirement is satisfied if the nonresidn t is given access to the courts of the state upon terms which in themselves are reasonable and adequate for the enforcing of any rights he may have, even though they may not be technically and precisely the same in extent as those accorded to resident citizens. The power is in the courts, ultimately in this court, to determine the adequacy and reasonableness of such terms. A man cannot be said to be denied, in a constitutional or in any rational sense, the privilege of resorting to courts to enforce his rights when he is given free access to them for a length of time reasonably sufficient to enable an ordinarily diligent man to institute proceedings for their protection.\n This is the principle on which this court has repeatedly ruled that contracts were not impaired in a constitutional sense by change in limitation statutes which reduced the time for commencing actions upon them, provided a reasonable time was given for commencing suit before the new bar took effect. Sohn v. Waterson, 17 Wall. 596; Terry v. Anderson, \n95 U.S. 628\n, 632; Tennessee v. Sneed, \n96 U.S. 69\n, 74; Antoni v. Greenhow, \n107 \nU.S. 769, 774\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 91.\n A like result to that which we are announcing was reached with respect to similar statutes, in Chemung Canal Bank v. Lowery, \n93 U.S. 72\n; by the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, in Aultman & Taylor Co. v. Syme, 79 Fed. 238, 24 C. C. A. 539; in Klotz v. Angle, 220 N. Y. 347, 116 N. E. 24; and in Robinson v. Oceanic Steam Navigation Co., 112 N. Y. 315, 325, 19 N. E. 625, 627 (2 L. R. A. 636).\n In this last case the Court of Appeals of New York pertinently says: \n\n[252 U.S. 553, 563]\n\u00a0\n 'A construction of the constitutional limitation [the one we are considering] which would apply it to such a case as this would strike down a large body of laws which have existed in all the states from the foundation of the government, making some discrimination between residents and nonresidents in legal proceedings and other matters.'\n The laws of Minnesota gave to the nonresident respondent free access to its courts, for the purpose of enforcing any right which he may have had, for a year-as long a time as was given him for that purpose by the laws under which he chose to live and work-and having neglected to avail himself of that law, he may not successfully complain because his expired right to maintain suit elsewhere is not revived for his benefit by the laws of the state to which he went for the sole purpose of prosecuting his suit. The privilege extended to him for enforcing his claim was reasonably sufficient and adequate and the statute is a valid law.\n It results that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed and that of the District Court affirmed.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCARBON STEEL CO. v. LEWELLYN(1920)\nNo. 535\nArgued: January 12, 1920Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 501, 502]\n\u00a0\n Mr. H. V. Blaxter, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this action against Lewellyn who is collector of internal revenue for the Twenty-Third district of Pennsylvania, to recover the sum of $271,062.62, with interest from December 29, 1917, paid to him, under a demand made by him, as collector for an excise tax assessed under section 301 of title III of the Act of September 8, 1916, known as 'munition manufacturer's tax.'\n Petitioner made a verified return under protest, reciting its belief that the tax should be abated for the following reasons: (1) It ( petitioner) did not manufacture munitions; (2) the munitions taxed were manufactured by certain independent contractors; (3) the profit derived by petitioner was from the sale of the munitions, not from their manufacture.\n The tax was not abated and petitioner paid it under protest. \n\n[251 U.S. 501, 503]\n\u00a0\n The facts are stipulated: Petitioner, through its president, who went to England, entered into three contracts with the British government dated, respectively, January 26, September 29, and October 7, 1915, for the manufacture and delivery f. a. s. New York, of a certain number of high explosive shells.\n The work to complete the shells consisted of the following operations : (1) Obtaining suitable steel in bar form; (2) cutting or breaking the bars to proper length; (3) converting the bars or slugs into a hollow shell forging by means of a hydraulic press; (4) turning the shell upon a lathe to exact dimensions; (5) closing one end of the forging to form the nose of the shell; (6) drilling out the case of the shell and inserting a base plate; (7) threading the nose of the shell and inserting the nose bushing and inserting in the nose bushing a wooden plug to protect the thread thereof; (8) cutting a groove around the circumference of the shell and inserting thereon a copper driving band and turning the band to required dimensions; (9) varnishing, greasing, and crating the completed shell.\n Petitioner was not equipped, nor did it have facilities, for doing any of the described work except the manufacture of steel suitable for the shells in bar form, and, therefore, to procure the manufacture of the shells it (petitioner) did certain work and entered into numerous contracts in relation to the various steps in making a completed shell.\n These steps are not necessary to give. The question in the case is not a broad one and all of the details of the stipulation are not necessary to its decision. The essential elements of fact we have given and whether they bring petitioner within the munitions Tax Act we shall proceed to consider.\n The act is as follows:\n'Sec. 301. (1) That every person manufacturing ... (c) projectiles, shells, or topedoes of any kind; ... or (f) any part of any of the articles mentioned in ... (c) ...-shall pay \n\n[251 U.S. 501, 504]\n\u00a0\n for each taxable year, in addition to the income tax imposed by title I, an excise tax of twelve and one-half per centum upon the entire net profits actually received or accrued for said year from the sale or disposition of such articles manufactured within the United States . ...' Comp. St.  6336 1\/4 b. $The act is explicit in its declaration; perplexity and controversy come over its application. One must be a 'person manufacturing' to incur the tax, but who is to be regarded as such person in the sense of the act? Or to put it another way, when is 'manufacturing' (the word of the act) done, and when is 'manufactured' (the word of the act) attained? In elucidation of the words, the specifications enumerate nine operations to produce a shell, that is a completed shell (except for explosive charge and detonating device), such as petitioner contracted to deliver to the British government. And all of the operations are asserted to be necessary and all must be performed seemingly by the same person in order that he may be designae d as a 'person manufacturing.' We put aside for the purpose of testing the contention the provision of the act making a person manufacturing 'any part of any of the articles mentioned' subject to 'a tax.'\n\n The contention reduces the act to a practical nullity on account of the ease of its evasion. Besides petitioner minimizes what it did. It was the contractor for the delivery of shells, made the profits on them and the profits necessarily reimbursed all expenditures on account of the shells. It was such profits that the act was intended to reach-profits made out of the war and taxed to defray the expense of the war. Or, as expressed by the Court of Appeals, Congress 'felt that the large abnormal profits incident to these war contracts created a remunerative field for temporary taxation.' Petitioner, it is true, used the services of others, but they were services necessary to the discharge of its obligations and to the acquisition of the profits of such discharge. And petitioner kept control \n\n[251 U.S. 501, 505]\n\u00a0\n throughout-never took its hands off, was at pains to express the fact, and retained its ownership of all of the materials furnished by it, and the completed shell belonged to it until delivered to the British government. And further, the steel furnished by it was advanced above a crude state- advanced to slugs. The nicking by an outside company we consider of no consequence, for after nicking they were redelivered to petitioner and by it 'broken or separated' into slugs.\n And petitioner supplied its respective subcontractors with other materials-'transit plugs,' 'fixing screws,' and 'copper tubing.' It is, of course, the contention of petitioner that this was furnishing, no manufacturing, and that the literal meaning of words can be insisted on in resistance to a taxing statute. We recognize the rule of construction, but it connot be carried to reduce the statute to empty declarations. And, as we have already said, petitioner's contention would so reduce it. How universal must the manufacturing be? Will the purchase of an elemental part destroy it? And how subsidiary must the work of the subcontractor be not to relieve the contractor-take from him the character of a 'person manufacturing'? And such is the tangle of inquiries we encounter when we undertake to distinguish between what a contractor to deliver a thing does himself and what he does through others as subsidiary to his obligation.\n It is after all but a question of the kind or degree of agency-the difference, to use counsel's words, between 'servants and general agents' and 'brokers, dealers, middlemen or factors.' And this distinction between the agents counsel deems important and expresses it another way as follows:\n\"Every person manufacturing' means the person doing the actual work individually, or through servants or general agents and that the ownership of the material worked upon does not alter this meaning of the word.' \n\n[251 U.S. 501, 506]\n\u00a0\n We are unable to assent to this meaning of the word. It takes from the act a great deal of utility and makes it miss its purpose. Of course it did not contemplate that 'person manufacturing' should use his own hands-it contemplated the use of other aid and instrumentalities, machinery, servants, and general agents; availing thereby of the world's division of labor, but it contemplated also the world's division of occupations, and in this comprehensive way, contemplated that all of the world's efficiency might be availed of, and when availed of for profits, the latter could not thereby escape being taxed. And where, indeed, was the hardship of it? The tax was on profits and measured by them.\n\n It is, however, alleged, and the stipulation shows, that the subcontracting companies paid a tax on their profits and profits were testified to be the difference between what was paid the subcontracting companies for the work and their cost in doing it. And it thus appears, it is urged, that petitioner has been taxed upon the theory that it manufactured the shells and the contrat ing companies 'have been taxed for actually performing all the manufacturing necessary to complete the same shells.'\n But it is sufficient answer to say that the tax here in issue is the tax on the profits of the petitioner, not on the profits of the subcontractors. The question whether such subcontractors were correctly assessed concerns them and not the petitioner who is resisting a tax on the profits actually made by him and none other.\n We consider further discussion unnecessary.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER dissent. \n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHAPMAN v. WINTROATH(1920)\nNo. 117\nArgued: January 9, 1920Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. John L. Jackson and Albert H. Adams, both of Chicago, Ill., and A. V. Cushman, of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.[ Chapman v. Wintroath \n252 U.S. 126\n (1920) ]\n\n\n[252 U.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Paul Synnestvedt, of Philadelphia, Pa., for respondent.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 126, 132]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1909 Mathew T. Chapman and Mark C. Chapman filed an application for a patent on an 'improvement in deep well pumps.' The mechanism involved was complicated, the specification intricate and long, and the claims numbered 34. The application met with unusual difficulties in the Patent Office, and, although it had been regularly prosecuted, as required by law and the rules of the Office, it was still pending without having been passed to patent in 1915, when the controversy in this case arose.\n In 1912 John A. Wintroath filed an application for a patent on 'new and useful improvements in well mechanism,' which was also elaborate and intricate, with 12 combination claims, but a patent was issued upon it on November 25, 1913\n\n\n Almost 20 months later, on June 6, 1915, the Chapmans filed a divisional application, in which the claims of the Wintroath patent were copied and on this application such proceedings were had in the Patent Office that on March 24, 1916, an interference was declared between it and the Wintroath patent.\n The interference proceeding related to the combination of a fluid- operated bearing supporting a downwardly extending shaft, and auxiliary bearing means for sustaining any resultant downward or upward thrust of such shaft. If is sufficiently described in count 3 of the notice of interference: \n\n[252 U.S. 126, 133]\n\u00a0\n\n'3. In deep well pumping mechanism, the combination with pump means including a pump casing located beneath the surface of the earth and rotary impeller means in said casing, of a downwardly extending power shaft driven from above and adapted to drive said impeller means, a fluid operated bearing co- operating to support said shaft, said fluid operated bearing being located substantially at the top of said shaft so that the shaft depends from the fluid bearing and by its own weight tends to draw itself into a substantially straight vertical line, means for supplying fluid under pressure to said fluid bearing independently of the action of the pump means, auxiliary bearing means for sustaining any resultant downward thrust of said power shaft and auxiliary bearing means for sustaining any resultant upward thrust of said power shaft.'\n\n Wintroath admits that the invention thus in issue was clearly disclosed in the parent application of the Chapmans, but he contends that their divisional application, claiming the discovery, should be denied, because of their delay of nearly 20 months in filing, after the publication of his patent and the Chapmans, while asserting that their parent application fully disclosed the invention involved, admit that the combination of the Wintroath patent was not specifically claimed in it.\n Pursuant to notice and the rules of the Patent Office, Wintroath, on April 27, 1916, filed a statement declaring that he conceived the invention contained in the claims of his patent 'on or about the 1st of October, 1910,' and thereupon, because this date was subsequent to the Chapman filing date, March 10, 1909, the Examiner of Interferences notified him that judgment on the record would be entered against him unless he showed cause within 30 days why such action should not be taken.\n Within the rule day Wintroath filed a motion for judgment in his favor 'on the record,' claiming that conduct on the part of the Chapmans was shown, which estopped \n\n[252 U.S. 126, 134]\n\u00a0\n Them from making the claims involved in the interference and which amounted to an abandonment of any rights in respect thereto which they may once have had. The Chapmans contended that such a motion for judgment could not properly be allowed 'until an opportunity had been granted for the introduction of evidence.' But the Examiner of Interferences, without hearing evidence, entered judgment on the record in favor of Wintroath, and awarded priority to him, on the ground that the failure of the Chapmans to make claims corresponding to the interference issue for more than one year after the date of the patent to Wintroath, constituted equitable laches which estopped them from successfully making such claims. This holding, based on the earlier decision by the Court of Appeals in Rowntree v. Sloan, 45 App. D. C. 207, was affirmed by the Examiner in Chief, but was reversed by the Commissioner of Patents, whose decision, in turn, was reversed by the Court of Appeals in the judgment which we are reviewing.\n In its decision the Court of Appeals holds that an inventor whose parent application discloses, but does not claim, an invention which conflicts with that of a later unexpired patent, may file a second application making conflicting claims, in order to have the question of priority of invention between the two determined in an interference proceeding, but only within one year from the date of the patent, and that longer delay in filing constitutes equitable laches, which bars the later application. By this holding the court substitutes a one-year rule for a two-year rule which had prevailed in the Patent Office for many years before the Rowntree decision, rendered in 1916, and the principal reason given for this important change is that the second application should be regarded as substantially an amendment to the parent application, and that it would be inequitable to permit a longer time for filing it than the one year allowed by R. S. \n\n[252 U.S. 126, 135]\n\u00a0\n  4894 (Comp. St.  9438), for further prosecution of an application after office action thereon.\n The question presented for decision is, whether this conclusion is justifiable and sound, and the answer must be found in the statutes and rules of the Patent Office made pursuant to statute, prescribing the action necessary to be taken in order to obtain a patent, for the whole subject is one of statutory origin and regulation.\n The statute which is fundamental to all others in our patent law (R. S.  4886, as amended March 3, 1897, 29 Stat. 692, c. 391 [Comp. St.  9430]), provides with respect to the effect of a United States patent upon the filing of a subsequent application for a patent on the same discovery, which is all we are concerned with here, that any discoverer of a patentable invention, not known or used by others in this country, before his invention or discovery, may file an application for a patent upon it, at any time within two years after it may have been patented in this country. Such a prior patent is in no sense a bar to the granting of a second patent for the same invention to an earlier inventor, ventor, provided that his application is filed not more than two years after the date of the conflicting patent. The applicant may not be able to prove that he was the first inventor, but the statute gives him two years in which to claim that he was and in which to secure the institution of an interference proceeding in which the issue of priority between himself and the patentee may be determined in a prescribed manner.\n This section, unless it has been modified by other statutes, or in effect by decisions of the courts, is plainly not reconcilable with the decision of the Court of Appeals, and should rule it. Has it been so modifled?\n The section of the Revised Statutes dealing with inventions previously patented in a foreign country (R. S.  4887, as amended March 3, 1903, 32 Stat. 1225 [Comp. St.  9431]), provides that no patent shall be granted on an \n\n[252 U.S. 126, 136]\n\u00a0\n application for a patent if the invention has been patented in this or any foreign country more than two years before the date of the actual filing of the application in this country.\n Section 4897 of the Revised Statutes (16 Stat. 202, c. 230,  35 [ Comp. St.  9443]), in dealing with the renewal of an application in case of failure to pay the final fee within six months of notice that a patent has been allowed, provides that another application may be made for the invention 'the same as in the case of an original application.' But such application must be made within two years after the allowance of the original application.\n And in R. S.  4920 (Comp. St.  9466), providing for pleadings and proofs in infringement suits it is provided that when properly pleaded and noticed the defendant may prove in defense that the patent declared on had been patented prior to the plaintiff's supposed invention 'or more than two years prior to his application for a patent therefor,' and also that the subject-matter of the patent 'had been in public use or on sale in this country for more than two years' before the plaintiff's application for a patent.\n Thus through all of these statutes runs the time limit of two years for the filing of an application, there is no modification in any of them of the like provision in R. S.  4886, as amended (Comp. St.  9430), and no distinction is made between an original and a later or a divisional application, with respect to this filing right.\n A brief reference to the decisions will show that until the Rowntree Case, the courts had left the filing right under R. S.  4886, as untouched as the statutes thus had left it.\n There is no suggestion in the record that the original application of the Chapmans was not prosecuted strictly as required by the statutes and the rules of the Patent Office, and therefore it is settled their rights may not be denied or diminished on the ground that such delay may \n\n[252 U.S. 126, 137]\n\u00a0\n have been prejudicial to either public or private interests.\n'A party seeking a right under the patent statutes may avail himself of all their provisions, and the courts may not deny him the benefit of a single one. These are questions not of natural but of purely statutory right. Congress, instead of fixing seventeen, had the power to fix 30 years as the life of a patent. No court can disregard any statutory provisions in respect to these matters on the ground that in its judgment they were unwise or prejudicial to the interests of the public.' United States v. American Bell Telephone Co. Et al., \n167 \nU.S. 224, 247\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 809, 813 (42 L. Ed. 144).\n\n In reissue cases, where there was no statutory time prescribed for the making of an application for the correction of a patent, and although unusual diligence is required in such cases, this court adopted the twoyear rule as reasonable by analogy to the law of public use before an application for a patent. Mahn v. Harwood, \n112 \nU.S. 354, 363\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 174, 6 Sup. Ct. 451; Wollensak v. Reiher, \n115 \nU.S. 96, 101\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 1137.\n To this we must add that not only have later or divisional applications not been dealt with in a hostile spirit by the courts, but, on the contrary, designed as they are to secure the patent to the first discoverer, they have been favored to the extent that where an invention clearly disclosed in an application, as in this case, is not claimed therein but is subsequently claimed in another application, the original will be deemed a constructive reduction of the invention to practice and the later one will be given the filing date of the earlier, with all of its priority of right. Smith & Griggs Manufacturing Co. v. Sprague, \n123 \nU.S. 249, 250\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 122; Von Recklinghausen v. Dempster, 34 App. D. C. 474, 476, 477.\n These, a few from many, suffice to show that prior to the Rowntree Case, the decisions did not tend to modification of the statutory two-year rule.\n The Court of Appeals recognizes all this law as applicable to an original application, but it finds warrant for \n\n[252 U.S. 126, 138]\n\u00a0\n cutting the time limit to one year in the case of later applications in three reasons, viz.: Because it is inequitable to allow so long a time as two years for filing a new application, claiming a discovery for which a patent has issued; because such a time allowance is contrary to public policy, as unduly extending the patent monopoly if the new application should prevail; and, finally and chiefly, as we have pointed out, because, regarding such a later application as substantially an amendment to the original application the court discovers, in analogy to the time allowed by statute for amendment to applications (R. S.  4894), a reason for holding that the failure for more than one year to make a later, in this case a divisional, application, amounts to fatal laches.\n However meritorious the first two of these grounds may seem to be they cannot prevail against the provisions of the statutes (United States v. American Bell Telephone Co., supra), and the third does not seem to us persuasive because of the difference in the kind of notice which is given to the applicant cant under R. S.  4894, and that given him when a patent is issued conflicting with his application.\n The one-year provision of R. S.  4894, as amended March 3, 1897, 29 Stat. 693 (Comp. St.  9438), is that an applicant for a patent, who shall fail to prosecute his application within one year after Patent Office action thereon, 'of which notice shall have been given' him, shall be regarded as having abandoned his application, unless the Commissioner of Patents shall be satisfied that such delay was unavoidable. But when a conflict between inventions disclosed in applications escapes the attention of the Patent Office Examiners (R. S.  4904 [Comp. St.  9449]), and a patent is issued, with claims conflicting with the disclosures of a pending application, the applicant receives only such notice of the conflict as he is presumed to derive from the publication of the patent. In the one case the notice \n\n[252 U.S. 126, 139]\n\u00a0\n is actual and specific, in the other it is indefinite and constructive only. When the great number of patents constantly being issued is considered, many of them of a voluminous and complicated character, such as we have in this case, with many and variously worded claims, such an implied notice must necessarily be precarious and indefinite to a degree which may well have been thought to be a sufficient justification for allowing the longer two-year period to inventors who must, at their peril, derive from such notice their knowledge of any conflict with their applications.\n As has been pointed out, the Examiner of Interferences did not permit the introduction of any evidence with respect to laches or abandonment and the Court of Appeals rests its judgment, as he did, wholly upon the delay of the Chapmans in filing their divisional application for more than one year after the Wintroath patent was issued, as this appeared 'on the face of the record.' While not intending to intimate that there may not be abandonment which might bar an application within the two-year period allowed for filing, yet upon this discussion of the statutes and decisions, we cannot doubt that upon the case disclosed in this record, the Chapmans were within their legal rights in filing their divisional application at any time within two years after the publication of the Wintroath patent, and therefore the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESBROUGH v.

Parrish, of Des Moines, Iowa, and Frederick W. Lehmann, of St. Louis, Mo., for Des Moines Union Ry. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit in equity brought in the year 1907 in the Circuit ( now District) Court of the United States for the Southern District of Iowa by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company and the Wabash Railroad Company against the Des Moines Union Railway Company. By an amended bill the individual defendants, Frederick M. Hubbell, Frederick C. Hubbell, and their firm of F. M. Hubbell & Son, were brought in, and afterwards the Wabash Railway Company, having succeeded to the rights of the Wabash Railroad Company, was substituted as a complainant in its stead. Jurisdiction depended entirely upon diverse citizenship of the parties.\n Complainants own and operate lines of railroad extending to the city of Des Moines, Iowa, and connecting there with a joint terminal property, legal title to which is held by the defendant Des Moines Union Railway Company (hereinafter called for convenience the terminal company), in which complainants hold a minority of stock, the Wabash Company an eighth, the other complainant a quarter, \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 200]\n\u00a0\n while the Messrs. Hubbell hold five-eighths. Complainants assert that the terminal company holds its property in trust for their use, and that they are the sole beneficial owners, having an equitable tenancy in common, and being entitled to the joint use of the property in perpetuity, exclusive except as other railroads may be admitted to participate in such use with their consent. This is the principal matter in controversy. Intimately connected with it is the question of the validity as against complainants of the Messrs. Hubbell's claim to ownership of five-eighths of the capital stock. A subordinate issue relates to the disposition of what are called 'surplus earnings,' acquired by the terminal company from outside parties during the operation of the terminal under an agreement made in the year 1889 between the terminal company and the predecessors of complainants and which expired in 1918\n\n\n Complainants base their principal contention upon a trust alleged to have been established under and pursuant to an agreement made January 2, 1882, between three companies then engaged in the construction of as many railroads converging at Des Moines, and through the incorporation of the terminal company in the year 1884 for the express purpose of acting as trustee for the three companies, and the conveyance to it by them of the terminal property, followed by the working agreement of 1889, from all of which it is contended that the terminal company has from the beginning held and still holds all its property subject to a trust under which the three railroad companies and their successors and assigns, and such other railroad companies having lines terminating at Des Moines as may be admitted with their consent, are entitled to have the terminal property maintained and operated for their use and benefit at the actual cost of the terminal service performed. Complainant Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company is the remote \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 201]\n\u00a0\n successor of two of the three companies, owning what may be called the Northern and the Northwestern lines. Complainant Wabash Railway Company is the remote successor of the original company that owned the third, which may be called the St. Louis line.\n The bill of complaint prayed for a decree declaring and establishing the trust, an accounting for all income and profits received by the terminal company for switching or handling traffic at the terminal for companies other than complainants and their predecessors, and for rentals of real estate and the like, and specifically and generally for other appropriate relief. The defenses set up in the answer and attempted to be supported by the proofs are, briefly, that by the deeds of conveyance made to the terminal company it took title not as trustee but absolutely and for its own sole use and benefit; that whatever relation may have arisen from the provisions of the original articles of incorporation, whether fiduciary or merely contractual, was substantially modified, and if fiduciary terminated, by amendments adopted April 8, 1890, alleged to have been thereafter recognized by complainants and their predecessors as valid and so treated by defendants and all others concerned; that complainants by their conduct and that of their predecessors are estopped from setting up the equitable title alleged, and have been guilty of laches barring relief in equity; hence that they are not entitled to assert any right or interest in the terminal property except such as arises from their ownership of a portion of the stock of the terminal company and from the provisions of the agreement of 1889; and that by the proper construction of that agreement the so-called surplus earnings are the property of the terminal company and not of complainants.\n Upon final hearing the District Court made a decree from which both sides appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where it was held (one judge dissenting) that \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 202]\n\u00a0\n the terminal company had complete and absolute title to the terminal property; that complainants, except as holders of its stock or bonds, had no interest in it, nor voice in the control or management; that by the true construction of the 1889 agreement complainants were entitled to the surplus earnings until May 1, 1918, and that thereafter the rights of the parties respecting the use of the terminal were only such as sprang from their nature as carriers and their physical and business relations to each other and to the terminal; by reason of which the terminal company must furnish them with reasonable terminal facilities at reasonable charges to be agreed upon, or in default of agreement to be fixed by the proper public tribunal. 254 Fed. 927, 168 C. C. A. 289.\n Cross-writs of certiorari bring the resulting decree here for review.\n The facts are intricate, and the evidence so voluminous that any detailed recital of it would be unduly tedious. It is sufficiently referred to in the prevailing and dissenting opinions delivered in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and we will content ourselves with touching upon the salient points. The case involves no abstruse legal or equitable doctrine; the application of familiar principles to the facts as they are developed will direct us to the proper outcome.\n The agreement of January 2, 1882, was made between the three railroad companies and two individuals in whose names certain titles had been taken for the benefit of the companies. Its principal provisions were:\n That terminal facilities in Des Moines should be purchased, constructed, and maintained at the joint expense of the three companies and held and used in common; that the expense of acquisition should be borne one-half by the St. Louis Company, one- quarter by each of the others; 'that a depot company may be organized and may take permanent charge of the property upon the terms herein set forth, and \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 203]\n\u00a0\n that said company may issue and deliver to the companies, parties hereto, its mortgage bonds to the amount of their respective portions of the cost of the said purchases and improvements. ... The title to said property shall be and remain in a trustee to be named by agreement of said companies, but subject to the joint use and occupation of all of said railway companies upon the terms herein described.'\n The St. Louis Company was to be charged with police control, supervision, and maintenance of the terminal, and the expense thereof ( including taxes) apportioned between it and the other companies according to the use they should respectively make as evidenced by the wheelage; spur tracks were to be built connecting the terminal with factories and other sources of trade in and about the city, but if either of the companies should deem the construction of any such track not advantageous the question of constructing it and which of the three companies should pay for it was to be determined by arbitration; any railroad company having a line not extending to Des Moines, but having effected an arrangement for running its trains into the city over the line of either of the three companies, was to be entitled to the use of the terminal facilities upon paying a fair sum for rental and a proportion of the maintenance account, the rental to inure to the three companies in the same proportion as the original outlay, and the sum due for maintenance to be determined in the same manner as in the case of the three companies; railroad companies having lines extending into Des Moines might be admitted to the use of the terminal by agreement of all three companies; differences arising under the agreement were to be referred to arbitration.\n The terminal company was organized by representatives of the three companies under articles of incorporation dated December 10, 1884, which recited the 1882 contract in full, with special emphasis upon the provision that a \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 204]\n\u00a0\n depot company might be organized to take permanent charge of the property, and declared that the new company was organized for this purpose as well as others that were expressed. The articles contained apt provisions to comply with the laws of the state of Iowa so as to enable it to construct, own, and operate a railway in, around, and about the city, with depots and everything else useful and convenient for the operation of railways at the terminal point, and with all the powers conferred upon corporations for pecuniary profit. Its corporate existence was to continue for 50 years, with the right of renewal. It was expressly declared:\n'All the powers exercised by this company shall be in accordance with the terms and spirit of the aforesaid contract entered into on the 2d day of January, A. D. 1882.'\n\n There was a provision that the written assent of the three companies should be necessary before the terminal company should lease or otherwise dispose of the use of any part of its franchises to any other railroad company. The capital stock was to be $1,000,000, divided into shares of $ 100 each, and paid in as the board of directors might determine, with authority to the board to receive in payment the property and franchises in Des Moines held by the three companies and their trustees. Four members of the board of directors were to be nominated by the St. Louis Company, two members by each of the other proprietary companies, and no stockholder to be eligible for membership in the board unless so nominated. This provision to apply to and be enjoyed by any grantee or assignee of either of the three companies. No contract, lease, or other agreement amounting to a permanent charge upon the property of the corporation to be entered into unless first approved by the three companies or their assigns and by more than three-fourths of all the stockholders.\n January 1, 1885, each of the three companies held a stockholders' meeting, at which formal resolutions were \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 205]\n\u00a0\n adopted reciting the contract of January 2, 1882, and the organization of the terminal company as contemplated in that contract and in order to carry out its purpose; each company thereby accepting and ratifying, so far as its interests were affected, the articles of incorporation of the terminal company as in substantial accord and compliance with the terms and conditions of the contract, and authorizing its officers to transfer to the new company all its right, title, and interest in the terminal property in exchange for a proper share of the bonds and stock of the terminal company.\n On the same day the board of directors of the terminal company adopted resolutions accepting the transfer, management, and operation of the terminal property, appointing a committee to confer with the three railroad companies with respect to the terms and price at which the terminal property and franchises should be conveyed to it, and to procure from them 'such conveyance and transfer as may be necessary to fully invest this company with the title, control and management of said properties provided for in said contract of January 2, 1882,' and authorizing the issue of all its capital stock and not exceeding $500,000 of bonds to be secured by mortgage of the properties so to be conveyed; the bonds and stock to be used in paying for the property, maintaining, operating, and improving it, and purchasing other property necessary to carry out the objects of the company.\n Due apparently to the financial embarrassment of the original Wabash Company, which dominated the St. Louis and the Northwestern, terminal matters remained in abeyance until November, 1887, when deeds were authorized, and, between that time and the following April, were made by the companies and the individual trustees with the effect of vesting in the terminal company complete legal title to the properties that had been acquired for the purpose of establishing the terminal. The \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 206]\n\u00a0\n deeds were absolute in form. The terminal company by amendment of its articles increased its capital stock from $1,000,000 to $2,000,000, and authorized the making of a mortgage, which afterwards was given as of date November 1, 1887, to the Central Trust Company of New York as trustee, to secure an issue of $800,000 of 5 per cent. bonds for the purpose of paying for its property and completing improvements thereon; the mortgage covering all its real estate, rolling-stock, etc., then owned or thereafter to be acquired.\n Until May 1, 1888, the terminal property continued to be operated by the St. Louis Company under the original agreement; on that date the terminal company took possession, and ever since then has continued to operate it and render terminal service thereon to the three railroad companies and their successors, as well as to other companies admitted from time to time under special agreements.\n Upon a review of all the evidence, construing the writings in the light of the circumstances and the manifest purpose and intent of the parties, we are clear that the effect of the transactions thus far recounted was to establish a trust in the full and proper sense of the word, the terminal company being invested as trustee with complete legal title, but without beneficial ownership, and subject to a duty to maintain and operate the property and exercise all of its corporate powers for the common use and benefit of the three railroad companies, their successors and assigns, and such other companies as might be admitted by them to a proprietary participation in the terminal.\n The gist of defendants' argument to the contrary is that the incorporation of the terminal company and the conveyance of the property to it by deeds absolute in form manifested a substantial change of plan from that embodied in the contract of January 2, 1822; stress being laid \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 207]\n\u00a0\n upon the fact that the powers of a terminal railway company as acquired under the articles of incorporation were much more extensive than those of a depot company, and it being contended that the provisions of the articles respecting the control of the terminal company and the resolutions providing for the transfer of the property to it, the form of the deeds themselves, and the issuance of stock and bonds to the proprietary companies in payment, demonstrated a purpose to invest the terminal company with title for all purposes. But the main object of establishing a joint terminal at the common expense and for the common use of the three companies and to retain their proprietary interest in it while confiding its maintenance and operation to their trustee is so manifest that all the proceedings are properly to be construed as designed to give effect to it, and seeming inconsistencies and ambiguities resolved accordingly. The provision of the articles that 'all the powers exercised by this company shall be in accordance with the terms and spirit of the aforesaid contract' is not merely contractual, but amounts to a declaration of trust and together with the other evidence shows clearly that the powers were procured from the state expressly to enable the company the better to fulfill the purposes of its existence as such trustee, and not to set it up in business on its own account. The substitution of the terminal company with more elaborate powers in place of the depot company contemplated at the beginning shows a development and modification of the original plan, but no departure or substantial change. The particular stipulations contained in the articles respecting the control of the terminal company were intended not as a substitute for but as safeguards of the trust. The absolute form of the conveyances, and the issuance of stock and bonds 'in payment,' were intended to give credit to the company in its dealings with outside parties and to render its bonds more readily salable; but they constituted the \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 208]\n\u00a0\n mere mechanism for carrying into effect the main purpose of the parties, and as between them were controlled by that purpose and by the articles and resolutions that manifested an express declaration of the trust. All the circumstances, and what we have quoted from the resolution of the terminal company directors, show that the title was conveyed for the purpose of enabling that company to control and manage the terminal in furtherance of the objects of the 1882 agreement.\n It needs no particular form of words to create a trust, so there be reasonable certainty as to the property, the objects, and the beneficiaries. Colton v. Colton, \n127 U.S. 310\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1164. But if, as here, the subject of the trust be a legal interest in property and capable of legal transfer, the trust is not perfectly created unless the legal interest be actually vested in the trustee. Adams v. Adams, 21 Wall. 185, 192, 194. Hence the necessity in this case of deeds conveying the fee to the terminal company. But it is not necessary that the trust be expressed in the same instrument that transfers the title. Various instruments may be read together in order to ascertain the intention to establish one. Loring v. Palmer, \n118 \nU.S. 321, 340\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 1073.\n The agreement of May 10, 1889, between the terminal company of the first part and the three proprietary companies of the second part fixed the terms upon which the property should be managed and the terminal service performed for a period of 30 years to date from May 1, 1888. It constituted a working arrangement for that period, but did not in terms or by implication set aside the trust or place a time limit upon it. It provided that for the terminal service the proprietary companies should make payments, in proportion to the wheelage of each, to cover interest upon the mortgage bonds, the cost of maintenance, repairs, taxes, and insurance and the cost of operating the terminal, including all expenses ( except the operation of engine houses, care of engines, and repairs \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 209]\n\u00a0\n thereto, which were separately dealt with), after deducting any amounts which other railway companies might be obliged to pay for the use of the property. Engine house expenses were to be apportioned according to the number of engines of each company, engine repairs to be charged to the company for which the work was done. The agreement contained other provisions of permanent effect, providing for the allotment of the stock of the terminal company to the proprietary companies and declaring the terms upon which outside companies might be admitted to ownership of the stock or the use of the property. It recited that the proprietary companies were entitled to the stock in the proportion of one-half to the St. Louis Company, one-fourth to each of the others, and provided for the issuance of certificates accordingly, and that these should express upon their faces that they were not transferable without the consent in writing of all the proprietary companies, except as to shares issued to qualify directors. And there was a provision that the St. Louis Company might sell one-half of its stock, or one-quarter of the whole, to such railroad company as might be acceptable to a majority of the proprietary companies, in which case the purchasing company might be admitted as one of the parties to the agreement upon the same terms and conditions as those stipulated for the other parties of the second part; and that, except as thus provided, other railroad companies should not be admitted to the use of the terminal property without the consent of all the parties of the second part.\n Here again we have a further modification of some of the details of the original plan, but in respects altogether consistent with the continuance of the trust; inconsistent, indeed, with a purpose to treat the terminal company as an independent entity subject only to contractual obligations and remit the proprietary companies to the ordinary rights of stockholders. Their contributions to the original cost \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 210]\n\u00a0\n of the property naving been secured by mortgage bonds according to the plan of 1882, provision was now made for distributing the entire capital stock according to the original proportions, one-half to the St. Louis, one-quarter to each of the two other companies, but with certain material restrictions upon the ordinary rights of stockholders expressed in the agreement and others necessarily implied.\n Since, from the very nature and terms of the trust, all the property and franchises of the terminal company were to be held for the benefit of the proprietary companies, and all its corporate powers exercised in the administration of the joint terminal for their common use, the stockholding interest in the terminal company necessarily must be modified, as between the parties, to the extent necessary to give full effect to the trust. In the hands of the proprietors of the connecting lines the stock was the evidence of their right to participate in the benefits of the trust, in the control and management of the terminal company, and in the use of the terminal; but such use, in the nature of things, must be proportioned, not according to the magnitude of their respective stock holdings, but according to their respective traffic requirements. And since the terms of the trust required that these connecting lines should have the entire beneficial use of the property upon paying the cost of the terminal service, there was no room for a profit from the operations of the terminal company out of which dividends could be paid. Except in the theoretically possible but extremely improbable event of an abandonment of the terminal (as to the effect of which no opinion need be expressed), it is plain that, as between the parties to the trust and others having notice of it, the stock could have little or no exchange value except to a company owning or operating a railroad line connecting or capable of connecting with the terminal. In the hands of others having notice of the trust, the stock represented no sub \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 211]\n\u00a0\n stantial property interest. Some recognition of the anomalous status of the stockholding interest is to be found in the acts of the parties above set forth, especially in the provisions of the agreement of 1889. The amount of stock provided for shows that it was deemed probable that eventually the property would have a value in excess of the original cost represented by the bond issue, or that value might be given to the stock through liquidation of the bonds or otherwise, and that upon a sale of a participation in the terminal property and facilities to an outside railroad company evidenced by a transfer of stock in the terminal company, some return could be got for such increased value. The apportionment of the original issue, and the stipulations of the 1889 agreement, recognized that the St. Louis Company, as representative of the original Wabash Company, was equitably entitled to preference in any profits that might be derived from such a sale to an outside company. And evidently it was then anticipated that there would be four proprietary companies, each holding one-fourth of the stock, with equal representation in the board of directors.\n We are not here concerned with any question pertaining to the rights of the bondholders. It may be assumed that, if necessary for their protection, the mortgage would be treated as conveying the entire estate, both legal and equitable, in the terminal property. No express provision appears to have been made for paying off the principal of the bonds. Whether the beneficiaries of the trust, as between themselves, were or are entitled to have provision made for discharging the principal by including periodic amortization charges as a part of the cost of operating the terminal is a question that we need not consider.\n Nor are we at this moment concerned with any question that might arise if stock of the terminal company had come or should come to the hands of a bona fide purchaser for value without notice. The principal controversy \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 212]\n\u00a0\n arises from the fact that defendants F. M. Hubbell and F. C. Hubbell have become the holders of five-eighths of the capital stock, upon which fact, together with the alleged effect of the amendments to the articles of incorporation adopted April 8, 1890, defendants rest the insistence that the proprietary companies have lost their right to control the action of the terminal company, that the Messrs. Hubbell as stockholders are entitled to control it and to have dividends out of its profits, and that from and after the expiration of the 1889 agreement, complainants have no right to the use of the terminal except upon terms to be agreed upon by the terminal company as controlled by the Messrs. Hubbell.\n It is important, therefore, to consider the circumstances under which their stock was acquired and the amendments adopted.\n Obviously the fiduciary character of the terminal company extended to its officers and directors as to all others concerned in its management, charging them with a duty to uphold the trust and imposing upon them the usual disability about reaping a personal advantage at the expense of the beneficiaries. And it is clear and undisputed that the Messrs. Hubbell acquired their stock with full notice of all essential facts pertaining to the trust; they themselves at all times material were officers and directors of the terminal company and acted in a fiduciary capacity in everything relating to its affairs. Mr. F. M. Hubbell was an officer and director of that company at the beginning and continuously thereafter, especially active in its management; and during a period which included the important transactions in question he also was a director and officer of each of the proprietary companies and their trusted representative in respect to terminal matters at Des Moines. Mr. F. C. Hubbell became a director of the terminal company in January, 1890, president two years later, and has been such continuously since. \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 213]\n\u00a0\n In the year 1886 and thereafter until and during the year 1890 the property of the Wabash system, including the stock of the St. Louis Company with control of its part of the stock of the terminal company, was in the hands of a purchasing committee as trustees for the Wabash bondholders. In February, 1890, F. M. Hubbell obtained from this committee an option for the purchase of $135,000 of the terminal company bonds and a quarter interest in its capital stock for $135,000, accepted the option, made over to General Dodge a half interest in it, and Hubbell and Dodge each received one-half of the specified bonds and one-eighth of the outstanding capital stock, with a guaranty on the part of the purchasing committee that the St. Louis Company would approve the transfer (as it afterwards did, through its board of directors), and that the committee would consent to such change in the articles of incorporation of the terminal company as would permit one director to be nominated by any person or company holding one-eighth of the stock. At this time Gen. Dodge was president of the terminal company, and also president and principal stockholder of the Northern Company; Hubbell, besides his relation to the terminal company, was president of the Northwestern Company and its controlling stockholder. In correspondence between Mr. Hubbell and the purchasing committee antecedent to this transaction they warned him that it would be necessary to confine a sale of stock 'to such railway companies as would be interested in the station'; and he assented to this, acknowledging that 'it would be prejudicial to sell any of this stock to outsiders, and I understand it as you do that the stock cannot be sold without the consent of the different railroad companies who now form the terminal company.' Later Hubbell acquired from the purchasing committee $ 50,000 of the bonds and an additional eighth interest in the capital stock of the terminal company for $57,736, being \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 214]\n\u00a0\n par and accrued interest for the bonds and 15 per cent. of par for the stock, upon the understanding expressed in writing that an eighth interest should be 'sufficient to represent a proprietorship in the company, according to the understanding we had when you were here'-evidently meaning that the eighth retained by the purchasing committee should carry with it a proprietary interest and influence in the terminal not limited in proportion to the amount of the stock.\n Defendants insist that because the purchasing committee sold the stock to Hubbell and Dodge for a valuable consideration, they must be taken to have dealt with it as having substantial value; and that since, in afterwards making report to the board of directors of the Wabash Company, with an account of their financial transactions, the committee included their receipts from sales of the stock and bonds of the terminal company, and the directors approved the account, complainant Wabash Railway Company is estopped from denying that Hubbell and Dodge acquired a substantial and valuable interest in the terminal company. We deem it clear, however, that the intent of the purchasing committee, known and assented to by Hubbell and Dodge at the time, was merely to enable the latter to sell the three-eighths interest to some railroad company capable of participating in the use of the terminal Whether consistently with their fiduciary relations or not, they took advantage of this opportunity in the following year, when the Northern and Northwestern companies were consolidated and they sold to the consolidated company the stock in question, apparently and presumably at a profit over and above what they paid the purchasing committee for it. There is no foundation for the suggested estoppel.\n The title now asserted by the Messrs. Hubbell to five-eighths of the terminal company stock was derived not directly from the Wabash purchasing committee, but from \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 215]\n\u00a0\n the consolidated Northern and Western company. That company, in addition to the three-eights transferred to it by Hubbell and Dodge, had the two quarter-interests originally owned by those companies, making seven-eights in all. In October, 1893, the consolidated company pledged to F. M. Hubbell & Son five-eighths of the terminal company stock (2,500 shares) as security for a debt. The stock was transferred to the Hubbell firm on the books at that time, and so remained down to the institution of this suit, except as to five 'qualifying shares' placed in the names of individuals but controlled by the firm. On January 29, 1894, the indebtedness was settled between the directors of the consolidated company and the Messrs. Hubbell upon terms that included a purchase by the latter of the 2,500 shares of terminal company stock at ten per centum of its par value. Passing for the moment certain special grounds of attack upon the title they thus acquired to these shares, it is obvious that they took them subject to all qualifications arising out of the trust that pertained to the property and franchises of the terminal company.\n The quarter interest in the terminal company stock retained by the consolidated company afterwards passed from it to the complainant Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway Company, which acquired at the same time the Northern and Northwestern lines. That company took with notice of the claim of the Hubbells to a five-eighths interest; but this does not estop it from disputing the validity of their claim, nor from setting up, as in this suit, whatever beneficial participation in the trust respecting the terminal property may be incident to its ownership of one-fourth of the stock of the terminal company together with connecting lines of railroad, and asking for relief against any inequitable use by the Hubbells of the five-eighths interest claimed by them.\n As to the amendments to the articles of incorporation: These are alleged to have been adopted at a meeting of \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 216]\n\u00a0\n the stockholders of the terminal company held April 8, 1890. Their purport was, briefly, to omit from the articles the copy of the contract of 1882 recited therein, the declaration that the powers exercised by the company should be in accordance with the terms and spirit of that contract, and the requirement that assent in writing of the proprietary companies should be necessary before any disposition of the franchises of the terminal company should be made; to set aside previous proceedings respecting the amount of capital stock to be issued to the proprietary companies and provide for the distribution of a much decreased amount ($400,000 par, instead of $2,000,000) but in the same proportions as before, the remaining capital stock ($1,600,000 par) to be issued only by resolution of the stockholders adopted by vote of more than seven-eighths of all the stock theretofore issued; and to eliminate the former method of selecting directors and provide that they should be elected by the stockholders, but that it should require the votes of more than seven-eighths of all the stock to elect a director, and that as to all matters except the ordinary operation of the property the directors could act only upon unanimous vote of the eight members of the board. One of the articles adopted purported to repeal, strike out, and expunge the proceedings of a stockholders' meeting held December 10, 1884, at which the original articles of incorporation were adopted.\n It is plain enough, and is conceded, that the corporation could not, by merely altering its own internal organization, affect the interests of its cestuis que trustent. It is as evidence of a modification of the agreement between the stockholders of the terminal company-themselves beneficiaries of the trust-that the amendments are invoked. So regarding them, the question is, by what authority and with what intent were they adopted? The stockholders' meeting was attended by six individuals ( including the two Hubbells), and two others by proxy, each of \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 217]\n\u00a0\n whom assumed to represent, and in a general sense did represent, one or the other of the three proprietary companies. F. M. Hubbell himself was president of the Northwestern Company and assumed to represent it. Others present were the vice president of the Northern and the president of the St. Louis Companies. The evidence fails to show that those present had express authority to act for the proprietary companies in amending the articles; and action of this kind-materially affecting the property interests of the three companies in a matter so vital as the ownership and control of an important terminal-was so far out of the usual or ordinary course of business that authority to represent their corporations in assenting to it was not to be implied as coming within the general scope of their duties. Nor did either of the proprietary companies, by any formal corporate action, accept or ratify the amendments.\n Moreover, it affirmatively appears, and both courts below in effect found, that there was no actual intent on the part of any of the parties concerned to affect the substantial rights or equities of the proprietary companies, or to terminate, repudiate, or substantially modify the trust respecting the terminal property. It does appear that some of those active in proposing the amendments, and assuming to act for the proprietary companies in assenting to them (there is a question whether they actually were adopted by a proper vote of the stockholders, but we do not go into this), were under the impression that the contract of 1882, recited in the articles of incorporation, already had been abrogated and the trust set aside by the issuance of the terminal company's bonds and apportionment of the stock to the proprietary companies in payment for the property conveyed and by the making of deeds absolute in form; that both in respect to the ownership of the property and the management of it under the contract of 1889 the original arrangement had been abandoned; and \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 218]\n\u00a0\n that it was desirable to amend the articles so as to make them conform to the situation actually existing.\n Clearly, this was a mistaken impression, as will appear from what we have said. It was a mistake not indeed as to any mere matter of fact, nor on the other hand as to any pure question of law, but rather as to the existing legal rights, interests, and relations of the parties resulting from antecedent transactions. Whether it was such a mistake as to furnish ground for a cancellation of the amendments in equity, is a question into which we need not enter. See Snell v. Insurance Co., \n98 U.S. 85\n, 90; Griswold v. Hazard, \n141 \nU.S. 260, 284\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 972, 999; Utermehle v. Norment, \n197 \nU.S. 40, 56\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 291, 3 Ann. Cas. 520; Philippine Sugar Co. v. Philippine Islands, \n247 \nU.S. 385, 389\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 513; Pom. Eq. Jur.  841-849. For the fact that those who assumed to act for the proprietary companies in assenting to the amendments were mistaken as to the existing legal situation, so that the amendments, if given effect according to their terms, instead of bringing the articles into conformity with the situation already actually existing, would materially change the situation to the disadvantage of the proprietary companies by putting an end to an important trust contrary to their actual intent as parties beneficially interested, is a cogent reason for holding as we do that authority on the part of agents to assent to such amendments is not to be implied where it was out of the ordinary course of business and express authority was not conferred.\n In support of the contention that the terminal property was not subject to any trust either before or after the amendments, defendants cite a series of contracts in which the terminal company asserted its ownership without qualification, and of conveyances, mortgages, etc., by the proprietary companies recognizing the legal title of the terminal company to its property and asserting in themselves only a title to shares in the terminal company. But when a trust is once established and acknowledged it does \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 219]\n\u00a0\n not need to be constantly reiterated or confessed. None of the instruments referred to is in anywise inconsistent with the trust, the contracts of the terminal company were made in the very course of its administration of the trust, and the mortgages and coveyances of the proprietary companies dealt with legal titles only, their equitable interests in the terminal passing without mention as incidental to their ownership of the stock together with the connecting lines.\n The majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals held that the control of the proprietary companies was relinquished by reason of the amendments and the conduct of the parties at the time and thereafter, upon this theory: That although the amendments were neither previously authorized nor afterwards formally accepted or ratified by the three companies, yet since their executive officers were aware of and approved the action of the meeting; since Hubbell was encouraged to purchase the bonds and stock, the value of the stock being wholly prospective; since after the amendments the stock of the terminal company was issued in accordance therewith and directors elected by the new method, the railroads making no attempt to exercise their right of naming directors in certain proportions as before; since for 17 years the railroads acted, as it seemed to the court, in harmony with the amended articles, not questioning their validity until this suit was commenced-they could not, after such delay, enforce their rights in a court of equity against defendants who to their knowledge had acted upon the belief that such rights did not exist, and had acquired and held property which had largely increased in value in the interval. It was held that this result had come to pass although the railroads never had intended it; that the sale of a part of the Wabash stock by the purchasing committee to Hubbell and Dodge, then influential in the two other roads, would seem at the time a mere rearrangement of the interests of \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 220]\n\u00a0\n the three companies in the terminal company; but that the effect of the amendments was a severance of the control of the roads over the terminal company, and subsequent events confirmed this, so that when the Hubbells disposed of their interests in the Northern and Northwestern to the Milwaukee, retaining for themselves a majority of the terminal holdings, the result was that the railroads themselves had grandually let slip that exclusive ownership and control which at the beginning they had so much valued and so carefully guarded.\n Convinced that the relation of the parties was fiduciary and not merely contractual, we are unable to accept the view thus outlined. It would require a clear case to warrant a court of equity in declaring that the trustees of an express trust, in the very course of their administration of the trust, had acquired a dominant interest in the trust property and in effect a discharge of the trust, through mere inattention or even negligence-not raising an estoppel or amounting to laches-on the part of the parties beneficially interested, or of their executive officers. Conduct merely equivocal, or apparently inconsistent with a vigilant insistence upon the obligations of the trustee, is not sufficient to discharge a trust. The cestui que trust is entitled to rely upon the fidelity of the trustee, until plainly put on guard against him. And the trustee is at all times disabled from making a profit for himself out of any dealings in the trust property without the express consent of the cestui que trust.\n Nothing appears to create an estoppel against complainants. Neither they nor their predecessors have misled defendants to their disadvantage. The purchasing committee accepted a money consideration from Hubbell and Dodge for the transfer of a block of stock. But the purchasers had more complete and intimate knowledge of the situation than the committee had, and were specially put on notice, as the correspondence shows. Indeed, their \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 221]\n\u00a0\n knowledge of the true nature and office of the terminal company constituted adequate notice. And again, when the Messrs. Hubbell reacquired the same three-eighths with an additional one-quarter interest from the consolidated Northern and Western Company, they were as before chargeable with full notice of all the facts out of which the equities of complainants arise.\n The question of laches presents more difficulty; but after mature consideration we are convinced that it must be resolved in favor of complainants. Acquiescence by the executive officers of the proprietary companies in the changed situation resulting from the amendments of April 8, 1890, is stressed by counsel for defendants, as it was in the majority opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals; it being pointed out that after the amendments directors were elected in in the new mode, and that in an agreement of ratification dated July 31, 1897, made for the purpose of giving recognition to the participation of the Wabash and of the consolidated Northern and Western Company in the obligations of the 1889 agreement, it was declared that so much of that agreement as related to the issuance and distribution of the capital stock of the terminal company was no longer binding, and the stock was held in specified proportions, including 'F. M. Hubbell & Son, 2,500 shares.' This was a recognition of their status as de facto stockholders, but not a concession that the fiduciary character of the terminal company had been changed, or that the stock possessed any quality or value other than was consistent with the nature and terms of the trust. The parties acted in harmony with the amended articles so far as the internal organization of the company was concerned, but the company remained in possession of the property as before and continued to manage it in accordance with the terms of the agreement of 1889. Such possession was as consistent with a continued recognition of the trust as with the opposite; and it does not appear \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 222]\n\u00a0\n that at any time until shortly before the bill was filed defendants contended that the amendments amounted to an express repudiation of the trust or that the terminal company would be free from obligation at the expiration of the agreement. Prior to this there had been a difference about the disposition of the 'surplus earnings,' but this was no more than a question about the proper construction of the working agreement.\n It seems to us the court below attributed undue weight to the conduct of the executive officers of the proprietary companies indicating acquiescence in a supposedly changed situation resulting from the amended articles. It would not be surprising if occasionally there was a failure to appreciate fully and accurately the rights and obligations growing out of the trust. But the Messrs. Hubbell, because of their fiduciary relation, are estopped from laying hold of the incautious, negligent or mistaken acts of the executive officers as a ground on which to build up a profit or advantage for themselves at the expense of the proprietary roads which were their cestuis que trustent.\n Upon the whole case, it is our conclusion that the trust with respect to the terminal property continues substantially as it was established at the incorporation of the terminal company; that this company holds all its property and franchises-whether conveyed to it at the beginning or acquired since-in trust for the purpose of carrying out, in substance, the terms and spirit of the contract of January 2, 1882, with such minor changes as have been agreed upon since, and is bound to exercise all its powers (including its power to renew the corporate charter) in furtherance of the trust; that the amendments of April 8, 1890, were unauthorized by the proprietary companies and had no effect in discharging or modifying the trust; that complainants are the sole beneficial owners of the property and franchises of the terminal company, and they and their successors and assigns, and such other \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 223]\n\u00a0\n railroad companies owning or operating lines of railroad extending to or near Des Moines as may be admitted to a proprietary interest by consent of complainants and their successors and assigns, are (as between the present parties and their successors) entitled to the sole beneficial use of the terminal property upon paying the cost of the terminal service, including interest upon the mortgage debt and other proper charges, after crediting all revenues derived from other sources, and without profit to the terminal company; and that from and after the expiration of the 1889 agreement complainants were and are entitled to have a similar working arrangement renewed from time to time perpetually, its specific terms to be agreed upon between themselves, or judicially ascertained if they are unable to agree.\n Complainants are entitled to a decree establishing the trust, with all appropriate incidental relief. We do not attempt to lay down the particular provisions of the decree. These may be settled by the District Court upon the going down of the mandate.\n To consider, next, the status of the Hubbell stock: The title acquired by them from the consolidated company is attacked by the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul on the ground that it was acquired by inequitable means, the Hubbells being at the time in control of the board of directors. It is attacked by the Wabash on the ground that the consolidated company could not in equity pass the stock to the Hubbells and thus impair the interest in the terminal company then held by the St. Louis Company, to which the Wabash has succeeded. We have not found it necessary to consider whether these contentions ought to be sustained as independent grounds of substantive relief, or to what extent they would be affected by the agreement of July 31, 1897, in which the consolidated and the Wabash Companies apparently gave recognition to the ownership of the stock by the Hubbells.\n We pass this, because convinced that as incidental to the \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 224]\n\u00a0\n principal relief granted, and necessary to give full effect to it, complainants are entitled upon equitable terms to have the Hubbell shares ( including all 'qualifying shares' controlled by them) surrendered for cancellation. Our reasons, briefly, are as follows: The issuance of the stock to the Messrs. Hubbell, and the clause of the 1897 agreement relating to it, already have been considered with other evidence cited by defendants to show an assent to or acquiescence in a modification or abandonment of the trust, and are found insufficient for the purpose. Hence this stock, being like all other stock of the terminal company subordinate to the trust that dominates all its property and franchises, does not represent in the hands of the Hubbells any property interest that they are entitled to set up as against the proprietary companies. When they acquired it, and at all other times material, they themselves were and still are acting in a fiduciary relation to the trust; hence they cannot be heard to assert any right in the stock that is inconsistent with the trust. Manifestly it would be inequitable for them to sell it to a bona fide purchaser who might claim (even though unsuccessfully) to hold it exempt from the trust. They may have expected to sell it at a profit to one of the proprietary companies, or with their consent to an outside company or companies qualified to participate in the beneficial use of the terminal property under the trust. But, because of their fiduciary character, they are debarred in equity from trafficking in the trust property in this or any other way without the express consent of the beneficiaries; they would be bound to account for any profit that might accrue; and any seeming consent on the part of the beneficiaries to waive such profit in advance, not amounting to a termination of the fiduciary relation, is in its nature revocable. The Hubbell stock, therefore, representing no legitimate proprietary interest as against complainants, serves merely to evidence a voting power and to qualify its holders to act as directors \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 225]\n\u00a0\n and officers of the terminal company; in short, to participate in a fiduciary employment, without profit beyond compensation for the value of the services rendered. But complainants, being the sole present beneficiaries of the trust and equitable owners of the terminal property, are entitled equity to a controlling voice in the choice of directors, and especially to have the management of the trustee company, now and hereafter, freed from the domination of a stock interest that represents no property-interest in the concerns of the trust. To guard against such alien control and at the same time prevent the danger of the Hubbell stock getting into the hands of bona fide holders who might set up rights under it which the present holders are debarred in equity from asserting-in short, to avoid undue jeopardy to the trust-complainants are entitled to have this stock surrendered, retired and canceled, and, until surrendered, to an injunction against any sale, assignment, or transfer of it or any part of it, and against the exercise of any voting power thereon; but upon terms that complainants shall repay to the Messrs. Hubbell the amount they paid to the consolidated Northern and Western Company for it, viz. $25,000, with interest thereon from January 29, 1894. How this should be apportioned, as between complainants, has not been discussed. It may be settled by the District Court.\n The issue as to the surplus earnings relates to a considerable accumulation of moneys received by the terminal company from sources outside the proprietary companies. Possibly it may have become a moot question, in view of the result we have reached upon the main matter; but as this is not altogether clear we will dispose of the issue as raised. The agreement of 1889 provided that in making up the net cost of maintenance and operation chargeable to the proprietary lines on a wheelage basis, there should be deducted 'the amount if any which other railway companies may be under obligation to pay by virtue of con tracts \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 226]\n\u00a0\n for the use of said property or parts thereof.' In the course of time, the terminal company received not only payments from outside railroad companies under contracts technically for participation in the use of the terminal property-which have been credited to complainants and their predecessors according to their wheelage-but, in addition, substantial sums from railroad companies and others for switching and other terminal services and for rent of portions of the property and privileges thereon. Receipts of the latter character were called 'surplus earnings.' For a period of nearly two years after the making of the 1889 agreement they were included in the credits given to the proprietary companies. This was done at first by the accounting officers of the terminal company under the general direction of its president and executive committee. In February, 1891, the practice was approved by action of the board of directors. About a year later the board resolved that until its further action sums received as rents of real estate and all switching charges should not be thus credited, but should be used as a cash capital 'with which to purchase supplies and pay current bills which come in before it receives its monthly revenue from the tenant companies.' Thereafter the surplus revenues were not again credited to the proprietary companies.\n We concur in the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals that by the fair construction of the 1889 agreement and the practical construction placed upon it by the parties at the beginning-a construction entirely consonant with the terms of the trust-complainants and their predecessors were entitled to credit for the surplus earnings as they accrued, each company to a share proportioned to its wheelage, and that the 1897 contract did not change this. It was decreed that these earnings belonged to complainants, and that there should be an accounting to ascertain the part due to each upon a wheelage basis. As to this the only question that occurs to us is whether the accounting \n\n[254 U.S. 196, 227]\n\u00a0\n should include sums that have been appropriated out of these earnings and devoted to capital expenditures for acquiring additional property and for permanent improvements-sometimes, apparently, with approval of complainants or their predecessors, sometimes without. This would hardly seem to be of serious consequence in view of the result we have reached upon the main issue. It is chiefly of interest to complainants; but they have not argued the question, declaring indeed that the entire controversy as to the surplus earnings would be material only should this court decide that complainants had no proprietary interest in the terminal company.\n Defendants have assigned error to so much of the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals as awards the surplus earnings to complainants, but have not furnished data enabling us to draw an accurate line between those that were and those that were not disbursed for permanent improvements, or between those disbursements that were approved and those that were not. Unaided by counsel we hardly could be expected to unravel the somewhat obscure evidence bearing upon these points. We must therefore content ourselves with simply affirming that portion of the decree which relates to the surplus profits.\n The main portion of the decree as attacked by complainants must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n As to costs, the decree of the courts below apportioned them one-half to complainants and one-half to the terminal company. We leave this disposition undisturbed. The entire costs in this court should be paid by defendants Frederick M. Hubbell and Frederick C. Hubbell. \n No. 66.\n Decree reversed.\n No. 67. Decree affirmed.\n Cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, M. & ST. P. RY. CO. v. MCCAULL-DINSMORE CO.(1920)\nNo. 628\nArgued: Decided: May 17, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 97, 98]\n\u00a0\n Mr. O. W. Dynes, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. J. O. P. Wheelwright, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action for the loss of grain belonging to the plaintiff and delivered on November 17, 1915, to the defendant, the petitioner, in Montana, for transportation to Omaha, Nebraska. The grain was shipped under the uniform bill of lading, part of the tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, by which it was provided that 'the amount of any loss or damage for which any carrier is liable shall be computed on the basis of the value of the property at the place and time of shipment under this bill of lading, including freight charges, if paid.' The petitioner has paid $1,200.48, being the amount of the loss so computed, but the value of the grain at the place of destination at the time when it should have been delivered, with interest, less freight charges, was $1, 422.11. The plaintiff claimed the difference between the two sums of the ground that the Cummins Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act made the above stipulation void. The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiff, 252 Fed. 664, and the judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 260 Fed. 835. \n\n[253 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n The Cummins Amendment Act of March 4, 1915, c. 176, 38 Stat. 1196 ( Comp. St.  8604a), provides that the carriers affected by the Act shall issue a bill of lading and shall be liable to the lawful holder of it 'for any loss, damage, or injury to such property ... and no contract, receipt, rule, regulation, or other limitation of any character whatsoever, shall exempt such common carrier ... from the liability hereby imposed' and further that the carrier 'shall be liable ... for the full actual loss, damage, or injury ... notwithstanding any limitation of liability or limitation of the amount or recovery or representation or agreement as to value in any such receipt or bill of lading, or in any contract, rule, regulation, or in any tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission; and any such limitation, without respect to the manner or form in which it is sought to be made is hereby declared to be unlawful and void.' Before the passage of this amendment the Interstate Commerce Commission had upheld the clause in the bill of lading as in no way limiting the carriers' liability to less than the value of the goods, but merely offering the most convenient way of finding the value. Shaffer v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., 21 I. C. C. 8, 12. In a subsequent report upon the amendment it considered that the clause was still valid and not forbidden by the law. 33 I. C. C. 682, 693. The argument for the petitioner suggests that courts are bound by the Commission's determination that the rule is a reasonable one. But the question is of the meaning of a statute and upon that, of course, the courts must decide for themselves.\n We appreciate the convenience of the stipulation in the bill of lading and the arguments urged in its favor. We understand that it does not necessarily prevent a recovery of the full actual loss, and that it the price of wheat had gone down the carrier might have had to pay more under this contract than by the common law rule. But the \n\n[253 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n question is how the contract operates upon this case. In this case it does prevent a recovery of the full actual loss, if it is enforced. The rule of the common law is not an arbitrary fiat but an embodiment of the plain fact that the actual loss caused by breach of a contract is the loss of what the contractee would have had if the contract had been performed, less the proper deductions, which have been made and are not in question here. It seems to us, therefore, that the decision below was right, and as, in our opinion, the conclusion is required by the statute, neither the convenience of the clause, nor any argument based upon the history of the statute or upon the policy of the later Act of August 9, 1916, c. 301, 39 Stat. 441 (Comp. St.  8592, 8604a) can prevail against what we understand to be the meaning of the words. Those words seem not only to indicate a broad general purpose but to apply specifically to this very case.\n Judgment affirmed.\n The Chief Justice dissents for the reasons stated by the Interstate Commerce Commission. [100-Continued]\n Note.-The following is the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission, as found in 33 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 683: By the Commission:\n For many years, if not, indeed, from the origin of railroad transportation in this country, common carriers by railroad have sought, by provisions in shipping contracts, bills of lading, tariff publications, etc., to limit their common-law liability, not only as insurers against loss or damage to property received by them for transportation, but also as tort-feasors for loss or damage caused by their negligence. One method was by a so-called release, executed by shipper and carrier, and intended to be effective, whether the loss or damage was due to negligence of the carrier or to other causes. The courts in different jurisdictions have differed as to the validity of such limitations and they have been the subject of legislation in some of the states.\n By adoption of the Carmack Amendment, so called, to the act to regulate commerce, approved June 29, 1906, the Congress provided that a common carrier receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state should issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor and be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier to which such property might be delivered, or over whose lines such property might pass, and declared that no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation should exempt such common carrier from the liability thereby imposed. It was provided that nothing in that amendment should deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he had at that time under existing law.\n Since that time, beginning in 1913, with Adams Express Co. v. Croninger, \n226 U.S. 491\n, the Supreme Court of the United States has decided in a number of cases, all of which followed Hart v. P. R. R., \n112 U.S. 331\n, that where the shipper has his choice of two rates, the higher carrying unlimited carrier's liability, and in 'a fair, just, and reasonable agreement' declares or agrees that the value of his shipment is a certain sum, and thereby secures a reduced transportation rate, he is bound by that declaration or agreement, estopped from claiming or recovering more than that value in case of loss of or damage to the property, and conclusively presumed to have known the governing tariff.\n On March 4, 1915, the following act, amendatory of the act to regulate commerce, and hereinafter called the Cummins Amendment, was approved:\n'Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, that so much of section seven of an act entitled 'An act to amend an act entitled 'An act to regulate commerce,' approved February fourth, eighteen hundred and eighty- seven, and all acts amendatory thereof, and to enlarge the powers of the Interstate Commerce Commission,' approved June w enty-ninth, nineteen hundred and six, as [100-Continued.]\n\nreads as follows, to wit:\n\"That any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company receiving property for transportation from a point in one state to a point in another state shall issue a receipt or a bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company to which such property may be delivered, or over whose line or lines such property may pass, and no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation shall exempt such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed: Provided, that nothing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under existing law,' be, and the same is hereby, amended so as to read as follows, to wit:\n\n\"That any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company subject to the provisions of this act receiving property for transportation from a point in one state or territory or the District of Columbia to a point in another state, territory, District of Columbia, or from any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign country shall issue a receipt or bill of lading therefor, and shall be liable to the lawful holder thereof for any loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any common carrier, railroad, or transportation company to which such property may be delivered or over whose line or lines such property may pass within the United States or within an adjacent foreign country when transported on a through bill of lading, and no contract, receipt, rule, regulation, or other limitation of any character whatsoever, shall exempt such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company from the liability hereby imposed; and any such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company so receiving property for transportation from a point in one state, territory, or the District of Columbia to a point in another state or territory, or from a point in a state or territory to a point in the District of Columbia, or from any point in the United States to a point in an adjacent foreign country, or for transportation wholly within a territory shall be liable to the lawful holder of said receipt or bill of lading or to any party entitled to recover thereon, whether such receipt or bill of lading has been issued or not, for the full actual loss, damage, or injury to such property caused by it or by any such common carrier, railroad, or transportation company to which such property may be delivered or over whose line or lines such property may pass within the United States or within an adjacent foreign country when transported on a through bill of lading, notwithstanding any limitation of liability or limitation of the amount of recovery or representation or agreement as to value in any such receipt or bill of lading, or in any contract, rule, regulation, or in any tariff filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission; and any such limitation, without respect to the manner or form in which it is sought to be made is hereby declared to be unlawful and void: Provided, however, that if the goods are hidden from view by wrapping, boxing, or other means, and the carrier is not notified as to the character of the goods, the carrier may require the shipper to specifically state in writing the value of the goods, and the carrier shall not be liable beyond the amount so specifically stated, in which case the Interstate Commerce Commission may establish and maintain rates for transportation, dependent upon the value of the property shipped as specifically stated in writing by the shipper. Such rates shall be published as are other rate schedules: Provided further, that nothing in this section shall deprive any holder of such receipt or bill of lading of any remedy or right of action which he has under the existing law: Provided further, that it shall be unlawful for n y such common carrier to provide by rule, contract, regulation, or otherwise a shorter period for giving notice of claims than ninety days and for the filing of claims for a shorter period than four months, and for the institution of suits than two years: Provided, however, that if the loss, damage, or injury complained of was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery.' [100-Continued.]\n\n'Sec. 2. That this act shall take effect and be in force from ninety days after its passage.' Many widely varying or diametrically opposed ideas have been expressed as to the effect of this amendment and as to what will be the lawful rates under present tariffs when it becomes effective on June 2, 1915. The commission has been urged to some expression in the premises. It has held a hearing on this subject, and the questions there discussed have been argued on briefs. From the best information it has been possible to obtain and the consideration it has been possible to give this matter within the limited time available, the commission expresses tentatively the views hereinafter indicated.\n\n The greater part of the freight transported moves under a bill of lading, which constitutes a receipt for the property and a contract for its carriage. Efforts have been made from time to time to secure the adoption and use by all carriers of a uniform bill of lading, but no such effort has been entirely successful. Several years ago protracted effort of that kind, assisted in so far as seemed appropriate by the commission, culminated in substantial agreement among the representatives of the shippers and the representatives of the carriers, excepting those in the Southern classification territory, as to the terms and conditions of what was then styled and has since been known as the uniform bill of lading. The commission gave its tentative approval and recommended its use, and since that time it has been in use except in the Southern territory mentioned, where a somewhat different bill of lading, commonly called the standard bill of lading, has been and is in use.\n The official classification, which, speaking generally, applies in the territory east of the Mississippi river and north of the Ohio and Potomac rivers, contains a rule that, except as otherwise provided, when property is transported subject to the provisions of that classification the acceptance and use of the uniform bill of lading, export bill of lading, uniform live stock contract, and certain contracts with men in charge of shipments, respectively, are required. The uniform bill of lading and the other bills of lading or contracts are set out in full in the classification.\n Another rule is that in order that the consignor may have the option of shipping subject to the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading, or under the liability imposed upon common carriers by the common law and the federal and state statutes applicable thereto, different rates and different forms of bills of lading are provided, to be used at the election of the shipper. Under this rule, unless it is otherwise provided in the classification, property will be carried at the lower rates specified if shipped subject to all the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading. Property carried not subject to all the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading is to be carried at the carrier's liability, limited only as provided by common law and by the laws of the United States and of the several states in so far as they apply, but subject to the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading in so far as they are not inconsistent with such common carrier's liability, and in such instances a rate 10 per cent. higher, subject to a minimum increase of 1 cent per 100 pounds, will be charged. It is provided that if consignor elects not to accept all the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading he shall so notify the agent of the carre r at the time his property is delivered for shipment, and if he does not give such notice it will be understood that he desires the property carried subject to the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading in order to secure the lower rate or, as it is termed in the classification, 'the reduced rate.' If the shipper notifies the agent of the initial carrier that he elects not to accept all the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading, the agent must print, write, or stamp upon the bill of lading a provision that in consideration of the higher rate charged the property will be carried at the carrier's liability, limited only as provided by law, but subject to the terms and conditions of the uniform bill of lading in so far as they are not inconsistent with such common carrier's liability. [100-Continued.]\n The Western classification, which, speaking generally, applies in all of the territory west of the Mississippi river and Lake Michigan, contains a rule that, except as otherwise provided therein, when property is transported subject to the provisions of the Western classification the acceptance and use of the uniform bill of lading is required. It also contains additional provisions substantially like those cited from the official classification. All of the terms of the uniform bill of lading are printed in the classification, but the live stock contract form does not so appear. The live stock ratings are stated to be based upon values declared by shippers, not exceeding certain stated values 'under contract.'\n The Southern classification, which, speaking in general, applies in the territory east of the Mississippi and south of the Ohio and Potomac rivers, contains a rule that the reduced rates specified in the classification will apply only on property shipped subject to the conditions of the carrier's bill of lading, and that property carried not subject to the conditions of the carrier's bill of lading will be at the carrier's liability, limited only as provided by common law and by the laws of the United States and of the several states in so far as they apply. It provides that property thus carried will be charged 10 per cent. higher, subject to a minimum increase of 1 cent per 100 pounds, than if shipped subject to the conditions of the carrier's bill of lading. The classification does not contain the terms of the carrier's bill of lading, and, with one or two individual exceptions, the terms thereof are not filed with the commission as a tariff publication or rate schedule. The classification provides that the rates on live stock will apply when the declared value does not exceed certain values therein stated and that for each increase of 100 per cent. Or fraction thereof in the declared value there shall be an increase of 20 per cent. in the rate. The classification does not contain any requirement that the live stock contract must be used, but it does provide that agents must not issue more than one live stock contract on any one shipment. Some of the tariffs of the individual carriers in this territory contain released rates applicable to shipments of live stock which are conditioned upon certain declared valuations and upon shipments being made under the live stock contract, and such tariffs provide that higher rates will apply when shipments are not so made. The terms of the live stock contract are not incorporated in the tariffs and, with one or two individual exceptions, they are not filed with the commission as a tariff publication.\n It is perfectly plain that the purpose of this law is, except as otherwise provided therein, to invalidate all limitations of carrier's liability for loss, damage, or injury to property transported caused by the initial carrier or by another carrier to which it may be delivered or which may participate in transporting it. The law does not specifically say that attempts so to limit the carrier's liability shall not be resorted to but it declares them to be invalid and unlawful wherever found and in whatever guise they may appear. Obviously, therefore, neither the bil  of lading or other contracts for carriage, or classifications or rate schedules of the carriers, should contain any provisions which are so declared to be unlawful and void. Some of the carriers insist that if no changes are made in their classifications and other tariff publications the lower rates, which are conditioned upon the use of the bills of lading now in use, will be automatically canceled and the higher rates, based upon the carrier's liability, will be the only lawful rates from and after the date upon which the law in question becomes effective. Some of the shippers insist that if no changes are made in the classifications or tariff publications, the provisions for limitation of carrier's liability will, when the new law becomes effective, be unlawful and void, and the carriers will thereupon have two sets of rates, both applicable under like conditions, and that of the two shippers will be entitled to the lower.\n The official classification roads have announced the purpose of making certain changes in the terms of their bill of lading, other contracts of carriage, and classification and rate schedules, in the light of the provisions of the new law. They say that whether or not they will continue to maintain rates based upon the value of the property is a matter for further [100-Continued.]\nconsideration by their traffic officers. They express the opinion that certain of these changes will impose upon them liabilities not heretofore borne and consequent loss of revenue, and reserve the right to assert at the proper time a claim for some increase in rates on account thereof.\n The Southern lines announced their purpose of making certain changes in their contracts, classification, and rate schedules which would exempt certain heavy commodities moving in large quantities and said to constitute about 70 per cent. of their traffic from any immediate increases in rates on account of the amended law, and to incorporate in the classification a provision that as to the remainder of the traffic the rates contained in schedules governed by the classification would be increased 5 per cent. upon the date when the new law becomes effective. That method of changing rates would be in direct opposition to the commission's regulations governing the construction of tariffs, which are by the act given full force of law. The Southern lines urge that the new law will produce conditions which furnish substantial reasons for allowing them additional revenue, and that it is physically impossible, except by the method which they propose, to issue any tariff publications prior to June 2 which will secure that additional revenue. They say that the tariff regulations are prescribed by the commission, and that it is within its power to modify them at any time, and therefore the question of whether or not the carriers should be permitted to make effective the proposed plan is wholly within the commission's discretion to determine. They argue that if nothing is done the 10 per cent. higher rates will automatically become effective, which they do not desire, and that the course proposed by them is the only alternative to the injustice of their being compelled to sustain the burdens imposed by the new legislation without means for recouping the losses which they will suffer.\n The commission has made no investigation upon which a judgment as to the cost of and proper compensation for additional risk could be based. The commission has no right to assume that it would be 5 per cent. of the rates upon 30 per cent. of the carriers' traffic, or that it would be any given per cent. Upon all of the traffic. Obviously there can be no propriety in attaching to one commodity unreasonable rates for the purpose of compensating a carrier for a risk attaching to it in the transportation of another commodity, and it is admitted that the carriers cannot make any accurate statement in advance as to the added cost, if any, of the increased liability.\n With regard to rates on shipments of live stock, the Southern carriers announced at the hearing their purpose to provide that the present rates would apply on shipments declared to be of value not exceeding that now stated as limitation of the carrier's liability, and to increase the rates 20 per cent. for each 100 per cent. increase in the declared value of the live stock. By letter submitted since the hearing they announce the purpose to provide for an increase of 5 per cent. in the rate for each increase of 100 per cent., or fraction thereof, in the declared value.\n By a still later letter the Southern classification roads advise that, in view of the numerous and irreconcilable complications which have developed, and in order to remove all doubt as to the continuance of existing rates after the amendment to the law becomes effective, they have decided to supersede their present classification rule by one which will recite that the rates governed by the classification will apply only on property shipped subject to the conditions of the carrier's bill of lading in use on and after the effective date of the amended law, and, except as otherwise provided in the classification, all interstate rates in effect on June 2, 1915, will continue in force, disregarding provisions in tariffs, classifications, and exception sheets which limit the liability of carriers, and to continue a provision that property carried not subject to the terms and conditions of the carriers' bill of lading will be at carriers' liability, limited only by the common law and the laws of the United States and of the several states, in so far as they may apply, and property so carried will be subject to rates 10 per cent. higher than those shown in the tariffs. [100-Continued.]\n The Western classification roads, in the main, take a position substantially like that taken by the official classification roads. Their representatives expressed to the committees of Congress the view that the enactment of the amendment in question would, by striking from the uniform bill of lading vital provisions, automatically throw the roads back upon their common-law liability and the increased rates. They admit that a 10 per cent. increase in rates cannot be justified. They think that the increased liability will justify some increase in rates, but emphatically disclaim any disposition to take advantage of a technical opportunity to mulct the shipping public. They are of opinion that they still have the right to provide rates upon live stock dependent upon the declared value of the stock, and that a shipper who misstates the true value of his shipment is guilty of violation of section 10 of the act, just as he would be if he misstated the commodity shipped. They suggest that their present rule, which provides in general for an increase of 10 per cent. in the rate for each 100 per cent. of increase in the declared valuation, is probably too high; that an increase of 5 per cent. in the rate for each 100 per cent. increase in the value, or of 3 per cent. in the rate for each increase of 50 per cent. in the value, would be a more equitable rule, and that this question is involved in a case soon to be submitted to the commission. They, like the Eastern roads, have numerous commodity rates based upon valuation, and they think they may lawfully continue that practice. They have, however, not had opportunity since this bill was enacted to formulate in detail the changes which they think necessary and proper.\n From the best information that can be gathered from testimony that has been submitted in various cases, it appears that prior to 1913 the limited liability provisions contained in the shipping contracts, classifications, and rate schedules were very generally disregarded in the settlement of loss and damage claims, especially in the Western classification territory. It seems, therefore, that to a very large extent at least, despite the limitations of liability stated in the contracts and schedules, full value was quite generally recognized in the settlement of claims. After the Supreme Court decided the Croninger Case, supra, in 1913, the provisions of the contracts and rat schedules in this and other particulars were recognized as lawfully binding upon carriers and shippers alike, and the policy followed was correspondingly changed. It is pointed out that prior to 1906 many of these limitations of liability were not contained in the shipping contracts and rate schedules; that in 1906 they were incorporated therein, but were largely ignored until 1913; that in 1913 the policy was generally adopted of endeavoring to enforce the limited liability provisions; and that neither in 1906 nor in 1913 was say change in the rates undertaken because of the limited liability. It is argued that, inasmuch as no reduction in rates was made when the limited liability provisions were established, or when they were sustained as lawful by the Supreme Court of the United States, there is no justification for an increase in rates now that the liability conditions are restored to substantially what they were prior to 1906. Limitations of liabibility have been incorporated in live stock shipment contracts for many years, but, as has been said, it appears that at least in the territory where there is the greatest movement of live stock those limitations were generally disregarded in settlement of claims. The so-called uniform bill of lading, which has been in use in official and Western classification territories, contains, and has contained, a provision that claims for loss or damage must be presented to the carrier within four months, but until the Croninger Case, supra, was decided by the Supreme Court no effort was made by the carriers generally to enforce or to observe that provision. After the Croninger Case was decided the carriers adopted an entirely different course, and took the position that this provision was in the bill of lading, the terms of the bill of lading were in the rate schedules, and therefore it was unlawful to depart from that requirement. This created a general controversy, and the sudden change from ignoring a rule to literally enforcing it necessarily created multitudes of unjust discriminations. The question was presented to and considered by the commission, and as the fair and only means of composing the situation and avoiding endless controversy and litigation the commission issued its report. In the Matter of Bills of Lading, 29 I. C. C. 417. [100-Continued.]\n The Cummins Amendment makes it unlawful for the carrier to fix a period for giving notice of claims shorter than 90 days, for the filing of claims shorter than 4 months, and for the institution of suits shorter than 2 years. The law does not indicate the time or date from which these several periods of time shall be computed; that is, whether from the date of delivery by the carrier of the damaged property, or, in case of loss, after a reasonable time for delivery has elapsed, from the date shown on the bill of lading, or from the occurrence of the loss or of the damage. It seems clear that these provisions are, in common with the other matters governed by the amendment, confined to instances of loss, damage, or injury caused by the carriers. It will be necessary for the carriers to determine what periods of time they will fix for giving notice of claims, the filing of claims, and the institution of suits. The dates or times from which such periods shall run should also be fixed in the rules. In the interest of thorough understandings and to avoid controversies, it is very desirable that these rules be uniform for all the carriers of the country.\n It is to be remembered that the Cummins Amendment is not a separate statute, but is an amendment to the act. It must therefore be construed as a part of, and in connection with other portions of, the act, and in such a way as to give effect to the whole statute. There does not seem to be any indication of legislative intent to change any provision of the act other than that part known as the Carmack Amendment. The new amendment should, if possible, be so construed as to give full force to its clear purpose, without impairing the effect of any other provision of the ac. \n The more important points, which seem to be surrounded with the most doubt and upon which opinions so far expressed most sharply conflict, are:\n\n 1. \nIf no changes are made in the existing shipping contracts and rate schedules, will the higher rates provided therein automatically become lawfully applicable upon the date upon which the amendment takes effect?\n As we have seen, the Carmack Amendment, adopted in 1906, provided that no contract, receipt, rule, or regulation should exempt the carrier from the liability thereby imposed. As has been said, no effort was made to change rates because of that amendment to the act. The classifications or rate schedules provide that unless the terms of certain bills of lading are accepted higher rates will apply. The terms of the bill of lading could be modified or changed to any extent without automatically changing any rate. Prior to 1913 many of the limitations contained in bills of lading or other shipping contracts were treated as if they did not exist, and it was never suggested that the validity or invalidity of any such provision affected the rate.\n It is contrary to all canons of construction to hold that an act of Congress produces a result not intended by Congress unless the express language of the act compels such a construction. There is nothing in the expressed terms of this act, or in the history of this legislation, that shows any intent or purpose on the part of Congress to affect in any degree the existing rates charged by carriers for transporting property. The legislation is aimed at specified contracts and declares them to be unlawful. The lawful rates on file at this time, therefore, are the rates providing for the limited liability. The Cummins Amendment, by making contracts limiting liability for loss caused by the carriers unlawful, does not destroy these rates, but they remain in effect and are lawfully applicable, for the 10 per cent. increased rates are merely additional and cannot stand in and of themselves.\n Applying correct rules of interpretation, the Cummins Amendment does not automatically bring into effect the increased rates named in the classifications and tariff publications as applicable to shipments which are not made subject to the terms of the uniform or carrier's bill of lading. [100-Continued.]\n\n 2. \nMay the carriers lawfully provide in their tariffs and rate schedules that their liability shall be for the full value of the property at the time and place of shipment?\n It is argued that such a provision would be neither a limitation of the amount of recovery nor a representation or agreement as to value within the meaning of the new law. It is urged that this rule would relieve the question of the amount of liability from uncertainty, would afford a reasonable and uniform method of determining the measure of recovery, save endless litigation, with its attendant labor and expense, and avoid unjust discriminations.\n The Cummins Amendment clearly places upon the carriers liability for the full actual loss, damage, or injury to the property transported which is caused by them, and it makes unlawful any limitation of that liability, or of the amount of recovery thereunder, in any receipt, bill of lading, contract, rule, regulation, or tariff filed with this commission, without respect to the manner or form in which such limitation is sought to be made. The loss or damage must, apparently, be either as of the time and place of shipment, time and place of loss or damage, or time and place of destination. Where rates are lawfully dependent upon declared values, the property and the rates are classified according to the character of the property, of which the value of the property may constitute an element, and such classification is necessarily as of the time and place of shipment. It is therefore believed that the liability of the carrier may be limited to the full value of the property so classified and established as of the time and place of shipment.\n\n 3. \nDoes the amendment to the act apply to export and import shipments to and from foreign countries not adjacent to the United States?\n This must be answered in the negative, in view of the fact that, while specifically stating that its terms shall apply to property received for transportation from certain points to certain other points, it makes no reference to shipments from a point in the United States to a point in a nonadjacent foreign country, or from a nonadjacent foreign country to a point in the United States.\n\n 4. \nIn the proviso, 'that if the goods are hidden from view by wrapping, boxing, or other means, and the carrier is not notified as to the character of the goods,' what is the proper interpretation to be placed upon the words 'and the carrier is not notified as to the character of the goods'?\n Some argue that the word 'character' means nothing more than a statement of the ordinary name by which the commodity is known. On the other hand, it is urged that knowledge as to what the commodity is is necessary in order to apply to it any transportation rate, and that therefore the word 'character' properly means more than the mere name of the commodity. It has been suggested that the real and proper meaning would be indicated by recasting the language as follows: 'Provided, however, that if a commodity in the course of transportation is hidden from view by wrapping, boxing, or other means, so that the carrier cannot know its character, that is to say, its grade, quality, and condition, it may, with the approval of the commission, publish and maintain rates based on value and require the shipper to state in writing the value of any shipment made, and beyond the value so stated the carrier shall not be liable.'\n It has also been suggested that, in view of the fact that the articles dealt with in this proviso are to be distinguished on the basis of value, the value becomes a peculiar quality of the property, and the word 'character' should be construed as including value, and that when the shipper notifies the carrier of the character of the goods the notice is incomplete, unless the value is stated as a necessary element in pointing out the character of the goods. [100-Continued.]\n Another suggestion is that when common experience or knowledge does not clearly establish the nature of the goods, or the view is hidden by boxing, wrapping, or other means, and the carrier is not notified as to the true character of the goods, it may exercise the right to require the shipper to state in writing the value of the property.\n The right of the carrier to initiate its rates and to consider value of the property tendered for transportation as an element in determining the classification thereof or the rate applicable thereto has not been denied by the act or withdrawn by this amendment. The right in certain instances to make varying rates upon a given article or commodity dependent upon its true value being recognized, and it being impossible for the carrier's agent to know the true value of the shipment unless it is declared by the shipper, and in view of the fact that the ordinary name of the commodity is essential to the application of any transportation rate whatsoever, it seems that the word 'character' as used in this proviso must include the true and actual value as stated by the shipper.\n The word 'character' as here used clearly relates primarily to value, or to those qualities affecting value, and when the entire proviso is considered the meaning seems to be that if the qualities affecting value of the goods are hidden from the carrier's view, or are not known to the carrier, the proviso applies. It is a well-settled rule of statutory construction that the word 'and' may be read as 'or' in deference to the meaning of the context.\n If the word 'and' in the proviso is read as 'or,' the meaning is reasonably clear; whereas, if the letter of the statute is adhered to, the meaning is doubtful and difficult to determine. In those instances in which the carrier desires to limit its liability to the value of the property as specifically stated in writing by the shipper, the rate must be basd upon the declared value and be so published; but the commission apparently must determine in advance of such publication that the commodity is one the value of which cannot be known to the carrier from ordinary sources or reasonable inspection, and to which rates based on declared value may be applied in connection with which the carrier's liability is limited to the value so declared. In determining that question the inquiry is whether or not the commodity is one the value of which is peculiarly within the knowledge of the shipper. If it has a definite market value, or its value depends upon facts of which the carrier has equal knowledge with the shipper, the 'character' of the shipment is known to the carrier, and the proviso does not apply. The Congress did not affirmatively recognize any rates based upon declared value other than those authorized by this proviso. This, of course, does not mean that commodities may not be reasonably classified according to value and be subject to different rates applicable to different grades of the same commodity, which is a different matter from limiting the liability to the declared value.\n When the goods are not hidden from view, and the carrier is advised as to their character, all contracts or agreements purporting to limit the liability of the carrier for loss or damage caused by it are made void. A carrier, after the Cummins Amendment goes into effect, may not contract to limit its liability for loss or damage caused by it to the property. There is, however, no inhibition as to the limitation of the liability of a carrier for losses not caused by it or a succeeding carrier to which the property may be delivered. The amendment has expressly reapplied the limitation of the prior act with respect to loss or damage caused by the carriers chargeable t t therewith. It follows, therefore, that the interpretation applied to the act before it was amended is equally applicable to the amendment in so far as the latter affects the right of a carrier to establish rates conditional upon the shipper's assumption of the entire risk of loss attributable to causes beyond the carrier's control. From this it follows that under the amendment a contract o a tariff may lawfully limit to a reasonable maximum the liability of a carrie for losses which it does not cause. It follows further that the rates provided by such tariff may be proportionate to the risk assumed. [100-Continued.]\n This provision of the statute as to goods concealed carrier is not advised clearly prescribes the right carrier is not advised clearly prescribes the right of carriers under the direction or approval of the commission to provide for a graduation of rates in accordance with the declared value of the property transported. The liability provided by the rates so established by the commission is applicable no less to instances of loss or damage chargeable to the negligence of the carrier than to those occasioned by causes beyond the carrier's control. But the carriers may not contract to limit their liability for loss, damage, or injury caused by them to property the character of which is manifested by the shipment itself or otherwise disclosed.\n In this connection it has been suggested that the carrier might provide that in the event the shipper refused to declare the value the higher rates would apply. This suggestion cannot be approved. If the rate is lawfully conditioned upon the value as declared by the shipper, it is as much the shipper's duty to declare the true value of the shipment as it is his duty to declare the name of a commodity tendered for shipment as to which there are no different rates.\n It is important to keep in mind that the carriers are not prohibited from making different rates dependent upon the value of different grades of a given commodity; that, except as covered by the Cummins Amendment, including approval of the rates by the commission, the carrier is subject to all of the liabilities imposed by that amendment; and that if, in any instance, the shipper declares the value to be less than the true vl ue in order to get a lower rate than that to which he would otherwise be entitled, he violates, and is subject to the penalty prescribed in, section 10 of the act. The carrier would also be subject to the same penalty in such a case if, having knowledge that the value represented is not the true value, it nevertheless accepts the shipper's representation as to value for the purpose of applying the rate.\n\n 5. \nDo the terms of the Cummins Amendment apply to the transportation of baggage? This must apparently be answered in the affirmative. Transportation of baggage is a part of the contract for transportation of the passenger. The carriers have always limited their liability for loss of or damage to baggage. The baggage check is the carrier's receipt for the baggage. The conditions attached to the carrier's liability are stated in the fare schedules and on passage tickets of contract form. In National Baggage Committee v. A. T. & S. F. Ry. Co., 32 I. C. C. 152, the commission considered the carriers' rules relative to charges and liabilities in the transportation of baggage and prescribed certain reasonable regulations, including reasonable insurance charges upon baggage declared to be of greater value than the maximum limit provided in the schedules and contract for carriage. All ordinary personal or sample baggage is hidden from view by boxing, wrapping, or other means, and the amended law seems clearly to recognize the carrier's right to fix conditions and terms applicable to the transportation of baggage dependent upon the value as declared by the person offering the baggage for transportation.\n The necessity for revision of the bills of lading, live stock contracts, and other similar contracts of carriage, as well as of certain parts of the carriers' classifications and rate schedules, is manifest. Bills of lading and shipping contracts can and ought to be at once amended by eliminating obviously unlawful and invalid provisions. Such action will obviate for the immediate future numerous controversies that otherwise would properly arise. Proper analysis should be made of the classifications and tariffs to bring them into harmony with the amended law.\n Such changes in classifications and rate schedules cannot be made upon statutory notice and become effective contemporaneously with the new law. Permission is therefore hereby given to carriers to make effective on June 2, 1915, upon not less than three days' notice to the public and to the commission, given in the manner prescribed in the act and in the commission's [100-Continued.]\nregulations, amendments to the classifications and rate schedules which eliminate provisions or rules that are in conflict with the terms of the new law, provided no such amendment has the effect of increasing any rate or charge for services.\n If, in a proper manner and a proper proceeding, it shall be made to appear that, with regard to any commodity or commodities, the existing rates do not afford the carriers proper compensation for the services they perform and the risk which is imposed upon them, it could hardly be denied that the rates on such commodities might properly be increased in a sufficient amount to properly compensate the carriers for their added risk and liability. Where rates are lawfully based upon declared values, the difference in rates should be no more than fairly and reasonably represents the added insurance. It does not appear that this amendment to the act affords justification for any increase in rates on commodities in general. As has been said, the carrier may not lawfully impose unreasonable rates upon one commodity in order to compensate it for risk or liabilities incurred in connection with the transportation of another commodity, and it is not to be forgotten that the liabilities here considered are only those for loss, damage, or injury to the property caused by a carrier or its agents or employes; in other words, the loss, damage, or injury resulting from the neglects or omissions of a carrier or its agents.\n The commission has been cod ucting an investigation with regard to bills of lading, entitled In the Matter of Bills of Lading, Docket No. 4844. Further hearings in that proceeding may be necessary in the light of the Cummins Amendment. In that connection matters that have been informally presented and urged in this informal proceeding may be presented in a formal way, supported by testimony, and a determination can there be reached on questions as to which the commission now has no information upon which it could base a lawful order. What is attempted here is simply to indicate the impressions gained from the experience had in the past and from the suggestions informally presented by those who are vitally interested in the effect of the Cummins Amendment and the course to be pursued for the immediate future in the light thereof. All of the questions herein discussed are, of course, subject to judicial interpretation, and the views indicated herein might be somewhat changed in the light of more complete information supported by competent evidence.\n The classification, tariffs, receipt and other forms used by the express companies have been prescribed by order of the commission. The new law, of course, applies to them as well as to other carriers. They have presented suggested changes in their rules and forms which will be disposed of by a supplemental order in the Express Case. \n\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHICAGO, R. I. & P. RY. CO. v. WARD(1920)\nNo. 198\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 18, 19]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. J. Roberts, of El Reno, Okl., W. H. Moore, of McAlester, Okl., Thomas P. Littlepage and Sidney F. Taliaferro, both of Washington, D. C., and W. F. Dickinson, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioners.\n Mr. W. S. Pendleton, of Shawnee, Okl., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit was brought in the superior court, Pottawatomie county, Oklahoma, against the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company and A. J. Carney to recover damages for injuries alleged to have been received by Ward while he was employed as a switchman of the railway company in its yards at Shawnee. He recovered a judgment which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, 173 Pac. 212. The ground upon which recovery was sought against the railway company and Carney, who was an engine foreman, was that Ward, while engaged in his duty as a switchman, was suddenly thrown from the top of a box car upon which he was about to apply a brake. The petition alleged, and the testimony tended to show, that Ward was engaged as a switch \n\n[252 U.S. 18, 20]\n\u00a0\n man on a cut of cars which it was the duty of the engine foreman to cut loose from the engine pushing the cars in order that Ward might gradually stop the cars by applying the brake. It appears that at the time of the injury to Ward, the cut of cars had been pushed up an incline by the engine, over an elevation, and as the cars ran down the track the effect was to cause the slack to run out between them permitting them to pull apart sufficiently to be uncoupe d, at which time it was the duty of the engine foreman to uncouple the cars. The testimony tended to support the allegations of the petition as to the negligent manner in which this operation was performed at the time of the injury, showing the failure of the engine foreman to properly cut off the cars at the time he directed the engineer to retard the speed of the engine, thereby causing them to slow down in such manner that when the check reached the car upon which Ward was about to set the brake, he was suddenly thrown from the top of the car with the resulting injuries for which he brought this action.\n The railway company and Carney took issue upon the allegations of the petition, and set up contributory negligence and assumption of risk as defenses. The trial court left the question of negligence on the part of the company and the engine foreman to the jury, and also instructed it as to assumption of risk by an employe of the ordinary hazards of the work in which he was engaged, and further charged the jury as follows:\n'You are further instructed that while a servant does not assume the extraordinary and unusual risks of the employment yet on accepting employment he does assume all the ordinary and usual risks and perils incident thereto, whether it be dangerous or otherwise, and also all risks which he knows or should, in the exercise of reasonable care, know to exist. He does not, however, assume such risks as are created by the master's negligence nor such as are latent or are only discoverable at \n\n[252 U.S. 18, 21]\n\u00a0\n the time of the injury. The doctrine of an assumption of risk is wholly dependent upon the servant's knowledge, actual or constructive, of the dangers incident to his employment. Where he knew, or in the exercise of reasonable and ordinary care, should know the risk to which he is exposed, he will, as a rule, be held to have assumed them; but where he either does not know, or knowing, does not appreciate such risk, and his ignorance or nonappreciation is not due to negligence or want of care on his part, there is no assumption of risk on the part of the servant preventing a recovery for injuries.'\n\n Treating the case, as the court below did, as one in which the injury occurred while the petitioners and respondent were engaged in interstate commerce, this charge as to the assumption of risk was not accurate, in stating without qualification that the servant did not assume the risk created by the master's negligence. We have had occasion to deal with the matter of assumption of risk in cases where the defense is applicable under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665), being those in which the injury was caused otherwise than by the violation of some statute enacted to promote the safety of employes. As this case was not one of the latter class, assumption of risk was a defense to which the defendants below were entitled. Seaboard Air Line R. R. Co. v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 475; Jacobs v. Southern Railway Co., \n241 U.S. 229\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 588.\n As to the nature of the risk assumed by an employe in actions brought under the Employers' Liability Act, we took occasion to say in Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. De Atley, \n241 \nU.S. 310, 315\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 564, 566 (60 L. Ed. 1016):\n'According to our decisions, the settled rule is, not that it is the duty of an employe to exercise care to discover extraordinary dangers that may arise from the negligence of the employer or of those for whose conduct the employer is responsible, but that the employe may assume that the employer or his agents have exercised proper care with respect to his safety until \n\n[252 U.S. 18, 22]\n\u00a0\n notified to the contrary, unless the want of care and the danger arising from it are so obvious that an ordinarily careful person, under the circumstances, would observe and appreciate them.'\n\n The federal Employers' Liability Act places a coemploye's negligence, when it is the ground of the action, in the same rl ation as that of the employer upon the matter of assumption of risk. \n241 U.S. 313\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 564. See also Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co. v. Proffitt, \n241 \nU.S. 462, 468\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 620; Erie Railway Co. v. Purucker, \n244 U.S. 320\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 629\n\n\n Applying the principles settled by these decisions to the facts of this case, the testimony shows that Ward had neither warning nor opportunity to judge of the danger to which he was exposed by the failure of the engine foreman to cut off the cars. In the absence of notice to the contrary, and the record shows none, Ward had the right to act upon the belief that the usual method would be followed and the cars cut off at the proper time by the engine foreman so that he might safely proceed to perform his duty as a switchman by setting the brake to check the cars which should have been detached. For the lack of proper care, on the part of the representative of the railway company while Ward was in the performance of his duty, he was suddenly precipitated from the front end of the car by the abrupt checking resulting from the failure to make the disconnection. This situation did not make the doctrine of assumed risk a defense to an action for damages because of the negligent manner of operation which resulted in Ward's injury, and the part of the charge complained of though inaccurate could have worked no harm to the petitioners. It was a sudden emergency, brought about by the negligent operation of that particular cut of cars, and not a condition of danger, resulting from the master's or his representatives' negligence, so obvious that an ordinarily prudent person in the situation in which Ward was placed, had opportunity to know and appreciate it, and thereby assume the risk.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 18, 23]\n\u00a0\n Trial court also charged that contributory negligence by Ward would prevent a recovery. This charge was more favorable to the petitioners than they were entitled to, as under the federal Employers' Liability Act contributory negligence is not a defense, and only goes in mitigation of damages. The giving of this charge could not have been prejudicial error requiring a reversal of the judgment.\n Another assignment of error, dealt with by the Supreme Court of Oklahoma, that a jury of less than 12 returned the verdict, conforming to the state practice, does not seem to be pressed here. In any event it is disposed of by St. Louis & San Francisco R. R. Co. v. Brown, \n241 U.S. 223\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 602.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma and the same is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","26":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHIPMAN LIMITED v. THOMAS B JEFFREY CO.(1920)\nNo. 516\nArgued: Decided: January 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 373, 374]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Daniel P. Hays, of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 373, 376]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Philip B. Adams, of New York City, and Thomas B. Kearney, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error was plaintiff in the courts below, defendant in error was defendant, and we shall refer to them respectively as plaintiff and defendant.\n The action was brought in the Supreme Court of the state of New York, and removed upon motion of the defendant to the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. In the latter court defendant made a motion for an order vacating and setting aside the service of summons, and dismissing the complaint, for lack of jurisdiction of the person of the defendant. The motion was granted, and the case is here on the jurisdictional question only.\n A brief summary of the grounds of action and the proceedings upon the motion to dismiss is all that is necessary. Plaintiff is a New York corporation; defendant, one under the laws of Wisconsin, and a manufacturer and seller of motor cars, known as the 'Jeffrey' and 'Rambler,' and parts thereof, and motor trucks and parts thereof. By contracts, in writing, made in Wisconsin by the plaintiff and defendant, it was agreed that the former should have the sole right to sell the motor cars and parts \n\n[251 U.S. 373, 377]\n\u00a0\n thereof (first cause of action) and the motor trucks and parts thereof ( second cause of action) of defendant in Europe and certain other foreign places, and to receive certain designated percentages. The contracts as to motor cars and their parts, and the trucks and their parts, provided that they (cars, trucks, and parts) should be sold and delivered to plaintiff ( called in the contracts the 'distributor') at Kenosha, Wis., for sale at the designated places by plaintiff; defendant reserving the right to fill the orders of plaintiff (distributor) for the cars, trucks, and parts from any of its defendant's depots in New York City. Cars and trucks purchased under the contracts to be paid for at Kenosha. Both contracts continued in effect to July 31, 1915\n\n\n There are allegations of performance of the contracts by plaintiff, their nonperformance by defendant, whereby plaintiff on one cause of action was entitled, it is alleged, to $280,000, and upon the other $600, 000. Judgment is prayed for their sum, to wit, $880,000.\n The District Court has certified three questions, but, as the first includes the other two, we give it only as it sufficiently presents the question at issue:\n'Whether in the service of summons, as shown by the record herein, upon Philip B. Adams, this court acquired jurisdiction of the person of the defendant.'\n\n Plaintiff contends for an affirmative answer, and adduces the New York statute, which requires of corporations not organized under the laws of New York, as a condition of doing business in the state, to file in the office of the secretary of state a stipulation designating 'a place within the state which is to be its principal place of business, and designating a person upon whom process against the corporation may be served within the state,' and the person designated must consent, and the designation 'shall continue in force until revoked by an instrument in writing' designating some other person. \n\n[251 U.S. 373, 378]\n\u00a0\n Defendant complied with the requirements of the statute July 6, 1914, designating 21 Park Row, New York, as its place of business, and Philip B. Adams as its agent upon whom process might be served. The designation and appointment have not been revoked.\n It is not denied, however, that defendant had removed from the state before service on Adams, and, as we have stated, the contracts sued on made the place of their performance Kenosha, Wis. But, in emphasis of the requirement of the statute, it is urged that, at all of the times of the duration of the contracts sued on and their breaches, defendant was doing business in the state, and at any time had the right to transact business in the state. It is further urged that the contracts contemplated they might be performed within the state. There is no allegation of such performance, nor that the present causes of action arose out of acts or transactions within the state. The other circumstances of emphasis may be disregarded, as the validity of the service depends upon the statute, assuming it to be controlling; that is, whether under its requirements the unrevoked designation of Adams as an agent of defendant gave the latter constructive presence in the state. And making that assumption of the control of the statute, which we do in deference to counsel's contention, for light we must turn to New York decisions, and there is scarcely ambiguity in them, though the facts in none of them included an actual absence from the state of the corporation with which they, the cases, were concerned.\n Bagdon v. Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 217 N. Y. 432, 111 N. E. 1075, L. R. A. 1916F, 407, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 389, passed upon the effect of a cause of action arising out of the state, the corporation, however, doing business within the state, and having complied with the statute in regard to its place of business and the designation of an agent upon whom process could be served. But the court throughout the opinion, with conscious so licitude \n\n[251 U.S. 373, 379]\n\u00a0\n of the necessity of making the ground of its decision the fact that the corporation was doing business in the state, dwelt upon the fact and distinguished thereby, Old Wayne Mut. Life Ass'n v. McDonough, \n204 U.S. 8\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 236, and Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., \n236 U.S. 115\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 255, in both of which the causes of action were based on transactions done outside of the states in which the suits were brought.\n Tauza v. Susquehanna Coal Co., 220 N. Y. 259, 115 N. E. 915, is nearer in principle of decision than the case just commented upon. The question of the doing of business within the state by the coal company was in the case and was discussed. But the question was unconnected with a statutory designation of a place of business or of an agent to receive service of process. However, there was an implication of agency in the coal company's sales agent under other provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure of the state and it was considered that the principle of Bagdon v. Phila. & Read. C. & I. Co., supra, applied. But the court went further and left no doubt of the ground of its decision. It said:\n'Unless a foreign corporation is engaged in business within the state, it is not brought within the state by the presence of its agents'- citing and deferring to St. Louis S. W. Ry. Co. of Texas v. Alexander, \n227 U.S. 218\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 245, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 77.\n\n And further said:\n'The essential thing is that the corporation shall have come into the state.'\n\n If prior cases have a different bent, they must be considered as overruled, as was recognized in Dollar Co. v. Canadian C. & F. Co., 220 N. Y. 270, 277, 115 N. E. 711.\n In resting the case on New York decisions, we do not wish to be understood that the validity of such service as here involved would not be of federal cognizance, whatever the decision of a state court, and refer to Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Alexander, supra; Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. v. McKibben, \n243 U.S. 264\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 280; Meisukas v.

Stephens L. Blakely, of Covington, Ky., and Charles Harwood Morris, of Frankfort, Ky., for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case was argued with No. 252, South Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Co. v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, \n252 U.S. 399\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 378, 64 L. Ed. --. It was disposed of by the Court of Appeals with that case in one opinion. The company was indicted, as the other company was, of a violation of the Separate Coach Law of the state (Ky. St.  795), and found guilty. The facts are in essence the same as in the other case, though the indictment is more elaborate. The defenses and contentions are the same. We have stated them, and upon what they are based, and the character and relation of the companies, in our opinion in the other case.\n The company is an interurban road, and the Separate Coach Law is applicable to it. It was incorporated under the general laws of the state, and authority conferred upon it to construct and operate an electric railway from the city of Covington to the town of Erlanger, and to such further point beyond Erlanger as might be determined. It was constructed from Covington to a point just beyond the suburban town called Ft. Mitchell, a town of a few hundred inhabitants.\n The South Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Company furnished the means to build the road, and at the time covered by the indictment was operating the road as part of its railway system, as described in the other case.\n The intimate relations of the roads, as stated by the Court of Appeals, we have set forth in the other case, and it is only necessary to add that the indictment in the present case charges that the company in this case was \n\n[252 U.S. 408, 410]\n\u00a0\n the lessor of the other company, and 'thereby permitted and brought about the acquisition of its rights and privileges, knowing that' the other company, 'would not operate and run separate coaches for its white and colored passengers.' And it is charged that the other company operating the lease violated the law, and that the defendant company, knowing of the intended method of operation, also violated the law. These facts and other facts the Court of Appeals decided made h e company an offender against the statute, and decided further that the statute was not an interference with interstate commerce. The conviction of the company was sustained.\n Our reviewing power, we think, is limited to the last point-that is, the effect of the law as an interference with interstate Commerce-and that we disposed of in the other case. The distinction counsel make between street railways and other railways, and between urban and interurban roads, we are not concerned with.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY (dissenting).\n This case is controlled by the disposition made of No. 252. While it is true that the Erlanger Company was incorporated under the laws of the state of Kentucky, the proof shows that its road was built and operated by the South Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Company as part of the latter's system. This is not a proceeding to test the right to operate the road. The conviction is justified because the local company permitted the principal company to operate without separate coaches or compartments for its colored passengers. The traffic conducted is of an interstate nature, and the same reasons which impel a disent in No. 252 require a like dissent in the present case.\n In my opinion the single traffic over both railroads being \n\n[252 U.S. 408, 411]\n\u00a0\n interstate, the regulation embodied in the statute and for which the conviction was had, as to both roads, is an unreasonable and burdensome interference with interstate commerce.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice PITNEY concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCITY OF NEW YORK v.

The jurisdiction was invoked solely upon the ground that the rate was confiscatory and hence violated constitutional rights of the company. The city of New York applied for leave to intervene as a party defendant in the action. The District Judge denied the petition for intervention, stating that the Public Service Commission, the Attorney General, and the district attorney properly represented private consumers; that the city had no interest in the litigation as a consumer, was not the governmental body which had fixed the rate, and was not charged with the duty of enforcing it. From the order (Consolidated Gas Co. of New York v. Newton, 256 Fed. 238) denying the application to intervene, the city of New York prosecuted an appeal to the Circuit Court of \n\n[253 U.S. 219, 221]\n\u00a0\n Appeals, and the latter court (260 Fed. 1022) affirmed the order of the District Court.\n The application was addressed to the discretion of the District Court, and the order appealed from was not of that final character which furnished the basis for appeal.

J. Smith Hays, of Winchester, Ky., and T. L. Edelen, of Frankfort, Ky., for appellants. \n\n[251 U.S. 192, 193]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Beverly R. Jouett, of Winchester, Ky., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Winchester Waterworks Company filed its bill in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of an ordinance establishing maximum rates for water to be furnished the city for public use and to the people thereof for private use. By the bill and amended bill it was charged that the city had no authority to pass or enforce an ordinance fixing such rates, because (1) no power had been granted to the city so to do by the Legislature of Kentucky; (2) because the rates established were so low as to be confiscatory in their character, and, consequently, the ordinance was violative of rights secured to the company by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. An answer was filed, and the court decided the case and made a final decree in favor of the company upon the ground that under the laws of Kentucky the city had no authority to pass or enforce an ordinance fixing rates. The court found it unnecessary to pass upon the question of the confiscatory character of the rates. The bill invoked jurisdiction upon a constitutional ground, and the case was brought here by direct appeal.\n It appears that the company had a contract with the city, which expired in 1916, and thereafter the ordinance in controversy was passed. That a city has no power to regulate rates of this character unless it has legislative authority so to do is established, and does not seem to be disputed by the appellant. 'Independently of a right to regulate and control the rates to be charged for public service reserved in a grant of a franchise or right to use the city streets, a city or other municipality has no power to regulate the rates to be charged by water, lighting or \n\n[251 U.S. 192, 194]\n\u00a0\n other public service corporations in the absence of express or plain legislative authority to do so.' 3 Dillon on Municipal Corporations (5th Ed.)  1325. Nor does such authority arise from the power to regulate the opening and use of streets, nor a grant of the general right to control and regulate the right to erect works and lay pipes in the streets of the city. State v. Missouri & K. Telephone Co., 189 Mo. 83, 88 S. W. 41; Jacksonville v. Southern Bell & Tel. Co., 57 Fla. 374, 49 South. 509; Lewisville Natural Gas Co. v. State, 135 Ind. 49, 34 N. E. 702, 21 L. R. A. 734; Mills v. Chicago (C. C.) 127 Fed. 731; State v. Sheboygan, 111 Wis. 23, 86 N. W. 657.\n Bearing this general principle in mind, we come to examine the sections of the laws of Kentucky which, it is insisted, give the authority to fix water rates. The appellant insists that this power is expressly conferred in subsection 25 of section 3490 of the Kentucky Statutes, which reads as follows:\n'The board of council may grant the right of way over the public streets or public grounds of the city to any railroad company or street railroad company, on such conditions as to them may seem proper, and shall have a supervising control over the use of same, and regulate the speed of cars and signals and fare on street cars; and under like condition and supervision may grant the right of way that may be necessary to gas companies, water companies, electric light companies, telephone companies, or any like companies; and may compel any railroad company to erect and maintain gates at any or all street crossings, and to prevent railways from blocking or obstructing the streets or public ways of the city, and to fix penalties for the violation of these provisions: Provided,' etc.\n\n Other subsections claimed to be applicable are given in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[251 U.S. 192, 195]\n\u00a0\n Examining subsection 25, we are unable to discover any grant of authority to fix the rates for water consumption. It is therein first provided that the council may grant the right of way over the public streets to any railroad or street railroad company on such conditions as to the council may seem proper, and shall have a supervising control over the use of the same, and the council is given the right to regulate the speed of cars and signals and fare no street cars, and under like conditions and supervision, the council may grant the right of way to water companies among others. This language is certainly very far from that express authority to regulate rates, which is essential in order to enable municipalities so to do. The power to grant a right of way to water companies is specifically granted, and this under like conditions and supervision already provided as to railroad and street \n\n[251 U.S. 192, 196]\n\u00a0\n railroad companies. This is the full measure of the grant of authority to deal with water companies. The right to regulate fares is in the same sentence which grants authority to deal with water companies, and is specifically limited to fares on street cars.\n Nor do we find in other subsections of this section any provision from which the right to fix the rates of water companies can be inferentially deduced.\n Counsel call to our attention but one case from Kentucky, whose court of last resort is final authority upon the construction of the statutes, and that is United Fuel & Gas Co. v. Commonwealth, 159 Ky. 34, 166 S. W. 783. There the United Fuel & Gas Company held a franchise from a city in Kentucky under an ordinance providing that the grantee of the franchise should furnish for public and private use for the city and its inhabitants natural and artificial gas at a reasonable price not exceeding in any event $1 per 1,000 cubic feet, and that the grantee in delivering gas should not discriminate against the consumers in the city. The company proposed to sell gas to the inhabitants of the city at 20 cents per thousand feet if they would sign a contract for five years, but it charged persons who did not sign such a contract 25 cents a thousand feet. The city council passed an ordinance providing that a gas company should not charge one citizen more than another, and imposed a fine for violation of the ordinance. The city was of the fifth class, and was given authority to make 'all other local police, sanitary and other regulations, not conflicting with the general laws.' The court held that the act for the government of this city of the fifth class must be read in connection with the statutes conferring power on larger cities, and, that thus construed, there was no grant of authority to the city to impose a fine such as the one in question in the absence of legislative authority so to do. The section from Dillon on Municipal Corporations, \n\n[251 U.S. 192, 197]\n\u00a0\n stating that the authority of a municipality to regulate rates to be charged by public service corporations is limited to cases in which express or plain legislative authority has been given was quoted with approval. Cases from other states in which the principle has been approved were also cited.\n It is true that this case is not precisely in point, but it contains a recognition by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky of the accepted principle that the right to fix rates must be granted to municipal corporations by a plain expression of legislative authority. It is said, however, that our decision in Owensboro v. Owensboro Waterworks Co., \n191 U.S. 358\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 82, holds a contrary view. So far as apposite, that case dealt with the power of a city of the third class to fix rates for water consumers. As to cities of that class, section 3290 of the Kentucky statutes specifically provides authority to provide the city and inhabitants thereof with water, light, etc., service by contract or by works of its own, and to make regulations for the management thereof, and to fix and regulate the price to consumers and customers. Dealing with that section, and the authority conferred upon cities of the third class, this court said:\n'The purpose of section 3290 was to provide the inhabitants of cities of the third class with the services mentioned-water, light, power, heat and telephone. They could be provided by the cities directly or they could be provided by private persons; but whatever way provided, the power was given to regulate the management and fix the rates of the services, and this was but the endowment of a common governmental power.'\n\n This language was used in regard to the authority given in express terms to fix rates. It was said of such authority that it was but the endowment of a common governmental power. This is undoubtedly true. But it is equally certain that the governmental power rests with the state, and must be conferred upon the municipality \n\n[251 U.S. 192, 198]\n\u00a0\n in an unmistakable way. We find nothing in the Owensboro Case which at all conflicts with the construction which we have given to section 3490, applicable to cities of the fourth class to which the city of Winchester belongs.\n Finding no error in the judgment of the District Court, the same is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Kentucky Statutes:\n'3490. The board of council, in addition to other powers herein granted, shall have power within the city: ...\n\n'(8) To provide the city with water, or erect, purchase, or lease waterworks and maintain same, or to make all necessary contracts with any person or corporation for such purposes; to erect hydrants, cisterns, fire plugs and pumps in the streets within or beyond the limit of the city. ... \n\n'(30) The board of council shall have power, by ordinance, to prescribe the punishment, by fine not exceeding $100, or imprisonment not exceeding 60 days of any person who shall molest, damage or interfere with any system of waterworks laid in said city, or the pipes and mains, hydrants, or any part thereof, and shall have power to punish by ordinance and impose the same penalty as for damaging or molesting any other public property, and may, subject to the rules of any water company which may establish such system, select persons who shall have the right to open, tap or make connection with such pipes or mains in streets, alleys, or public ways of said city. ...\n\n'(33) Said city council shall have legislative power to make by-laws and ordinances for the carrying into effect of all of the powers herein granted for the government of the city, and to do all things properly belonging to the police of incorporated cities.

The District Court gave the plaintiff a decree. 235 Fed. 408. This was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Koke Co. v. Coca-Cola Co., 255 Fed. 894, 167 C. C. A. 214. Subsequently a writ of certiorari was granted by this Court. \n250 U.S. 637\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 493. \n\n[254 U.S. 143, 145]\n\u00a0\n It appears that after the plaintiff's predecessors in title had used the mark for some years it was registered under the Act of Congress of March 3, 1881 (21 Stat. 502), and again under the Act of February 20, 1905, c. 592, 33 Stat. 724 (Comp. St.  9485 et seq.). Both the Courts below agree that subject to the one question to be considered the plaintiff has a right to equitable relief. Whatever may have been its original weakness, the mark for years has acquired a secondary significance and has indicated the plaintiff's product alone. It is found that defendant's mixture is made and sold in imitation of the plaintiff's and that the word 'Koke' was chosen for the purpose of reaping the benefit of the advertising done by the plaintiff and of selling the imitation as and for the plaintiff's goods. The only obstacle found by the Circuit Court of Appeals in the way of continuing the injunction granted below was its opinion that the trade- mark in itself and the advertisements accompanying it made such fraudulent representations to the public that the plaintiff had lost its claim to any help from the Court. That is the question upon which the writ of certiorari was granted and the main one that we shall discuss.\n Of course a man is not to be protected in the use of a device the very purpose and effect of which is to swindle the public. But the defects of a plaintiff do not offer a very broad ground for allowing another to swindle him. The defence relied on here should be scrutinized with a critical eye. The main point is this: Before 1900 the beginning of the good will was more or less helped by the presence of cocaine, a drug that, like alcohol of caffein or opium, may be described as a deadly poison or as a valuable item of the pharmacopoeia according to the rhetorical purposes in view. The amount seems to have been very small, but it may have been enough to begin a bad habit and after the Food and Drug Act of June 30, 1906, c. 3915 (Comp. St.  8717-8728), if not earlier, long before this \n\n[254 U.S. 143, 146]\n\u00a0\n suit was brought, it was eliminated from the plaintiff's compound. Coca leaves still are used, to be sure, but after they have been subjected to a drastic process that removes from them every characteristic substance except a little tannin and still less chlorophyl. The cola nut, at best, on its side furnishes but a small portion of the caffein, which now is the only element that has appreciable effect. That comes mainly from other sources. It is argued that the continued use of the name imports a representation that has ceased to be true and that the representation is reinforced by a picture of coca leaves and cola nuts upon the label and by advertisements, which however were many years before this suit was brought, that the drink is an 'ideal nerve tonic and stimulant,' etc., and that thus the very thing sought to be protected is used as a fraud.\n The agrument does not satisfy us. We are dealing here with a popular drink not with a medicine, and although what has been said might suggest that its attraction lay in producing the expectation of a toxic effect the facts point to a different conclusion. Since 1900 the sales have increased at a very great rate corresponding to a like increase in advertising. The name now characterizes a beverage to be had at almost any soda fountain. It means a single thing coming from a single source, and well known to the community. It hardly would be too much to say that the drink characterizes the name as much as the name the drink. In other words 'Coca-Cola' probably means to most persons the plaintiff's familiar product to be had everywhere rather than a compound of particular substances. Although the fact did not appear in United States v. Coca-Cola Co., \n241 \nU.S. 265, 289\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 573, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 487, we see no reason to doubt that, as we have said, it has acquired a secondary meaning in which perhaps the product is more emphasized than the producer but to which the producer is entitled. The coca leaves and whatever of cola nut is \n\n[254 U.S. 143, 147]\n\u00a0\n employed may be used to justify the continuance of the name or they may affect the flavor as the plaintiff contends, but before this suit was brought the plaintiff had advertised to the public that it must not expect and would not find cocaine, and had eliminated everything tending to suggest cocaine effects except the name and the picture of the leaves and nuts, which probably conveyed little or nothing to most who saw it. It appears to us that it would be going too far to deny the plaintiff relief against a palpable fraud because possibly here and there an ignorant person might call for the drink with the hope for incipient cocaine intoxication. The plaintiff's position must be judged by the facts as they were when the suit was begun, not by the facts of a different condition and an earlier time.\n The decree of the District Court restrains the defendant from using the word 'Dope.' The plaintiff illustrated in a very striking way the fact that the word is one of the most featureless known even to the language of those who are incapable of discriminating speech. In some places it would be used to call for Coca-Cola. It equally would have been used to call for anything else having about it a faint aureole of poison. It does not suggest Coca-Cola by similarity and whatever objections there may be to its use, objections which the plaintiff equally makes to its application to Coca-Cola, we see no ground on which the plaintiff can claim a personal right to exclude the defendant from using it.\n The product including the coloring matter is free to all who can make it if no extrinsic deceiving element is present. The injunction should be modified also in this respect.\n Decree reversed.\n Decree of District Court modified and affirmed. \n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOLE v.

Joseph Ralph is the lode claimant and the other parties are the placer claimants.\n Ralph made application at the local land office for the issue to him of a patent for the three lode claims, along with thirteen others not here in question, and in due time two adverse claims were filed in that proceeding, one based upon the Guy Davis and covering most of the ground within the Salt Lake No. 3, and the other based upon the Homestake and covering a considerable portion of the ground within the Midas and Evening Star. These suits were brought in a state court in support of the adverse claims, and Ralph, the sole defendant, caused them to be removed into the federal court, the parties being citizens of different states. Afterwards some of the original plaintiffs were eliminated and others brought in, but the citizenship remained diverse as bf ore.\n The cases were tried together to the court and a jury, the latter returning general verdicts for the plaintiffs and special verdicts finding that when the placer locations were made no lode had been discovered within the limits of any of the lode locations. Judgments for the plaintiffs were entered upon the verdicts and motions by the defendant for a new trial were overruled. Upon writs of error the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgments and ordered a new trial, one judge dissenting. Ralph v. Cole, 249 Fed. 81, 161 C. C. A. 133. The cases are here upon writs of certiorari which were granted because the ground upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals put its decision-The construction and application of some of the mineral land laws-was deemed of general interest in the regions where those laws are operative.\n The defendant does not rely entirely upon the ground of decision advanced by the Circuit Court of Appeals, \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 290]\n\u00a0\n but urges at length that, if it be not well taken, the record discloses other grounds, not considered by that court, for reversing the judgments and ordering a new trial. And he further urges that, if the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals be right, it is not sufficiently comprehensive to serve as a guide to the court and the parties upon another trial. The plaintiffs insist that the judgments in the District Court were right and should be affirmed.\n In the circumstances it is open to us to deal only with the matter considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals and to remand the cases to it for any needed action upon other questions, or to proceed ourselves to a complete decision. The latter course seems the better inasmuch as counsel have united in presenting to us all questions though to arise upon the record and the litigation already has covered a considerable period.\n Criticism is made of the complaints. As presented in the state court they fully met the requirements of the local Code, Rev. Laws 1912,  5526, and there was no request after the removal into the federal court that they be recast to meet any further requirements prevailing there. Apart from the local Code, each sufficiently stated a cause of action in the nature of ejectment, save as some allegations were wanting in precision and it was left uncertain whether the defendant was in possession. The latter defect was cured by an affirmative statement in the answer that the defendant was in possession. Texas & New Orleans R. R. Co. v. Miller, \n221 \nU.S. 408, 416\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 534. If the other defects embarrassed the defendant he should have interposed a timely objection, which doubtless would have resulted in appropriate amendments. Instead, he permitted the matter to pass until the trial was in progress and then sought to obtain some advantage from it. This he could not do; by his failure to make timely objection the defects had been waived. We here dispose of a related question by saying that, in our opinion, the \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 291]\n\u00a0\n complaints, with the answers, put in issue the validity of the lode locations, including the requisite mineral discovery.\n The defendant insists that necessary parties did not join in filing the adverse claims in the land office, that in the suits there was a misjoinder of plaintiffs and a failure to joinessential plaintiffs, and that deeds showing title in some of the plaintiffs were erroneously admitted in evidence in that they were without the requisite revenue stamps. We think this insistence is untenable in all its phases.\n As respects the guy Davis placer, Davis and Faubert were the original locators and Faubert soon conveyed a fraction of his interest to Thatcher. These three filed the adverse claim and brought the suit, the title being in them at the time. Thereafter Faubert transferred his remaining interest to Cole, Malley and Ross, and Thatcher conveyed a fraction of his interest to Healey. Because of these transfers, and with the court's approval, Faubert was eliminated as a party and Cole, Malley, Ross andH ealey came in as plaintiffs. Thus the changes in title pending the suit were followed by corresponding changes in the parties plaintiff.\n At all the times mentioned the title was in a sense affected by an outstanding contract, executed by the original locators, which invested Thatcher and Forman with a right to a specified share in the output or proceeds of the claim, and possibly with a right to have it worked and thereby made productive. The contract was not recorded, but this is not material, for the contract was good between the parties and no subsequent purchaser is calling it in question. See Rev. Laws 1912,  1038-1040. Unlike Thatcher, Forman had no interest in the claim other than under this contract. He did not join in filing the adverse claim or in bringing the suit, but with the court's approval came in as a plaintiff before the trial. We think his interest \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 292]\n\u00a0\n was not such as to make him an essential party to the adverse claim or to the suit, and yet was such as to make him an admissible party to either. Of course the acts of those having the title in filing the adverse claim and bringing the suit inured to his benefit. And had they proceeded in his absence to a judgment in their favor the same would have been true of it. But this does not prove that he could not be admitted as a plaintiff. He had an interest-a real interest-in the maintenance and protection of the claim which was the subject of the suit, and in view of the liberal provisions of the local statute, Rev. Laws 1912,  4998, 5000, we think the court did not err in allowing him to come in as a plaintiff. It is not asserted that his presence was prejudicial to the defendant and we perceive no ground for thinking it could have been.\n As respects the Homestake placer, Murray Scott and John J. Healey were the original locators and the title was still in them when the adverse claim was filed and when the suit was begun, unless there be merit in the defendant's contention that Scott's interest had then passed to others under attachment proceedings and that Healey's interest had then passed to his wife. Neither branch of the contention is, in our opinion, well grounded. The attachment proceedings, although commenced before the adverse claim was filed, did not result in a transfer of Scott's title until after the present suit was begun. The purported conveyance of Healey's interest to his wife, to which the defendant directs attention, recites that it was made upon a consideration paid in money at the time, and this is in no wise explained. There is no evidence that the consideration was paid out of any separate property of the wife, or that the conveyance was intended as a gift to her, or that she ever listed the subject of the conveyance as her separate property. In these circumstances, according to the laws of the state, the Healey interest was community property, of which the husband had the 'entire \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 293]\n\u00a0\n management and control' and the 'absolute power of disposition.' He could lease or convey it without the wife's concurrence and could sue in respect of it in his name alone. Rev. Laws 1912,  2155-2160; Crow v. Van Sickle, 6 Nev. 146; Lake v. Bender, 18 Nev. 361, 384, 385, 4 Pac. 711, 7 Pac. 74; Adams v. Baker, 24 Nev. 375, 55 Pac. 362; Malstrom v. People's Ditch Co., 32 Nev. 246, 260, 107 Pac. 98.\n There was here a contract with Thatcher and Forman like that relating to the Guy Davis, and this gave them a real interest in the claim, as already enplained.\n The adverse claim was filed and the suit was brought by Scott, Healey, Thatcher and Forman. Afterwards, and following the consummation of the attachment proceedings, the entire interest of Scott was transferred to Cole, Malley, Ross and Davis, and by reason of this, and with the court's approval, Scott was eliminated as a party and Cole, Malley, Ross and Davis came in as plaintiffs. Thus there was no misjoinder of plaintiffs, nor any failure to join an essential party. Of course, those who succeeded to Scott's interestp ending the suit were entitled to the benefit of what he had done while he held the title.\n In one of the adverse claims Healey's name was given as Frank J. instead of John J., but this was a mere inadvertence, did not mislead or prejudice any one, and rightly was disregarded by the District Court.\n As to the absence of revenue stamps, it is true that the deeds showing title in some of the plaintiffs-they were produced in evidence over the defendant's objection-were without the stamps required by the Act of October 22, 1914, c. 331,  22, Schedule A, 38 Stat. 762. But this neither invalidated the deeds nor made them inadmissible as evidence. The relevant provisions of that act, while otherwise following the language of earlier acts, do not contain the words of those acts which made such an instrument invalid and inadmissible as evidence while not \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 294]\n\u00a0\n properly stamped. Those words were carefully omitted, as will be seen by contrasting sections 6, 11, 12 and 13 of the Act of 1914 with sections 7, 13, 14 and 15 of the Act of 1898, c. 448, 30 Stat. 454. From this and a comparison of the acts in other particulars it is apparent that Congress in the later act departed from its prior practice of making such instruments invalid or inadmissible as evidence while remaining unstamped and elected to rely upon other means of enforcing this stamp provision, such as the imposition of money penalties, fines and imprisonment. The decisions upon which the defendant relies arose under the earlier acts and were based upon the presence in them of what studiously was omitted from the later one.\n As a preliminary to considering other contentions it will be helpful to refer to some features of the mineral land laws, Rev. Stat.  2318 et seq. (Comp. St.  4613 et seq.), about which there can be no controversy, and also to what actually was in dispute at the trial and what not in dispute.\n By those laws public lands containing valuable mineral deposits are opened to exploration, occupation and acquisition for mining purposes; and as an inducement to effective exploration the discoverer is given the right to locate a substantial area embracing his discovery, to hold the same and extract the mineral without payment of rent or royalty, so long as he puts one hundred dollars' worth of labor or improvements-called assessment work-upon the claim each year, and to demand and receive a patent at a small sum per acre after he had put five hundred dollars' worth of labor or improvements upon the claim.\n In advance of discovery an explorer in actual occupation and diligently searching for mineral1 is treated as a licensee or tenant at will, and no right can be initiated or \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 295]\n\u00a0\n acquired through a forcible, fraudulent or clandestine intrusion upon his possession. But if his occupancy be relaxed, or be merely incidental to something other than a diligent search for mineral, and another enters peaceably, and not fraudulently or clandestinely, and makes a mineral discovery and location, the location so made is valid and must be respected accordingly. Belk v. Meagher, \n104 U.S. 279\n, 287; Union Oil Co. v. Smith, \n249 U.S. 337\n, 346-348, 39 Sup. Ct. 308, and cases cited.\n A location based upon discovery gives an exclusive right of possession and enjoyment, is property in the fullest sense, is subject to sale and other forms of disposal, and so long as it is kept alive by performance of the required annual assessment work prevents any adverse location of the land. Gwillim v. Donnellman, \n115 \nU.S. 45, 49\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 1110; Swanson v. Sears, \n224 U.S. 180\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 455.\n While the two kinds of location-lode and placer-differ in some respects,2 a discovery within the limits of the claim is equally essential to both. But to sustain a lode location the discovery must be of a vein or lode of rock in place bearing valuable mineral (section 2320 [Comp. St.  4615]), and to sustain a placer location it must be of some othe form of valuable mineral deposit (section 2329 [Comp. St.  4628]), one such being scattered particles of gold found in the softer covering of the earth. A placer discovery will not sustain a lode location, nor a lode discovery a placer location. As is said by Mr. Lindley,3  323:\n'Gold occurs in veins of rock in place, and when so found the land containing it must be appropriated under the laws applicable to lodes. It is also found in placers, and when so found the lands containing it must be appropriated according to the laws applicable to \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 296]\n\u00a0\n placers.'\n\n And again (section 419):\n'In is the mode of occurrence, whether in place or not in place [ meaning in rock in place], which determines the manner in which it should be located.'\n\n Location is the act or series of acts whereby the boundaries of the claim are marked, etc., but it confers no right in the absence of discovery, both being dessential to a valid claim. Waskey v. Hammer, \n223 \nU.S. 85, 90\n, 91 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 187; Beals v. Cone, 27 Colo. 473, 484, 495, 62 Pac. 948, 83 Am. St. Rep. 92; Round Mountain Mining Co. v. Round Mountain Sphinx Mining Co., 36 Nev. 543, 560, 138 Pac. 71; New England Oil Co. v. Congdon, 152 Cal. 211, 213, 92 Pac. 180. Nor does assessment work take the place of discovery, for the requirement relating to such work is in the nature of a condition subsequent to a perfected and valid claim and has 'nothing to do with locating or holding a claim before discovery.' Union Oil Co. v. Smith, supra, \n249 U.S. 350\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 311. In practice discovery usually precedes location, and the statute treats it as the initial act. But in the absence of an intervening right it is no objection that the usual and statutory order is reversed. In such a case the location becomes effective from the date of discovery; but in the presence of an intervening right it must remain of no effect. Creede & Cripple Creek Mining Co. v. Uinta Tunnel Mining Co., \n196 U.S. 337\n, 348-351, 25 Sup. Ct. 266, and cases cited; Union Oil Co. v. Smith, supra, \n249 U.S. 347\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 308.\n When an application for a patent to mineral land is presented at the local land office and an adverse claim is filed in response to the notice required by the statute (section 2325[Comp. St.  4622]) further proceedings upon the application must be suspended to await the determination by a court of competent jurisdiction of the question whether either party, and, if so, which, has the exclusive right to the possession arising from a valid and subsisting location. A suit appropriate to the occasion must be brought by the adverse claimant, and in that suit each party is deemed an \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 297]\n\u00a0\n actor and must show his own title, for the suit is 'in aid of the land department.' If neither establishes the requisite title the judgment must so declare. Rev. Stat.  2326 (Comp. St.  4623); Act March 3, 1881, c. 140, 21 Stat. 505(Comp. St.  4625); Jackson v. Roby, \n109 U.S. 440\n, 3 Sup. Ct. 301; Perego v. Dodge, \n163 \nU.S. 160, 167\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 971; Brown v. Gurney, \n201 \nU.S. 184, 190\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 509; Healey v. Rupp, 37 Colo. 25, 28, 86 Pac. 1015; Tonopah Fraction Mining Co. v. Douglas (C. C.) 123 Fed. 936, 941. If final judgment be given in favor of either party-whether the applicant for patent or the adverse claimant-he may file in the land office a certified copy of the judgment and then will be entitled, as respects the area awarded to him, to go forward with the patent proceedings and to have the judgment recognized and respected as a binding adjudication of his exclusive right to the possession.

Ct. 289; Iron Silver Mining Co. v. Campbell, \n135 \nU.S. 286, 299\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 765; Last Chance Mining Co. v. Tyler Mining Co., \n157 \nU.S. 683, 694\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 733, 39 L. d . 859; Perego v. Dodge, supra; Clipper Mining Co. v. Eli Mining Co., \n194 \nU.S. 220, 232\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 632.\n The situation developed by the evidence presented and admissions made in the course of the trial was as follows: At the outset the land was public and unappropriated, and it remained such save as the locations in question or some of them may have changed its status. The lode locations were made, one in 1897 and the other two in 1907, and the placer locations in September, 1913. The title under the latter already has been sufficiently traced. That under the lode locations passed to the Glasgow & Western Exploration Company soon after they were made, and the defendant, Ralph, claims under a deed executed by that company's liquidator in 1914. The principal controversy was over the presence or absence of essential discoveries within the lode locations, it being denied on one hand and affirmed on the other that a vein or lode of rock in place bearing valuable mineral was discovered \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 298]\n\u00a0\n in each location before the placer locations were made. It was not controverted, but, on the contrary, conceded, that that point of time was the important one in the inquiry. Thus when the presiding judge indicated his view by saying, 'My idea is that you can't take advantage of any discoveries made since the placer locations, and I don't believe there can be any dispute about that,' counsel for the defendant responded, 'No your honor, there is none,' and on another occasion counsel said, 'We are undoubtedly limited to proving that there was a discovery of mineral in place on each of our lode claims prior to the location of the placer claims.' In all particulars other than discovery the regularity and perfection of the lode locations were conceded. Closely connected with the controversy over lode discoveries was another over the applicability and effect of section 2332 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  4631), but it will be passed for the moment and separately considered later. As to the placer claims, it was shown that they were based upon adequate discoveries of placer gold within their limits, and counsel for the defendant announced, 'We don't deny this ground is of placer character.' Their boundaries were properly marked, and the requisite notices were posted and certificates recorded. The only questions respecting their validity that were presented and need present mention were, first, whether at the time the placer locations were made the lode locations had become valid and effective claims, thereby precluding any adverse location of the same ground, and next, if the lode locations had not then become valid and effective, whether the placer locations were initiated and made through wrongful intrusions or trespasses upon any actual possession of the lode claimant. The defendant, as is admitted in his brief in this court, did not claim that any lode or vein was or should be excepted from the placer claims, but only that they were of no effect for the reasons just indicated. \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 299]\n\u00a0\n The evidence bearing upon the presence or absence of lode discoveries 4 was conflicting. That for the plaintiffs tended persuasively to show the absence of any such discovery before the placer claims were located, while that for the defendant tended the other way. Separately considered, some portions of the latter were persuasive, but it was not without noticeable infirmities, among them the following: The defendant testified that no ore was ever mined upon any of the lode claims, and that 'there was no mineral exposed to the best of my [his] knowledge which would stand the cost of mining, transportation and reduction at a commercial profit.' In the circumstances this tended to discredit the asserted discoveries; and of like tendency was his unexplained statement, referring to the claims grouped in this patent application, that 'some of them have not a smell of ore, but they can be located and held on the principle of being contiguous to adjacent claims'-an obviously mistakn view of the law-and his further statement, referring to vein material particularly relied upon as a discovery, that he 'would hate to try to mine it and ship it.'\n As respects the initiation and working of the placer \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 300]\n\u00a0\n claims, the plaintiffs' evidence indicated that the locators entered openly, made placer discoveries, performed the requisite acts of location, excavated several shafts in the 'wash' from 35 to 57 feet in depth, ran drifts from the bottom along the bedrock, and mined a considerable amount of placer gold; and that these acts covered a period of between two and three months. None of this was contradicted; and there was no evidence that the locators met with any resistance or resorted to any hostile, fraudulent or deceptive acts. But there was evidence of such ownership of buildings, comparatively recent prospecting, and maintenance of a watchman, on the part of the lode claimant5 as made it a fair question whether he was in actual possession when the placer locators entered. That he was in possession of the buildings and the ground where they stood was made certain, but that he had any actual possession beyond that was reasonably debatable under the evidence.\n The buildings were all on the same claim and covered only a part of it. One was a mill formerly in use but then dismantled and stripped of its machinery. All had been used in connection with mining operations upon other claims, but the operations had then been suspended. The buildings were not disturbed by the placer locators, nor was there any attempt to appropriate them. A watchman was in charge, but so far as appears he made no objection to what was done. Although a witness for the defendant and in his employ, he was not interrogated upon this point. Of course, ownership of the buildings did not in itself give the lode claimant any right in the land or prevent others from entering peaceably and in good faith to avail themselves of privileges accorded by the mineral land laws; but the presence of the buildings \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 301]\n\u00a0\n and his relation to them did have a bearing upon the question of actual possession-a pronounced bearing as respects the place where the building stood and a lesser bearing as respects the other ground.\n Even if the lode claimant was in actual possession of all, it still was a disputable question under the evidence whether there had not been such acquiescence in the acts of the placer locators in going upon the ground, making placer discoveries and marking their locations as gave them the status of lawful discoverers and locators rather than wrongful intruders or trespassers, that is to say, the status of explorers entering by permission and then making discoveries. See Crossman v. Pendery (C. C.) 8 Fed. 693.\n The questions of fact to which we have adverted were all submitted to the jury under a charge which was comprehensive, couched in plain terms, and in substantial accord with the legal principles hereinbefore stated. And, while the defendant criticizes some portions of the charge, we think they neither included nor omitted anything of which he rightfully can complain. As has been said, the jury returned general verdicts for the plaintiffs, and also special verdicts finding that no lode had been discovered within any of the lode locations before the placer ones were made.\n But it is objected that the court, instead of requiring the plaintiffs to take the burden of proving the absence of essential lode discoveries, subjected the defendant to the burden of proving that there were such discoveries. This is not in accord with the record. It there appears that the plaintiffs undertook at the outset to establish the absence of any lode discovery and persisted in that course, a large, if not the larger, part of their case in chief being directed to that point. When they rested the defendant moved that the evidence produced by them 'as to the absence of lodes, or the failure or inability of the witnesses to find or discover lodes or mineral-bearing \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 302]\n\u00a0\n rock in place' within the lode locations be stricken out because not within the issues tendered by the plaintiffs' complaints. The motion was denied and in that connection the court observed that the burden 'undoubtedly' was on the plaintiffs not only to show their own placer discoveries, acts of location, etc., but also 'that the ground in dispute was open to location;' and the court added, 'Plaintiffs have, so far as the record discloses, always insisted that there was no lode discovery, and that the only discovery was of placer.' There was also an admission in the defendant's requested instructions that the plaintiffs 'in their case in chief' introduced evidence tending to show that 'the ground comprised in the lode mining claims ... contained no lodes, veins or mineral- bearing rock in place and ... that said lode locations were therefore invalid.' And the court in charging the jury said:\n'The burden is on the plaintiffs in the first instance to show that when they went on these claims to locate the placers the ground was open to location, and that there was at the time no valid, subsisting location where their discoveries were made.'\n\n It therefore is plain that the burden of proof was dealt with and carried in a manner which does not admit of criticism by the defendant.\n It is objected also that the court refused to direct verdicts for the defendant. But what has been said sufficiently shows that, in our opinion, the evidence presented several disputable questions of fact which it was the province of the jury to determine. This was the view not only of the judge who presided at the trial but of another judge who in overruling the motion for a new trial said:\n'I think that not only is there substantial evidence to support the verdict, but the preponderance is upon that side.'\n\n Were we less satisfied than we are upon the point we should hesitate to disturb the concurring conclusions of those judges. \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 303]\n\u00a0\n It is urged that the court erred in not holding that the placer claimants had admitted the validity of one of the lode locations by relocating the ground as a lode claim. A short statement of what was done will show, as we think, that it did not involve any such admission. After the placer claimants made their placer discovery a representative of theirs posted on the ground a notice stating that they had relocated it as a lode claim. The next day he substituted another notice stating that they had located it as a placer claim. The first notice did not accord with their discovery and the other did. Nothing was done or claimed under the first and all the subsequent steps were in accord with the other. Evidently the first was posted by mistake and the other as the true notice. No one was misled by the mistake and it was promptly corrected. In these circumstances, the first notice was of no effect and no admission could be predicated of it. Zeiger v. Dowdy, 13 Ariz. 331, 114 Pac. 565.\n The further objection is made that no probative force was given to recitals of discovery in the recorded notices of location of the lode claims. The notices were admitted in evidence and no instruction was asked or given respecting the recitals. In one nothing is said about discovery, and what is said in the other two is meager. But, passing this, the objection is not tenable. The general rule is that such recitals are mere ex parte self-serving declarations on the part of the locators, and not evidence of discovery.

Fox v. Myers, 29 Nev. 169, 186, 86 Pac. 793; Round Mountain Mining Co. v. Round Mountain Sphinx Mining Co., 36 Nev. 543, 560, 138 Pac. 71.\n Complaint is made because the defendant was not permitted \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 304]\n\u00a0\n on the cross-examination of a witness for the plaintiffs to show the contents of certain assay reports. In his examination in chief the witness told of taking twelve samples from openings made by the lode claimant in the lode locations and of having the samples assayed. Seven of the assay reports were produced at the plaintiffs' request and put in evidence. They attributed to one sample a mineral value of sixty-three cents per ton and to the other six only a trace of mineral. In cross-examining the witness the defendant called for the remaining reports or their contents, but the plaintiffs objected and the objection was sustained. In other respects the cross-examination proceeded without restriction and included a full interrogation of the witness about the points from which each of the twelve samples was taken. This interrogation disclosed that one of the reports put in evidence covered a sample taken from an opening made after the location of the placer claims; and because of this that report was stricken out at the defendant's request and with the plaintiffs' consent. Near the close of the trial the court recalled its prior ruling and announced another more favorable to the defendant. The witness was then recalled and, after some further examination, three of the remaining reports were put in evidence. They attributed to one sample a mineral value of one dollar and thirty-four cents per ton and to the other two only a trace of mineral. Thus of the twelve reports all but two were produced. These two, like the one stricken out, covered samples taken from openings made after the placer claims were located. The defendant did not call for them when the witness was recalled or reserve any exception to the new ruling, and it is more than inferable from the record that he acquiesced in it. Of course, there is no merit in the present complaint.\n What we have said sufficiently disposes of all questions other than that before mentioned respecting the applicability \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 305]\n\u00a0\n and effect of section 2332 of the Revised Statutes, which provides:\n'Where such person or association, they and their grantors, have held and worked their claims for a period equal to the time prescribed by the statute of limitations for mining claims of the state or territory where the same may be situated, evidence of such possession and working of the claims for such period shall be sufficient to establish a right to a patent thereto under this chapter, in the absence of any adverse claim.'\n\n The defendant, conceiving that the section could be invoked in the absence of a mineral discovery, requested the court to instruct the jury that if the lode claimant held and worked the lode claims for a period of two years-the local prescriptive period for adverse possession, Rev. Laws 1912,  4951-before the placer claims were initiated, such holding and working were the full equivalent of all that was essential to the validity of the lode claims, including discovery. That request was refused and others were then presented which differed from it only in that they treated discovery as essential by coupling it with holding and working. These were also refused, but no complaint is made of this-obviously because the jury were told that under the evidence the lode claims should be regarded as valid, if only the requisite discoveries were made at any time before the placer claims were initiated. The jury, as we have seen, found as matter of fact that there was no such discovery.\n The effect which must be given to section 2332, Rev. St., in circumstances such as are here disclosed-whether it substitutes something else in the place of discovery or cures its absence-is the matter we have to consider. That the section is a remedial provision and designed to make proof of holding and working for the prescribed period the legal equivalent of proof of acts of location, recording and transfer, and thereby to relieve against possible loss or \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 306]\n\u00a0\n destruction of the usual means of establishing such acts, is attested by repeatd rulings in the land department and the courts. But those rulings give no warrant for thinking that it disturbs or qualifies important provisions of the mineral land laws, such as deal with the character of the land that may be taken, the discovery upon which a claim must be founded, the area that may be included in a single claim, the citizenship of claimants, the amount that must be expended in labor or improvements to entitle the claimant to a patent, and the purchase price to be paid before the patent can be issued. Indeed, the rulings have been to the contrary.\n The view entertained and applied in the land department is shown in the following excerpt from a decision by the Secretary of the Interior:\n'One purpose of section 2332, ... clearly shown in the history of the proceedings in Congress attending its consideration and passage there, was to lessen the burden of proving the location and transfers of old claims concerning which the possessory right was not controverted but the record title to which had in many instances been destroyed by fire or otherwise lost because of the insecurity and difficulty necessarily attending its preservation during the early days of mining operations. ...\n\n'The section was not intended as enacted, nor as now found in the Revised Statutes, to be a wholly separate and independent provision for the patenting of a mining claim. As carried forward into the Revised Statutes it relates to both lode and placer claims, and being in pari materia with the other sections of the Revision concerning such claims is to be construed together with them, and so as, if possible, that they may all stand together, forming a harmonious body of mining law.' Barklage v. Russell, 29 Land. Dec. 401, 405, 406.\n\n The views entertained by the courts in the mining regions are shown in Harris v. Equator Mining Co. (C. C.) 8 \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 307]\n\u00a0\n Fed. 863, 866, where the court ruled that holding and working a claim for a long period were the equivalent of necessary acts of location, but added that 'this, of course, was subject to proof of a lode in the Ocean Wave ground, of which there was evidence'; in Humphreys v. Idaho Gold Mines Co., 21 Idaho, 126, 140, 120 Pac. 823, 40 L. R. A. (N. S.) 817, where the section was held to obviate the necessity for proving the posting, etc., of a location notice, but not to dispense with proof of discovery; in Upton v. Santa Rita Mining Co., 14 N. M. 96, 89 Pac. 275, where the court held that the section should be construed in connection with other provisions of the mineral land laws, and that it did not relieve a claimant coming within its terms from continuing to do the assessment work required by another section; and in Anthony v. Jillson, 83 Cal. 296, 23 Pac. 419, where the section was held not to change the class who may acquire mineral lands or to dispense with proof of citizenship.\n As respects discovery, the section itself indicates that no change was intended. Its words, 'have held and worked their claims,' presuppose a discovery; for to 'work' a mining claim is to do something toward making it productive, such as developing or extracting an ore body after it has been discovered. Certainly it was not intended that a right to a patent could be founded upon nothing more than holding and prospecting, for that would subject nonmineral land to acquisition as a mining claim. Here, as the verdicts show, there was no discovery, so the working relied upon could not have been of the character contemplated by Congress.\n The defendant places some reliance upon the decisions of this court in Belk v. Meagher, \n104 U.S. 279\n, 26 .L. Ed. 735, and Reavis v. Fianza, \n215 U.S. 16\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 1, but neither contains any statement or suggestion that the section dispenses with a mineral discovery or cures its absence. The opinion in the first shows affirmatively that there was a discovery and that in the other shows that the controversy, although of \n\n[252 U.S. 286, 308]\n\u00a0\n recent origin, related to 'gold mines' which had been worked for mn y years.\n The only real divergence of opinion respecting the section has been as to whether it is available in an adverse suit, such as these are, or is addressed merely to the land department. Some of the courts have held it available only in proceedings in the department (McCowan v. Maclay, 16 Mont. 234, 40 Pac. 602), and others in greater number have held it available in adverse suits (Upton v. Santa Rita Mining Co., supra, and cases cited). The later view has received the approval of this court. Reavis v. Fianza, supra; Belk v. Meagher, supra.\n We conclude that the defendant was not entitled to any instruction whereby he could receive the benefit of section 2332 in the absence of a discovery, and therefore that the District Court rightly refused to give the one in question. The Circuit Court of Appeals held that the instruction should have been given, and in this we think it erred.\n Judgments of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed.\n Judgments of District Court affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As to the status of an explorer or locator on oil-bearing land in advance of discovery, see the special provisions in Act June 25, 1910, c. 421,  2, 30 Stat. 847 (Comp.

Kemp Bartlett, both of Baltimore, Md., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Charles Fox and Donelson Caffery, of New Orleans, La., for marshal and consul general.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are appeals from a single judgment entered by the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana on a petition for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari. The relator had been arrested on extradition proceedings. Each party asks to have reviewed the construction given below to provisions of our treaty with Great Britain, proclaimed August 9, 1842 (8 Stat. 572, 576), and of the supplementary treaty proclaimed April 22, 1901 (32 Stat. 1864). The questions presented are therefore of a character which may be reviewed upon direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 U.S. 447\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 945, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 397. But this court has jurisdiction on writ of error and appeal under that section, as under others, only from final judgments. McLish v. Roff, \n141 U.S. 661\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 118; Heike v. United States, \n217 U.S. 423\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 539. And the rule applies to habeas corpus proceedings. Harkrader v. Wadley, \n172 \nU.S. 148, 162\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 119. The fundamental question whether the judgment appealed from \n\n[252 U.S. 364, 366]\n\u00a0\n is a final one within the meaning of the rule has suggested itself to the court; and it must be answered, although it was not raised by either party. Defiance Water Co. v. Defiance, \n191 \nU.S. 184, 194\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 63. In order to answer the question it is necessary to describe the proceedings before the committing magistrate as well as those in the District Court on the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n In October and November, 1918, the British consul general at New Orleans filed with the Honorable Rufus E. Foster, District Judge of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana, three separate affidavits, each charging that Charles Glen Collins, who was then within the jurisdiction of that court, had committed at Bombay, India, the crime therein described as obtaining property under false pretenses, and that he stood charged therewith in the Chief Presidency Magistrate's Court at Bombay, and asking that he be committed as a fugitive from justice for the purpose of having him returned to India for trial. Warrants of arrest issued, and Collins moved, as to each affidavit, to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, contending that the transactions in question were commercial dealings in which he had merely failed to pay debts incurred. Hearings, entitled 'In the Matter of Extradition Proceedings of Charles Glen Collins,' were had before Judge Foster, at which the consul general and Collins appeared by counsel. Evidence in support of each of the three affidavits was introduced by the consul general. Then Collins, who was sworn at his request, admitted his identity and that he had been present in India at the times each of the alleged crimes were committed. As to one of the charges, that of obtan ing a pearl button from Mohamed Alli Zaimel ali Raza, he was allowed to testify further. But he was not permitted to testify as to matters concerning the other two which had been consolidated. And he was not permitted to introduce other witnesses in defense of any of the three \n\n[252 U.S. 364, 367]\n\u00a0\n affidavits. After the hearings were concluded Judge Foster made two orders or judgments signed by him as Judge of said United States District Court and entitled in said court. In these orders he found, as to each of the affidavits, that he deemed the evidence sufficient to sustain the charge under the law and the treaty, and as to each he ordered Collins recommitted to the House of Detention in the custody of the United States marshal for that district to await the order of the President of the United States. The two proceedings (which included the three affidavits) were then consolidated. Under date of November 27, 1918, a certificate setting forth his findings together with a copy of the record in all the proceedings was transmitted to the Secretary of State.\n This petition for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari was filed by Collins, in said District Court, on January 8, 1919. It set forth the proceedings before Judge Foster on the three affidavits, and alleged that his detention was illegal and in violation of rights secured to him by the treaty; among other reasons because he was refused permission to introduce evidence as above mentioned. District Judge Grubb ordered that the writs issue; and the marshal made return setting forth in substance the facts above recited. The case was heard before Judge Grubb on February 21, 1919, the record before Judge Foster being introduced. On the same day Judge Grubb, without delivering an opinion, entered an order which declared that 'relator's application for habeas corpus is denied' so far as concerned the charge of obtaining the pearl button from Mohamed Alli Zaimel all Raza, and that 'the writs of habeas corpus are granted' so far as the detention was based on the other two charges, but that the relator be remanded to the House of Detention to await further proceedings in said last two named affidavits.\n'And it is further ordered that, as to the said two affidavits last mentioned, this cause be and is hereby remanded \n\n[252 U.S. 364, 368]\n\u00a0\n to the Honorable Rufus E. Foster, judge, to the end that relator be given the opportunity of introducing such evidence as he might offer at a preliminary examination under the law of Louisiana.\n\n Neither party took any action in respect to such further proceedings before Judge Foster. On March 3, 1919, Collins petitioned for leave to appeal, contending that he should have been discharged on all three affidavits and his appeal was allowed. This is case No. 350 on the docket of this court. Later the British consul general petitioned for leave to appeal on the ground that Collins' application should have been definitely denied also as to the commitment on the other two affidavits. His appeal, being No. 351 on the docket of this court, was allowed March 28, 1919\n\n\n First. Was the judgment appealed from a final one? A single petition for a writ of habeas corpus thus sets forth detention of the relator on three separate affidavits. As to the commitment on one of these, the judgment entered by Judge Grubb directed that the writ be 'denied.' Such denial, or more appropriately dismissal, of the writ would obviously have been a final judgment, if it had stood alone. McNamara v. Henkel, \n226 \nU.S. 520, 523\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 146. But the judgment appealed from dealt also with the detention on the other two affidavits. It declared that 'the writs of habeas corpus are granted' as to the commitments on the other two affidavits, and ordered that the case be remanded for further hearing before Judge Foster.\n What was thus called granting the writ was not a discharge of the prisoner, deferred as in In re Medley, \n134 U.S. 160\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 384, and in In re Bonner, \n151 U.S. 242\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 323, 38 L. d . 149; or made conditional as in United States v. Petkos, 214 Fed. 978, 131 C. C. A. 274; Billings v. Sitner, 228 Fed. 315, 142 C. C. A. 607, and Ex Parte Romano (D. C.) 251 Fed. 762; or coupled with other disposition of him as in In re Gut Lun (D. C.) 84 Fed. 323, and \n\n[252 U.S. 364, 369]\n\u00a0\n Ex parte Gytl (D. C.) 210 Fed. 918, 924. It more nearly resembles the kind of an order which an appellate tribunal enters on reversing and remanding the judgment of a lower court upon finding error in its proceedings. But the proceeding before a committing magistrate in international extradition is not subject to correction by appeal. See Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n149 \nU.S. 698, 714\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 1016; Sternaman v. Peck, 80 Fed. 883, 26 C. C. A. 214. Compare United States v. Ferreira, 13 How. 40, 48; The United States, Petitioner, \n194 U.S. 194\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 629. And it is ordinarily beyond the scope of the review afforded by a writ of habeas corpus to correct error in the proceedings. In re Kaine, 14 How. 103, 122; Ex parte Harding, \n120 \nU.S. 782, 784\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 780; Charlton v. Kelly, \n229 \nU.S. 447, 457\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 945, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 397; Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219, 228\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 54. The order resembles, also, that which might be entered by a District Judge after having reviewed the proceedings taking place before a United States commissioner, under the court's authority to assume control in the preliminary stages of matters of which it has the final decision under the law. United States v. Berry (D. C.) 4 Fed. 779, 781; In re Chin K. Shue (D. C.) 199 Fed. 282, 284; The Mary (D. C.) 233 Fed. 121, 124. Compare Todd v. United States, \n158 \nU.S. 278, 282\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 889; United States v. Allred, \n155 \nU.S. 591, 594\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 231; In re Perkins (D. C.) 100 Fed. 950, 954. For an extradition commissioner is an officer of the court which appoints him. See Grin v. Shine, \n187 \nU.S. 181, 187\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 98; In re Grin (C. C.) 112 Fed. 790, 794. But here the extradition commissioner had certified his findings to the Secretary of State before the petition for writ of habeas corpus was filed. Whether, for this reason, the time had not passed when the court could correct the action of its commissioner, except upon reopening of the proceeding before him with the consent of the executive (see 6 Op. Atty. Gen. 91)-or, in other words, whether in such a case the power of the court is not limited to ordering the discharge of the prisoner either absolutely \n\n[252 U.S. 364, 370]\n\u00a0\n or conditionally except upon a rehearing before the commissioner with the consent of the President-this question, we are not required to consider at this time. For the proceeding ordered by Judge Grubb had not been taken; nor had the power sought to be exercised by him been challenged. Nor need we consider whether Judge Grubb, having found that a proper hearing had been denied by the committing magistrate on the two affidavits, might have heard the case de novo, and have determined thereon whether the prisoner should be discharged (compare Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8, 13\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 201; Whitfield v. Hanges, 222 Fed. 745, 746, 138 C. C. A. 199; United States v. Williams [D. C.] 193 Fed. 228), for Judge Grubb did not undertake to do so. The prisoner remained under the authority of the District Court (see Mr. Justice Nelson in In re Kaine, 14 How. 103, 133, 134); and as the writ of habeas corpus had not been disposed of there, so far as concerned the detention on two of the three affidavits, the decision below on that branch of the case was not final.\n Second. A case may not be brought here by appeal or writ of error in fragments. To be appealable, the judgment must be, not only final, but complete. United States v. Girault, 11 How. 22, 32; Holcombe v. McKusick, 20 How. 552, 554; Bostwick v. Brinkerhoff, \n106 \nU.S. 3, 4\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 15 27 L. Ed. 73; Grant v. Phoenix Ins. Co., \n106 \nU.S. 429, 431\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 414; Dainese v. Kendall, \n119 U.S. 53\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 65; Covington v. Covington First National Bank, \n185 \nU.S. 270, 277\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 645; Heike v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 423, 429\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 539; Rexford v. Brunswick-Balke-Collender Co., \n228 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 515. And the rule requires that the judgment to be appealable should be final not only as to all the parties, but as to the whole subject-matter and as to all the causes of action involved. Louisiana Navigation Co. v. Oyster Commission, \n226 \nU.S. 99, 101\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 78; Sheppy v. Stevens, 200 Fed. 946, 119 C. C. A. 330. The seeming exception to this rule by which an adjudication final in its nature of \n\n[252 U.S. 364, 371]\n\u00a0\n matters distinct from the general subject of the litigation, like a claim to property presented by intervening petition in a receivership proceeding, has been treated as final, so as to authorize an appeal without awaiting the termination of the general litigation below (Trust Co. v. Grant Locomotive Works, \n135 \nU.S. 207, 224\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 736; Williams v. Morgan, \n111 \nU.S. 684, 699\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 638; Trustees v. Greenough, \n105 U.S. 527\n), has no application here. Nor have cases like Forgay v. Conrad, 6 How. 201, 204, and Thomson v. Dean, 7 Wall. 342, 345, where decrees finally disposing of property which the successful party was entitled to have carried into execution immediately, were held appealable, although certain accounts pursuant to the decree remained to be settled. Here a single judgment deals with the detention on three affidavits. Only one branch of the case has been finally disposed of below; therefore none of it is ripe for review by this court.\n Third. In what has been said we must not be understood as recognizing the British consul general as the party entitled to appeal from a decision in Collins' favor. For the writ of habeas corpus was directed to the United States marshal, who held Collins in custody, and the marshal was the party in whom rested the right to appeal, if Collins prevailed on final judgment. See Charlton v. Kelly, supra.\n Both appeals are\n Dismissed for want of jurisdiction. \n\n\n\n","33":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOM. OF PENNSYLVANIA v.

GRAND FORKS COUNTY, N. D.(1920)\nNo. 302\nArgued: April 29, 1920Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 325, 326]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Rome G. Brown and Harry S. Carson, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Albert E. Sheets, Jr., and George E. Wallace, both of Bismarck, N. D., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the statutes of North Dakota, as construed by the Supreme Court of the state, a manufacturing corporation organized under its laws is taxed in the following manner: Its real and personal property within the state is assessed like that of an individual. In addition there is assessed against it an amount equal to the aggregate market value of its outstanding stock, less the value of its real and personal property and certain indebtedness. The corporation, in submitting its list of property for purposes of taxation, is required to enter this additional amount as 'bonds and stocks,' under item 23 in the prescribed statutory schedule. On this additional amount, as upon the value of its real and personal property, the corporation is taxed at the same rate and in the same manner as individuals are upon their property. The statute does not in terms impose a franchise tax as distinguished, or separated, from a tax on personal property, but the Supreme Court of \n\n[253 U.S. 325, 327]\n\u00a0\n the state construes the tax upon this additional amount as a tax, 'in substance or effect, to some degree at least, upon the privilege of being a corporation,' or, in other words, a tax upon the corporate franchise granted it by the state. Individuals are not required to include in their lists of taxable property any share or portion of the capital stock or property of any corporation which such corporation is required to list. Compiled Laws of North Dakota for 1913,  2110, 2103, 2102, 2077; County of Grand Forks v. Cream of Wheat Co. (N. D.) 170 N. W. 863.\n The Cream of Wheat Company was incorporated under the laws of North Dakota after the enactment of the tax legislation above described, and it maintained throughout the years 1908 to 1914, both inclusive, a public office in the city of Grand Forks in said state for the transaction of its usual and corporate business. Its manufacturing, commercial, and financial business was conducted wholly without the state, and it had not at any time during any of those years within the state either any tangible property real or personal or any papers by which intangible property is customarily evidenced. Its property, as distinguished from its franchise, is alleged to have been taxed in states other than North Dakota. In 1914 the officials of North Dakota assessed against the company in the manner prescribed by law for each year from 1908 to 1913, both inclusive, a tax at the uniform rate on the sum of $50,000, as representing personal property, to wit, 'bonds and stocks' which had escaped taxation. They also assessed a similar tax for the then current year. The taxes not being paid, this action was brought in a state court for the amount; and the facts above stated were proved. The trial court entered judgment for the defendant; but its judgment was reversed by the Supreme Court of the state, which entered judgment for the county for the full amount of the taxes. The case is here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1214). \n\n[253 U.S. 325, 328]\n\u00a0\n The company concedes that the state of North Dakota might constitutionally have imposed a franchise tax upon a corporation organized under its laws, even though it had no property within the state. The contentions are that the Supreme Court of North Dakota erred in holding that the tax here in question was a franchise tax, that it was in reality a property tax upon intangible property, that the company's intangible property must be deemed to have been located where its tangible property was, and that in taxing property beyond its limits North Dakota violated rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. The view which we take of the matter renders it unnecessary to consider the question whether or not the law under discussion imposed a franchise tax or a property tax. Compare Hamilton Company v. Massachusetts, 6 Wall. 632; Commonwealth v. Hamilton Manufacturing Co., 12 Allen (Mass.) 298. The view also renders it unnecessary to consider whether the company having been incorporated in North Dakota after the enactment of the law in question is in a position to complain. Compare Interstate Railway Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 \nU.S. 79, 84\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 26, 12 Ann. Cas. 555; International & Great Northern Railway Co. v.

The fact that its property and business were entirely in another state did not make it any the less subject to taxation in the state of its domicile. The limitation imposed by the Fourteenth Amendment is merely that a state may not tax a resident for property which has acquired a permanent situs beyond its boundaries. This is the ground on which the ferry franchise involved in Louisville & Jeffersonville Ferry Co. v. Kentucky, \n\n[253 U.S. 325, 329]\n\u00a0\n \n188 U.S. 385\n, 23 Sup.

Cas. 493, were held immune from taxation by the states in which the companies were incorporated. The limitation upon the power of taxation does not apply even to tangible personal property without the state of the corporation's domicile, if, like a seagoing vessel, the property has no permanent situs anywhere. Southern Pacific Co. v. Kentucky, \n222 \nU.S. 63, 68\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 13. Nor has it any application to intangible property (Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, \n199 U.S. 205\n, 26 Sup.

Cas. 1916C, 842), even though the property is also taxable in another state by virtue of having acquired a 'business situs' there (Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54, 59\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 40, L. R. A. 1918C, 124). As stated in that case:\n'It is unnecessary to consider whether the distinction between a tax measured by certain property and a tax on that property could be invoked in a case like this. Flint v. Stone-Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 146\n, 162 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas 1912B, 1312, et seq. Whichever this tax technically may be, the authorities show that it must be sustained.'\n\n Counsel for the company direct our attention to cases like Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, \n165 \nU.S. 194, 227\n, 17 S. Sup. Co. 305, and \n166 U.S. 185\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 604, which hold that a state may tax a foreign corporation, not only on the value of its tangible property within the state, but also on that proportion of its entire \n\n[253 U.S. 325, 330]\n\u00a0\n intangible property which is fairly represented by and must be included, in order to place a just value on the tangible property located and the business transacted there. The conclusion drawn by them is that the situs of the intangible property must be with the tangible; otherwise, they say, we must hold that it is in two places at once and that it may be subjected to double taxation. To this it is sufficient to say that the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit double taxation. Coe v. Errol, \n116 \nU.S. 517, 524\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 475; Kidd v.

NORTHERN OHIO TRACTION & LIGHT CO.(1920)\nNo. 102\nArgued: March 17, 1920Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 388, 389]\n\u00a0\n The appeal is direct to this court, the laws and Constitution of the United States being asserted to be involved. Upon motion of defendants ( appellees) the bill was dismissed for want of jurisdiction and equity. Its allegations, therefore, become necessary to consider.\n Plaintiff (appellant) was incorporated as a hydroelectric power company on May 29, 1908, for the purposes specified in the act of the Legislature of Ohio, passed in 1904, and contained in sections 10128 and 10134 of the Ohio General Code of 1910\n\n\n The articles of incorporation filed May 29, 1908, with the Secretary of State, specified the streams across which the dams were to be built and maintained; that is, the streams in controversy, the Big Cuyahoga river and certain of its tributaries.\n By said incorporation a contract was duly made and entered into between the state and plaintiff whereby the state granted to plaintiff a right of way over and along the \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 390]\n\u00a0\n Cuyahoga river between the designated terminia nd a vested right and franchise to construct, maintain, and operate, within the limits of the right of way, a hydroelectric plant for the development of electric current and energy from the waters of the river, together with a right or franchise to exercise the state's power of eminent domain in order to appropriate and acquire property necessary to carry out and perform the grant and make it effective. The grant has not been repealed.\n The grants were accepted and are of great value, and upon the faith of that the capital stock of plaintiff was subscribed for, and large expenditures and investments made and obligations incurred, including bonds of the par value of $150,000, and stock to the value of $210,000, all in a large part prior to December, 1910.\n On June 4, 1908, plaintiff by its board of directors adopted a specific and detailed plan for the development of the power and sale of the same to the public, and definitely located its proposed improvements for that purpose upon specifically described lands, which had previously been entered upon and surveyed by its engineers, and then and there declared and resolved that the parcels of land were necessary to carry out the purpose of the plaintiff's organization and that it thereby appropriated and demanded them for its corporate purposes. The parcels of land described in the resolution include all that were necessary for the purpose of the corporation, and the location of the improvement so fixed by the resolution was permanent and irrevocable, and conclusive upon plaintiff and all other persons, except as the same might be altered by further act of the state.\n June 5, 1908, the plaintiff instituted a suit in the court of proper jurisdiction, to condemn or appropriate in accordance with the statutes of Ohio, the parcels of land mentioned in the resolution, and the persons owning the same were made parties. The suit was continuously pend- \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 391]\n\u00a0\n ing until a date subsequent to July 18, 1911, but at the instance and request of one of the owners of the parcels and of the Northern Ohio Traction & Light Company, called the Traction Company, the suit was not pressed for trial against them until January, 1911, up to which date certain negotiations in regard to the improvement of the company were proposed, but finally terminated in the refusal of the owner of the land and the Traction Company to sell the land to plaintiff.\n December 20, 1910, pending the suit and negotiations, the landowner executed a deed of the lands to the Northern Realty Company, conveying to it a fee-simple title.\n January 20, 1911, after unsuccessful negotiations with the Realty Company, plaintiff instituted another suit for the condemnation of the land, which suit was prosecuted in the probate court (the court of jurisdiction) and is now pending in the Supreme Court of the United States, undetermined, to which court it was carried by a writ of error from the Court of Appeals of Ohio.\n January 31, 1911, and while the suit above mentioned was pending, the Realty Company conveyed the land, that had been conveyed to it, to the Northern Ohio Power Company, and the latter company conveyed that and other land which it had acquired, and all of its properties, rights, and franchises, to the Traction Company, and the latter company entered upon the lands, and now holds possession of them and of the improvements erected thereon.\n Prior to January 20, 1911, no location or improvement upon the lands above designated was made for the purpose of utilizing them in the development of power and they were actually employed for no use whatsoever, except a small wooden structure intended and occasionally used for dances and roller skating, a small portion of which structure was within all of the parcels.\n Between January 31, 1911, and February 24, 1914, there \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 392]\n\u00a0\n was erected upon the lands designated a power house and other appliances for the generation of electric current and energy by means of steam power, also a dam, a powerhouse, and other appliac es for the generation of electric current and energy by the flow and fall of the waters of the river.\n (There is an allegation of the capacity of the plants which may be omitted. Other allegations in regard to the various companies and the powers they possess and do not possess also may be omitted. It is only necessary to say that it is alleged that the Power Company had not, and the Traction Company has not, power to use the designated lands or the waters of the river to operate the steam power plant and the hydroelectric plant, or for the development of such powers, and therefore neither company had power to excrcise eminent domain for such purposes, though asserting its right and intention to do so, and, if it should do so, it would invade and injure rights of plaintiff, 'inflicting upon the plaintiff and the persons interested therein a continuing and irreparable injury, for which there is no adequate remedy at law.')\n From and after the time of the adoption of the resolution of June 4, 1908, the designated parcels of land were subjected to plaintiff's public use and its rights and franchises, exclusive of all other persons and corporations; that such rights and franchises were granted to plaintiff by the state Ohio under and by authority of plaintiff's contract with the state, and for the protection of which plaintiff is entitled to, and claims, the protection of the Constitution of the United States and of the amendments thereof, as well as section 5 of article 13 of the Constitution of the state of Ohio.\n The effect and result of the Traction Company's use of the designated parcels of land and of the waters of the river is an appropriation by it of the rights and franchises of plaintiff and the deprivation of its property for private \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 393]\n\u00a0\n use without compensation and without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, and an impairment of the contract of plaintiff with the state of Ohio within the meaning of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States.\n Plaintiff has at all times, and since its incorporation, actively and diligently and in good faith proceeded to carry out and accomplish its corporate purpose.\n In April, 1909, the plaintiff amended its resolution of June 4, 1908, and enlarged its proposed plant and the output and product thereof and obtained a grant from the state over the additional portion or section of the Cuyahoga river, so as to carry out the amended plan, and it provides for the utilization of the designated parcels of land necessary to the plaintiff's rights and franchises. (The additional capacity is alleged.)\n The prayer is that plaintiff's rights and franchises be established and adjudged; that the proceedings complained of be decreed a violation of the plaintiff's rights, and of the Constitution of Ohio and the Constitution of the United States, and a taking of its property without due process of law, and that an injunction be granted against their further exercise, that defendants be required to remove the structures and devices already erected upon the lands, or to convey them to the plaintiff, and that a receiver be appointed to take possession of the lands and structures. An accounting is also prayed, and general relief.\n Mr. Carroll G. Walter, of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. John E. Morley, of Cleveland, Ohio, J. S. Clark, of Philadelphia, Pa., and S. H. Tolles and Thomas H. Hogsett, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellees. \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 394]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA after stating the case as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n As we have said, a motion was made to dismiss the bill. The grounds of the motion were that there was no jurisdiction in the court, the controversy not arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that the bill did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against defendants or either of them.\n There is an assertion, in words, of rights under the Constitution of the United State, and the only question now presented is whether the assertion is justified by the allegations of the bill. Putting the question concretely, or rather the contention which constitutes its foundation, the District Court said:\n'The contention of the plaintiff is that by virtue of its charter, it has appropriated the potentialities of the river and its tributaries within the boundaries by it designated in its resolution of improvement, and that it is entitled, because of its incorporation under the general laws of the state, to exclude any use of the water power of these streams of the nature of the use which it anticipates enjoying in the future while it proceeds, however dilatorily, to make its improvements in detail and to complete its ambitious scheme. In brief, its proposition is that its charter is equivalent to a contract with the state of Ohio giving it the exclusive right to the employment of the benefits which nature has conferred upon the public through the forces of these streams to the end that, until it finds itself able to completely occupy all the territory which it has privately designated to be necessary for its use, the public shall not have the advantage of any portion not immediately occupied by it through the employment of the resources thereof by another public utility company.'\n\n The court rejected the contention holding that it was not tenable under the law and Constitution of Ohio. To \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 395]\n\u00a0\n sustain this view the court cited prior Ohio cases, and certain cases on the docket of the court, and, as an inference from them, declared that it was-\n'not true in Ohio that the character of complainant gave to it 'a vested right seemingly unlimited in time to exclude the rest of the world from the water sheds it chose' simply by declaring by resolution just what territory it hoped in the future to occupy to carry out its purposes.'\n\n And further:\n'The terms of section 19, article 1, of the Ohio Constitution militate against the plaintiff's claim. Until appropriation is completed as provided by the condemnation laws of the state, the Traction Company's right to dominion over its holdings is inviolate. Wagner v. Railway Co., 38 Ohio St. 32.'\n\n The court also cited Sears v. City of Akron, \n246 U.S. 242\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 245 (then just delivered), expressing the view that, if the case had been brought to the court's attention sooner, a less extended discussion of the motion to dismiss could have been made.\n We concur with the District Court, both in its reasoning and its deductions from the cited cases. The contention of plaintiff is certainly a bold one, and seemingly erects into a legal principle that unexecuted intention, or partly executed intention, has the same effect as executed intention, and that the declaration of an enterprise gives the same right as its consummation. Of course, there must be a first step in every project as well as a last step, and in enterprises like those we are considering there may be attainment under the local law of a right invulnerable to opposing assertion. And this plaintiff contends. To be explicit it contends that as against the Power Company and the Traction Company, they being its competitors in the same field of enterprise, its resolution of June 4, 1908, constituted an appropriation of the waters of the river, and a definite location of 'its proposed improvement for that purpose upon specifically described parcels of land previously entered upon and surveyed by its engineers.' Whether the \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 396]\n\u00a0\n resolution had that effect under the Ohio laws we are not called upon to say. Indeed, we are not so much concerned with the contention as the ground of it. Plaintiff alleges as a ground of it, a contract with the state of Ohio, by its incorporation, 'wherein and whereby said state duly granted to the plaintiff a right of way over and along said Cuyahoga river' between the designated termini, with the rights and franchises which we have mentioned, together 'with the right or franchise to exercise the state's power of eminn t domain in order to appropriate and acquire all property necessary to carry out and perform said grant and make the same effective' and that the acts of defendants, having legislative sanction of the state, impair plaintiff's contract.\n It is manifest, therefore, that the determining and effective element of the contention is the charter of the state, and plaintiff has proceeded in confidence in it against adverse adjudications. One of the adjudications is Sears v. City of Akron, supra. The elemental principle urged here was urged there; that is, there was urged there, as here, that the charter of the company constituted a contract with the state, and that the contract was to a conclusive effect executed by the resolution of the board of directors of plaintiff on June 4, 1908, such resolution constituting an appropriation of the lands described therein, they being necessary to be acquired in order to construct and maintain the improvement specified in the plaintiff's charter and resolution. The principle was rejected, and it was decided that the incorporation of plaintiff was not a contract by the state with reference to the riparian rights, and that if plaintiff acquired riparian rights, or specific rights in the use and flow of the water, that 'would be property acquired under the charter, not contract rights expressed or implied in the grant of the charter.'\n The case is determinative of the plaintiff's contention here, and it is manifest, if plaintiffs have any rights, they \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 397]\n\u00a0\n are against defendants as rival companies, or against them as landowners, rights under the charter, not by the charter, considered as a contract express or implied. The District Court recognized the distinction and confined its decree accordingly. The court refused to speculate as to what plaintiff might be able to do hereafter in the assertion of rights against the Traction Company, but declared that it was against public policy to accede to the contention of plaintiff that, in the absence of specific acquirement, it (plaintiff) could prevent an owner of property within its territory from occupying or using the same without condemnation proceedings being had, and compensation paid or secured for such property.\n The court, therefore, was considerate of the elements of the case and of plaintiff's rights, both against defendants as rival companies or as landowners, and necessarily, as we have said, if either or both of them be regarded as involved in the case, its or their assertion cannot be made in a federal court unless there be involved a federal question, and a federal question, not in mere form, but in substance, and not in mere assertion, but in essence and effect. The federal questions urged in this case do not satisfy the requirement. The charter as a contract is the plaintiff's reliance primarily and ultimately. Independent of that, it has no rights or property to be taken; that is, independently of the resolution of June 4, 1908, there was no appropriation or condemnation of the land. Wagner v. Railway Co., 38 Ohio St. 32.\n Having nothing independently of its charter and the resolution of June 4, 1908, it could be divested of nothing, and it must rely upon the assertion of a contract and the impairment of it by the state, or some agency of the state, exercising the state's legislative power. That there is such agency is the contention, but what it is exactly it is not easy to say. We, however, pick out of the confusion of the bill, with the assistance of plaintiff's brief, that the rights \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 398]\n\u00a0\n it acquired, and by what they are impaired, are as follows: By the resolution of June 4, 1908, the lands described in the bill (Exhibit A) became, and ever since have been, subjected to plaintiff's public use, and subject to its rights of way and franchises, exclusive of all other persons or corporations, that the Traction Company asserts and claims that by reason of purchases of the rights and franchises of the Northern Ohio Power Company sanctioned by the orders of the Pul ic Unilities Commission as set forth in the bill, and the construction by it (the Traction Company) of power plants upon the designated tracts of land, they, the tracts of land, have become subject to a public use and cannot be appropriated by plaintiff. And it is said (in the brief) that the Traction Company bases its claim upon the state laws; that is, the incorporation of the defendant Power Company and the Public Utilities Commission's orders.\n It is manifest that there was no state legislative or other action against any charter rights which plaintiff possessed. What the Traction Company may or does claim cannot be attributed to the state (its incorporation antedated that of plaintiff), and it would be a waste of words to do more than say that the incorporation of plaintiff under the general laws of the state did not preclude the incorporation of the Power Company under the same general laws. What rights, if any, the Power Company thereby acquired against plaintiff, is another question. There remains then, only the order of the Public Utilities Commission, authorizing the conveyance by the Power Company of the latter's rights and franchises to the Traction Company, to complain of as an impairment of plaintiff's asserted contract. But here again we are not disposed to engage in much discussion. The commission's order may or may not have been the necessary condition to a conveyance by the Power Company of whatever rights it had to the Traction Company. Section 614-60, Page & Adams Ohio General \n\n[252 U.S. 388, 399]\n\u00a0\n Code. The order conferred no new rights upon the Power Company, which that company could or did convey to the Traction Company, nor give them a sanction that they did not have, nor did it affect any rights of the plaintiff.\n From every federal constitutional standpoint, therefore, the contentions of plaintiff are so obviously without merit as to be colorless, and whatever controversies or causes of action it had were against the defendant companies as rivals in eminent domain, or as owners of the lands, and diversity of citienship not existing, the District Court of the United States had no jurisdiction.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice CLARKE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","36":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDE REES v. COSTAGUTA(1920)\nNo. 341\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 166, 167]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Marion Erwin and Frederick M.

Merritt, of New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 166, 169]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, plaintiff below, a resident and citizen of the state of New Jersey, filed a bill of complaint against David Costaguta, Marcos A. Algiers, Alajandro Sassoli, and Eugenio Ottolenghi, individually and as copartners composing the firm of David Costaguta & Co., asserting that they, and each of them, were aliens, and residents of the republic of Argentine, South America. The bill joined as defendants Renado Taffell, a British subject, resident of New York and the Southern district thereof, and the American-European Trading Corporation, organized under the laws of New York.\n The bill sets forth at length a contract whereby it is alleged that a copartnership was formed between the plaintiff and David Costaguta & Co., for the buying and selling of hosiery. The bill alleges that to carry the contract into effect a place of business was established in New York City; that disagreements arose between the parties; that plaintiff elected to terminate the contract and demanded a liquidation of the merchandise and an accounting; that the firm of David Costaguta & Co., caused the American- European Corporation to be organized under the laws of New York, and that said firm caused certain assets of the copartnership to be transferred to the corporation in fraud of the plaintiff, and which assets, it was alleged, were within the territorial jurisdiction of \n\n[254 U.S. 166, 170]\n\u00a0\n the Southern district of New York. Plaintiff prayed a dissolution of the alleged copartnership; the liquidation of the property thereof; that the nonresident defendants account for their acts and transactions, and that it be established what sum, if any, remained due to the plaintiff; that the plaintiff be decreed to have a lien on all of the property of the defendants and on the property and assets of the American-European Trading Corporation; that a receiver pendente lite be named. An order was prayed for the delivery of the property to the receiver, and an injunction to restrain its transfer or disposition. A temporary restraining order was asked pending the hearing and the return of the rule nisi, prohibiting in any manner or form interference with the property, or removing the same from the jurisdiction of the court. An order was issued requiring the defendants to show cause why such receiver pendente lite should not be appointed, and the defendants required to transfer the property to such receiver, and enjoining them from otherwise transferring the same. The subpoena and order for the rule were served on the resident defendants American-European Trading Corporation and Taffell. Plaintiff then procured an order for service upon the nonresident defendants by publication under section 57 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1039). The nonresident defendants filed a special appearance for the purpose of asking the court to quash and set aside the order for service by publication, and for an order requiring the plaintiff to show cause why an order should not be made vacating and setting aside the service by publication, and also to vacate, quash, and set aside certain alleged service on an agent of the firm in the Southern District of New York. A motion was also made by the American-European Trading Corporation and Taffell, by special appearance, for the purpose of opposing the jurisdiction. The District Court denied the plaintiff's motion for an injunction and receiver, and granted the nonresident \n\n[254 U.S. 166, 171]\n\u00a0\n DEFENDANTS' MOTION TO VACATE THE ORDER FOr service by publication. this resulted in the dismissal of the plaintiff's bill by final decree, and the case was brought here by the plaintiff under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) upon the question of jurisdiction of the court.\n The District Judge after entering the decrees of dismissal made a certificate as follows:\n'I hereby certify that said decrees were entered solely because the case as made by the bill did not set forth a legal or equitable claim to or lien on the property in the district, of which this court would have jurisdiction within the meaning of section 57 of the Judicial Code, or in which this court could render a judgment otherwise than a judgment in personam against the nonresident aliens who appeared specially and objected to the jurisdiction of the court.'\n\n The judge also delivered an opinion, which is in the record, holding that under the terms of the contract the plaintiff had no right in the assets as such, and no partner's lien upon the property, but was confined to his rights in personam against the firm, and that, therefore, there could be no service by publication under section 57 of the Judicial Code. That section is a re-enactment of section 8 of the Act of March 3, 1875, 18 Stat. 472. It provides for service by publication when in any suit commenced in any district court of the United States to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon, or claim to, or to remove any incumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to real or personal property within the district where such suit is brought, one or more of the defendants therein shall not be an inhabitant of or found within the said district, or shall not voluntarily appear thereto.1\n Section 238 of the Judicial Code provides that, the case \n\n[254 U.S. 166, 172]\n\u00a0\n being one in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue, that question shall be certified to this court.\n The appellees challenge the jurisdiction of this court to entertain this appeal on the ground that the case does not present a jurisdictional issue properly reviewable by this court. \n\n[254 U.S. 166, 173]\n\u00a0\n Since the decision of Shepard v. Adams, \n168 U.S. 618\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 214, it has been the accepted doctrine that where there is a contention that no valid service of process has been made upon the defendant, and the judgment is rendered without jurisdiction over the person, such judgment can be reviewed by direct appeal to this court. This principle was restated and previous cases cited as late as Merriam v. Saalfield, \n241 \nU.S. 22, 26\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 477.\n It is equally well settled that where the question of jurisdiction presented and decided turns upon questions of general law, determinable upon principles alike applicable to actions brought in other jurisdictions, the jurisdiction of the court as a federal court is not presented in such wise as to authorize the jurisdictional appeal directly to this court, and the question must be decided as other questions are, by the usual course of appellate procedure, giving review in the Circuit Court of Appeals.

Ct. 810; Darnell v. Illinois Central R. R. Co ., \n225 U.S. 243\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 760; Public Service Co. v. Corboy, \n250 \nU.S. 153, 162\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 440.\n The opinion of the court below, read in connection with the certificate, shows that it was held that the contract set up in the bill gave no lien upon or right in rem in the assets sought to be reached within the district. The question was presented, the court in the exercise of jurisdiction, after an examination of the contract set forth in the bill and a consideration of its terms, determined it \n\n[254 U.S. 166, 174]\n\u00a0\n upon principles which would have been equally applicable had the question been presented in other jurisdictions. Its decision, therefore, did not involve the jurisdiction of the federal court as such, which, it is settled, is required in order to justify a direct appeal to this court.\n In Chase v. Wetzlar, \n225 U.S. 79\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 659, the Act Of March 3, 1875, now section 57 of the Judicial Code, was involved, and there was an attempt to have service on alien defendants by publication under the provisions of the statute. The issue made was as to whether there was property of the defendants within the jurisdiction of the court. That issue was held to present a question of jurisdiction properly reviewable in this court under section 238. In the case now presented no question is made as to the presence of property in the district. The attempted service was set aside, and the bill dismissed, upon consideration of the allegations of the bill which, it was held, upon application of general principles, did not show that the plaintiff had any lien upon or interest in the property authorizing him to invoke the procedure outlined in section 57 of the Judicial Code.\n As to the contention that the whole case is here upon a constitutional question becuase of the procedure in the court below, section 238 provides that when a case comes here upon a question of jurisdiction, that question alone shall be certified. Moreover, we find no merit in the alleged deprivation of constitutional rights so as to present questions arising under the Constitution.\n It follows that the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n Dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 57: 'When in any suit commenced in any District Court of the United States to enforce any legal or equitable lien upon or claim to, or to remove any incumbrance or lien or cloud upon the title to real or personal property within the district where such suit is brought, one or more of the defendants therein shall not be an inhabitant of or found within the said district, or shall not voluntarily appear thereto, it shall be lawful for the court to make an order directing such absent defendant or defendants, to appear, plead, answer, or demur by a day certain to be designated which order shall be served on such absent defendant or defendants, if practicable wherever found, and also upon the person or persons in possession or charge of said property, if any there be; or where such personal service upon such absent defendant or defendants is not practicable, such order shall be published in such manner as the court may direct, not less than once a week for six consecutive weeks.

STATE OF NEW JERSEY(1920)\n\nArgued: January 5, 1920Decided: January 12, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Everett V. Abbot, of New York City, for complainant. \n\n[251 U.S. 311, 312]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas F. McCran, of Paterson, N. J., for defendant State of New jersey.\n Mr. Solicitor General Alexander C. King, of Atlanta, Ga., for other defendants.\n\n Memorandum opinion by Mr. Chief Justice WHITE, by direction of the Court.\n The complainant, a citizen of New Jersey, asked leave to file an original bill against the Attorney General of the \n\n[251 U.S. 311, 313]\n\u00a0\n United States, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue thereof and the United States District Attorney for the District of New Jersey, as well as against the state of New Jersey. The bill sought an injunction restraining the United States officials named and the state of New Jersey, its officers and agents, from in any manner directly or indirectly enforcing the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, any law of Congress or statute of the state to the contrary, on the ground that that amendment was void from the beginning and formed no part of the Constitution.\n Answering a rule to show cause why leave to file the bill should not be granted, if any there was, the defendants, including the state of New Jersey, denied the existence of jurisdiction to entertain the cause and this is the first question for consideration.\n So far as the controversy concerns the officials of the United States, it is obvious that the bill presents no question within the original jurisdiction of this court, and in effect that is not disputed, since in substance it is conceded that the bill would not present a case within our original jurisdiction, if it were not for the presence of the state of New Jersey as a defendant. But it has been long since settled that the whole sum of the judicial power granted by the Constitution to the United States does not embrace the authority to entertain a suit brought by a citizen against his own state without its consent. Hans v. Louisiana, \n134 U.S. 1\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 504; North Carolina v. Temple, \n134 U.S. 22\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 509; California v. Southern Pacific Co., \n157 U.S. 229\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 591; Fitts v. McGhee, \n172 \nU.S. 516, 524\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 269.\n It is urged, however, that although this may be the general rule, it is not true as to the original jurisdiction of this court, since the second clause of section 2, article 3, of the Constitution, confers original jurisdiction upon this court 'in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party. ...' In \n\n[251 U.S. 311, 314]\n\u00a0\n other words, the argument is that the effect of the clause referred to is to divest every state of an essential attribute of its sovereignty by subjecting it without its consent to be sued in every case if only the suit is originally brought in this court. Here again the error arises from treating the language of the clause as creative of jurisdiction instead of confining it to its merely distributive significance according to the rule long since announced as follows:\n'This second clause distributes the jurisdiction conferred in the previous one into original and appellate jurisdiction, but does not profess to confer any. The original jurisdiction depends solely on the character of the parties, and is confined to the cases in which are those enumerated parties and those only.' Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 251, 256 (44 L. Ed. 347).\n\n That is to say, the fallacy of the contention consists in overlooking the fact that the distribution which the clause makes relates solely to the grounds of federal jurisdiction previously conferred and hence solely deals with cases in which the original jurisdiction of this court may be resorted to in the exercise of the judicial power as previously given. In fact, in view of the rule now so well settled as to be elementary, that the federal jurisdiction does not embrace the power to entertain a suit brought against a state without its consent, the contention now insisted upon comes to the proposition that the clause relied upon provides for the exercise by this court of original jurisdiction in a case where no federal judicial power is conferred.\n As the want of jurisdiction to entertain the bill clearly results, it follows that the permission to file must be and it is denied, and our order is:\n Rule discharged. \n\n\n\n","38":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUNBAR V CITY OF NEW YORK(1920)\nNo. 160\nArgued: January 21, 1920Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Marold G. Aron and Henry M. Wise, both of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. William Herbert King, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error, to whom we shall refer as plaintiff, is the owner of certain real property and a building thereon \n\n[251 U.S. 516, 517]\n\u00a0\n in the city of New York which she leased to William Hills and William Hills, Jr., copartners doing business under the the style of William Hills, Jr. The lessee covenanted to pay the charges for water which should be assessed against or imposed upon the building during the lease, and if not so paid it should be added to the rent then due or to become due.\n The copartnership was subsequently adjudged bankrupt and at the time of the petition was indebted to the city in the sum of $379.89 for water supplied as measured by two meters which had been installed in the property.\n The city proved no claim in bankruptcy and a motion by plaintiff for an order directing the trustee to pay the water charges as a tax entitled to preference under the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9585-9656) was denied on the ground that they were not a tax.\n The plaintiff then brought this action to cancel the charge as a lien upon the property and prayed an injunction against its enforcement.\n The contention against the charge of the city and the lien it asserts is that they are in violation of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States and because they deprive plaintiff of property without due process of law.\n Plaintiff's argument is somewhat difficult to state briefly. It commences by declaring that the question presented was left open in Provident Institution v. Jersey City, \n113 U.S. 506\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 612, whic sustained the postponement of mortgages to the lien of water rents because it was said in that case that the complainant in the case knew what the law was when the mortgages were taken, and therefore 'its own voluntary act, its own consent,' was 'an element in the transaction.'\n Counsel assumes that the case presented an instance of an express consent. In that counsel is mistaken. The consent was implied from the fact that the law imposing \n\n[251 U.S. 516, 518]\n\u00a0\n the water rents preceded the mortgages. And so in the water charge in controversy it was imposed and made a lien on plaintiff's property by the charter of the city, and therefore the Supreme Court at the first instance and afterwards in Appellate Division, and we may assume by the Court of Appeals, decided that the consent of plaintiff could be implied, and any other conclusion would have been impossible. A city without water would be a desolate place and if plaintiff's property was in such situation it would partake of the desolation. And as a supply of water is necessary it is only an ordinary and legal exertion of government to provide means for its compulsory compensation.\n It is of no consequence, therefore, at whose request the meters were installed in the property. The meters, as observed by the Appellate Division, were 'not the instrumentalities for furnishing the water'; they only registered its consumption. And, besides, the lease made by plaintiff contemplated the use of water by the lessees and provided, as far as the lessor (plaintiff) could, for the payment of the charges for it. That her tenants defaulted in their obligation by reason of their bankruptcy was her misfortune, but it did not relieve the property, which we may say, would be unfit for human habitance if it could not get water.\n Counsel appear to rely on prior decisions of the court for relief of plaintiff; one in the Supreme Court, in which, it is said, a doubt was intimated whether a statute making a lessor liable for the personal debt of a lessee for water would be constitutional; and one in the Court of Appeals, which, to quote counsel, 'having decided in 1910, three years prior to the inception of the charges for which the lien is claimed, that the statute meant what the earlier case had suggested, the lien became unconstitutional,' and plaintiff cannot be charged with an 'implication of assent' to it. Without attempting an estimate of the \n\n[251 U.S. 516, 519]\n\u00a0\n contertion it is enough to say that the decision in this case and other cases are opposed to the contention, and that besides no constitutional rights can be based on the error of prior decisions. \n\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDUPLEX PRINTING PRESS CO. v.

Mulholland, of Toledo, Ohio, for appellees.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 443, 460]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit in equity brought by appellant in the District Court for the Southern District of New York for an injunction to restrain a course of conduct carried on by defendants in that district and vicinity in maintaining a boycott against the products of complainant's factory, in furtherance of a conspiracy to injure and destroy its good will, trade, and business-especially to obstruct and destroy its interstate trade. There was also a prayer for damages, but this has not been pressed and calls for no further mention. Complainant is a Michigan corporation, and manufactures printing presses at a factory in Battle Creek, in that state, employing about 200 machinists in the factory, in addition to 50 office employees, traveling salesmen, and expert machinists or road men, who supervise the erection of the presses for complainant's customers at their various places of business. The defendants who were brought into court and answered the bill are Emil J. Deering and William Bramley, sued individually and as business agents and representatives of District No. 15 of the International Association of Machinists, and Michael T. Neyland, sued individually and as business agent and representative of Local Lodge No. 328 of the same association. The Dis trict \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 461]\n\u00a0\n Council and the Lodge are unincorporated associations having headquarters in New York City, with numerous members resident in that city and vicinity. There were averments and proof to show that it was impracticable to bring all the members before the court and that the named defendants properly represented them; and those named were called upon to defend for all, pursuant to equity rule 38 (\n226 U.S. 659\n, 33 Sup. Ct. xxix). Other jurisdictional averments need no particular mention. The District Court, on final hearing, dismissed the bill (247 Fed. 192), the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed its decree (252 Fed. 722, 164 C. C. A. 562), and the present appeal was taken.\n The jurisdiction of the federal court was invoked both by reason of diverse citizenship and on the ground that defendants were engaged in a conspiracy to restrain complainant's interstate trade and commerce in printing presses, contrary to the Sherman Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890, c. 647, 26 Stat. 209. (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830). The suit was begun before but brought to hearing after the passage of the Clayton Act of October 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730. Both parties invoked the provisions of the latter act, and both courts treated them as applicable. Complainant relied also upon the common law; but we shall deal first with the effect of the acts of Congress.\n The facts of the case and the nature of the relief prayed are sufficiently set forth in the report of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals. 252 Fed. 722, 164 C. C. A. 562. The case was heard before Circuit Judges Rogers and Hough and District Judge Learned Hand. Judge Rogers, although in the minority, stated the case and the pleadings for the court (252 Fed. 723-727, 164 C. C. A. 562), and delivered an opinion for reversal in which he correctly outlined (252 Fed. 734-737 164 C. C. A. 562) the facts as shown by the undisputed evidence-defendants having introduced none. Judges Hough and Hand followed with separate opinions for affirmance, not, however, disagreeing with Judge Rogers as to the facts. These may \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 462]\n\u00a0\n be summarized as follows:\n Complainant conducts its business on the 'open shop' policy, without discrimination against either union or non-union men. The individual defendants and the local organizations of which they are the representatives are affiliated with the International Association of Machinists, an unincorporated association having a membership of more than 60,000, and are united in a combination, to which the International Association also is a party, having the object of compelling complainant to unionize its factory and enforce the 'closed shop,' the eight-hour day, and the union scale of wages, by means of interfering with and restraining its interstate trade in the products of the factory. Complainant's principal manufacture is newspaper presses of large size and complicated mechanism, varying in weight from 10,000 to 100,000 pounds, and requiring a considerable force of labor and a considerable expenditure of time-a week or more-to handle, haul, and erect them at the point of delivery. These presses are sold throughout the United States and in foreign countries; and, as they are especially designed for the production of daily papers, there is a large market for them in and about the city of New York. They are delivered there in the ordinary course of interstate commerce; the handling, hauling, and installation work at destination being done by employees of the purchaser under the supervision of a specially skilled machinist supplied by complainant. The acts complained of and sought to be restrained have nothing to do with the conduct or management of the factory in Michigan, but solely with the installation and operation of the presses by complainant's customers. None of the defendants is or ever was an employee of complainant, and complainant at no time has had relations with either of the organizations that they represent. In August, 1913 (eight months before the filing of the bill), the International Association called a strike at complain ant's \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 463]\n\u00a0\n factory in Battle Creek, as a result of which union machinists to the member of about 11 in the factory and 3 who supervised the erection of presses in the field left complainant's employ. But the defection of so small a number did not materially interfere with the operation of the factory, and sales and shipments in interstate commerce continued.\n The acts complained of made up the details of an elaborate programme adopted and carried out by defendants and their organizations in and about the city of New York as part of a country-wide programme adopted by the International Association, for the purpose of enforcing a boycott of complainant's product. The acts embraced the following, with others: Warning customers that it would be better for them not to purchase, or, having purchased, not to install, presses made by complainant, and threatening them with loss should they do so; threatening customers with sympathetic strikes in other trades; notifying a trucking company, usually employed by customers to haul the presses, not to do so, and threatening it with trouble if it should; inciting employees of the trucking company, and other men employed by customers of complainant, to strike against their respective employers in order to interfere with the hauling and installation of presses, and thus bring pressure to bear upon the customers; notifying repair shops not to do repair work on Duplex presses; coercing union men, by threatening them with loss of union cards and with being blacklisted as 'scabs' if they assisted in installing the presses; threatening an exposition company with a strike if it permitted complainant's presses to be exhibited; and resorting to a variety of other modes of preventing the sale of presses of complainant's manufacture in or about New York City, and delivery of them in interstate commerce, such as injuring and threatening to injure complainant's customers and prospective customers, and persons concerned \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 464]\n\u00a0\n in hauling, handling, or installing the presses. In some cases the threats were undisguised; in other cases polite in form, but none the less sinister in purpose and effect.\n All the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals concurred in the view that defendants' consisted essentially of efforts to render it impossible for complainant to carry on any commerce in printing presses between Michigan and New York and that defendants had agreed to do and were endeavoring to accomplish the very thing pronounced uniawful by this court in Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 U.S. 274\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, and Lawlor v. Loewe, \n235 U.S. 522\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 170. The judges also agreed that the interference with interstate commerce was such as ought to be enjoined, unless the Clayton Act of October 15, 1914, forbade such injunction.\n That act was passed after the beginning of the suit, but more than two years before it was brought to hearing. We are clear that the courts below were right in giving effect to it; the real question being whether they gave it the proper effect. In so far as the act (a) provided for relief by injunction to private suitors, (b) imposed conditions upon granting such relief under particular circumstances, and (c) otherwise nodified the Sherman Act, it was effective from the time of its passage, and applicable to pending suits for injunction. Obviously, this form of relief operates only in futuro, and the right to it must be determined as of the time of the hearing. State of Pennsylvania v. Wheeling & Belmont Bridge Co., 18 How. 421, 431, 432. See, also, United States v. Schooner Peggy, 1 Cranch, 103, 110; Sampeyreac v. United States, 7 Pet. 222, 239, 240; Mills v. Green, \n159 \nU.S. 651, 653\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 132; Dinsmore v. Southern Express Co., \n183 \nU.S. 115, 120\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 45; Berry v. Davis, \n242 \nU.S. 468, 470\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 208.\n The Clayton Act, in section 1 (Comp. St.  8835a), includes the Sherman Act in a definition of 'anti-trust laws,' and in section 16 (38 Stat. 737 [section 8835o]) gives to private parties a right to relief by injunction in any court of the United States against threatened loss or \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 465]\n\u00a0\n damage by a violation of the antitrust laws, under the conditions and principles regulating the granting of such relief by courts of equity. Evidently this provision was intended to supplement the Sherman Act, under which some of the federal courts had held, as this court afterwards held in Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, \n244 \nU.S. 459, 471\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 718, that a private party could not maintain a suit for injunction.\n That complainant's business of manufacturing printing presses and disposing of them in commerce is a property right, entitled to protection against unlawful injury or interference; that unrestrained access to the channels of interstate commerce is necessary for the successful conduct of the business; that a widespread combination exists, to which defendants and the associations represented by them are parties, to hinder and obstruct complainant's interstate trade and commerce by the means that have been indicated; and that as a result of it complainant has sustained substantial damage to its interstate trade, and is threatened with further and irreparable loss and damage in the future-is proved by clear and undisputed evidence. Hence the right to an injunction is clear if the threatened loss is due to a violation of the Sherman Act as amended by the Clayton Act.\n Looking first to the former act, the thing declared illegal by its first section (26 Stat. 209 [Comp. St.  8820]) is:\n'Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations.'\n\n The accepted definition of a conspiracy is a combination of two or more persons by concerted action to accomplish a criminal or unlawful purpose, or to accomplish some purpose not in itself criminal or unlawful by criminal or unlawful means. Pettibone v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 197, 203\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 542. If the purpose be unlawful, it may not be carried out, even by means that otherwise would be legal; and, although \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 466]\n\u00a0\n the purpose be lawful, it may not be carried out by criminal or unlawful means.\n The substance of the matters here complained of is an interference with complainant's interstate trade, intended to have coercive effect upon complainant, and produced by what is commonly known as a 'secondary boycott'; that is, a combination not merely to refrain from dealing with complainant, or to advise or by peaceful means persuade complainant's customers to refrain ('primary boycott'), but to exercise coercive pressure upon such customers, actual or prospective, in order to cause them to withhold or withdraw patronage from complainant through fear of loss or damage to themselves should they deal with it.\n As we shall see, the recognized distinction between a primary and a secondary boycott is material to be considered upon the question of the proper construction of the Clayton Act. But, in determining the right to an injunction under that and the Sherman Act, it is of minor consequence whether either kind of boycott is lawful or unlawful at common law or under the statutes of particular states. Those acts, passed in the exercise of the power of Congress to regulate commerce among the states, are of paramount authority, and their prohibitions must be given full effect, irrespective of whether the things prohibited are lawful or unlawful at common law or under local statutes.\n In Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 U.S. 274\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, where there was an effort to compel plaintiffs to unionize their factory by preventing them from manufacturing articles intended for transportation beyond the state, and also by preventing vendees from reselling articles purchased from plaintiffs and negotiating with plaintiffs for further purchases, by means of a boycott of plaintiffs' products and of dealers who handled them, this court held that there was a conspiracy in restraint of trade actionable under section 7 of the \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 467]\n\u00a0\n Sherman Act (section 8829), and in that connection said (\n208 U.S. 293\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 303, 13 Ann. Cas. 815):\n'The act prohibits any combination whatever to secure action which essentially obstructs the free flow of commerce between the states, or restricts, in that regard, the liberty of a trader to engage in business. The combination charged falls within the class of restraints of trade aimed at compelling third parties and strangers involuntarily not to engage in the course of trade except on conditions that the combination imposes.'\n\n And when the case came before the court a second time, \n235 \nU.S. 522, 534\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 170, it was held that the use of the primary and secondary boycott and the circulation of a list of 'unfair dealers,' intended to influence customers of plaintiffs and thus subdue the latter to the demands of the defendants, and having the effect of interfering with plaintiffs' interstate trade, was actionable.\n In Eastern States Lumber Association v. United States, \n234 U.S. 600\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788, wholesale dealers were subjected to coercion merely through the circulation among retailers, who were members of the association, of information in the form of a kind of 'black list,' intended to influence the retailers to refrain from dealing with the listed wholesalers, and it was held that this constituted a violation of the Sherman Act. Referring to this decision, the court said, in Lawlor v. Loewe, \n235 \nU.S. 522, 534\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 170, 172 (59 L. Ed. 341):\n'That case establishes that, irrespective of compulsion or even agreement to observe its intimation, the circulation of a list of 'unfair dealers,' manifestly intended to put the ban upon those whose names appear therein, among an important body of possible customers combined with a view to joint action and in anticipation of such reports, is within the prohibitions of the Sherman Act if it is intended to restrain and restrains commerce among the states.'\n\n It is settled by these decisions that such a restraint produced by peaceable persuasion is as much within the \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 468]\n\u00a0\n prohibition as one accomplished by force or threats of force; and it is not to be justified by the fact that the participants in the combination or conspiracy may have some object beneficial to themselves or their associates which possibly they might have been at liberty to pursue in the absence of the statute.\n Upon the question whether the provisions of the Clayton Act forbade the grant of an injunction under the circumstances of the present case, the Circuit Court of Appeals was divided; the majority holding that under section 20, 'perhaps in conjunction with section 6,' there could be no injunction. These sections are set forth in the margin. \n1\n Defendants seek to derive from them some \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 469]\n\u00a0\n authority for their conduct. As to section 6, it seems to us its principal importance in this discussion is for what it does not authorize, and for the limit it sets to the immunity conferred. The section assumes the normal objects of a labor organization to be legitimate, and declares that nothing in the anti-trust laws shall be construed to forbid the existence and operation of such organizations or to forbid their members from lawfully carrying out their legitimate objects; and that such an organization shall not be held in itself-merely because of its existence and operation-to be an illegal combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade. But there is nothing in the section to exempt such an organization or its members from accountability where it or they depart from its normal and legitimate objects and engage in an actual combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade. And by no fair or permissible construction can it be taken as authorizing any activity otherwise unlawful, or enabling a normally lawful organization to become a cloak for an illegal combination or conspiracy in restraint of trade as defined by the anti-trust laws.\n The principal reliance is upon section 20. This regulates the granting of restraining orders and injunctions by the courts of the United States in a designated class of cases, with respect to (a) the terms and conditions of the relief and the practice to be pursued, and (b) the character of \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 470]\n\u00a0\n acts that are to be exempted from the restraint, and in the concluding words it declares (c) that none of the acts specified shall be held to be violations of any law of the United States. All its provisions are subject to a general qualification respecting the nature of the controversy and the parties affected. It is to be a 'case between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees, or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment.'\n The first paragraph merely puts into statutory form familiar restrictions upon the granting of injunctions already established and of general application in the equity practice of the courts of the United States. It is but declaratory of the law as it stood before. The second paragraph declares that 'no such restraining order or injunction' shall prohibit certain conduct specified-manifestly still referring to a 'case between an employer and employees, ... involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or condition of employment,' as designated in the first paragraph. It is very clear that the restriction upon the use of the injunction is in favor only of those concerned as parties to such a dispute as is described. The words defining the permitted conduct include particular qualifications consistent with the general one respecting the nature of the case and dispute intended; and the concluding words, 'nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States,' are to be read in the light of the context, and mean only that those acts are not to be so held when committed by parties concerned in 'a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment.' If the qualifying words are to have any effect, they must operate to confine the restriction upon the granting of injunctions, and also the relaxation \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 471]\n\u00a0\n of the provisions of the anti-trust and other laws of the United States, to parties standing in proximate relation to a controversy such as is particularly described.\n The majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals appear to have entertained the view that the words 'employers and employees,' as used in section 20, should be treated as referring to 'the business class or clan to which the parties litigant respectively belong,' and that, as there had been a dispute at complainant's factory in Michigan concerning the conditions of employment there-a dispute created, it is said, if it did not exist before, by the act of the Machinists' Union in calling a strike at the factory-section 20 operated to permit members of the Machinists' Union elsewhere, some 60,000 in number, although standing in no relation of employment under complainant, past, present, or prospective, to make that dispute their own and proceed to instigate sympathetic strikes, picketing, and boycotting against employers wholly unconnected with complainant's factory and having relations with complainant only in the way of purchasing its product in the ordinary course of interstate commerce, and this where there was no dispute between such employers and their employees respecting terms or conditions of employment.\n We deem this construction altogether inadmissible. Section 20 must be given full effect according to its terms as an expression of the purpose of Congress; but it must be borne in mind that the section imposes an exceptional and extraordinary restriction upon the equity powers of the courts of the United States and upon the general operation of the anti- trust laws, a restriction in the nature of a special privilege or immunity to a particular class, with corresponding detriment to the general public; and it would violate rules of statutory construction having general application and far-reaching importance to enlarge that special privilege by resorting to a loose construction of \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 472]\n\u00a0\n the section, not to speak of ignoring or slighting the qualifying words that are found in it. Full and fair effect will be given to every word if the exceptional privilege be confined-as the natural meaning of the words confines it-to those who are proximately and substantially concerned as parties to an actual dispute respecting the terms or conditions of their own employment, past, present, or prospective. The extensive construction adopted by the majority of the court below virtually ignores the effect of the qualifying words. Congress had in mind particular industrial controversies, not a general class war. 'Terms or conditions of employment' are the only grounds of dispute recognized as adequate to bring into play the exemptions; and it would do violence to the guarded landguage employed were the exemption extended beyond the parties affected in a proximate and substantial, not merely a sentimental or sympathetic, sense by the cause of dispute.\n Nor can section 20 be regarded as bringing in all members of a labor organization as parties to a 'dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment,' which proximately affects only a few of them, with the result of conferring upon any and all members-no matter how many thousands there may be, nor how remote from the actual conflict-those exemptions which Congress in terms conferred only upon parties to the dispute. That would enlarge by construction the provisions of section 20, which contain no mention of labor organizations, so as to produce an inconsistency with section 6, which deals specifically with the subject and must be deemed to express the measure and limit of the immunity intended by Congress to be incident to mere membership in such an organization. At the same time it would virtually repeal by implication the prohibition of the Sherman Act, so far as labor organizations are concerned, notwithstanding repeals by implication are not favored, and in effect, as \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 473]\n\u00a0\n was noted in Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 \nU.S. 274, 303\n, 304 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, would confer upon voluntary associations of individuals formed within the states a control over commerce among the states that is denied to the governments of the states themselves.\n The qualifying effect of the words descriptive of the nature of the dispute and the parties concerned is further borne out by the phrases defining the conduct that is not to be subjected to injunction or treated as a violation of the laws of the United States, that it to say:\n\n\n (a)\n 'Terminating any relation of employment, ... or persuading others by peaceful means so to do;' (b) 'attending at any place where any such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating information, or from peacefully persuading any person to work or to abstain from working;' (c) 'ceasing to patronize or to employ any party to such dispute, or ... recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do;' (d) 'paying or giving to, or withholding from, any person engaged in such dispute, any strike benefits; ...' (e) 'doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto.'\n The emphasis placed on the words 'lawful' and 'lawfully,' 'peaceful' and 'peacefully,' and the references to the dispute and the parties to it, strongly rebut a legislative intent to confer a general immunity for conduct violative of the anti-trust laws, or otherwise unlawful. The subject of the boycott is dealt with specifically in the 'ceasing to patronize' provision, and by the clear force of the language employed the exemption is limited to pressure exerted upon a 'party to such dispute' by means of 'peaceful and lawful' influence upon neutrals. There is nothing here to justify defendants or the organizations they represent in using either threats or persuasion to bring about strikes or a cessation of Work \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 474]\n\u00a0\n on the part of employees of complainant's customers or prospective customers, or of the trucking company employed by the customers, with the object of compelling such customers to withdraw or refrain from commercial relations with complainant, and of thereby constraining complainant to yield the matter in dispute. To instigate a sympathetic strike in aid of a secondary boycott cannot be deemed 'peaceful and lawful' persuasion. In essence it is a threat to inflict damage upon the immediate employer, between whom and his employees no dispute exists, in order to bring him against his will into a concerted plan to inflict damage upon another employer who is in dispute with his employees.\n The majority of the Circuit Court of Appeals, very properly treating the case as involving a secondary boycott, based the decision upon the view that it was the purpose of section 20 to legalize the secondary boycott 'at least in so far as it rests on or consists of refusing to work for any one who deals with the principal offender.' Characterizing the section as 'blindly drawn,' and conceding that the meaning attributed to it was broad, the court referred to the legislative history of the enactment as a warrant for the construction adopted. Let us consider this.\n By repeated decisions of this court it has come to be well established that the debates in Congress expressive of the views and motives of individual members are not a safe guide, and hence may not be resorted to, in ascertaining the meaning and purpose of the law-making body. Aldridge v. Williams, 3 How. 9, 24; United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n91 U.S. 72\n, 79; United States v. Freight Association, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 318\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 540. But reports of committees of House or Senate stand upon a more solid footing, and may be regarded as an exposition of the legislative intent in a case where otherwise the meaning of a statute is obscure. Binns v. United States, \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 475]\n\u00a0\n \n194 \nU.S. 486, 495\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 816. And this has been extended to include explanatory statements in the nature of a supplemental report made by the committee member in charge of a bill in course of passage. Binns v. United States, supra; Penna. R. R. Co. v. International Coal Co., \n230 U.S. 184\n, 198-199, 33 Sup. Ct. 893, Ann. Cas. 1915A, 315; United States v. Coca Cola Co., \n241 \nU.S. 265, 281\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 573, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 487; United States v. St. Paul, M. & M. Ry. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 310, 318\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 525\n\n\n In the case of the Clayton Act, the printed committee reports are not explicit with respect to the meaning of the 'ceasing to patronize' clause of what is now section 20. See House Rept. No. 627, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 33-36; Senate Rept. No. 698, 63 Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 29-31; the latter being a reproduction of the former. But they contain extracts from judicial opinions and a then recent text-book sustaining the 'primary boycott,' and expressing an adverse view as to the secondary or coercive boycott, and, on the whole, are far from manifesting a purpose to relax the prohibition against restraints of trade in favor of the secondary boycott.\n Moreover, the report was supplemented in this regard by the spokesman of the House committee (Mr. Webb) who had the bill in charge when it was under consideration by the House. The question whether the bill legalized the secondary boycott having been raised, it was emphatically and unequivocally answered by him in the negative. \n2\n The subject-he declared in substance or \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 476]\n\u00a0\n effect-was under consideration when the bill was framed, and the section as reported was carefully prepared with the settled purpose of excluding the secondary boycott and confining boycotting to the parties to the dispute, allowing parties to cease to patronize and to ask other to cease \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 477]\n\u00a0\n to patronize a party to the dispute; it was the opinion of the committee that it did not legalize the secondary boycott; it was not their purpose to authorize such a boycott, not a member of the committee would vote to do so; clarifying amendment was unnecessary; the section as reported expressed the real purpose so well that it could not be tortured into a meaning authorizing the secondary boycott. This was the final word of the House committee on the subject, and was uttered under such circumstances and with such impressive emphasis that it is not going too far to say that, except for this exposition of the meaning of the section, it would not have been enacted in the in which it was reported. In substantially that form it became law; and since, in our opinion, its proper construction is entirely in accord with its purpose as thus declared, little need be added.\n The extreme and harmful consequences of the construction adopted in the court below are not to be ignored. The present case furnishes an apt and convincing example. An ordinary controversy in a manufacturing establishment, said to concern the terms or conditions of employment there, has been held a sufficient occasion for imposing a general embargo upon the products of the establishment and a nation-wide blockade of the channels of interstate commerce against them, carried out by inciting sympathetic strikes and a secondary boycott against complainant's customers, to the great and incalculable damage of many innocent people far remote from any connection with or control over the original and actual dispute-people constituting, indeed, the general public \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 478]\n\u00a0\n upon whom the cost must ultimately fall, and whose vital interest in unobstructed commerce constituted the prime and paramount concern of Congress in enacting the antitrust laws, of which the section under consideration forms after all a part.\n Reaching the conclusion, as we do, that complainant has a clear right to an injunction under the Sherman Act as amended by the Clayton Act, it becomes unnecessary to consider whether a like result would follow under the common law or local statutes; there being no suggestion that relief thereunder could be broader than that to which complainant is entitled under the acts of Congress.\n There should be an injunction against defendants and the associations represented by them, and all members of those associations, restraining them, according to the prayer of the bill, from interfering or attempting to interfere with the sale, transportation, or delivery in interstate commerce of any printing press or presses manufactured by complainant, or the transportation, carting, installation, use, operation, exhibition, display, or repairing of any such press or presses, or the performance of any contract or contracts made by complainant respecting the sale, transportation, delivery, or installation of any such press or presses, by causing or threatening to cause loss, damage, trouble, or inconvenience to any person, firm, or corporation concerned in the purchase, transportation, carting, installation, use, operation, exhibition, display, or repairing of any such press or presses, or the performance of any such contract or contracts, and also and especially from using any force, threats, command, direction, or even persuasion with the object or having the effect of causing any person or persons to decline employment, cease employment, or not seek employment, or to refrain from work or cease working under any person, firm, or corporation being a purchaser or prospective purchaser of any printing press or presses from complainant, \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 479]\n\u00a0\n or engaged in hauling, carting, delivering installing, handling, using, operating, or repairing any such press or presses for any customer of complainant. Other threatened conduct by defendants or the associations they represent, or the members of such associations, in furtherance of the secondary boycott should be included in the injunction according to the proofs.\n Complainant is entitled to its costs in this court and in both courts below.\n Decree reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice CLARKE, concur.\n The Duplex Company, a manufacturer of newspaper printing presses, seeks to enjoin officials of the machinists' and affiliated unions from interfering with its business by inducing their members not to work for plaintiff or its customers in connection with the setting up of presses made by it. Unlike Hitchman Coal & Coke Co. v. Mitchell, \n245 U.S. 229\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 65, L. R. A. 1918C, 497, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 461, there is here no charge that defendants are inducing employees to break their contracts. Nor is it now urged that defendants threaten acts of violence. But plaintiff insists that the acts complained of violate both the common law of New York and the Sherman Act, and that, accordingly, it is entitled to relief by injunction under the state law and under section sixteen of the Clayton Act, October 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730, 737.\n The defendants admit interference with plaintiff's business but justify on the following ground: There are in the United States only four manufacturers of such presses; and they are in active competition. Between 1909 and 1913 the machinists' union induced three of \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 480]\n\u00a0\n them to recognize and deal with the union, to grant to eight-hour day, to establish a minimum wage scale, and to comply with other union requirements. The fourth, the Duplex Company, refused to recognize the union; insisted upon conducting its factory on the open shop principle; refused to introduce the eight-hour day and operated, for the most part, ten hours a day; refused to establish a minimum wage scale; and disregarded other union standards. Thereupon two of the three manufacturers, who had assented to union conditions, notified the union that they should be obliged to terminate their agreements with it unless their competitor, the Duplex Company, also entered into the agreement with the union, which, in giving more favorable terms to labor, imposed correspondingly greater burdens upon the employer. Because the Duplex Company refused to enter into such an agreement, and in order to induce it to do so, the machinists' union declared a strike at its factory, and in aid of that strike instructed its members and the members of affiliated unions not to work on the installation of presses which plaintiff had delivered in New York. Defendants insisted that by the common law of New York, where the acts complained of were done, and where this suit was brought, and also by section 20 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 730, 738, the facts constitute a justification for this interference with plaintiff's business.\n First. As to the rights at common law: Defendants' justification is that of self-interest. They have supported the strike at the employer's factory by a strike elsewhere against its product. They have injured the plaintiff, not maliciously, but in self-defense. They contend that the Duplex Company's refusal to deal with the machinists' union and to observe its standards threatened the interest, not only of such union members as were its factory employees, but even more of all members of the several affiliated unions employed by plaintiff's competitors and \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 481]\n\u00a0\n by others whose more advanced standards the plaintiff was, in reality, attacking; and that none of the defendants and no person whom they are endeavoring to induce to refrain from working in connection with the setting up of presses made by plaintiff is an outsider, an interloper. In other words, that the contest between the company and the machinists' union involves vitally the interest of every person whose co-operation is sought. May not all with a common interest join in refusing to expend their labor upon articles whose very production constitutes an attack upon their standard of living and the institution which they are convinced supports it? Applying common law principles the answer should, in my opinion, be: Yes, if as a matter of fact those who so co-operate have a common interest.\n The change in the law by which strikes once illegal and even criminal are now recognized as lawful was effected in America largely without the intervention of legislation. This reversal of a common-law rule was not due to the rejection by the courts of one principle and the adoption in its stead of another, but to a better realization of the facts of industrial life. It is conceded that, although the strike of the workmen in plaintiff's factory injured its business, the strike was not an actionable wrong; because the obvious self-interest of the strikers constituted a justification. See Pickett v. Walsh, 192 Mass. 572, 78 N. E. 753, 6 L. R. A. (N. S) 1067, 116 Am. St. Rep. 272, 7 Ann. Cas. 638. Formerly courts held that self-interests could not be so served. Commons, History of Labor in the United States, vol. 2, c. 5. But even after strikes to raise wages or reduce hours were held to be legal because of the self-interest, some courts held that there was not sufficient causal relationship between a strike to unionize a shop and the self-interest of the strikers to justify injuries inflicted. Plant v. Woods, 176 Mass. 492, 57 N. E. 1011, 51 L. R. A. 339, 79 Am. St. Rep. 330; Lucke v. Clothing Cutters' Assembly, 77 Md. 396, 26 Atl. 505, 19 L. R. A. 408, 39 Am. St. Rep. 421; Erdman v. Mitchell, 207 Pa. 79, 56 Atl. 327, 63 L. R. A. 534, 99 Am. St. Rep. 783. \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 482]\n\u00a0\n But other courts, repeating the same legal formula, found that there was justification, because they viewed the facts differently. National Protective Ass'n v. Cumming, 170 N. Y. 315, 63 N. E. 369, 58 L. R. A. 135, 88 Am. St. Rep. 648; Kemp v. Division No. 241, 255 Ill. 213, 99 N. E. 389, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 347; Roddy v. United Mine Workers, 41 Okl. 621, 139 Pac. 126, L. R. A. 1915D, 789.\n When centralization in the control of business brought its corresponding centralization in the organization of workingmen, new facts had to be appraised. A single employer might, as in this case, threaten the standing of the whole organization and the standards of all its members; and when he did so the union, in order to protect itself, would naturally refuse to work on his materials whereever found. When such a situation was first presented to the courts, judges concluded that the intervention of the purchaser of the materials established an insulation through which the direct relationship of the employer and the workingmen did not penetrate; and the strike against the material was considered a strike against the purchaser by unaffected third parties. Burnham v. Dowd, 217 Mass. 351, 104 N. E. 841, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.) 778; Purvis v. United Brotherhood, 214 Pa. 348, 63 Atl. 585, 12 L. R. A. (N. S.) 642, 112 Am. St. Rep. 757, 6 Ann. Cas. 275; Booth v. Burgess, 72 N. J. Eq. 181, 65 Atl. 226. But other courts, with better appreciation of the facts of industry, recognized the unity of interest throughout the union, and that, in refusing to work on materials which threatened it, the union was only refusing to aid in destroying itself. Bossert v. Dhuy, 221 N. Y. 342, 117 N. E. 582, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 661; Cohn & Roth Electric Co. v. Bricklayers, 92 Conn. 161, 101 Atl. 659, 6 A. L. R. 887; Gill Engraving Co. v. Doerr (D. C.) 214 Fed. 111; State v. Van Pelt, 136 N. C. 633, 49 S. E. 177, 68 L. R. A. 760, 1 Ann. Cas. 495; Grant Construction Co. v. St. Paul Building Trades, 136 Minn. 167, 161 N. W. 520, 1055; Pierce v. Stablemen's Union, 156 Cal. 70, 76, 103 Pac. 324.\n So, in the case at bar, deciding a question of fact upon the evidence introduced and matters of common knowledge, I should say, as the two lower courts apparently have said, that the defendants and those from whom they \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 483]\n\u00a0\n sought co-operation have a common interest which the plaintiff threatened. This view is in harmony with the views of the Court of Appeals of New York. For in New York, although boycotts like that in Loewe v. Lawlor, \n208 U.S. 274\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 301, 13 Ann. Cas. 815, are illegal because they are conducted, not against a product, but against those who deal in it, and are carried out by a combination of persons, not united by common interest, but only by sympathy (Auburn Draying Co. v. Wardwell, 227 N. Y. 1, 124 N. E. 97, 6 A. L. R. 901), it is lawful for all members of a union by whomever employed to refuse to handle materials whose production weakens the union (Bossert v. Dhuy, supra; P. Reardon, Inc., v. Caton, 189 App. Div. 501, 178 N. Y. Supp. 713). Compare Paine Lumber Co. v. Neal, \n244 \nU.S. 459, 471\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 718.\n'The voluntary adoption of a rule not to work on nonunion made material and its enforcement differs only in degree from such voluntary rule and its enforcement in a particular case. Such a determination also differs entirely from a general boycott of a particular dealer or manufacturer with a malicious intent and purpose to destroy the good will or business of such dealer or manufacturer.' Bossert v. Dhuy, supra, 221 N. Y. 355, 117 N. E. 584, Ann. Cas. 1918D, 661.\n\n In my opinion, therefore, plaintiff had no cause of action by the common law of New York.\n Second. As to the anti-trust laws of the United States: Section 20, of the Clayton Act, declares;\n'Nor shall any of the acts specified in this paragraph be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States.'\n\n The acts which are thus referred to are whether performed singly or in concert:\n'Terminating any relation of employment, or ... ceasing to perform any work or labor, or ... recommending, advising or persuading others by peaceful means so to do, or ... attending at any place where such person or persons may lawfully be, for the purpose of obtaining or communicating information, or ... peacefully persuading \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 484]\n\u00a0\n any person to work or to abstain from working, or ... ceasing to patronize or employ any party to such dispute, ... or ... recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful and lawful means so to do, or ... paying or giving to, or withholding from, any person engaged in such dispute, any strike benefits or other moneys or things of value, or peacefully assembling in a lawful manner and for lawful purposes, or ... doing any act or thing which might lawfully be done in the absence of such dispute by any party thereto.'\n\n This statute was the fruit of unceasing agitation, which extended over more than 20 years and was designed to equalize before the law the position of workingmen and employer as industrial combatants. Aside from the use of the injunction, the chief source of dissatisfaction with the existing law lay in the doctrine of malicious combination,3 and, in many parts of the country, in the judicial declarations of the illegality at common law of picketing and persuading others to leave work. The grounds for objection to the latter are obvious. The objection to the doctrine of malicious combinations requires some explanation. \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 485]\n\u00a0\n By virtue of that doctrine, damage resulting from conduct such as striking or withholding patronage or persuading others to do either, which without more might be damnum absque injuria because the result of trade competition, became actionable when done for a purpose which a judge considered socially or economically harmful and therefore branded as malicious and unlawful. \n4\n It was objected that, due largely to environment, the social and economic ideas of judges, which thus became translated into law, were prejudicial to a position of equality between workingman and employer; that due to this dependence upon the individual opinion of judges great confusion existed as to what purposes were lawful and what unlawful;5 and that in any event Congress, not the judges, was the body which should declare what public policy in regard to the industrial struggle demands.\n By 1914 the ideas of the advocates of legislation had fairly crystalized upon the manner in which the inequality and uncertainty of the law should be removed. It was to \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 486]\n\u00a0\n be done by expressly legalizing certain acts regardless of the effects produced by them upon other persons. As to them Congress was to extract the element of injuria from the damages thereby inflicted, instead of leaving judges to determine according to their own economic and social views whether the damage inflicted on an employer in an industrial struggle was damnum absque injuria, because an incident of trade competition, or a legal injury, because in their opinion, economically and socially objectionable. This idea was presented to the committees which reported the Clayton Act. \n6\n The resulting law set out certain acts which had previously been held unlawful, whenever courts had disapproved of the ends for which they were performed; it then declared that, when these acts were committed in the course of an industrial dispute, they should not be held to violate any law of the United States. In other words the Clayton Act substituted the opinion of Congress as to the propriety of the purpose for that of differing judges; and thereby it declared that the relations between employers of labor and workingmen were competitive relations, that organized competition was not harmful and that it justified injuries necessarily inflicted in its course. \n7\n Both the \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 487]\n\u00a0\n majority and the minority report of the House committee indicate that such was its purpose. \n8\n If, therefore, the act applies to the case at bar, the acts here complained of cannot 'be considered or held to be violations of any law of the United States,' and hence do not violate the Sherman Act.\n The Duplex Company contends that section 20 of the Clayton Act does not apply to the case at bar, because it is restricted to cases 'between an employer and employees, or between employers and employees, or between employees or between persons employed and persons seeking employment, involving, or growing out of, a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment'; whereas the case at bar arises between an employer in Michigan and workingmen in New York not in its employ, and does not involve their conditions of employment. But Congress did not restrict the provision to employers and workingmen in their employ. \n\n[254 U.S. 443, 488]\n\u00a0\n By including 'employers and employees' and 'persons employed and persons seeking employment' it showed that it was not aiming merely at a legal relationship between a specific employer and his employees. Furthermore, the plaintiff's contention proves too much. If the words are to receive a strict technical construction, the statute will have no application to disputes between employers of labor and workingmen, since the very acts to which it applies sever the continuity of the legal relationship. Iron Moulders' Union v. Allis-Chalmers Co., 166 Fed. 45, 52-53, 91 C. C. A. 631, 20 L. R. A. (N. S.) 315. Louisville etc. Ry. Co. v. Wilson, \n138 \nU.S. 501, 505\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 405; Cf. Rex. v. Neilson, 44 N. S. 488, 491. The further contention that this case is not one arising out of a dispute concerning the conditions of work of one of the parties is, in my opinion, founded upon a misconception of the facts.\n Because I have come to the conclusion that both the common law of a state and a statute of the United States declare the right of industrial combatants to push their struggle to the limits of the justification of self-interest, I do not wish to be understood as attaching any constitutional or moral sanction to that right. All rights are derived from the purposes of the society in which they exist; above all rights rises duty to the community. The conditions developed in industry may be such that those engaged in it cannot continue their struggle without danger to the community. But it is not for judges to determine whether such conditions exist, nor is it their function to set the limits of permissible contest and to declare the duties which the new situation demands. This is the function of the legislature which, while limiting individual and group rights of aggression and defense, may substitute processes of justice for the more primitive method of trial by combat. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 6.

Would not this also legalize the secondary boycott? ...\n Mr. Webb. Mr. Chairman, I do not think it legalizes a secondary boycott.\n Mr. Volstead. Let me read the lines, if the gentleman will permit. And no such restraining order or injunction shall prohibit any one-- \n'from ceasing to patronize those who [or to] employ any party to such dispute, or from recommending, advising, or persuading others by peaceful means so to do.'\n\n Now, does not the word 'others' in that instance refer to other than parties to the dispute?\n Mr. Webb. No; because it says in line 15:\n'From ceasing to patronize or employ any parties to such dispute.'\n\n Mr. Volstead. ... Can there be any doubt this is intended or does, in fact, legalize the secondary boycott?\n Mr. Webb. I will say frankly to my friend when this section was drawn it was drawn with the careful purpose not to legalize the secondary boycott, and we do not think it does. There may be a difference of opinion about it, but it is the opinion of the committee that it does not legalize the secondary boycott and is not intended to do so. It does legalize the primary boycott; it does legalize the strike; it does legalize persuading others to strike, to quit work, and the other acts mentioned in section 18 [ now section 20], but we did not intend, I will say frankly, to legalize the secondary boycott.\n (Page 9653.)\n Mr. Webb. I will say this section was drawn two years or more ago and was drawn carefully, and those who drew this section drew it with the idea of excluding the secondary boycott. It passed the House, I think, by about 243 to 16, and the question of the secondary boycott was not raised then, because we understood so clearly it did not refer to or authorize the secondary boycott.\n (Page 9658.)\n Mr. Webb. Mr. Chairman, I should vote for the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Volstead] if I were not perfectly satisfied that it is taken care of in this section. The language the gentleman reads does not authorize the secondary boycott, and he could not torture it into any such meaning. While it does authorize persons to cease to patronize the party to the dispute and to recommend to others to cease to patronize that same party to the dispute, that is not a secondary boycott, and you cannot possibly make it mean a secondary boycott. Therefore this section does not authorize the secondary boycott.\n\n I say again-and I speak for, I believe, practically every member of the Judiciary committee-that if this section did legalize the secondary boycott there would not be a man vote for it. It is not the purpose of the committee to authorize it, and I do not think any person in this House wants to do it. We confine the boycotting to the parties to the dispute, allowing parties to cease to patronize that party and to ask others to cease to patronize the party to the dispute. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See 'Malice and Unlawful Interference,' Ernest Freund, 11 Harv.

U S(1920)\nNo. 240\nArgued: Decided: May 17, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Arthur C. Fraser, of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. Assistant Attorney General Davis and Daniel L. Morris, ofW ashington, D. C., for the United States. \n\n[253 U.S. 187, 188]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this suit compensation is sought from the government for the use which it made of a patented 'superheater,' in connection with Whitehead torpedoes.\n A 'superheater' is a device in which fuel is burned in the compressed air which drives the motor by which a torpedo is propelled through the water, so that the air is heated to such a degree that its energy is greatly increased, with the result that the range of the use of the torpedo is much extended.\n The Court of Claims interpreted the petition as containing a claim that the defendant had contracted to pay appellant for 50 'superheaters' at $500 each, and also as claiming that it had infringed rights of the appellant in certain United States patents by the purchase of 360 'superheaters' from Whitehead & Co., a British corporation, and by itself manufacturing 100 such 'superheaters.' Concluding, as to the first claim, that the petition did not state a cause of action in contract, and, as to the second, that it did not show title to the patents involved sufficient to support infringement, a demurrer to the petition was sustained, and the suit dismissed.\n The main contention in this court is that a cause of action in contract is stated with respect to all of the 510 'superheaters,' but in the alternative, though faintly, it is claimed that the allegations also make out a case of infringement.\n The appellant alleges that it was the owner of two United States patents issued in 1902, covering the 'superheater' device, and that in 1905 it entered into a written contract with the Armstrong Company, a British corporation, for the use of improvements in 'superheaters' owned by that company and at the time protected in \n\n[253 U.S. 187, 189]\n\u00a0\n Great Britain by a provisional specification for a patent. A copy of this contract, attached to the petition, after reciting that the Armstrong Company proposes to apply for a patent in the United States upon the improvements in 'superheaters' which it owns, and that it is desirous of granting to the appellant the exclusive license to use such invention 'in connection with the Bliss-Leavitt torpedo' manufactured by appellant, proceeds to grant to appellant the 'sole and exclusive license' to use such inventions for the full term of the letters patent thereafter to be procured for the purpose of propelling Bliss-Leavitt torpedoes wherever sold by the Bliss Company and 'Whitehead torpedoes sold only to the United States government.'\n The contract provides for the payment by the appellant of a royalty of $25 for each torpedo fitted with the Armstrong inventions under penalty of cancellation, and that the Armstrong Company shall pay all costs and expenses of procuring the contemplated patents and of protecting them against infringement.\n The petition alleges that eight United States patents on the 'superheater' device were procured by the Armstrong Company, variously dated from August 7, 1906, to November 14, 1911, but no assignment of rights under them was made to appellant other than such as it derives from the contract of 1905, which, it avers, has been fully recognized and its terms complied with, by both of the parties to it.\n The references in the amended petition to the two patents owned by the appellant are so meager and so vague that we conclude that liability in contract or for infringement must be derived, if at all, from the allegations applicable to the contract of 1905\n\n\n As to the contract:\n The allegations are that prior to 1907 Armstrong & Co. licensed Whitehead & Co., a British corporation, to \n\n[253 U.S. 187, 190]\n\u00a0\n 'use and exercise' its superheater inventions patented in Great Britain and in the United States, but subject to the rights of appellant under its contract of 1905; that in June, 1907, the appellant granted a request by the defendant for permission to purchase from Whitehead & Co. not more than 100 torpedoes containing the 'superheater' invention, thea mount of royalty 'to be later settled'; that subsequently 50 torpedoes so equipped were purchased and were brought into the United States subsequent to June 1, 1908; but that no royalty was ever paid to appellant for the use of the 'superheaters' upon them.\n If the petition had stopped here, there might be substance in the claim that as to these 50 torpedoes a contract for royalty on the basis of quantum meruit should be implied. But the petition goes on and alleges that in November, 1907, before the alleged purchase of the 50 torpedoes, in a treaty between the parties as to the amount of royalty to be paid, a demand by the petitioner of $500 for each 'superheater' installed in a Whitehead torpedo was refused by the government; that in December, 1910, and again in March, 1912, long after the alleged purchase, the prior discussion as to royalty was renewed, but without agreement; and finally it is averred--\n'that petitioner, by letter dated March 19, 1912, declined to grant any reduction and no reduction has ever been granted, and petitioner has never consented to the use of said patented invention or of said patented improvements thereon or any of them by defendant without payment of said royalty of $500 each.'\n\n It is too clear for discussion that these allegations, taken together, not only do not show a contract of the parties, express or implied, to pay a royalty in any amount, but that they distinctly and in terms negative the making of any such contract as is necessary to give the Court of Claims jurisdiction under the applicable section of the \n\n[253 U.S. 187, 191]\n\u00a0\n Judicial Code (section 145 [Comp. St.  1136]) and the decisions of this court. Schillinger v. United States, \n155 U.S. 163\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 85; United States v. Berdan Fire-Arms Manufacturing Co., \n156 U.S. 552\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 420; Russell v. United States, \n182 U.S. 516\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 899; Bigby v. United States, \n188 U.S. 400\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 468; Harley v. United States, \n198 \nU.S. 229, 304\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 634; Juragua Iron Co., Ltd., v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 297, 309\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 385; Farnham v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 427.\n Treating for peace with one claiming patent rights for which it paid a royalty of $25 falls far short of a 'convention between the parties-a coming together of the minds'- to pay $500, or any other amount, for the use of the device.\n As to the claim for infringement:\n The contract of 1905, relied upon, in terms granted to the appellant the 'sole and exclusive license' to use the Armstrong inventions for the terms of the patents thereafter to be procured in Great Britain and in the United States 'for the purpose of propelling Bliss-Leavitt torpedoes' ( with which we are not concerned) 'wherever sold by the Bliss Company and the Whitehead torpedoes sold only to the United States government.'\n Authority to maintain a suit for infringement against the United States can be derived only from the Act of Congress of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 851, c. 423 [Comp. St.  9465]), which provides that the 'owner' of an infringed patent may recover reasonable compensation in the Court of Claims, and reserves to the United States 'all defenses, general or special, which might be pleaded by a defendant in an action for infringement, as set forth in title LX of the Revised Statutes of the United States, or otherwise.'\n Giving to this statute, as we do, the liberal interpretation placed upon it in Crozier v. Krupp, \n224 U.S. 290\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 488, and in Cramp v. International Curtis Marine Turbine Co., \n246 U.S. 28\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 271, the 'owner' who may maintain an infringement suit against the government must have at least such an interest in the patent as without the \n\n[253 U.S. 187, 192]\n\u00a0\n statute would support such a suit against a defendant other than the United States.\n It has long been settled that a licensee may not maintain a suit for infringement (Gayler . Wilder, 10 How. 477; Littlefield v. Perry, 21 Wall. 205; Paper Bag Cases, \n105 U.S. 766\n; Pope Manufacturing Co. v. Gormully & Juffery Manufacturing Co., \n144 U.S. 248\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 641), and that to entitle an assingee or grantee to maintain such a suit under warrant of R. S.  4919 ( Comp. St.  9464), such assignee or grantee must have an assignment, grant, or conveyance, either of the whole patent, of an undivided part of it, or of an exclusive right under it 'within and throughout a specified part of the United States.' Any assignment or transfer short of one of these is a mere license, giving the licensee no interest in the patent sufficient to sue at law in his own name for infringement or in equity without joining the owner of the patent. Waterman v. Mackenzie, \n138 \nU.S. 252, 255\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 334; Pope Manufacturing Co. v. Gormully & Jeffery Manufacturing Co., \n144 U.S. 224\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 632.\n While the legal effect of the terms used, and not the name applied to the instrument containing them, will determine whether a transfer is an assignment or a license, nevertheless the language used is often, as in this case, of great significance in determining what that legal effect shall be.\n The right granted the appellant by the contract of 1905 is termed in it a 'license'; the appellant contracts, as licensees usually do, to pay a royalty for each torpedo fitted with the devices to be patented; the contract does not purport grant an interest in the patent or any exclusive territorial rights, but only, with respect to the Whitehead torpedo, rights as to a single prospective purchaser, the government of the United States; and the Armstrong Company contracts at its own cost 'to take all necessary proceedings for protecting and defending the license to use ... hereby granted' against \n\n[253 U.S. 187, 193]\n\u00a0\n infringers. Palpably this is a mere license, not sufficient to sustain a suit for infringement.\n Several minor questions, including some of practice, are argued in the brief for appellant, but the opinion of the Court of Claims deals with them thoroughly and satisfactorily and its judgment is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEASTERN EXTENSION, AUSTRALASIA & CHINA TEL CO. v. U S(1920)\nNo. 357\nArgued: December 15, 1919Decided: January 12, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 355, 356]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis Marshall and Samuel Untermyer, both of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, claimant, is the grantee from the government of Spain of three concessions to lay down and operate submarine cables. The first one, in 1879, was for the exclusive privilege, for 40 years, of constructing and operating a cable between the Island of Luzon and Hongkong. It was landed at Bolinao on the northerly coast of Luzon, and dispatches were transmitted to Manila and other places by government owned land lines, which were subject to interruption. This concession required that official messages be transmitted free and be given precedence. In 1898 a second concession, supplemental to the first, empowered the claimant to extend its cable to Manila, and the term of the prior exclusive grant was extended 20 years, with the same priority for official dispatches, but with the provision that they were to be \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 357]\n\u00a0\n transmitted free only for the first 10 years from the date of this second grant.\n In 1897 a third concession, the one with which this case is chiefly concerned, authorized the claimant to lay down and operate three submarine cables, connecting the Island of Luzon with three Visayas Islands-Panay, Negros, and Cebu. This grant required the claimant to operate the cables for 20 years; to give precedence to official dispatches and to charge for them at one-half the rates charged for private messages; to pay a tax of ten per cent. on receipts in excess of expenses not to exceed 6,000 per annum, an additional tax of '50 centimes of a franc' per word on telegrams transmitted, and a surtax of '5 centimes of a franc' per word on telegrams between the four islands named in the grant and others of the Archipelago.\n The government of Spain, on its part, agreed to pay the claimant in equal monthly installments, an annual subsidy of 4,500 during the term of the grant.\n All of the cables were promptly laid down and put in use, and those of the third grant are designated in the record as the 'Visayas cables' and the grant as the 'Visayas concession.' This suit is to recover the amount of the subsidy provided for in the third concession, which had accrued when the petition was filed.\n The United States denied all liability, and the judgment of the Court of Claims, dismissing the petition, is before us for review.\n The case was here before on appeal, and this court held (\n231 U.S. 326\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 57) that the case as then stated in the petition was not within the jurisdiction of the court of Claims, whether viewed as asserting an obligation growing directly out of the treaty with Spain or one imposed by principles of international law upon the United States as a consequence of the cession of the Islands by the treaty. The court, however, referring to certain general and indefinite \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 358]\n\u00a0\n allegations in the petition, suggested that the implication might be drawn from them that there may have been action on the part of officials of the government of the United States since it had assumed sovereignty over the Islands which, if properly pleaded and proved, would give rise to an implied contract with the claimant outside the treaty, which would be within jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, and, to the end that the right to have such a claim adjudicated might be saved, if it really existed, the case was remanded for further proceedings in conformity with the opinion.\n Doubtless inspired by the suggestion from the court, an amended petition was filed, in which claimant alleged with much detail that the government of the United States had used the cables extensively for official messages, which had been given precedence and had been transmitted, as required by the terms of the two concessions, over the Hongkong cable free until 1908, and thereafter at one-fourth of the regular rate, and over the Visayas cables at one-half the rate charged for private dispatches; that the claimant had paid and the government accepted the 10 per cent. tax on receipts from messages, computed as required by the third concession; that since the American occupation the service over the Visayas cables had been extended and improved at large expense by arrangement with duly authorized officers of the government; and that in August, 1905, the claimant had paid and the government had accepted a balance due on an account stated in a form indicating an adoption of the terms of the concessions. By this course of conduct, it was averred, the United States 'assumed and adopted' all of the obligations imposed on the government of Spain by the concessions, and agreed with the claimant to discharge and perform all of them and especially agreed to pay the annual subsidy of 4, 500, as required by article 10 of the third concession. \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 359]\n\u00a0\n Trial by the Court of Claims resulted in findings of fact, as follows: That the concessions were made to claimant as alleged and that all of the cables were completed and in use when the Treaty with Spain was signed, December 10, 1898; that the government used the cables extensively for official dispatches, which were given priority in transmission, but that this was in accordance with the International Telegraph Convention, as well as in compliance with the terms of the concessions; that the claimant charged the government for messages over the Visayas cables at one-half the rate charged for private dispatches, which is the rate prescribed by the third concession, but that it 'has paid the full rates charged by the claimant for messages over any of the lines' and claimant had authority to make its own rates; and that it is not true that the claimant transmitted messages over the Hongkong cable free of charge. 'The United States government has paid full established rates on the Hongkong-Manila cable.'\n It is further found that since December, 1901, the claimant has made claim to the subsidy in annual statements to the authorities of the Philippine government, in which the terms of the concession granting it were referred to and in which the United States was charged with the amount of it then accrued. With respect to these, except as hereinafter noted, the court finds that whether any reply was made to them 'does not appear from the record.'\n Much significance is attached by the claimant to the statement presented on June 11, 1905. The finding with respect to this is that on that date the claimant's representative forwarded to 'the Secretary of Finance and Justice,' an officer of the Philippine government at Manila, a communication, with an attached statement purporting to show the amount 'due to the United States government in the Philippines on account of the transmission \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 360]\n\u00a0\n of all United States government traffic over the Manila-Hongkong cable, as per the concessiongranted to us for laying the same, up to and including December 31, 1904.'\n In this statement the government is credited (as if the amount had nor been paid) with what it had paid for service over the Hongkong-Manila cable, laid under the first and second concessions, from August 21, 1898, to December 31, 1904, and it is charged with 'Visayas subsidy,' under the third concession, 4,500 per annum to December, 1904. Thus a balance was arrived at of 4,712.10.6 in favor of the United States, 'as to the disposal of which I shall be glad to receive your instructions,' wrote the representative of the claimant.\n In reply to this the auditor of the government of the Philippine Islands, to whom it had been referred, wrote to claimant's representative at Manila, acknowledging receipt of his letter in which it was stated, 'There is due the insular government under your concession the sum of 4, 712.10.6,' and the auditor added, 'It is respectfully requested that said amount be deposited with the insular treasury as miscellaneous revenue.' Payment was made and receipt given by the treasurer of the government of the Philippine Islands for the amount as 'due government as per statement of account rendered by Eastern Extension, etc., Tel. Co. to Sec. Finance and Justice June 5, 1911.'\n Each year after 1905 the claimant sent a statement to the 'Secretary of Finance and Justice' at Manila in the form following:\n'The United States Government at Manila in Account with the Eastern Extension Australasia & China Tel. Co., Limited. ... Free Transmission of American Government Telegrams over Hongkong-Manila Section.'\n\n Then follow credits for messages passing over the Hongkong-Manila cable, as if they had not been paid for, and a debit of the 'Visayas \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 361]\n\u00a0\n subsidy' accrued to the date of the statement. To these no reply appears to have been made.\n It is expressly found that:\n'Except the payment above referred to in 1905, the claimant has never paid anything into the treasury of the Philippine government. It does not appear that any part of said sum was paid into the treasury of the United States. Nor has the claimant paid any sum to the United States government.'\n\n The only payment of the 10 per cent. tax under the third concession was that made in 1905, 184.17.2, and the statement showing this balance in favor of the United States concluded:\n'I therefore have the honor to request that the necessary permission be given to the treasurer to receive these amounts, now standing to the credit of the United States government in the Philippines.'\n\n Of its own motion the claimant, in 1899, made extensions of the Visayas cables at a considerable expense. But the finding with respect to this is:\n'These extensions were carried out with the approval of the military authorities in control of the Philippines at the time, and by the sanction of the United States government, but without prejudice to, and with the reservation of, all rights of the government of the United States.'\n\n The following is from the court's finding of fact No. IX:\n'Between the 10th day of December, 1898, and March, 1899, considerable correspondence was exchanged between the government of the United States and the claimant regarding the transmission of official telegrams over the Hongkong-Manila cable at reduced rates.\n\n'On the 1st of March, 1899, the Secretary of War transmitted to the chairman of the claimant company a telegram, stating that the War Department 'accepts the courteous offer of your company to transmit messages \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 362]\n\u00a0\n free between Hongkong and Manila, providing that this acceptance leaves in abeyance Spanish concession which is now under consideration.' On the following day claimant's reply was transmitted to the War Department, stating that the foregoing telegram had been received and the reservation therein noted, and that 'the company have pleasure in affording all possible facilities to the United States government in connection with the transmission of their telegrams.' On the 28th of March, 1899, a written communication was transmitted by the War Department to the duly authorized representative of the claimant company, to the effect that 'upon careful reconsideration of the subject it is deemed inadvisable for the department to avail itself of your company's offer. I beg to state, therefore, that the department will pay the established rates on official cable messages, and all accounts of this character presented to the United States will be paid.' This communication concluded with a renewal of thanks 'for the voluntary reduction in rates which your company has so courteously tendered.' The United States government has paid full established rates on Hongkong-Manila cable, and has paid the established rates on the Visayas cables on its messages.'\n\n Upon these findings of fact and upon principles and analogies derived from the law of private contract, the court must proceed to judgment. For it was determined by this court on the former appeal that any right in the defendant derived directly from the Treaty with Spain, or any obligation imposed upon the United States by principles of international law as a consequence of the cession of the Islands, would not be within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, and counsel for claimant, expressly disclaiming the assertion of any right under the Treaty of Paris, urge that the case be treated 'exactly as it would be if it arose between two private citizens.' \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 363]\n\u00a0\n So regarding the case: It is obvious that no express contract by the United States to adopt and be bound by the third or any of the concessions can be made out from the findings of fact, and it is equally clear that such an implied contract, using the words in any strict sense, cannot be derived from the findings, for it is plain that there is nothing in them tending to show that any official with power, express or implied, to commit that government to such a contract ever intended to so commit it.\n The contention of the claimant must be sustained, if at all, as a quasi contract, as an obligation imposed by law independent of intention on the part of any officials to bind the government, one which in equity and good conscience the government should discharge because of the conduct of its representatives in dealing with the subject-matter.\n It is argued that the United States should be held to have assumed the burden of the concession because it derived benefits and advantages from the use of the cables.\n These cables were in operation when the United States government assumed jurisdiction over the Islands. It extended a much more efficient governmental protection over the lines than they had before, but left the claimant in full ownership and control over them with the power to determine rates for service. The government, to be sure, availed itself of the advantages of communication which the cables afforded, but for such service it paid the rates which the claimant demanded and which it must be assumed were adequate. From such circumstances as these, very clearly, the law will not raise an obligation on the part of the government to assume the burden of the subsidy on the principle of undue enrichment or of advantage obtained. It used the cables as other customers used them, and from such a use, paid \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 364]\n\u00a0\n for at the full rate demanded, no obligation can be derived by implication.\n It is further contended that the terms and conditions of the concession should be imposed on the government because the officials of the Philippine government accepted taxes computed as provided for by the third grant.\n The finding of the Court of Claims is not that the Philippine government demanded or exacted the small amount of taxes that was paid, but that the claimant itself computed the amount in the manner which it thought was provided for in the concession and tendered payment, which, after repeated urging, was accepted by local officers of the Philippine government so subordinate in character that it is impossible to consider them as empowered to commit the government of the United States to the large responsibilities now claimed to spring from their conduct.\n The finding with respect to extension of the cables in 1899 excludes all suggestion of the assumption of any liability by the United States on account of the expenditure involved.\n The form of the statement of account of December 31, 1904, showing a balance favorable to the United States, which was paid to and accepted by the treasurer of the Philippine government, and from which so much is claimed, is not impressive as creating the asserted liability.\n Here again the claimant, without suggestion of demand from the government of the United States or even from the Philippine government, prepared a statement, and, in order to give it the form of an account, was obliged to treat as unpaid charges for tolls over the Hongkong-Manila cable all of which had been paid by the United States government and accepted by the claimant.\n A separate government, sustained by its own revenues, has been maintained for the Philippine Islands ever since they were ceded to the United States. At first military, \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 365]\n\u00a0\n it became a civil government in 1902, organized as provided for by an act of Congress (32 Stat. p. 691, c. 1369), with a Governor General, and executive, legislative and judicial departments all subject to the supervision of the Secretary of War of the United States.\n It is surprising that the claimant, when it desired to have these important concessions, with their large obligations, adopted by the government of the United States, did not make application for that purpose directly to that government or to its Secretary of War, or at least to the Governor General or legislative department of the Philippine government, instead of relying for its adoption by implication, as it has done, chiefly upon the form in which the accounts were presented to the secretary of finance and justice of the Philippine government.\n The action of a department head of the Philippine government ( inconsistent with the position taken by the Secretary of War in 1899, with respect to the subject-matter) in accepting a voluntary payment of $23,000 cannot be made the sufficient basis for implying an obligation on the part of the government of the United States to pay a bonus of a total aggregate of almost $440,000.\n If doubt could be entertained as to the correctness of this conclusion, it would be disposed of by the fact that when the claimant, in March, 1899, tendered to the Secretary of War, so far as appears the only official of the United States with large powers, who considered the subject, the privilege of free transmission of messages over its Hongkong- Manila cable, as was provided for in the first concession, the offer was politely, but firmly, declined with the statement that 'the Department will pay the established rates on official cable messages and all accounts of this character presented to the United States will be paid'-a promise which the findings show that he and his successors in office have faithfully kept.\n In the jurisdiction given to the Court of Claims Con \n\n[251 U.S. 355, 366]\n\u00a0\n gress has consented that contracts, express or implied, may be judicially enforced against the government of the United States. But such a liability can be created only by some officer of the government lawfully invested with power to make such contracts or to perform acts from which they may be lawfully implied. Langford v. United States, \n101 U.S. 341\n, 345; United States v. Buffalo, Pitts Co., \n234 U.S. 228\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 840; Tempel v. United States, \n248 U.S. 121\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 56; Ball Engineering Co. v. J. G. White, \n250 U.S. 55\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 393.\n The foregoing discussion makes it palpably plain that no contract, express or implied, to pay the disputed subsidy, was made by any officer of the United States, and the judgment of the Court of Claims is therefore\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEISNER v. MACOMBER(1920)\nNo. 318\nArgued: April 16, 1919Decided: March 8, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 189, 190]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes and George Welwood Murray, both of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 189, 199]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question whether, by virtue of the Sixteenth Amendment, Congress has the power to tax, as income of the stockholder and without apportionment, a stock dividend made lawfully and in good faith against profits accumulated by the corporation since March 1, 1913.\n It arises under the Revenue Act of September 8, 1916 (39 Stat. 756 et seq., c. 463 [Comp. St.  6336a et seq.]), which, in our opinion ( notwithstanding a contention of the government that will be \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 200]\n\u00a0\n noticed), plainly evinces the purpose of Congress to tax stock dividends as income. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The facts, in outline, are as follows:\n On January 1, 1916, the Standard Oil Company of California, a corporation of that state, out of an authorized capital stock of $100,000, 000, had shares of stock outstanding, par value $100 each, amounting in round figures to $50,000,000. In addition, it had surplus and undivided profits invested in plant, property, and business and required for the purposes of the corporation, amounting to about $45,000,000, of which about $20,000,000 had been earned prior to March 1, 1913, the balance thereafter. In January, 1916, in order to readjust the capitalization, the board of directors decided to issue additional shares sufficient to constitute a stock dividend of 50 per cent. of the outstanding stock, and to transfer from surplus account to capital stock account an amount equivalent to such issue. Appropriate resolutions were adopted, an amount equivalent to the par value of the proposed new stock was transferred accordingly, and the new stock duly issued against it and divided among the stockholders.\n Defendant in error, being the owner of 2,200 shares of the old stock, received certificates for 1,100 additional \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 201]\n\u00a0\n shares, of which 18.07 per cent., or 198.77 shares, par value $19,877, were treated as representing surplus earned between March 1, 1913, and January 1, 1916. She was called upon to pay, and did pay under protest, a tax imposed under the Revenue Act of 1916, based upon a supposed income of $ 19,877 because of the new shares; and an appeal to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue having been disallowed, she brought action against the Collector to recover the tax. In her complaint she alleged the above facts, and contended that in imposing such a tax the Revenue Act of 1916 violated article 1,  2, cl. 3, and article 1,  9, cl. 4, of the Constitution of the United States, requiring direct taxes to be apportioned according to population, and that the stock dividend was not income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment. A general demurrer to the complaint was overruled upon the authority of Towne v. Eisner, \n245 U.S. 418\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254; and, defendant having failed to plead further, final judgment went against him. To review it, the present writ of error is prosecuted.\n The case was argued at the last term, and reargued at the present term, both orally and by additional briefs.\n We are constrained to hold that the judgment of the District Court must be affirmed: First, because the question at issue is controlled by Towne v. Eisner, supra; secondly, because a re-examination of the question with the additional light thrown upon it by elaborate arguments, has confirmed the view that the underlying ground of that decision is sound, that it disposes of the question here presented, and that other fundamental considerations lead to the same result.\n In Towne v. Eisner, the question was whether a stock dividend made in 1914 against surplus earned prior to January 1, 1913, was taxable against the stockholder under the Act of October 3, 1913 (38 Stat. 114, 166, c. 16 ), which provided (section B, p. 167) that net income should include 'dividends,' and also 'gains or profits and income derived \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 202]\n\u00a0\n from any source whatever.' Suit having been brought by a stockholder to recover the tax assessed against him by reason of the dividend, the District Court sustained a demurrer to the complaint. 242 Fed. 702. The court treated the construction of the act as inseparable from the interpretation of the Sixteenth Amendment; and, having referred to Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n158 U.S. 601\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 912, and quoted the Amendment, proceeded very properly to say (242 Fed. 704):\n'It is manifest that the stock dividend in question cannot be reached by the Income Tax Act and could not, even though Congress expressly declared it to be taxable as income, unless it is in fact income.'\n\n It declined, however, to accede to the contention that in Gibbons v. Mahon, \n136 U.S. 549\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 1057, 'stock dividends' had received a definition sufficiently clear to be controlling, treated the language of this court in that case as obiter dictum in respect of the matter then before it (242 Fed. 706), and examined the question as res nova, with the result stated. When the case came here, after overruling a motion to dismiss made by the government upon the ground that the only question involved was the construction of the statute and not its constitutionality, we dealt upon the merits with the question of construction only, but disposed of it upon consideration of the essential nature of a stock dividend disregarding the fact that the one in question was based upon surplus earnings that accrued before the Sixteenth Amendment took effect. Not only so, but we rejected the reasoning of the District Court, saying (\n245 U.S. 426\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 159, L. R. A. 1918D, 254):\n'Notwithstanding the thoughtful discussion that the case received below we cannot doubt that the dividend was capital as well for the purposes of the Income Tax Law as for distribution between tenant for life and remainderman. What was said by this court upon the latter question is equally true for the former. 'A stock dividend really takes nothing from the property of the corporation, and adds nothing to the \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 203]\n\u00a0\n interests of the shareholders. Its property is not diminished, and their interests are not increased. ... The proportional interest of each shareholder remains the same. The only change is in the evidence which represents that interest, the new shares and the original shares together representing the same proportional interest that the original shares represented before the issue of the new ones.' Gibbons v. Mahon, \n136 \nU.S. 549, 559\n, 560 S. [10 Sup. Ct. 1057]. In short, the corporation is no poorer and the stockholder is no richer than they were before. Logan County v. United States, \n169 U.S. 255\n, 261 [18 Sup. Ct. 361]. If the plaintiff gained any small advantage by the change, it certainly was not an advantage of $417,450, the sum upon which he was taxed. ... What has happened is that the plaintiff's old certificates have been split up in effect and have diminished in value to the extent of the value of the new.'\n\n This language aptly answered not only the reasoning of the District Court but the argument of the Solicitor General in this court, which discussed the essential nature of a stock dividend. And if, for the reasons thus expressed, such a dividend is not to be regarded as 'income' or 'dividends' within the meaning of the act of 1913, we are unable to see how it can be brought within the meaning of 'incomes' in the Sixteenth Amendment; it being very clear that Congress intended in that act to exert its power to the extent permitted by the amendment. In Towne v. Eisner it was not contended that any construction of the statute could make it narrower than the constitutional grant; rather the contrary.\n The fact that the dividend was charged against profits earned before the act of 1913 took effect, even before the amendment was adopted, was neither relied upon nor alluded to in our consideration of the merits in that case. Not only so, but had we considered that a stock dividend constituted income in any true sense, it would have been held taxable under the act of 1913 notwithstanding it was \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 204]\n\u00a0\n based upon profits earned before the amendment. We ruled at the same term, in Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 U.S. 339\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 543, that a cash dividend extraordinary in amount, and in Peabody v. Eisner, \n247 U.S. 347\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 546, that a dividend paid in stock of another company, were taxable as income although based upon earnings that accrued before adoption of the amendment. In the former case, concerning 'corporate profits that accumulated before the act took effect,' we declared (\n247 \nU.S. 343, 344\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 543, 545 [62 L. Ed. 1149]):\n'Just as we deem the legislative intent manifest to tax the stockholder with respect to such accumulations only if and when, and to the extent that, his interest in them comes to fruition as income, that is, in dividends declared, so we can perceive no constitutional obstacle that stands in the way of carrying out this intent when dividends are declared out of a pre-existing surplus. ... Congress was at liberty under the amendment to tax as income, without apportionment, everything that became income, in the ordinary sense of the word, after the adoption of the amendment, including dividends received in the ordinary course by a stockholder from a corporation, even though they were extraordinary in amount and might appear upon analysis to be a mere realization in possession of an inchoate and contingent interest that the stockholder had in a surplus of corporate assets previously existing.'\n\n In Peabody v. Eisner, \n247 \nU.S. 349, 350\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 546, 547 (62 L. Ed. 1152), we observed that the decision of the District Court in Towne v. Eisner had been reversed 'only upon the ground that it related to a stock dividend which in fact took nothing from the property of the corporation and added nothing to the interest of the shareholder, but merely changed the evidence which represented that interest,' and we distinguished the Peabody Case from the Towne Case upon the ground that 'the dividend of Baltimore & Ohio shares was not a stock dividend but a distribution in specie of a portion of the assets of the Union Pacific.'\n Therefore Towne v. Eisner cannot be regarded as turning \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 205]\n\u00a0\n upon the point that the surplus accrued to the company before the act took effect and before adoption of the amendment. And what we have quoted from the opinion in that case cannot be regarded as obiter dictum, it having furnished the entire basis for the conclusion reached. We adhere to the view then expressed, and might rest the present case there, not because that case in terms decided the constitutional question, for it did not, but because the conclusion there reached as to the essential nature of a stock dividend necessarily prevents its being regarded as income in any true sense.\n Nevertheless, in view of the importance of the matter, and the fact that Congress in the Revenue Act of 1916 declared (39 Stat. 757 [Comp. St .  6336b]) that a 'stock dividend shall be considered income, to the amount of its cash value,' we will deal at length with the constitutional question, incidentally testing the soundness of our previous conclusion.\n The Sixteenth Amendment must be construed in connection with the taxing clauses of the original Constitution and the effect attributed to them before the amendment was adopted. In Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n158 U.S. 601\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 912, under the Act of August 27, 1894 (28 Stat. 509, 553, c. 349,  27), it was held that taxes upon rents and profits of real estate and upon returns from investments of personal property were in effect direct taxes upon the property from which such income arose, imposed by reason of ownership; and that Congress could not impose such taxes without apportioning them among the states according to population, as required by article 1,  2, cl. 3, and section 9, cl. 4, of the original Constitution.\n Afterwards, and evidently in recognition of the limitation upon the taxing power of Congress thus determined, the Sixteenth Amendment was adopted, in words lucidly expressing the object to be accomplished:\n'The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 206]\n\u00a0\n the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.'\n\n As repeatedly held, this did not extend the taxing power to new subjects, but merely removed the necessity which otherwise might exist for an apportionment among the states of taxes laid on income. Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 U.S. 1\n, 17-19, 36 Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414; Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., \n240 U.S. 103\n, 112 et seq., 36 Sup. Ct. 278; Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165, 172\n, 173 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 432.\n A proper regard for its genesis, as well as its very clear language, requires also that this amendment shall not be extended by loose construction, so as to repeal or modify, except as applied to income, those provisions of the Constitution that require an apportionment according to population for direct taxes upon property, real and personal. This limitation still has an appropriate and important function, and is not to be overridden by Congress or disregarded by the courts.\n In order, therefore, that the clauses cited from article 1 of the Constitution may have proper force and effect, save only as modified by the amendment, and that the latter also may have proper effect, it becomes essential to distinguish between what is and what is not 'income,' as the term is there used, and to apply the distinction, as cases arise, according to truth and substance, without regard to form. Congress cannot by any definition it may adopt conclude the matter, since it cannot by legislation alter the Constitution, from which alone it derives its power to legislate, and within whose limitations alone that power can be lawfully exercised.\n The fundamental relation of 'capital' to 'income' has been much discussed by economists, the former being likened to the tree or the land, the latter to the fruit or the crop; the former depicted as a reservoir supplied from springs, the latter as the outlet stream, to be measured by its flow during a period of time. For the present purpose we require only a clear definition of the term 'income,' \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 207]\n\u00a0\n as used in common speech, in order to determine its meaning in the amendment, and, having formed also a correct judgment as to the nature of a stock dividend, we shall find it easy to decide the matter at issue.\n After examining dictionaries in common use (Bouv. L. D.; Standard Dict.; Webster's Internat. Dict.; Century Dict.), we find little to add to the succinct definition adopted in two cases arising under the Corporation Tax Act of 1909 (Stratton's Independence v. Howbert, \n231 \nU.S. 399, 415\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 136, 140 [58 L. Ed. 285]; Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 185\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 467, 469 [62 L. Ed. 1054]), 'Income may be defined as the gain derived from capital, from labor, or from both combined,' provided it be understood to include profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets, to which it was applied in the Doyle Case, \n247 \nU.S. 183, 185\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 467, 469 (62 L. Ed. 1054).\n Brief as it is, it indicates the characteristic and distinguishing attribute of income essential for a correct solution of the present controversy. The government, although basing its argument upon the definition as quoted, placed chief emphasis upon the word 'gain,' which was extended to include a variety of meanings; while the significance of the next three words was either overlooked or misconceived. 'Derived-from- capital'; 'the gain-derived-from-capital,' etc. Here we have the essential matter: not a gain accruing to capital; not a growth or increment of value in the investment; but a gain, a profit, something of exchangeable value, proceeding from the property, severed from the capital, however invested or employed, and coming in, being 'derived'-that is, received or drawn by the recipient (the taxpayer) for his separate use, benefit and disposal- that is income derived from property. Nothing else answers the description.\n The same fundamental conception is clearly set forth in the Sixteenth Amendment-'incomes, from whatever source derived'-the essential thought being expressed \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 208]\n\u00a0\n with a conciseness and lucidity entirely in harmony with the form and style of the Constitution.\n Can a stock dividend, considering its essential character, be brought within the definition? To answer this, regard must be had to the nature of a corporation and the stockholder's relation to it. We refer, of course, to a corporation such as the one in the case at bar, organized for profit, and having a capital stock divided into shares to which a nominal or par value is attributed.\n Certainly the interest of the stockholder is a capital interest, and his certificates of stock are but the evidence of it. They state the number of shares to which he is entitled and indicate their par value and how the stock may be transferred. They show that he or his assignors, immediate or remote, have contributed capital to the enterprise, that he is entitled to a corresponding interest proportionate to the whole, entitled to have the property and business of the company devoted during the corporate existence to attainment of the common objects, entitled to vote at stockholders' meetings, to receive dividends out of the corporation's profits if and when declared, and, in the event of liquidation, to receive a proportionate share of the net assets, if any, remaining after paying creditors. Short of liquidation, or until dividend declared, he has no right to withdraw any part of either capital or profits from the common enterprise; on the contrary, his interest pertains not to any part, divisible or indivisible, but to the entire assets, business, and affairs of the company. Nor is it the interest of an owner in the assets themselves, since the corporation has full title, legal and equitable, to the whole. The stockholder has the right to have the assets employed in the enterprise, with the incidental rights mentioned; but, as stockholder, he has no right to withdraw, only the right to persist, subject to the risks of the enterprise, and looking only to dividends for his return. If he desires to dissociate himself \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 209]\n\u00a0\n from the company he can do so only by disposing of his stock.\n For bookeeping purposes, the company acknowledges a liability in form to the stockholders equivalent to the aggregate par value of their stock, evidenced by a 'capital stock account.' If profits have been made and not divided they create additional bookkeeping liabilities under the head of 'profit and loss,' 'undivided profits,' 'surplus account,' or the like. None of these, however, gives to the stockholders as a body, much less to any one of them, either a claim against the going concern for any particular sum of money, or a right to any particular portion of the assets or any share in them unless or until the directors conclude that dividends shall be made and a part of the company's assets segregated from the common fund for the purpose. The dividend normally is payable in money, under exceptional circumstances in some other divisible property; and when so paid, then only (excluding, of course, a possible advantageous sale of his stock or winding-up of the company) does the stockholder realize a profit or gain which becomes his separate property, and thus derive income from the capital that he or his predecessor has invested.\n In the present case, the corporation had surplus and undivided profits invested in plant, property, and business, and required for the purposes of the corporation, amounting to about $45,000,000, in addition to outstanding capital stock of $50,000,000. In this the case is not extraordinary. The profits of a corporation, as they appear upon the balance sheet at the end of the year, need not be in the form of money on hand in excess of what is required to meet current liabilities and finance current operations of the company. Often, especially in a growing business, only a part, sometimes a small part, of the year's profits is in property capable of division; the remainder having been absorbed in the acquisition of increased plant, \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 210]\n\u00a0\n quipment, stock in trade, or accounts receivable, or in decrease of outstanding liabilities. When only a part is available for dividends, the balance of the year's profits is carried to the credit of undivided profits, or surplus, or some other account having like significance. If thereafter the company finds itself in funds beyond current needs it may declare dividends out of such surplus or undivided profits; otherwise it may go on for years conducting a successful business, but requiring more and more working capital because of the extension of its operations, and therefore unable to declare dividends approximating the amount of its profits. Thus the surplus may increase until it equals or even exceeds the par value of the outstanding capital stock. This may be adjusted upon the books in the mode adopted in the case at bar-by declaring a 'stock dividend.' This, however, is no more than a book adjustment, in essence not a dividend but rather the opposite; no part of the assets of the company is separated from the common fund, nothing distributed except paper certificates that evidence an antecedent increase in the value of the stockholder's capital interest resulting from an accumulation of profits by the company, but profits so far absorbed in the business as to render it impracticable to separate them for withdrawal and distribution. In order to make the adjustment, a charge is made against surplus account with corresponding credit to capital stock account, equal to the proposed 'dividend'; the new stock is issued against this and the certificates delivered to the existing stockholders in proportion to their previous holdings. This, however, is merely bookkeeping that does not affect the aggregate assets of the corporation or its outstanding liabilities; it affects only the form, not the essence, of the 'liability' acknowledged by the corporation to its own shareholders, and this through a readjustment of accounts on one side of the balance sheet only, increasing 'capital stock' at the expense of \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 211]\n\u00a0\n 'SURPLUS'; IT DOES NOT ALTER THE PRE-EXisting proportionate interest of any stockholder or increase the intrinsic value of his holding or of the aggregate holdings of the other stockholders as they stood before. The new certificates simply increase the number of the shares, with consequent dilution of the value of each share.\n A 'stock dividend' shows that the company's accumulated profits have been capitalized, instead of distributed to the stockholders or retained as surplus available for distribution in money or in kind should opportunity offer. Far from being a realization of profits of the stockholder, it tends rather to postpone such realization, in that the fund represented by the new stock has been transferred from surplus to capital, and no longer is available for actual distribution.\n The essential and controlling fact is that the stockholder has received nothing out of the company's assets for his separate use and benefit; on the contrary, every dollar of his original investment, together with whatever accretions and accumulations have resulted from employment of his money and that of the other stockholders in the business of the company, still remains the property of the company, and subject to business risks which may result in wiping out the entire investment. Having regard to the very truth of the matter, to substance and not to form, he has recived nothing that answers the definition of income within the meaning of the Sixteenth Amendment.\n Being concerned only with the true character and effect of such a dividend when lawfully made, we lay aside the question whether in a particular case a stock dividend may be authorized by the local law governing the corporation, or whether the capitalization of profits may be the result of correct judgment and proper business policy on the part of its management, and a due regard for the interests of the stockholders. And we are considering the taxability of bona fide stock dividends only. \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 212]\n\u00a0\n We are clear that not only does a stock dividend really take nothing from the property of the corporation and add nothing to that of the shareholder, but that the antecedent accumulation of profits evidenced thereby, while indicating that the shareholder is the richer because of an increase of his capital, at the same time shows he has not realized or received any income in the transaction.\n It is said that a stockholder may sell the new shares acquired in the stock dividend; and so he may, if he can find a buyer. It is equally true that if he does sell, and in doing so realizes a profit, such profit, like any other, is income, and so far as it may have arisen since the Sixteenth Amendment is taxable by Congress without apportionment. The same would be true were he to sell some of his original shares at a profit. But if a shareholder sells dividend stock he necessarily disposes of a part of his capital interest, just as if he should sell a part of his old stock, either before or after the dividend. What he retains no longer entitles him to the same proportion of future dividends as before the sale. His part in the control of the company likewise is diminished. Thus, if one holding $60,000 out of a total $100,000 of the capital stock of a corporation should receive in common with other stockholders a 50 per cent. stock dividend, and should sell his part, he thereby would be reduced from a majority to a minority stockholder, having six-fifteenths instead of six- tenths of the total stock outstanding. A corresponding and proportionate decrease in capital interest and in voting power would befall a minority holder should he sell dividend stock; it being in the nature of things impossible for one to dispose of any part of such an issue without a proportionate disturbance of the distribution of the entire capital stock, and a like diminution of the seller's comparative voting power-that 'right preservative of rights' in the control of a corporation. \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 213]\n\u00a0\n Yet, without selling, the shareholder, unless possessed of other resources, has not the wherewithal to pay an income tax upon the dividend stock. Nothing could more clearly show that to tax a stock dividend is to tax a capital increase, and not income, than this demonstration that in the nature of things it requires conversion of capital in order to pay the tax.\n Throughout the argument of the government, in a variety of forms, runs the fundamental error already mentioned-a failure to appraise correctly the force of the term 'income' as used in the Sixteenth Amendment, or at least to give practical effect to it. Thus the government contends that the tax 'is levied on income derived from corporate earnings,' when in truth the stockholder has 'derived' nothing except paper certificates which, so far as they have any effect, deny him present participation in such earnings. It contends that the tax may be laid when earnings 'are received by the stockholder,' whereas he has received none; that the profits are 'distributed by means of a stock dividend,' although a stock dividend distributes no profits; that under the act of 1916 'the tax is on the stockholder's share in corporate earnings,' when in truth a stockholder has no such share, and receives none in a stock dividend; that 'the profits are segregated from his former capital, and he has a separate certificate representing his invested profits or gains,' whereas there has been no segregation of profits, nor has he any separate certificate representing a personal gain, since the certificates, new and old, are alike in what they represent-a capital interest in the entire concerns of the corporation.\n We have no doubt of the power or duty of a court to look through the form of the corporation and determine the question of the stockholder's right, in order to ascertain whether he has received income taxable by Congress without apportionment. But, looking through the form, \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 214]\n\u00a0\n we cannot disregard the essential truth disclosed, ignore the substantial difference between corporation and stockholder, treat the entire organization as unreal, look upon stockholders as partners, when they are not such, treat them as having in equity a right to a partition of the corporate assets, when they have none, and indulge the fiction that they have received and realized a share of the profits of the company which in truth they have neither received nor realized. We must treat the corporation as a substantial entity separate from the stockholder, not only because such is the practical fact but because it is only by recognizing such separateness that any dividend-even one paid in money or property-can be regarded as income of the stockholder. Did we regard corporation and stockholders as altogether identical, there would be no income except as the corporation acquired it; and while this would be taxable against the corporation as income under appropriate provisions of law, the individual stockholders could not be separately and additionally taxed with respect to their several shares even when divided, since if there were entire identity between them and the company they could not be regarded as receiving anything from it, any more than if one's money were to be removed from one pocket to another.\n Conceding that the mere issue of a stock dividend makes the recipient no richer than before, the government nevertheless contends extent to which the gains accumulated by the extend to which the gains accumulated by the corporation have made him the richer. There are two insuperable difficulties with this: In the first place, it would depend upon how long he had held the stock whether the stock dividend indicated the extent to which he had been enriched by the operations of the company; unless he had held it throughout such operations the measure would not hold true. Secondly, and more important for present purposes, enrichment through increase in value \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 215]\n\u00a0\n of capital investment is not income in any proper meaning of the term.\n The complaint contains averments respecting the market prices of stock such as plaintiff held, based upon sales before and after the stock dividend, tending to show that the receipt of the additional shares did not substantially change the market value of her entire holdings. This tends to show that in this instance market quotations reflected intrinsic values-a thing they do not always do. But we regard the market prices of the securities as an unsafe criterion in an inquiry such as the present, when the question must be, not what will the thing sell for, but what is it in truth and in essence.\n It is said there is no difference in principle between a simple stock dividend and a case where stockholders use money received as cash dividends to purchase additional stock contemporaneously issued by the corporation. But an actual cash dividend, with a real option to the stockholder either to keep the money for his own or to reinvest it in new shares, would be as far removed as possible from a true stock dividend, such as the one we have under consideration, where nothing of value is taken from the company's assets and transferred to the individual ownership of the several stockholders and thereby subjected to their disposal.\n The government's reliance upon the supposed analogy between a dividend of the corporation's own shares and one made by distributing shares owned by it in the stock of another company, calls for no comment beyond the statement that the latter distributes assets of the company among the shareholders while the former does not, and for no citation of authority except Peabody v. Eisner, \n247 \nU.S. 347, 349\n, 350 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 546.\n Two recent decisions, proceeding from courts of high jurisdiction, are cited in support of the position of the government. \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 216]\n\u00a0\n Swan Brewery Co., Ltd. v. Rex, \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 1914]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 231, arose under the Dividend Duties Act of Western Australia, which provided that 'dividend' should include 'every dividend, profit, advantage, or gain intended to be paid or credited to or distributed among any members or directors of any company,' except, etc. There was a stock dividend, the new shares being allotted among the shareholders pro rata; and the question was whether this was a distribution of a dividend within the meaning of the act. The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council sustained the dividend duty upon the ground that, although 'in ordinary language the new shares would not be called a dividend, nor would the allotment of them be a distribution of a dividend,' yet, within the meaning of the act, such new shares were an 'advantage' to the recipients. There being no constitutional restriction upon the action of the lawmaking body, the case presented merely a question of statutory construction, and manifestly the decision is not a precedent for the guidance of this court when acting under a duty to test an act of Congress by the limitations of a written Constitution having superior force.\n In Tax Commissioner v. Putnam (1917) 227 Mass. 522, 116 N. E. 904, L. R. A. 1917F, 806, it was held that the Forty-Fourth amendment to the Constitution of Massachusetts, which conferred upon the Legislature full power to tax incomes, 'must be interpreted as including every item which by any reasonable understanding can fairly be regarded as income' (227 Mass. 526, 531, 116 N. E. 904, 907 [L. R. A. 1917F, 806]), and that under it a stock dividend was taxable as income; the court saying (227 Mass. 535, 116 N. E. 911, L. R. A. 1917F, 806):\n'In essence the thing which has been done is to distribute a symbol representing an accumulation of profits, which instead of being paid out in cash is invested in the business, thus augmenting its durable assets. In this aspect of the case the substance of the transaction is no different from what it would be if a cash dividend had been declared with the privilege of subscription to an equivalent amount of new shares.' \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 217]\n\u00a0\n We cannot accept this reasoning. Evidently, in order to give a sufficiently broad sweep to the new taxing provision, it was deemed necessary to take the symbol for the substance, accumulation for distribution, capital accretion for its opposite; while a case where money is paid into the hand of the stockholder with an option to buy new shares with it, followed by acceptance of the option, was regarded as identical in substance with a case where the stockholder receives no money and has no option. The Massachusetts court was not under an obligation, like the one which binds us, of applying a constitutional amendment in the light of other constitutional provisions that stand in the way of extending it by construction.\n\n Upon the second argument, the government, recognizing the force of the decision in Towne v. Eisner, supra, and virtually abandoning the contention that a stock dividend increases the interest of the stockholder or otherwise enriches him, insisted as an alternative that by the true construction of the act of 1916 the tax is imposed, not upon the stock dividend, but rather upon the stockholder's share of the undivided profits previously accumulated by the corporation; the tax being levied as a matter of convenience at the time such profits become manifest through the stock dividend. If so construed, would the act be constitutional?\n That Congress has power to tax shareholders upon their property interests in the stock of corporations is beyond question, and that such interests might be valued in view of the condition of the company, including its accumulated and undivided profits, is equally clear. But that this would be taxation of property because of ownership, and hence would require apportionment under the provisions of the Constitution, is settled beyond peradventure by previous decisions of this court.\n The government relies upon Collector v. Hubbard (1870) \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 218]\n\u00a0\n 12 Wall. 1, (20 L. Ed. 272), which arose under section 117 of the Act of June 30, 1864 (13 Stat. 223, 282, c. 173), providing that--\n'The gains and profits of all companies, whether incorporated or partnership, other than the companies specified in that section, shall be included in estimating the annual gains, profits, or income of any person, entitled to the same, whether divided or otherwise.'\n\n The court held an individual taxable upon his proportion of the earnings of a corporation although not declared as dividends and although invested in assets not in their nature divisible. Conceding that the stockholder for certain purposes had no title prior to dividend declared, the court nevertheless said (12 Wall. 18):\n'Grant all that, still it is true that the owner of a share of stock in a corporation holds the share with all its incidents, and that among those incidents is the right to receive all future dividends, that is, his proportional share of all profits not then divided. Profits are incident to the share to which the owner at once becomes entitled provided he remains a member of the corporation until a dividend is made. Regarded as an incident to the shares, undivided profits are property of the shareholder, and as such are the proper subject of sale, gift, or devise. Undivided profits invested in real estate, machinery, or raw material for the purpose of being manufactured are investments in which the stockholders are interested, and when such profits are actually appropriated to the payment of the debts of the corporation they serve to increase the market value of the shares, whether held by the original subscribers or by assignees.'\n\n In so far as this seems to uphold the right of Congress to tax without apportionment a stockholder's interest in accumulated earnings prior to dividend declared, it must be regarded as overruled by Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n158 \nU.S. 601, 627\n, 628 S., 637, 15 Sup. Ct. 912. Conceding Collector v. Hubbard was inconsistent with the doctrine of that case, because it sustained a direct tax upon property not apportioned \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 219]\n\u00a0\n AMONG THE STATES, THE GOVERNMENT NEVERTHEless insists that the sixteenth Amendment removed this obstacle, so that now the Hubbard Case is authority for the power of Congress to levy a tax on the stockholder's share in the accumulated profits of the corporation even before division by the declaration of a dividend of any kind. Manifestly this argument must be rejected, since the amendment applies to income only, and what is called the stockholder's share in the accumulated profits of the company is capital, not income. As we have pointed out, a stockholder has no individual share in accumulated profits, nor in any particular part of the assets of the corporation, prior to dividend declared.\n Thus, from every point of view we are brought irresistibly to the conclusion that neither under the Sixteenth Amendment nor otherwise has Congress power to tax without apportionment a true stock dividend made lawfully and in good faith, or the accumulated profits behind it, as income of the stockholder. The Revenue Act of 1916, in so far as it imposes a tax upon the stockholder because of such dividend, contravenes the provisions of article 1,  2, cl. 3, and article 1,  9, cl. 4, of the Constitution, and to this extent is invalid, notwithstanding the Sixteenth Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n I think that Towne v. Eisner, \n245 U.S. 418\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254, was right in its reasoning and result and that on sound principles the stock dividend was not income. But it was clearly intimated in that case that the construction of the statute then before the Court might be different from that of the Constitution. \n245 U.S. 425\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1918D, 254. I think that the word 'incomes' in the Sixteenth Amendment should be read in \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 220]\n\u00a0\n 'a sense most obvious to the common understanding at the time of its adoption.' Bishop v. State, 149 Ind. 223, 230, 48 N. E. 1038, 1040, 39 L. R. A. 278, 63 Am. St. Rep. 270; State v. Butler, 70 Fla. 102, 133, 69 South. 771. For it was for public adoption that it was proposed. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407. The known purpose of this Amendment was to get rid of nice questions as to what might be direct taxes, and I cannot doubt that most people not lawyers would suppose when they voted for it that they put a question like the present to rest. I am of opinion that the Amendment justifies the tax. See Tax Commissioner v. Putnam, 227 Mass. 522, 532, 533, 116 N. E. 904, L. R. A. 1917F, 806.\n Mr. Justice DAY concurs in this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the following [dissenting] opinion:\n Financiers, with the aid of lawyers, devised long ago two different methods by which a corporation can, without increasing its indebtedness, keep for corporate purposes accumulated profits, and yet, in effect, distribute these profits among its stockholders. One method is a simple one. The capital stock is increased; the new stock is paid up with the accumulated profits; and the new shares of paid-up stock are then distributed among the stockholders pro rata as a dividend. If the stockholder prefers ready money to increasing his holding of the stock in the company, he sells the new stock received as a dividend. The other method is slightly more complicated. .arrangements are made for an increase of stock to be offered to stockholders pro rata at par, and, at the same time, for the payment of a cash dividend equal to the amount which the stockholder will be required to pay to \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 221]\n\u00a0\n the company, if he avails himself of the right to subscribe for his pro rata of the new stock. If the stockholder takes the new stock, as is expected, he may endorse the dividend check received to the corporation and thus pay for the new stock. In order to ensure that all the new stock so offered will be taken, the price at which it is offered is fixed far below what it is believed will be its market value. If the stockholder prefers ready money to an increase of his holdings of stock, he may sell his right to take new stock pro rata, which is evidenced by an assignable instrument. In that event the purchaser of the rights repays to the corporation, as the subscription price of the new stock, an amount equal to that which it had paid as a chsh dividend to the stockholder.\n Both of these methods of retaining accumulated profits while in effect distributing them as a dividend had been in common use in the United States for many years prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment. They were recognized equivalents. Whether a particular corporation employed one or the other method was determined sometimes by requirements of the law under which the corporation was organized; sometimes it was determined by preferences of the individual officials of the corporation; and sometimes by stock market conditions. Whichever method was employed the resultant distribution of the new stock was commonly referred to as a stock dividend. How these two methods have been employed may be illustrated by the action in this respect (as reported in Moody's Manual, 1918 Industrial, and the Commercial and Financial Chronicle) of some of the Standard Oil companies, since the disintegration pursuant to the decision of this court in 1911. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 U.S. 1\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734.\n\n\n (a)\n Standard Oil Co. (of Indiana), an Indiana corporation. It had on December 31, 1911, $1,000,000 capital stock (all common), and a large surplus. On May 15, \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 222]\n\u00a0\n 1912, it increased its capital stock to $30,000,000, and paid a simple stock dividend of 2,900 per cent. in stock. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n\n (b)\n Standard Oil Co. (of Nebraska), a Nebraska corporation. It had on December 31, 1911, $600,000 capital stock (all common), and a substantial surplus. On April 15, 1912, it paid a simple stock dividend of 33 1\/3 per cent., increasing the outstanding capital to $800,000. During the calendar year 1912 it paid cash dividends aggregating 20 per cent., but it earned considerably more, and had at the close of the year again a substantial surplus. On June 20, 1913, it declared a further stock dividend of 25 per cent., thus increasing the capital to $1,000,000.3\n\n\n (c)\n The Standard Oil Co. (of Kentucky), a Kentucky corporation. It had on December 31, 1913, $1,000,000 capital stock (all common) and $3,701, 710 surplus. Of this surplus $902,457 had been earned during the calendar year 1913, the net profits of that year having been $1,002,457 and the dividends paid only $100,000 (10 per cent.). On December 22, 1913, a cash dividend of $200 per share was declared payable on February 14, 1914, to stockholders of record January 31, 1914, and these stockholders were offered the right to subscribe for an equal amount of new stock at par and to apply the cash dividend in payment therefor. The outstanding stock was thus increased to $3,000,000. During the calendar years 1914, 1915, and 1916, quarterly dividends were paid on this stock at an annual rate of between 15 per cent. and 20 per cent., but the company's surplus increased by $2,347,614, so that on December 31, 1916, it had a large surplus over its $3,000,000 capital stock. On December 15, 1916, the company issued a circular to the stockholders, saying:\n'The company's business for this year has shown a \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 223]\n\u00a0\n very good increase in volume and a proportionate increase in profits, and it is estimated that by January 1, 1917, the company will have a surplus of over $4,000,000. The board feels justified in stating that if the proposition to increase the capital stock is acted on favorably, it will be proper in the near future to declare a cash dividend of 100 per cent. and to allow the stockholders the privilege pro rata according to their holdings, to purchase the new stock at par, the plan being to allow the stockholders, if they desire, to use their cash dividend to pay for the new stock.'\n\n The increase of stock was voted. The company then paid a cash dividend of 100 per cent., payable May 1, 1917, again offering to such stockholders the right to subscribe for an equal amount of new stock at par and to apply the cash dividend in payment therefor.\n Moody's Manual, describing the transaction with exactness, says first that the stock was increased from $3,000,000 to $6,000,000, 'a cash dividend of 100 per cent., payable May 1, 1917, being exchanged for one share of new stock, the equivalent of a 100 per cent. stock dividend.' But later in the report giving, as customary in the Manual the dividend record of the company, the Manual says: 'A stock dividend of 200 per cent. was paid February 14, 1914, and one of 100 per cent. on May 1, 1197.' And in reporting specifically the income account of the company for a series of years ending December 31, covering net profits, dividends paid and surplus for the year, it gives, as the aggregate of dividends for the year 1917, $ 660,000 (which was the aggregate paid on the quarterly cash dividend-5 per cent. January and April; 6 per cent. July and October), and adds in a note: 'In addition a stock dividend of 100 per cent. was paid during the year.' \n4\n The Wall Street Journal of \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 224]\n\u00a0\n May 2, 1917, p. 2, quotes the 1917 'high' price for Standard Oil of Kentucky as '375 ex stock dividend.'\n It thus appears that among financiers and investors the distribution of the stock, by whichever method effected, is called a stock dividend; that the two methods by which accumulated profits are legally retained for corporate purposes and at the same time distributed as dividends are recognized by them to be equivalents; and that the financial results to the corporation and to the stockholders of the two methods are substantially the same-unless a difference results from the application of the federal Income Tax Law.\n Mrs. Macomber, a citizen and resident of New York, was, in the year 1916, a stockholder in the Standard Oil Company (of California), a corporation organized under the laws of California and having its principal place of business in that state. During that year she received from the company a stock dividend representing profits earned since March 1, 1913. The dividend was paid by direct issue of the stock to her according to the simple method described above, pursued also by the Indiana and Nebraska companies. In 1917 she was taxed under the federal law on the stock dividend so received at its par value of $100 a share, as income received during the year 1916. Such a stock dividend is income, as distinguished from capital, both under the law of New York and under the law of California, because in both states every dividend representing profits is deemed to be income, whether paid in cash or in stock. It had been so held in New York, where the question arose as between life tenant and remainderman, Lowry v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 172 N. Y. 137, 64 N. E. 796; Matter of Osborne, 209 N. Y. 450, 103 N. E. 723, 823, 50 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 510, Ann.Cas. 1915A, 298; and also, where the question arose in matters of taxation, People v. Glynn, \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 225]\n\u00a0\n 130 App. Div. 332, 114 N. Y. Supp. 460; Id. 198 N. Y. 605, 92 N. E. 1097. It has been so held in California, where the question appears to have arisen only in controversies between life tenant and remainderman. Estate of Duffill, 183 Pac. 337.\n It is conceded that if the stock dividend paid to Mrs. Macomber had been made by the more complicated method pursued by the Standard Oil Company of Kentucky; that is, issuing rights to take new stock pro rata and paying to each stockholder simultaneously a dividend in cash sufficient in amount to enable him to pay for this pro rata of new stock to be purchased-the dividend so paid to him would have been taxable as income, whether he retained the cash or whether he returned it to the corporation in payment for his pro rata of new stock. But it is contended that, because the simple method was adopted of having the new stock issued direct to the stockholders as paid-up stock, the new stock is not to be deemed income, whether she retained it or converted it into cash by sale. If such a different result can flow merely from the difference in the method pursued, it must be because Congress is without power to tax as income of the stockholder either the stock received under the latter method or the proceeds of its sale; for Congress has, by the provisions in the Revenue Act of 1916, expressly declared its purpose to make stock dividends, by whichever method paid, taxable as income.\n The Sixteenth Amendment, proclaimed February 25, 1913, declares:\n'The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.'\n\n The Revenue Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463,  2a, 39 Stat. 756, 757, provided:\n'That the term 'dividends' as used in this title shall \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 226]\n\u00a0\n be held to mean any distribution made or ordered to be made by a corporation, ... out of its earnings or profits accrued since March first, nineteen hundred and thirteen, and payable to its shareholders, whether in cash or in stock of the corporation, ... which stock dividend shall be considered income, to the amount of its cash value.'\n\n Hitherto powers conferred upon Congress by the Constitution have been liberally construed, and have been held to extend to every means appropriate to attain the end sought. In determining the scope of the power the substance of the transaction, not its form has been regarded. Martin v. Hunter, 1 Wheat, 304, 326; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 407, 415; Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446; Craig v. Missouri, 4 Pet. 410, 433; Jarrolt v. Moberly, \n103 \nU.S. 580, 585\n, 587 S.; Legal Tender Case, \n110 \nU.S. 421, 444\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 122; Lithograph Co. v. Sarony, \n111 \nU.S. 53, 58\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 279; United States v. Realty Co., \n163 \nU.S. 427, 440\n, 441 S., 442, 16 Sup. Ct. 1120; South Carolina v. United States, \n199 \nU.S. 437, 448\n, 449 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 110, 4 Ann. Cas. 737. Is there anything in the phraseology of the Sixteenth Amendment or in the nature of corporate dividends which should lead to a departure from these rules of construction and compel this court to hold, that Congress is powerless to prevent a result so extraordinary as that here contended for by the stockholder?\n First. The term 'income,' when applied to the investment of the stockholder in a corporation, had, before the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, been commonly understood to mean the returns from time to time received by the stockholder from gains or earnings of the corporation. A dividend received by a stockholder from a corporation may be either in distribution of capital assets or in distribution of profits. Whether it is the one or the other is in no way affected by the medium in which it is paid, nor by the method or means through which the particular thing distributed as a dividend was procured. If the \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 227]\n\u00a0\n dividend is declared payable in cash, the money with which to pay it is ordinarily taken from surplus cash in the treasury. But (if there are profits legally available for distribution and the law under which the company was incorporated so permits) the company may raise the money by discounting negotiable paper; or by selling bonds, scrip or stock of another corporation then in the treasury; or by selling its own bonds, scrip or stock then in the treasury; or by selling its own bonds, scrip or stock issued expressly for that purpose. How the money shall be raised is wholly a matter of financial management. The manner in which it is raised in no way affects the question whether the dividend received by the stockholder is income or capital; nor can it conceivably affect the question whether it is taxable as income.\n Likewise whether a dividend declared payable from profits shall be paid in cash or in some other medium is also wholly a matter of financial management. If some other medium is decided upon, it is also wholly a question of financial management whether the distribution shall be, for instance, in bonds, scrip or stock of another corporation or in issues of its own. And if the dividend is paid in its own issues, why should there be a difference in result dependent upon whether the distribution was made from such securities then in the treasury or from others to be created and issued by the company expressly for that purpose? So far as the distribution may be made from its own issues of bonds, or preferred stock created expressly for the purpose, it clearly would make no difference in the decision of the question whether the dividend was a distribution of profits, that the securities had to be created expressly for the purpose of distribution. If a dividend paid in securities of that nature represents a distribution of profits Congress may, of course, tax it as income of the stockholder. Is the result different where the security distributed is common stock? \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 228]\n\u00a0\n Suppose that a corporation having power to buy and sell its own stock, purchases, in the interval between its regular dividend dates, with moneys derived from current profits, some of its own common stock as a temporary investment, intending at the time of purchase to sell it before the next dividend date and to use the proceeds in paying dividends, but later, deeming it inadvisable either to sell this stock or to raise by borrowing the money necessary to pay the regular dividend in cash, declares a dividend payable in this stock; can any one doubt that in such a case the dividend in common stock would be income of the stockholder and constitutionally taxable as such? See Green v. Bissell, 79 Conn. 547, 65 Atl. 1056, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1011, 118 Am. St. Rep. 156, 9 Ann. Cas. 287; Leland v. Hayden, 102 Mass. 542. And would it not likewise be income of the stockholder subject to taxation if the purpose of the company in buying the stock so distributed had been from the beginning to take it off the market and distribute it among the stockholders as a dividend, and the company actually did so? And proceeding a short step further: Suppose that a corporation decided to capitalize some of its accumulated profits by creating additional common stock and selling the same to raise working capital, but after the stock has been issued and certificates therefor are delivered to the bankers for sale, general financial conditions make it undesirable to market the stock and the company concludes that it is wiser to husband, for working capital, the cash which it had intended to use in paying stockholders a dividend, and, instead, to pay the dividend in the common stock which it had planned to sell; would not the stock so distributed be a distribution of profits-and hence, when received, be income of the stockholder and taxable as such? If this be conceded, why should it not be equally income of the stockholder, and taxable as such, if the common stock created by capitalizing profits, had been originally created for the express purpose of being distributed \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 229]\n\u00a0\n as a dividend to the stockholder who afterwards received it?\n Second. It has been said that a dividend payable in bonds or preferred stock created for the purpose of distributing profits may be income and taxable as such, but that the case is different where the distribution is in common stock created for that purpose. Various reasons are assigned for making this distinction. One is that the proportion of the stockholder's ownership to the aggregate number of the shares of the company is not changed by the distribution. But that is equally true where the dividend is paid in its bonds or in its preferred stock. Furthermore, neither maintenance nor change in the proportionate ownership of a stockholder in a corporation has any bearing upon the question here involved. Another reason assigned is that the value of the old stock held is reduced approximately by the value of the new stock received, so that the stockholder after receipt of the stock dividend has no more than he had before it was paid. That is equally true whether the dividend be paid in cash or in other property, for instance, bonds, scrip or preferred stock of the company. The payment from profits of a large cash dividend, and even a small one, customarily lowers the then market value of stock because the undivided property represented by each share has been correspondingly reduced. The argument which appears to be most strongly urged for the stockholders is, that when a stock dividend is made, no portion of the assets of the company is thereby segregated for the stockholder. But does the issue of new bonds or of preferred stock created for use as a dividend result in any segregation of assets for the stockholder? In each case he receives a piece of paper which entitles him to certain rights in the undivided property. Clearly segregation of assets in a physical sense is not an essential of income. The year's gains of a partner is taxable as income, although there, likewise, no \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 230]\n\u00a0\n segregation of his share in the gains from that of his partners is had.\n The objection that there has been no segregation is presented also in another form. It is argued that until there is a segregation, the stockholder cannot know whether he has really received gains; since the gains may be invested in plant or merchandise or other property and perhaps be later lost. But is not this equally true of the share of a partner in the year's profits of the firm or, indeed, of the profits of the individual who is engaged in business alone? And is it not true, also, when dividends are paid in cash? The gains of a business, whether conducted by an individual, by a firm or by a corporation, are ordinarily reinvested in large part. Many a cash dividend honestly declared as a distribution of profits, proves later to have been paid out of capital, because errors in forecast prevent correct ascertainment of values. Until a business adventure has been completely liquidated, it can never be determined with certainty whether there have been profits unless the returns at least exceeded the capital originally invested. Business men, dealing with the problem practically, fix necessarily periods and rules for determining whether there have been net profits-that is, income or gains. They protect themselves from being seriously misled by adopting a system of depreciation charges and reserves. Then, they act upon their own determination, whether profits have been made. Congress in legislating has wisely adopted their practices as its own rules of action.\n Third. The Government urges that it would have been within the power of Congress to have taxed as income of the stockholder his pro rata share of undistributed profits earned, even if no stock dividend representing it had been paid. Strong reasons may be assigned for such a view. See The Collector v. Hubbard, 12 Wall. 1. The undivided share of a partner in the year's undistributed profits of his firm \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 231]\n\u00a0\n is taxable as income of the partner, although the share in the gain is not evidenced by any action taken by the firm. Why may not the stockholder's interest in the gains of the company? The law finds no difficulty in disregarding the corporate fiction whenever that is deemed necessary to attain a just result. Linn Timber Co. v. United States, \n236 U.S. 574\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 440. See Morawetz on Corporations (2d Ed.)  227- 231; Cook on Corporations (7th Ed.)  663, 664. The stockholder's interest in the property of the corporation differs, not fundamentally but in form only, from the interest of a partner in the property of the firm. There is much authority for the proposition that, under our law, a partnership or joint stock company is just as distinct and palpable an entity in the idea of the law, as distinguished from the individuals composing it, as is a corporations. \n5\n No reason appears, why Congress, in legislating under a grant of power so comprehensive as that authorizing the levy of an income tax, should be limited by the particular view of the relation of the stockholder to the corporation and its property which may, in the absence of legislation, have been taken by this court. But we have no occasion to decide the question whether Congress might have taxed to the stockholder his undivided share of the corporation's earnings. For Congress has in this act limited the income tax to that share of the stockholder in the earnings which is, in effect, distributed by means of the stock dividend paid. In other words to render the stockholder taxable there must be both earnings made and a dividend paid. Neither earnings without dividend-nor a dividend without earnings-subjects the \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 232]\n\u00a0\n stockholder to taxation under the Revenue Act of 1916.\n Fourth. The equivalency of all dividends representing profits, whether paid of all dividends in stock, is so complete that serious question of the taxability of stock dividends would probably never have been made, if Congress had undertaken to tax only those dividends which represented profits earned during the year in which the dividend was paid or in the year preceding. But this court, construing liberally, not only the constitutional grant of power, but also the revenue act of 1913, held that Congress might tax, and had taxed, to the stockholder dividends received during the year, although earned by the company long before; and even prior to the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment. Lynch v. Hornby, \n247 U.S. 339\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 543.6 That rule, if indiscriminatingly applied to all stock dividends representing profits earned, might, in view of corporate practice, have worked considerable hardship, and have raised serious questions. Many corporations, without legally capitalizing any part of their profits, had assigned definitely some part or all of the annual balances remaining after paying the usual cash dividends, to the uses to which permanent capital is ordinarily applied. Some of the corporations doing this, transferred such balances on their books to 'surplus' account-distinguishing between such permanent 'surplus' and the 'undivided profits' account. Other corporations, without this formality, had assumed that the annual accumulating balances carried as undistributed profits were to be treated as capital permanently invested in the business. And still others, without definite assumption of any kind, had \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 233]\n\u00a0\n so used undivided profits for capital purposes. To have made the revenue law apply retroactively so as to reach such accumulated profits, if and whenever it should be deemed desirable to capitalize them legally by the issue of additional stock distributed as a dividend to stockholders, would have worked great injustice. Congress endeavored in the Revenue Act of 1916 to guard against any serious hardship which might otherwise have arisen from making taxable stock dividends representing accumulated profits. It did not limit the taxability to stock dividends representing profits earned within the tax year or in the year preceding; but it did limit taxability to such dividends representing profits earned since March 1, 1913. Thereby stockholders were given notice that their share also in undistributed profits accumulating thereafter was at some time to be taxed as income. And Congress sought by section 3 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336c) to discourage the postponement of distribution for the illegitimate purpose of evading liability to surtaxes.\n Fifth. The decision of this court, that earnings made before the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment, but paid out in cash dividend after its adoption, were taxable as income of the stockholder, involved a very liberal construction of the amendment. To hold now that earnings both made and paid out after the adoption of the Sixteenth Amendment cannot be taxed as income of the stockholder, if paid in the form of a stock dividend, involves an exceedingly narrow construction of it. As said by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, 446 (6 L. Ed. 678):\n'To construe the power so as to impair its efficacy, would tend to defeat an object, in the attainment of which the American public took, and justly took, that strong interest which arose from a full conviction of its necessity.'\n\n No decision heretofore rendered by this court requires us to hold that Congress, in providing for the taxation of \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 234]\n\u00a0\n stock dividends, exceeded the power conferred upon it by the Sixteenth Amendment. The two cases mainly relied upon to show that this was beyond the power of Congress are Towne v. Eisner, \n245 U.S. 418\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 158 L. R. A. 1918D, 254, which involved a question not of constitutional power but of statutory construction, and Gibbons v. Mahon, \n136 U.S. 549\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 1057, which involved a question arising between life tenant and remainderman. So far as concerns Towne v. Eisner we have only to bear in mind what was there said (\n245 U.S. 425\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 159, L. R. A. 1918D, 254): 'But it is not necessarily true that income means the same thing in the Constitution and the [an] act.' \n7\n Gibbons v. Mahon is even less an authority for a narrow construction of the power to tax incomes conferred by the Sixteenth Amendment. In that case the court was required to determine how, in the administration of an estate in the District of Columbia, a stock dividend, representing profits, received after the decedent's death, should be disposed of as between life tenant and remainderman. The question was in essence: What shall the intention of the testator be presumed to have been? On this question there was great diversity of opinion and practice in the courts of English-speaking countries. Three well-defined rules were then competing for acceptance; two of these involves an arbitrary rule of distribution, the third equitable apportionment. See Cook on Corporations ( 7th Ed.)  552-558.\n\n 1. \nThe so-called English rule, declared in 1799, by Brander v. Brander, 4 Ves. Jr. 800, that a dividend representing \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 235]\n\u00a0\n profits, whether in cash, stock or other property, belongs to the life tenant if it was a regular or ordinary dividend, and belongs to the remainderman if it was an extraordinary dividend.\n\n 2. \nThe so-called Massachusetts rule, declared in 1868 by Minot v. Paine, 99 Mass. 101, 96 Am. Dec. 705, that a dividend representing profits, whether regular, ordinary or extrordinary, if in cash belongs to the life tenant, and if in stock belongs to the remainderman.\n\n 3. \nThe so-called Pennsylvania rule declared in 1857 by Earp's Appeal, 28 Pa. 368, that where a stock dividend is paid, the court shall inquire into the circumstances under which the fund had been earned and accumulated out of which the dividend, whether a regular, an ordinary or an extraordinary one, was paid. If it finds that the stock dividend was paid out of profits earned since the decedent's death, the stock dividend belongs to the life tenant; if the court finds that the stock dividend was paid from capital or from profits earned before the decedent's death, the stock dividend belongs to the remainderman.\n This court adopted in Gibbons v. Mahon as the rule of administration for the District of Columbia the so-called Massachusetts rule, the opinion being delivered in 1890 by Mr. Justice Gray. Since then the same question has come up for decision in many of the states. The so-called Massachusetts rule, although approved by this court, has found favor in only a few states. The so-called Pennsylvania rule, on the other hand, has been adopted since by so many of the states (including New York and California), that it has come to be known as the 'American rule.' Whether, in view of these facts and the practical results of the operation of the two rules as shown by the experience of the 30 years which have elapsed since the decision in Gibbons v. Mahon, it might be desirable for this court to reconsider the question there decided, as \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 236]\n\u00a0\n some other courts have done (see 29 Harvard Law Review, 551), we have no occasion to consider in this case. For, as this court there pointed out ( \n136 U.S. 560\n, 1059 [34 L. Ed. 525]), the question involved was one 'between the owners of successive interests in particular shares,' and not, as in Bailey v. Railroad Co., 22 Wall. 604, a question 'between the corporation and the government, and [which] depended upon the terms of a statute carefully framed to prevent corporations from evading payment of the tax upon their earnings.'\n We have, however, not merely argument; we have examples which should convince us that 'there is no inherent, necessary and immutable reason why stock dividends should always be treated as capital.' Tax Commissioner v. Putnam, 227 Mass. 522, 533, 116 N. E. 904, L. R. A. 1917F. 806. The Supreme Judical Court of Massachusetts has steadfastly adhered, despite ever-renewed protest, to the rule that every stock dividend is, as between life tenant and remainderman, capital and not income. But in construing the Massachusetts Income Tax Amendment, which is substantially identical with the federal amendment, that court held that the Legislature was thereby empowered to levy an income tax upon stock dividends representing profits. The courts of England have, with some relaxation, adhered to their rule that every extraordinary dividend is, as between life tenant and remainderman, to be deemed capital. But in 1913 the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council held that a stock dividend representing accumulated profits was taxable like an ordinary cash dividend, Swan Brewery Company, Limited v. The King, L. R. 1914 A. C. 231. In dismissing the appeal these words of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia were quoted (page 236) which show that the facts involved were identical with those in the case at bar:\n'Had the company distributed the 101,450 among the shareholders and had the shareholders repaid such sums to the company as the price of the 81,160 new SHARES, THE DUTY ON THE 101,450 \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 237]\n\u00a0\n WOULD CLEARLY HAVE BEEN PAYable. is not this virtually the effect of what was actually done? I think it is.'\n\n Sixth. If stock dividends representing profits are held exempt from taxation under the Sixteenth Amendment, the owners of the most successful businesses in America will, as the facts in this case illustrate, be able to escape taxation on a large part of what is actually their income. So far as their profits are represented by stock received as dividends they will pay these taxes not upon their income but only upon the income of their income. That such a result was intended by the people of the United States when adopting the Sixteenth Amendment is inconceivable. Our sole duty is to ascertain their intent as therein expressed. \n8\n In terse, comprehensive language befitting the Constitution, they empowered Congress 'to lay and collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived.' They intended to include thereby everything which by reasonable understanding can fairly be regarded as income. That stock dividends representing profits are so regarded, not only by the plain people, but by investors and financiers, and by most of the courts of the country, is shown, beyond peradventure, by their acts and by their utterances. It seems to me clear, therefore, that Congress possesses the power which it exercised to make dividends representing profits, taxable as income, whether the medium in which the dividend is paid be cash or stock, and that it may define, as it has done, what dividends representing \n\n[252 U.S. 189, 238]\n\u00a0\n profits shall be deemed income. It surely is not clear that the enactment exceeds the power granted by the Sixteenth Amendment. And, as this court has so often said, the high prerogative of declaring an act of Congress invalid, should never be exercised except in a clear case. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n'It is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body, by which any law is passed, to presume in favor of its validity, until its violation of the Constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.' Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 269.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Title I.-Income Tax.\n Part I.-On Individuals.\n Sec. 2.

Ryan and Adelbert Moot, both of Buffalo, N. Y., for petitioner.\n\n\n[253 U.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hamilton Ward, of Buffalo, N. Y. (Mr. Irving W. Cole, of Buffalo, N. Y., of counsel), for respondent.\n\n\n[253 U.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action for damages under the federal Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665) brought in the District Court for the Western District of New York.\n The following are the allegations of the complaint stated narratively:\n December 25, 1915, and prior thereto, defendant was an operator of a steam railroad and engaged in interstate commerce. On and prior to that date plaintiff as an employe of defendant operated a signaling tower and water tank in the town of Burns, N. Y., the tower being used for the operation of trains in interstate and intrastate commerce. The tank was used for supplying the locomotives of the trains with water, which was pumped from a closeby well into the tank by a gasoline engine which plaintiff ran.\n In the nighttime of December 25, 1915, while plaintiff was engaged in starting the engine the gasoline suddenly exploded burning him and seriously and painfully and permanently injurying him, causing him immediate and permanent suffering and the expenditure of large sums of money, by all of which he was damaged in the sum of $25,000.\n The engine was defective, which was the cause of the explosion, plaintiff being guilty of no negligence.\n Judgment was prayed in the sum of $25,000.\n Defendant by demurrer attacked the sufficiency of the complaint and the jurisdiction of the court.\n The court (Judge Hazel) overruled the demurrer but in doing so expressed the conflicting considerations which swayed for and against its strength but finally held the complaint sufficient, 'and that plaintiff was engaged in interstate commerce or that his work was so closely connected therewith as to be a part of it.' To this conclusion \n\n[253 U.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n the court seemed to have been determined by Pedersen v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., \n229 U.S. 146\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153.\n Defendant answered putting at issue the allegations of the complaint, and set up as separate defenses assumption of risk and contributory negligence.\n A trial was had to a jury, during the course of which it was stipulated that at the time of plaintiff's injury and prior thereto 'trains carrying interstate commerce ran daily' and at such times 'water from the water tank was supplied daily in part to defendant's engines engaged in interstate commerce and in part to engines hauling intrastate freight.'\n Motions for nonsuit and for a directed verdict were successively made and overruled.\n The jury returned a verdict for plaintiff in the sum of $15,000 upon which judgment was entered against motion for arrest and new trial.\n Error was then prosecuted to the Court of Appeals, which court affirmed the judgment, and to review its action this certiorari was granted.\n The evidence presents very few matters of controversy. It establishes the employment of plaintiff by defendant, and its character, and presents the question whether it was in interstate commerce or intrastate commerce, in both of which, it is stipulated, defendant was engaged. And on this question the courts below decided the employment was in interstate commerce though exhibiting some struggle with opposing considerations.\n They seemed to have been constrained to that conclusion by the same cases, and a review of them, h erefore, is immediately indicated to see whether in their discord or harmony, whichever exists, a solution can be found for the present controversy.\n They all dealt with considerations dependent upon the \n\n[253 U.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n distinctions of fact and law between interstate and intrastate commerce. A distinction, it may at once be said, is plain enough so far as the essential characteristics of the commerces are concerned, but how far instruments or personal actions are connected with either and can be assigned to either, becomes in cases a matter of difficulty, and ground, it may be, of divergent judgments. With this in mind we review the cases.\n But first as to the facts in this. Defendant is an interstate railroad and upon its line running from other states to New York it operated in New York a signal tower and switches to attend which plaintiff was employed. It also had near the tower a pumping station, consisting of water tank, and a gasoline engine for pumping purposes through which instrumentalities water was supplied to its engines in whichever commerce engaged. While in attendance at the pumping station plaintiff was injured. And such is the case, that is, while in attendance at the pumping station, it being his duty to so attend, was he injured in interstate commerce?\n It can hardly be contended that while plaintiff was engaged in the signal tower he was not engaged in interstate commerce, though he may have on occasion signaled the approach or departure of intrastate trains, But it is contended that when he descended from the tower and went to the pumping station he put off an interstate character and took on one of intrastate quality or, it may be, was divested of both and sank into undesignated employment. A rather abrupt transition it would seem at first blush, and, if of determining influence, would subject the Employers' Liability Act to rapid changes of application, plaintiff being within it at one point of time and without it at another-- within it when on the signal tower, but without it when in the pump house, though in both places being concerned with trains engaged in interstate commerce. \n\n[253 U.S. 77, 83]\n\u00a0\n But let us go from speculation to the cases. Pedersen v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., \n229 U.S. 146\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153, D., L. & W. R. R. Co. v. Yurkonis, \n238 U.S. 439\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 902, Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Harrington, \n241 U.S. 177\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 517, Shanks v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., \n239 U.S. 556\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797, and Roush v. B. & O. R. R. Co. (D. C.) 243 Fed. 712, were considered by the Court of Appeals. Some state cases were also referred to.\n In Pedersen v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co. it was held that one carrying bolts to be used in repairing an interstate railroad, and who was injured by an interstate train, was entitled to invoke the Employers' Liability Act. In other words, that one employed upon an instrumentality of interstate commerce was employed in interstate commerce. And it was said, citing cases:\n'The true test always is: Is the work in question a part of the interstate commerce in which the carrier is engaged.'\n\n In the Yurkonis Case the injury complained of happened to Yurkonis on a mine or colliery of the railroad by the explosion of gases when Yurkonis was engaged in and about the performance of his duties. It was held that an injury so received, though the coal was destined for use in interstate commerce, was not one occurring in such commerce.\n In Roush v. B. & O. R. R. Co. (D. C.) 243 Fed. 712, the decision was that one employed in operating a pumping station which furnished water to interstate and intrastate roads was engaged in work incidental to interstate commerce, the court deducing that conclusion from cases from which it liberally quoted.\n C., B. & Q. R. Co. v. Harrington, \n241 U.S. 177\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 517, the Court of Appeals considered as substantially the same in incident and principle with the Yurkonis Case,s upra. The case concerned an injury \n\n[253 U.S. 77, 84]\n\u00a0\n while handling coal. It was a step or steps nearer the instrumentality of use. It was being removed when the injury complained of occurred from storage tracks to chutes. The employment was considered too distant from interstate commerce to be a part of it or to have 'close or direct relation to interstate transportation.' The Yurkonis Case was cited and applied.\n Shanks v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., \n239 U.S. 556\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797, was considered of like character. The employment asserted to have been in interstate commerce was the taking down and putting up fixtures in a machine shop for repairing interstate locomotives.\n Before summarizing these cases we may add Minneapolis & St. Louis R. R. Co. v. Winters, \n242 U.S. 353\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 170, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 54, and Southern Ry. Co. v. Puckett, \n244 U.S. 571\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 703, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 69. In the Winters Case the work was repairing an engine. The engine, it was said, had no definite destination. 'It simply had finished some interstate business and had not as yet begun upon any other.' As to such instrumentalities the determining principle was said to be that their character depends upon their 'employment at the time, not upon remote probabilities or accidental later events.'\n In the Puckett Case an employe (car inspector) going to the relief of another employe stumbled over some large clinkers in his path while carrying a jack for raising a derailed car. It was decided that he was engaged in interstate commerce, the purpose being to open the way for interstate transportation.\n These, then, being the cases, what do they afford in the solution of the case at bar? As we have said regarding the essential character of the two commerces, the differences between them is easily recognized and expressed, but, as we have also said, whether at a given time particular instrumentalities or employment may be assigned to one or the other may not be easy, and of this the cases are illustrative. What is their determining principle? \n\n[253 U.S. 77, 85]\n\u00a0\n In the Pedersen Case it was said that the questions which naturally arise: 'Was that work being done independently of the interstate commerce in which the defendant was engaged, or was it so closely connected therewith as to be a part of it?' Or as said in Shanks v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., supra, was the 'work so closely related to it [interstate commerce] as to be practically a part of it?' The answer must be in the affirmative. Plaintiff was assigned to duty in the signal tower and in the pump house and it was discharged in both on interstate commerce as well as on intrastate commerce, and there was no interval between the commerces that separated the duty, and it comes therefore within the indicated test. It may be said however, that this case is concerned exclusively with what was to be done, and was done, at the pump house. This may be true but his duty there was performed and the instruments and facilities of it were kept in readiness for use and were used on both commerces as were demanded, and the test of the cases satisfied.\n There is only one other assertion of error that demands notice. The others (regarding assumption of risk and contributory negligence) counsel neither argue nor submit; their abandonment, therefore, may be assumed.\n It is asserted against the verdict that it is 'outrageously excessive,' caused by the instruction of the court that plaintiff could recover 'for shame and humiliation.' Counsel's argument is not easy to represent or estimate. They say that 'mental pain' of the designated character, 'the suffering from feelings, is intangible, incapable of test or trial,' might vary in individuals, 'rests entirely in the belief of the sufferer, and is not susceptible of contradiction or rebuttal.' If all that be granted, it was for the consideration of the jury. It certainly cannot be pronounced a proposition of law that personal mutilation or i sfiguration may be a mater of indifference to any body \n\n[253 U.S. 77, 86]\n\u00a0\n or that sensitiveness to it may vary with 'temperaments' and be incapable of measurement.\n We see no error in the instruction.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice PITNEY dissent. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nERIE R.

St.  8657-8665), for the loss of a leg in the railroad company's service. The verdict and judgment were for $20,000. The contest in the case is whether the injury was received in interstate or intrastate service.\n The judges below concurred in the judgment but disagreed upon the grounds of it. Judges Hand and Hough concurred on the authority of the Collins Case, 259 Fed. 172, 170 C. C. A. 240, though Judge Hand did not sit in it, and Judge Hough dissented from its judgment.\n As we have just affirmed that case, if it is not distinguishable from the case at bar, the latter must also be affirmed. A distinction is not asserted, but both cases are attacked. In our opinion in the Collins Case we have reviewed most of the cases upon which the company relies in this, and whether their principle applies depends upon the facts. We collect them from the testimony and represent them as the jury had a right to consider them, omitting conflicts. \n\n[253 U.S. 86, 89]\n\u00a0\n Sand is necessary to an engine and must be used dry. Szary and two others were employed in its preparation, which was done in what is called the 'sand house,' a small structure standing in the yards of the company alongside of the tracks. The drying was done in four large stoves which it was the duty of Szary and his associates to attend. Soft coal was the heating means and the resulting ashes were dumped in an ash pit, to do which a track had to be crossed.\n On the night of the accident, January 5, 1917, Szary began his duties at 6 o'clock, and sanded about seven engines whose destinations were other states. He sanded the last engine at 9 o'clock, and after doing so, he removed the ashes from the stove and carried them to the ash pit in a pail according to his custom, in doing which he was compelled to cross one of the tracks. He emptied the pail and left it on the ground while he went to the engine room to get a drink of water, and when returning for the pail and crossing the track he was hit by an engine. He had looked and saw no engine and heard no signal. He described the night as 'very dark and very foggy and rainy and misty,' and testified that he could not see anything, the steam and smoke from the engines in all parts of the yard being so thick that he could see nothing.\n The engine that hit him was running backwards and without a light. He was picked up and carried to a hospital and his left leg was amputated the same night from two to three inches below the knee.\n We think these facts bring the case within the Collins Case and the test there deduced from prior decisions. There were attempts there, and there are attempts here, to separate the duty and assign its character by intervals of time, and distinctions between the acts of service. Indeed something is attempted to be made of an omission, or an asserted omission, in the evidence, of the kind of commerce in which the last engine served was engaged. \n\n[253 U.S. 86, 90]\n\u00a0\n The distinctions are too artificial for acceptance. The acts of service were too intimately related and too necessary for the final purpose to be distinguished in legal character.\n The conclusion that the service of Szary was rendered in interstate commerce determines the correctness of the ruling of the District Court upon the motion to dismiss made at the close of plaintiff's evidence, and afterwards for particular instructions and the objections to the charge by the court. All of the rulings were based on the character of the commerce, the court adjudging it to be interstate.\n It hence follows that the judgment must be and it is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice PITNEY dissent. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEVANS v. GORE(1920)\nNo. 654\nArgued: March 5, 1920Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 245, 246]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. William Marshall Bullitt and Edmund F. Trabue, both of Louisville, Ky., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action to recover money paid under protest as a tax alleged to be forbidden by the Constitution.\n The plaintiff is the United States District Judge for the Western District of Kentucky, and holds that office under an appointment by the President made in 1899 with the advice and consent of the Senate. The tax which he calls in question was levied under the act of February 24, 1919, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1062, on his net income for the year 1918, as computd under that act. His compensation or salary as District Judge was included in the computation. Had it been excluded he would not have called on to pay any income tax for that year. The inclusion was in obedience to a provision in section 213 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8ff), requiring the computation to embrace all gains, profits, income and the like, 'including in the case of the President of the United States, the judges of the Supreme and inferior courts of the United States [and others ] ... the compensation received as such.' Whether he could be subjected to such a tax in \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 247]\n\u00a0\n respect of his salary, consistently with the Constitution, is the matter in issue. If it be resolved against the tax he will be entitled to recover what he paid; otherwise his action must fail. It did fail in the District Court. 262 Fed. 550.\n The Constitution establishes three great co-ordinate departments of the national government-the legislative, the executive, and the judicial- and distributes among them the powers confided to that government by the people. Each department is dealt with in a separate article, the legislative in the first, the executive in the second and the judicial in the third. Our present concern is chiefly with the third article. It defines the judicial power, vests it in one Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish, and declares:\n'The judges, both of the Supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.'\n\n The plaintiff insists that the provision in section 213 which subjects him to a tax in respect of his compensation as a judge by its necessary operation and effect diminishes that compensation and therefore is repugnant to the constitutional limitation just quoted.\n Stated in its broadest aspect, the contention involves the power to tax the compensation of federal judges in general, and also the salary of the President, as to which the Constitution (article 2,  1, cl. 6) contains a similar limitation. Because of the individual relation of the members of this court to the question, thus broadly stated, we cannot but regret that its solution falls to us; and this although each member has been paying the tax in respect of his salary voluntarily and in regular course. But jurisdiction of the present case cannot be declined or renounced. The plaintiff was entitled by law to invoke our \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 248]\n\u00a0\n decision on the question as respects his own compensation, in which no other judge can have any direct personal interest; and there was no other appellate tribunal to which under the law he could go. He brought the case here in due course, the government joined him in asking an early determination of the question involved, and both have been heard at the bar and through printed briefs. In this situation, the only course open to us is to consider and decide the cause-a conclusion supported by precedents reaching back many years. Moreover, it appears that, when this taxing provision was adopted, Congress regarded it as of uncertain constitutionality and both contemplated and intended that the question should be settled by us in a case like this. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n With what purpose does the Constitution provide that the compensation of the judges 'shall not be diminished during their continuance in office?' Is it primarily to benefit the judges, or rather to promote the public weal by giving them that independence which makes for an impartial and courageous discharge of the judicial function? Does the provision merely forbid direct diminution, such \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 249]\n\u00a0\n as expressly reducing the compensation from a greater to a less sum per year, and thereby leave the way open for indirect, yet effective, diminution, such as withholding or calling back a part as a tax on the whole? Or, does it mean that the judge shall have a sure and continuing right to the compensation, whereon he confidently may rely for his support during his continuance in office, so that he need have no apprehension lest his situation in this regard may be changed to his disadvantage?\n The Constitution was framed on the fundamental theory that a larger measure of liberty and justice would be assured by vesting the three great powers, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial, in separate departments, each relatively independent of the others; and it was recognized that without this independence-if it was not made both real and enduring-the separation would fail of its purpose. All agreed that restraints and checks must be imposed to secure the requisite measure of independence; for otherwise the legislative department, inherently the strongest, might encroach on or even come to dominate the others, and the judicial, naturally the weakest, might be dwarfed or swayed by the other two, especially by the legislative.\n The particular need for making the judiciary independent was elaborately pointed out by Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist, No. 78, from which we excerpt the following:\n'The executive not only dispenses the honors, but holds the sword of the community. The Legislature not only commands the purse, but prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated. The judiciary, on the contrary, has no influence over either the sword or the purse; no direction either of the strength or of the wealth of the society; and can take no active resolution whatever. It may truly be said to have neither force nor will, but merely judgment. ... This simple view of \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 250]\n\u00a0\n the matter suggests several important consequences. It proves incontestably that the judiciary is beyond comparison the weakest of the three departments of power; that it can never attack with success either of the other two; and that all possible care is requisite to enable it to defend itself against their attacks.'\n\n'The complete independence of the courts of justice is peculiarly essential in a limited Constitution. By a limited Constitution I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority; such, for instance, as that it shall pass no bills of attainder, no ex post facto laws, and the like. Limitations of this kind can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice, whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void. Without this, all the reservations of particular rights or privileges would amount to nothing.'\n\n At a later period John Marshall, whose rich experience as lawyer, legislator, and Chief Justice enabled him to speak as no one else could, tersely said (Debates Va. Conv. 1829-1831, pp. 616, 619):\n'Advert, sir, to the duties of a judge. He has to pass between the government and the man whom that government is prosecuting; between the most powerful ini vidual in the community, and the poorest and most unpopular. It is of the last importance, that in the exercise of these duties he should observe the utmost fairness. Need I press the necessity of this? Does not every man feel that his own personal security and the security of his property depends on that fairness? The judicial department comes home in its effects to every man's fireside: it passes on his property, his reputation, his life, his all. Is it not to the last degree important that he should be rendered perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or control him but God and his conscience? ... I have always thought, from my earliest youth till now, that the \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 251]\n\u00a0\n greatest scourge an angry Heaven ever inflicted upon an ungrateful and a sinning people was an ignorant, a corrupt, or a dependent judiciary.'\n\n More recently the need for this independence was illustrated by Mr. Wilson, now the President, in the following admirable statement:\n'It is also necessary that there should be a judiciary endowed with substantial and independent powers and secure against all corrupting or perverting influences; secure, also, against the arbitrary authority of the administrative heads of the government.\n\n'Indeed there is a sense in which it may be said that the whole efficacy and reality of constitutional government resides in its courts. Our definition of liberty is that it is the best practicable adjustment between the powers of the government and the privileges of the individual.'\n\n'Our courts are the balance wheel of our whole constitutional system; and ours is the only constitutional system so balanced and controlled. Other constitutional systems lack complete poise and certainty of operation because they lack the support and interpretation of authoritative, undisputable courts of law. It is clear beyond all need of exposition that for the definite maintenance of constitutional understandings it is indispensable, alike for the preservation of the liberty of the individual and for the preservation of the integrity of the powers of the government, that there should be some nonpolitical forum in which those understandings can be impartially debated and determined. That forum our courts supply. There the individual may assert his rights; there the government must accept definition of its authority. There the individual may challenge the legality of governmental action and have it adjudged by the test of fundamental principles, and that test the government must abide; there the government can check the too aggressive self-assertion of the individual and establish its power upon lines which all \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 252]\n\u00a0\n can comprehend and heed. The constitutional powers of the courts constitute the ultimate safeguard alike of individual privilege and of governmental prerogative. It is in this sense that our judiciary is the balance wheel of our entire system; it is meant to maintain that nice adjustment between individual rights and governmental powers which constitutes political liberty.'\n\n Constitutional Government in the United States, pp. 17, 142.\n Conscious of the nature and scope of the power being vested in the national courts, recognizing that they would be charged with responsibilites more delicate and important than any ever before confided to judicial tribunals, and appreciating that they were to be, in the words of George Washington,2 'the keystone of our political fabric,' the convention with unusual accord incorporated in the Constitution the provision that the judges 'shall hold their offices during good behavior and shall at stated times receive for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.' Can there be any doubt that the two things thus coupled in place-the clause in respect of tenure during good behavior and that in respect of an undiminishable compensation-were equally coupled in purpose? And is it not plain that their purpose was to invest the judges with an independence in keeping with the delicacy an importance of their task and with the imperative need for its impartial and fearless performance? Mr. Hamilton said in explanation and support of the provision (Federalist, No. 79):\n'Next to permanency in office, nothing can contribute more to the independence of the judges than a fixed provision for their support . ... In the general course of human nature, a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will. ... The enlightened friends of good government in every state have seen cause to lament the want of precise and explicit precautions in \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 253]\n\u00a0\n the state constitutions on this head. Some of these indeed have declared that permanent salaries should be established for the judges; but the experiment has in some instances shown that such expressions are not sufficiently definite to preclude legislative evasions. Something still more positive and unequivocal has been evinced to be requisite. ... This provision for the support of the judges bears every mark of prudence and efficacy; and it may be safely affirmed that, together with the permanent tenure of their offices, it affords a better prospect of their independence than is discoverable in the Constitutions of any of the states in regard to their own judges.'\n\n The several commentators on the Constitution have adopted and reiterated this view,3 Judge Story adding:\n'Without this provision [as to an undiminishable compensation], the other, as to the tenure of office, would have been utterly nugatory, and indeed a mere mockery'\n\n and Chancellor Kent observing:\n'It tends, also, to secure a succession of learned men on the bench, who, in consequence of a certain undiminished support, are enabled and induced to quit the lucrative pursuits of private business for the duties of that important station.'\n\n These considerations make it very plain, as we think, that the primary purpose of the prohibition against diminution was not to benefit the judges, but, like the clause in respect of tenure, to attract good and competent men to the bench and to promote that independence of action and judgment which is essential to the maintenance of the guaranties, limitations, and pervading principles of the Constitution and to the administration of justice without respect to persons and with equal concern for the poor and the rich. Such being its purpose, it is to be construed, not as a private grant, but as a limitation imposed in the public interest; in other words, not restrictively, but in \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 254]\n\u00a0\n accord with its spirit and the principle on which it proceeds.\n Obviously, diminution may be effected in more ways than one. Some may be direct and others indirect, or even evasive as Mr. Hamilton suggested. But all which by their necessary operation and effect withhold or take from the judge a part of that which has been promised by law for his services must be regarded as within the prohibition. Nothing short of this will give full effect to its spirit and principle. Here the plaintiff was paid the full compensation, but was subjected to an involuntary obligation to pay back a part, and the obligation was promptly enforced. Of what avail to him was the part which was paid with one hand and then taken back with the other? Was he not placed in practically the same situation as if it had been withheld in the first instance? Only by subordinating substance to mere form could it be held that his compensation was not diminished. Of course, the conclusion that it was diminished is the natural one. This is illustrated in Dobbins v. Commissioners of Erie County, 16 Pet. 435, 450, which involved a tax charged under a law of Pennsylvania against a revenue officer of the United States who was a citizen and resident of that state. The tax was adjusted or proportioned to his compensation, and the state court susa ined it. Erie County Com'rs v. Dobbins, 7 Watts (Pa.) 513. In reversing that decision, this court, after showing that the compensation had been fixed by a law of Congress said:\n'Does not a tax, then, by a state upon the office, diminisning the recompense, conflict with the law of the United States, which secures it to the officer in its entireness? It certainly has such an effect; and any law of a state imposing such a tax cannot be constitutional.'\n\n But it is urged that what the plaintiff was made to pay back was an income tax, and that a like tax was exacted or others engaged in private employment.\n If the tax in respect of his compensation be prohibited, \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 255]\n\u00a0\n it can find no justification in the taxation of other income as to which there is no prohibition; for, of course, doing what the Constitution permits gives no license to do what it prohibits.\n The prohibition is general, contains no excepting words, and appears to be directed against all diminution, whether for one purpose or another; and the reasons for its adoption, as publicly assigned at the time and commonly accepted ever since, make with impelling force for the conclusion that the fathers of the Constitution intended to prohibit diminution by taxation as well as otherwise-that they regarded the independence of the judges as of far greater importance than any revenue that could come from taxing their salaries.\n True, the taxing power is comprehensive and acknowledges few exceptions. But that there are exceptions, besides the one we here recognize and sustain, is well settled. In Collector v. Day, 11 Wall. 113, it was held that Congress could not impose an income tax in respect of the salary of a judge of a state court; in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 \nU.S. 429, 585\n, 601 S., 652, 653, 15 Sup. Ct. 673, it was held-the full court agreeing on this point-that Congress was without power to impose such a tax in respect of interest received from bonds issued by a state or any of its counties or municipalities; and in United States v. Railroad Co., 17 Wall. 322, there was a like holding as to municipal revenues derived by the city of Baltimore from its ownership of stock in a railroad company. None of those decisions was put on any express prohibition in the Constitution, for there is none; but all recognize and gave effect to a prohibition implied from the independence of the states within their own spheres.\n When we consider, as was done in those cases, what is comprehended in the congressional power to tax-where its exertion is not directly or impliedly interdicted-it becomes additionally manifest that the prohibition now \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 256]\n\u00a0\n under discussion was intended to embrace and prevent diminution through the exertion of that power; for, as this court repeatedly has held, the power to tax carries with it 'the power to embarrass and destroy'; may be applied to every object within its range 'in such measure as Congress may determine'; enables that body 'to select one calling and omit another, to tax one class of property and to forbear to tax another'; and may be applied in different ways to different objects so long as there is 'geographical uniformity' in the duties, imposts and excises imposed. McCulloch v. Marland, 4 Wheat. 316, 431; Pacific Insurance Co. v. Soule, 7 Wall. 433, 443; Austin v. The Aldermen, 7 Wall. 694, 699; Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 541, 548; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 92\n, 106 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 747; Treat v. White, \n181 \nU.S. 264, 268\n, 269 S., 21 Sup. Ct. 611; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 61\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561; Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 158\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 342, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 1312; Billings v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 261, 282\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 421; Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 U.S. 1\n, 24-26, 36 Sup. Ct. 236, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 71, L. R. A. 1917D, 414. Is it not therefore morally certain that the discerning statesmen who framed the Constitution and were so sedulously bent on securing the independence of the judiciary intended to protect the compensation of the judges from assault and diminution in the name or form of a tax? Could not the purpose of the prohibition be wholly thwarted if this avenue of attack were left open? Certainly there is nothing in the words of the prohibition indicating that it is directed against one legislative power and not another; and in our opinion due regard for its spirit and principle requires that it be taken as directed against them all.\n This view finds support in rulings in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and North Carolina, made under like constitutional restrictions, Commonwealth ex rel. v. Mann. 5 Watts & S. (Pa.) 403, 415, et seq.;4 New Orleans v. Lea, 14 \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 257]\n\u00a0\n La. Ann. 197; 48 N. C. Appendix; N. C. Public Documents 1899, Doc.

E. 534; and has strong sanction in the actual practice of the government, to which we now advert.\n No attempt was made to tax the compensation of federal judges prior to 1862. A statute of that year, chapter 119,  86, 12 Stat. 472, with its amendments, subjected the salaries of all civil officers of the United States to an income tax of 3 per cent. and was construed by the revenue officers as including the compensation of the President and the judges. Chief Justice Taney, the head of the judiciary, wrote to the Secretary of the Treasury a letter of protest (\n157 U.S. 701\n), based on the prohibition we are considering, and in the course of the letter said:\n'The act in question, as you interpret it, diminishes the compensation of every judge three per cent. and if it can be diminished to that extent by the name of a tax, it may in the same way be reduced from time to time at the pleasure of the Legislature.\n\n'The judiciary is one of the three great departments of the government, created and established by the Constitution. Its duties and powers are specifically set forth, and are of a character that requires it to be perfectly independent of the two other departments, and in order to place it beyond the reach and above even the suspicion of any such influence, the power to reduce their compensation is expressly withheld from Congress, and excepted from their powers of legislation.\n\n'Language could not be more plain than that used in \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 258]\n\u00a0\n the Constitution. It is moreover one of its most important and essential provisions. For the articles which limit the powers of the legislative and executive branches of the government, and those which provide safeguards for the protection of the citizen in his person and property, would be of little value without a judiciary to uphold and maintain them, which was free from every influence, direct or indirect, that might by possibility in times of political excitement warp their judgments.\n\n'Upon these grounds I regard an act of Congress retaining in the Treasury a portion of the compensation of the judges, as unconstitutional and void.'\n\n The collection of the tax proceeded, and, at the suggestion of the Chief Justice, this court ordered his protest spread on its records. In 1869 the Secretary of the Treasury referred the question to the Attorney General (Judge Hoar), and that officer rendered an opinion in substantial accord with Chief Justice Taney's protest, and also advised that the tax on the President's compensation ws likewise invalid. 13 Op. A. G. 161. The tax on the compensation of the President and the judges was then discontinued, and the amounts theretofore collected were all refunded-a part through administrative channels and a part through the action of the Court of Claims and ensuing appropriations by Congress. Wayne v. United States, 26 Ct. Cl. 274; chapter 311, 27 Stat. 306. Thus the Secretary of the Treasury, the accounting officers, the Court of Claims and Congress accepted and gave effect to the view expressed by the Attorney General. In the Income Tax Act of 1894, c. 349,  27 et seq., 28 Stat. 509, nothing was said about the compensation of the judges; but Mr. Justice Field regarded it as included and gave that as one reason for joining in the decision holding the act unconstitutional. \n157 U.S. 604\n-606, 15 Sup. Ct. 673. On the rehearing the Attorney General (Mr. Olney) frankly said in his brief:\n'There has never been a doubt since the opinion of Attorney General Hoar \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 259]\n\u00a0\n that the salaries of the President and judges were exempt.'\n\n The income tax acts of 1913, 1916, and 1917 (chapter 16, 38 Stat. 168; chapter 463, 39 Stat. 758,  4 [Comp. St.  6336d] chapter 63, 40 Stat. 329 [Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336d]) severally excepted the compensation of the judges then in office-also that of the President for the then current term. In short, during a period of more than 120 years there was but a single real attempt to tax the judges in respect of their compensation, and that attempt soon was disapproved and pronounced untenable by the concurring action of judicial, executive and legislative officers. And so it is apparent that in the actual practice of the government the prohibition has been construed as embracing and preventing diminution by taxation.\n Does the Sixteenth Amendment authorize and support this tax and the attendant diminution; that is to say, does it bring within the taxing powers subjects theretofore excepted? The court below answered in the negative; and counsel for the government say:\n'It is not, in view of recent decisions, contended that this amendment rendered anything taxable as income that was not so taxable before.'\n\n We might rest the matter here, but it seems better that our view and the reasons therefor be stated in this opinion, even if there be some repetition of what recently has been said in other cases.\n Preliminarily we observe that, unless there be some real conflict between the Sixteenth Amendment and the prohibition, in article 3, section 1, making the compensation of the judges undiminishable, effect must be given to the latter as well as to the former; and also that a purpose to depart from or imperil a constitutional principle so widely esteemed and so vital to our system of government as the independence of the judiciary is not lightly to be assumed.\n In Knowlton v. Moore, supra, \n178 U.S. 95\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 768, this court said:\n'The necessities which gave birth to the Constitution, the controversies which preceded its formation, and the \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 260]\n\u00a0\n conflicts of opinion which were settled by its adoption, may properly be taken into view for the purpose of tracing to its source any particular provision of the Constitution, in order thereby to be enabled to correctly interpret its meaning.'\n\n This sound rule is as applicable to the amendments as to the provisions of the original Constitution.\n Let us turn then to the circumstances in which this amendment was proposed and ratified and to the controversy it was intended to settle. By the Constitution all direct taxes were required to be apportioned among the several states according to their population, as ascertained by a census or enumeration (article 1,  2, cl. 3, and section 9, cl. 4), but no such requirement was imposed as to other taxes. And apart from capitation taxes, with which we now are not concerned, no rule was given for determining what taxes were direct and therefore to be apportioned, or what were n direct and not within that requirement. Controversy ensued and ultimately centered around the right classification of income from taxable real estate and from investments in taxable personal property. The matter then came before this court in Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n157 U.S. 429\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 673; Id., \n158 U.S. 601\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 912, and the decision when announced disclosed that the same differences in opinion existing elsewhere were shared by the members of the court, five, the controlling number, regarding a tax on such income as in effect a direct tax on the property from which it arose, and therefore as requiring apportionment, and four regarding it as indirect and not to be apportioned. Much of the law then under consideration had been framed according to the latter view, and because of this and the adjudged inseparability of other portions the entire law was held invalid. Afterwards, to enable Congress to reach all taxable income more conveniently and effectively than would be possible as to much of it if an apportionment among the states were essential, the Sixteenth \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 261]\n\u00a0\n Amendment was proposed and ratified. In other words, the purpose of the amendment was to eliminate all occasion for such an apportionment because of the source from which the income came,-a change in no wise affecting the power to tax but only the mode of exercising it. The message of the President5 recommending the adoption by Congress of a joint resolution proposing the amendment, the debates6 on the resolution by which it was proposed, and the public appeals7-corresponding to those in the Federalist- made to secure its ratification leave no doubt on this point. And that the proponents of the amendment in drafting it lucidly and aptly expressed this as its object is shown by its words:\n'The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes, from whatever source derived, without apportionment among the several states, and without regard to any census or enumeration.'\n\n True, Gov. Hughes, of New York, in a message laying the amendment before the Legislature of that state for ratification or rejection, expressed some apprehension lest it might be construed as extending the taxing power to income not taxable before; but his message promptly brought forth from statesmen who participated in proposing the amendment such convincing expositions of its purpose,8 as here stated, that the apprehension was effectively dispelled and ratification followed.\n Thus the genesis and words of the amendment unite in showing that it does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects, but merely removes all occasion otherwise existing for an apportionment among the states of taxes laid on income, whether derived from one \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 262]\n\u00a0\n source or another. \n9\n And we have so held in other cases.\n In Brushaber v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n240 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 18 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 236, 241 (60 L. Ed. 493, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 713, L. R. A. 1917D, 414), where the purpose and effect of the amendment were first drawn in question, the Chief Justice reviewed at length the legislative and judicial action which prompted its adoption and then, referring to its text and speaking for a unanimous court, sai: \n'It is clear on the face of this text that it does not purport to confer power to levy income taxes in a generic sense-an authority already possessed and never questioned-or to limit and distinguish between one kind of income taxes and another, but that the whole purpose of the amendment was to relieve all income taxes when imposed from apportionment from a consideration of the source whence the income was derived. Indeed in the light of the history which we have given and of the decision in the Pollock Case and the ground upon which the ruling in that case was based, there is no escape from the conclusion that the amendment was drawn for the purpose of doing away for the future with the principle upon which the Pollock Case was decided, that is, of determining whether a tax on income was direct not by a consideration of the burden placed on the taxed income upon which it directly operated, but by taking into view the burden which resulted on the property from which the income was derived, since in express terms the amendment provides that income taxes, from whatever source \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 263]\n\u00a0\n the income was derived, shall not be subject to the regulation of apportionment.'\n\n What was there said was reaffirmed and applied in Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., \n240 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 113 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 278, and Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165, 172\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 432, and in Eisner v. Macomber, \n252 U.S. 189\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 189, decided at the present term, we again held, citing the prior cases, that the amendment 'did not extend the taxing power to new subjects, but merely removed the necessity which otherwise might exist for an apportionment among the states of taxes laid on income.'\n After further consideration, we adhere to that view and accordingly hold that the Sixteenth Amendment does not authorize or support the tax in question.\n Apart from his salary, a federal judge is as much within the taxing power as other men are. If he has a home or other property, it may be taxed just as if it belonged to another. If he has an income other than his salary, it also may be taxed in the same way. And, speaking generally, his duties and obligations as a citizen are not different from those of his neighbors. But for the common good-to render him, in the words of John Marshall, 'perfectly and completely independent, with nothing to influence or control him but God and his conscience'-his compensation is protected from diminution in any form, whether by a tax or otherwise, and is assured to him in its entirety for his support.\n The court below concluded that the compensation was not diminished, and regarded this as inferable from our decisions in Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 165\n, 174-175, 38 Sup. Ct. 432, and United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 329\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748. We think neither case tends to support that view. Each related to a business, one to exportation, the other to interstate commerce, which the taxing power-of Congress in one case, of a state in the other-was restrained from directly burdening; and the holding in both was \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 264]\n\u00a0\n that an income tax laid, not on the gross receipts, but on the net proceeds remaining after all expenses were paid and losses adjusted, did not directly burden the business, but only indirectly and remotely affected it. Here the Constitution expressly forbids diminution of the judge's compensation, meaning, as we have shown, diminution by taxation as well as otherwise. The taxing act directs that the compensation-the full sum, with no deduction for expenses-be included in computing the net income, on which the tax is laid. If the compensation be the only income, the tax falls on it alone; and, if there be other income, the inclusion of the compensation augments the tax accordingly. In either event the compensation suffers a diminution to the extent that it is taxed.\n We conclude that the tax was imposed contrary to the constitutional prh ibition, and so must be adjudged invalid.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES dissenting.\n This is an action brought by the plaintiff in error against an acting Collector of Internal Revenue to recover a portion of the income tax paid by the former. The ground of the suit is that the plaintiff is entitled to deduct from the total of his net income six thousand dollars, being the amount of his salary as a judge of the District Court of the United States. The Act of February 24, 1919, c. 18,  210, 40 Stat. 1057, 1062 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 e), taxes the net income of every individual, and section 213, p. 1065, requires the compensation received by the judges of the United States to be included in the gross income from which the net income is to computed. This was done by the plaintiff in error and the tax was paid under protest. He contends that the requirement mentioned and the tax, to the extent that it was enhanced by consideration of the plaintiff's salary, are \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 265]\n\u00a0\n contrary to article 3, section 1, of the Constitution, which provides that the compensation of the judges shall not be diminished during their continuance in office. Upon demurrer judgment was entered for the defendant, and the case comes here upon the single question of the validity of the abovementioned provisions of the act.\n The decision below seems to me to have been right for two distinct reasons: that this tax would have been valid under the original Constitution, and that if not so, it was made lawful by the Sixteenth Amendment. In the first place I think that the clause protecting the compensation of judges has no reference to a case like this. The exemption of salaries from diminution is intended to secure the independence of the judges, on the ground, as it was put by Hamilton in the Federalist (No. 79) that 'a power over a man's subsistence amounts to a power over his will.' That is a very good reason for preventing attempts to deal with a judge's salary as such, but seems to me no reason for exonerating him from the ordinary duties of a citizen, which he shares with all others. To require a man to pay the taxes that all other men have to pay cannot possibly be made an instrument to attack his independence as a judge. I see nothing in the purpose of this clause of the Constitution to indicate that the judges were to be a privileged class, free from bearing their share of the cost of the institutions upon which their well-being if not their life depends.\n I see equally little in the letter of the clause to indicate the intent supposed. The tax on net incomes is a tax on the balance of a mutual account in which there always are some and may be many items on both sides. It seems to me that it cannot be affected by an inquiry into the source from which the items more or less remotely are derived. Obviously there is some point at which the immunity of a judge's salary stops, or to put it in the language of the clause, a point at which it could not be said that his compensation \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 266]\n\u00a0\n was diminished by a charge. If he bought a house the fact that a part or the whole of the price had been paid from his compensation as judge would not exempt the house. So if he bought bonds. Yet in such cases the advantages of his salary would be diminished. Even if the house or bonds were bought with other money the same would be true, since the money would not have been free for such an application if he had not used his salary to satisfy other more peremptory needs. At some point, I repeat, money received as salary loses its specific character as such. Money held in trust loses its identity by being mingled with the general funds of the owner. I see no reason why the same should not be true of a salary. But I do not think that the result could be avoided by keeping the salary distinct. I think that the moment the salary is received, whether kept distinct or not, it becomes part of the general income of the owner, and is mingled with the rest, in theory of law, as an item in the mutual account wit the United States. I see no greater reason for exempting the recipients while they still have income as income than when they have invested it in a house or bond.\n The decisions heretofore reached by this Court seem to me to justify my conclusion. In Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 165\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 432, a tax was levied by Congress upon the income of the plaintiff corporation. More than two-thirds of the income were derived from exports and the Constitution in terms prohibits any tax on articles exported from any state. By construction it had been held to create 'a freedom from any tax which directly burdens the exportation.' Fairbanks v. United States, \n181 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 648, 652 (45 L. Ed. 862). The prohibition was unequivocal and express, not merely an inference as in the present case. Yet it was held unanimously that the tax was valid. 'It is not laid on income from exportation ... in a discriminative way, but just as it is laid on other income. ... There is no \n\n[253 U.S. 245, 267]\n\u00a0\n discrimination. At most, exportation is affected only indirectly and remotely. The tax is levied ... after the recipient of the income is free to use it as he chooses. Thus what is taxed-the net income-is as far removed from exportation as are articles intended for export before the exportation begins.' \n247 \nU.S. 174, 175\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 434. All this applies with even greater force when, as I have observed, the Constitution has no words that forbid a tax. In United States Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321, 329\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748, the same principle was affirmed as to interstate commerce and it was said that if there was no discrimination against such commerce the tax constituted one of the ordinary burdens of government from which parties were not exempted because they happened to be engaged in commerce among the States.\n A second and independent reason why this tax appears to me valid is that, even if I am wrong as to the scope of the original document, the Sixteenth Amendment justifies the tax, whatever would have been the law before it was applied. By that amendment Congress is given power to 'collect taxes on incomes from whatever source derived.' It is true that it goes on 'without apportionment among the several States, and without regard to any census or enumeration,' and this shows the particular difficulty that led to it. But the only cause of that difficulty was an attempt to trace income to its source, and it seems to me that the Amendment was intended to put an end to the cause and not merely to obviate a single result. I do not see how judges can claim an abatement of their income tax on the ground that an item in their gross income is salary, when the power is given expressly to tax incomes from whatever source derived.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See House Report, No. 767, p. 29 65th Cong., 2d Sess.; Senate Report, No. 617, p. 6, 65th Cong. 3d Sess.

Cadwallader J. Collins and James E. Hath, both of Norfolk, Va ., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. J. D. Hank, Jr., of Richmond, Va., for the Commonwealth of Virginia.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error is a corporation created by and existing under the laws of Virginia, engaged in the business of manufacturing and selling commercial fertilizers. It operates a manufacturing plant in the county of Norfolk in that state and several plants in other states. From the operation of its plant in Virginia it made net profits during the year ending December 31, 1916, amounting in round figures to $260,000, and from the operation of its plants in other states during the same year made net profits amounting to about $270,000. Under the revenue law of \n\n[253 U.S. 412, 413]\n\u00a0\n the state (Act April 16, 1903 [Va. Acts, c. 148, p. 155], as amended by Act March 22, 1916 [Va. Acts, c. 472, p. 793]), plaintiff in error returned for taxation as income the former amount, omitting the latter. Under appropriate provisions of law the state officials added the latter amount, and assessed an income tax against plaintiff in error upon the aggregate. It petitioned the corporation court of the city of Norfolk for relief from so much of the tax as represented the $270,000, among other reasons upon the ground that, so far as chapter 472 of 1916 taxed that part of its business which was transacted outside of the limits of Virginia, the law imposed upon plaintiff in error a burden not placed upon domestic corporations doing no part of their business in Virginia but transacting business beyond the limits thereof, such corporations, by chapter 495 of 1916 (Va. Acts, p. 830), being expressly exempted from a tax on income derived from business done without the limits of the state; and hence chapter 472, as applied to the business of plaintiff in error transacted beyond the limits of the state, denied to it the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Other points were raised, but they require no mention. The corporation court having sustained the tax, plaintiff in error applied to the Supreme Court of Appeals of the state for a writ of error and supersedeas to review the judgment. That court being of opinion that the decision was right, the application was denied and an order entered in effect affirming the judgment of the corporation court; whereupon this writ of error, directed to the Supreme Court of Appeals in accordance with the practice indicated in Norfolk Turnpike Co. v. Virginia, \n225 \nU.S. 264, 269\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 828, was sued out under section 237, Judicial Code, as amended September 6, 1916 (39 Stat. 726, c. 448 [Comp. St.  1214]).\n The statute thus assailed (Va. Acts 1916, c. 472) imposes an income tax of 1 per centum upon 'the aggregate amount of income of each person or corporation,' subject \n\n[253 U.S. 412, 414]\n\u00a0\n to specified deductions and exemptions; including in income 'all profits from earnings of any partnership or business done in or out of Virginia,' and also 'all other gains and profits derived from any source whateverd.' Under this act, as applied to plaintiff in error by the state officers, whose action was sustained by the court of last resort, a tax was imposed upon the income derived from its plants without the state as well as from that within the state. At the same time, chapter 495, Acts 1916 (page 830), approved on the same day, was in force. This reads as follows:\n'Whereas, certain corporations have been organized under the laws of Virginia, and it is anticipated that certain others will be organized thereunder, which do no business within this state; therefore-1. Be it enacted by the general assembly of Virginia, that no income tax nor ad valorem taxes, state or local, shall be imposed upon the stocks, bonds, investments, capital or other intangible property owned by corporations organized under the laws of this state which do no part of their business within this state; and the mere holding of stockholders' meetings in this state by such corporations required by law, shall not be construed as doing any business in this state within the meaning of this act'-with further matter not necessary to be quoted.\n\n It is not disputed that, under this act, corporations created by and existing under the laws of Virginia, and doing business in other states, but none within the state except the holding of stockholders' meetings, are exempted from the payment of any income tax.\n Of course, these two statutes-chapter 472 and chapter 495-must be considered together as parts of one and the same law; and by their combined effect, if the judgment under review be affirmed, plaintiff in error will be required to pay a tax upon its income derived from business done without as well as from that done within the state, while other corporations owing existence to the same laws and simul taneously \n\n[253 U.S. 412, 415]\n\u00a0\n deriving income from business done without the state, but none from business within it, are exempt from taxation.\n It is unnecessary to say that the 'equal protection of the laws' required by the Fourteenth Amendment does not prevent the states from resorting to classification for the purposes of legislation. Numerous and familiar decisions of this court establish that they have a wide range of discretion in that regard. But the classification must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the iegislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike. The latitude of discretion is notably wide in the classification of property for purposes of taxation and the granting of partial or total exemptions upon grounds of policy. Bell's Gap R. R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 533; Michigan Central Railroad v. Powers, \n201 \nU.S. 245, 293\n, 26 S. Sup. Ct. 459; Keeney v. New York, \n222 \nU.S. 525, 536\n, 32 S. Sup.

Nevertheless a discriminatory tax law cannot be sustained against the complaint of a party aggrieved if the classification appear to be altogether illusory. Now both of the taxing provisions here in question relate to corporations organized under the laws of Virginia. It is the object of chapter 495 to exempt such corporations from income taxes (as well as taxes upon intangible property) where they do no business within the state except holding their stockholders' meetings therein; manifestly in recognition of the fact that Virginia corporations so circumstanced derive no governmental protection from the state warranting the imposition of taxes upon their incomes derived from without the state or property taxes upon their intangibles, and in recognition of the impolicy, if not injustice, of imposing such taxes upon them while they are liable, and presum ably \n\n[253 U.S. 412, 416]\n\u00a0\n subjected, to taxation in the state or states where their income-producing business is conducted. But no ground is suggested, nor can we conceive of any, sustaining this exemption which does not apply with equal or greater force as a ground for exempting from taxation the income of Virginia corporations derived from sources without the state where they also transact income-producing business within the state. Corporations of this class derive no more protection from the state of their origin with respect to their outside business, and are no less subject to taxation by the states in which such business is conducted, than corporations of the other class; and they are required to comply with the same laws as to the payment of organization taxes and annual registration fees and franchise taxes to the state of origin. Their business done within the state presumably is of some general benefit to the state, certainly enriches its treasury by the amount of the taxes they pay upon the income derived therefrom; and the imps ition upon them under chapter 472 of taxes not only upon this income, but also upon income that they derive from business conducted outside of the state (similar income of the favored corporations being exempted) has the effect of discriminating against them for that which ought to operate if at all in their favor. It is obvious that the ground of difference upon which the discrimination is rested has no fair or substantial relation to the proper object sought to be accomplished by the legislation. It follows that it is arbitrary in effect; and none the less because it is probable that the unequal operation of the taxing system was due to inadvertence rather than design.\n We suggest that it was inadvertent because shortly after the present suit was brought, and as if in recognition of and in order to correct the discrimination, the revenue act was amended by Act of March 14, 1918 ( chapter 219, Va. Acts, p. 395), providing:\n'Persons and corporations \n\n[253 U.S. 412, 417]\n\u00a0\n doing a part of their business within the state and a part without the state, and having offices or other regular places of business both within and without the state, shall be taxed only upon such income as is derived from business transacted and property located within the state, which may be determined by an allocation and separate accounting,' etc.\n\n But this was not retrospective, and, for the reasons given, we are constrained to hold that so far as chapter 472 of the Laws of 1916 operated to impose upon plaintiff in error a tax upon income derived from business transacted and property located without the state because of the mere circumstance that it also derived income from business transacted and property located within the state, while at the same time, under chapter 495, other corporations deriving their existence and powers from the laws of the same state, and receiving income from business transacted and property located without the state, but none from sources within the state, were exempted from income taxes, there was an arbitrary discrimination amounting to a denial to plaintiff in error of the equal protection of the laws within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs.\n It is settled that mere inequalities or exemptions in state taxation are not forbidden by the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; that the power of the state to make any reasonable classification of property, occupations, persons or corporations for purposes of taxation is not abridged thereby; and that the amendment forbids merely inequality which is the result of clearly arbitrary action and, particularly, of action \n\n[253 U.S. 412, 418]\n\u00a0\n attributable to hostile discrimination against particular persons or classes. Beers v. Glynn, \n211 \nU.S. 477, 485\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 186; Merchants' Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 \nU.S. 461, 463\n, 464 S., 17 Sup. Ct. 829; Bell's Gap Railroad v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 533. The question presented for our decision is whether the action of Virginia in subjecting its domestic corporations which transact business within the state to a tax on all their income, wherever earned, while exempting from the tax those domestic corporations which transact no business within the state, is so clearly arbitrary or invidious, as to fall within the constitutional prohibition.\n The court declares the act void on the ground that no substantial reason for difference in treatment between the two classes of domestic corporations has been suggested or can be conceived; and that the classification is illusory and the state's action arbitrary. I can conceive of a reason for differentiating in respect to taxation between the two classes of domestic corporations. The following reason is, in my opinion, substantial, and shows that the classification is not illusory, nor the state's actio necessarily arbitrary or invidious.\n It is a matter of common knowledge that some states have, in the past, made the granting of charters to nonresidents for companies, which purpose transacting business wholly without the state of incorporation, an important source of revenue. The action of those states has materially affected the legislation of other states. Sometimes it has led to active competition for the large revenues believed to be available from this source. More often, it has led to protective measures. The Legislature of Virginia may have believed that its own citizens interested in corporations whose business was transacted wholly in other states or countries, might be tempted to incorporate under more favorable laws of other states, but that such temptation would prove ineffective where the companies transacted a part of their business within \n\n[253 U.S. 412, 419]\n\u00a0\n the state of Virginia and enjoyed compensating advantages. If the Legislature of Virginia enacted the laws of 1916 here in question because it held that view, we surely cannot say that its action was unreasonable or arbitrary. And with the wisdom of its action we have no concern.\n If there were a doubt as to its reasonableness the facts which were, or may have been, before the Legislature should be considered. Every private domestic business corporation makes a substantial contribution to the revenues of Virginia, even if it is not subjected to property or income taxes. It pays an organization tax on incorporation, and annually thereafter both a registration fee and an annual franchise tax. These fees and taxes are graduated. For a corporation with a $1,000,000 capital the organization fee is $200; the annual registration fee and franchise tax $ 225. Acts of 1903, c. 148,  37, 43, 41, pp. 179, 182, 180, as amended respectively by Acts of 1912, c. 301; Acts 1910, c. 58; Acts 1908, c. 227. In the year 1915-1916 the fees and taxes from this source aggregated $114, 175.80.1 The number of charters issued was 1067-many of them, as the list indicates, to companies whose business would be transacted wholly without the state of Virginia. \n2\n The dangers from competition incident to less burdensome corporation laws of other states had, in other connections, been considered by the tax commission. \n3\n It may well have been the case that the Legislature did not wish to put in peril revenues already being received from concerns which, as they transacted no business within the state, might easily have surrendered their Virginia charters and reincorporated under the laws of the other states; and it would have been natural that \n\n[253 U.S. 412, 420]\n\u00a0\n to avert such loss the Legislature should have relieved such corporations from the payment of income taxes. The joint committee on tax revision had recommended that the income tax cover 'all profits from earnings of any partnership or business done in or out of Virginia,' and had not suggested that domestic corporations should be exempted from it. \n4\n It was reasonable that other domestic corporations should have been subjected, like natural persons domiciled within the state, to a tax on all income-whether earned within or without the state. Compare Cream of Wheat Co. v. County of Grand Forks, \n253 U.S. 325\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 558, 64 L. Ed.-, decided June 1, 1920\n\n\n The court calls attention to the Act of March 14, 1918 (chapter 219, Va. Acts, p. 395), which exempts all individuals and corporations from the burden of taxation on incomes earned without the state. The effect of this act is, among other things, to remove the alleged discrimination here complained of. But its enactment does not, in my opinion, indicate that the imposition of the tax was inadvertent. To my mind it indicates rathert hat the Legislatures of the several states may safely be intrusted with the duty of legislation.\n I cannot doubt that the classification for purposes of taxation made by the act of 1916 was within the power of the state. But if I did not think the matter clear, I should, for the reasons stated by me fully elsewhere, feel constrained to resolve the doubt in favor of the constitutionality of the act. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Report of Auditor of Virginia (1916) p. 66; Report of State Corporation Commission of Virginia (1916) p. 270. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Report of State Corporation Commission of Virginia (1916) pp. 226- 248, 269. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Report of Virginia Tax Commission (1911) p. 354. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Report of Joint Committee on Tax Revision (Virginia, 1914) p. 203. \n\n\n\n\n","47":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFARNCOMB v. CITY AND COUNTY OF DENVER(1920)\nNo. 110\nArgued: January 14, 1920Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. T. J. O'Donnell, of Denver, Colo., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. James A. Marsh, of Denver, Colo., for defendants in error. \n\n[252 U.S. 7, 8]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit was brought in the district court of the city and county of Denver by the plaintiffs in error to enjoin the city from enforcing an assessment ordinance passed to raise the necessary means to pay for certain park improvements and the construction of boulevards and streets in the city of Denver.\n The charter of the city of Denver was before this court in Londoner v. City and County of Denver, \n210 U.S. 373\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 708. Sections 298 and 299 of the charter provided that the board of local improvements shall prepare a statement showing the costs of improvements, interest, cost of collection, etc., and apportion the same upon each lot or tract of land to be assessed, shall cause the same to be certified by the president, and filed in the office of the clerk. The clerk shall then by advertisement in some newspaper of general circulation, published in the city and county, notify the owners of the real estate to be assessed and all persons interested that said improvements have been or will be completed, and shall specify the whole cost of the improvement, and the share so apportioned to each lot, or tract of land, or person, and any complaint or objection that may be made in writing by such persons or owners to the board of supervisors, and filed with the clerk within 60 days from the first publication of such notice, shall be heard and determined by the board of supervisors at its first regular meeting after 60 days, and before the passage of any ordinance assessing the cost of the improvements.\n Section 300 provides:\n'At the meeting specified in said notice, or any adjournment thereof, the board of supervisors, sitting as a board of equalization, shall hear and determine all such complaints and objections, and may recommend to the board of public works any modification of their apportionments; the board of public \n\n[252 U.S. 7, 9]\n\u00a0\n works may thereupon make such modifications and changes as to them may seem equitable and just, and may confirm the first apportionment and shall notify the council of their final decision; and the council shall thereupon, by ordinance, assess the costs of said improvements against all the real estate in said district and against such persons, respectivel, in the proportions above mentioned.'\n\n Section 328 of the charter provides:\n'When the cost of any such park site or parkway is definitely determined, the park commission shall prepare, certify and file with the clerk a statement showing the cost thereof as required in section 298 hereof; the clerk shall thereupon give the notice required by section 299 hereof; and thereupon the same proceedings required in section 300 hereof shall be had, except that the proceedings therein provided to be observed by the board shall be observed by the park commission; and the council shall thereupon by ordinance assess the cost against the other real estate as aforesaid, in the district, in accordance with said apportionments.'\n\n The federal question, brought before us by the writ of error, concerns the constitutionality of section 300, above set forth-the contention being that it does not give interested property owners the opportunity to be heard where the property is to be specially assessed for making improvements of the character in question, as the hearing provided is before a board which has no power to decide any complaint which the property owner may have or make with respect to the validity or falseness of such assessment, or to correct any error in such assessment, but only has power to recommend to the power or authority, originally making the assessment, any modifications of portions of such assessment; that is, that the board of supervisors has only the power to recommend to the board of park commissioners the apportionment to be made in the assessment. It is the contention of the plaintiffs in error that the hearing thus afforded does not \n\n[252 U.S. 7, 10]\n\u00a0\n give due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Supreme Court of Colorado, affirming the judgment of the district court, denied this contention, and affirmed the judgment of the district court sustaining the validity of the assessment. 171 Pac. 66.\n The Supreme Court of Colorado held that the question had already been disposed of by its own previous decision, affirmed as to the constitutional point by our decision in Londoner v. Denver, \n210 U.S. 373\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 708, supra. In Londoner v. Denver the section of the charter now involved was before this court, being then section 31 of the charter. Section 300 to all intents is the same in terms as section 31, except that the board of supervisors, sitting as a board of equalization, is substituted for the city council.\n This court when dealing with the constitutionality of state statutes, challenged under the Fourteenth Amendment, accepts the meaning thereof as construed by the highest court of the state. St. Louis & Kansas City Land Co. v. Kansas City, \n241 \nU.S. 419, 427\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 647\n\n\n In Londoner v. Denver this court accepted, as it was bound to do, the construction of the charter made by the state court, and upon that construction determined its constitutional validity. The city charter was construed in the Supreme Court in 33 Colo. 104, 80 Pac. 117. In the opinion in that case, after discussing the steps required in making improvements of the character involve here, the court, in dealing with section 31, said (33 Colo. 117, 80 Pac. 121):\n'Notwithstanding the apparently mandatory words used in section 31, supra, we do not think that thereby the legislative power and discretion of the city council is taken away and vested in the board of public works, but that the former, in the exercise of its functions, is empowered to pass an assessing ordinance charging property with the cost of an improvement, which, according to its judgment, would be just and equitable.' \n\n[252 U.S. 7, 11]\n\u00a0\n Adopting this construction of the section, and considering the objection urged that it would not afford due process of law, this court by Mr. Justice Moody said (\n210 U.S. 379\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 711):\n\n'The ninth assignment questions the constitutionality of that part of the law which authorizes the assessment of benefits.I t seems desirable, for the proper disposition of this and the next assignment, to state the construction which the Supreme Court gave to the charter. This may be found in the judgment under review and two cases decided with it. Denver v. Kennedy, 33 Colo. 80 [80 Pac. 122, 467]; Denver v. Dumars, 33 Colo. 94 [80 Pac. 114]. From these cases it appears that the lien upon the adjoining land arises out of the assessment; after the cost of the work and the provisional apportionment is certified to the city council the landowners affected are afforded an opportunity to be heard upon the validity and amount of the assessment by the council sitting as a board of equalization; if any further notice than the notice to file complaints and objections is required, the city authorities have the implied power to give it; the hearing must be before the assessment is made; this hearing, provided for by section 31, is one where the board of equalization 'shall hear the parties complaining and such testimony as they may offer in support of their complaints and objections as would be competent and relevant' (33 Colo. 97 [80 Pac. 114]); and that the full hearing before the board of equalization excludes the courts from entertaining any objections which are cognizable by this board. The statute itself, therefore, is clear of all constitutional faults.'\n\n Plaintiffs in error did not avail themselves of the privilege of a hearing as provided by this section, but after the assessing ordinance had been passed began this proceeding in the district court to test the constitutionality of the law. As we have said, the question as to what should be a proper construction of the charter provision was not for our decision; that matter was within the \n\n[252 U.S. 7, 12]\n\u00a0\n sole authority of the state court, and was disposed of, as the Supreme Court of Colorado held, by the former cases reported in 33 Colorado, and by our decision based upon that construction in Londoner v. Denver, \n210 U.S. 373\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 708, supra. As the plaintiffs in error had an opportunity to be heard before the board duly constituted by section 300, they cannot be heard to complain now. It follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","48":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION v. GRATZ(1920)\nNo. 492\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Huston Thompson, of Washington, D. C., Alexander C. King, of Atlanta, Ga., and Claude R. Porter, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas F. Magner, of Brooklyn, N. Y., for respondents. \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 422]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an act approved September 26, 1914 (chapter 311, 38 Stat. 717 [ Comp. St.  8836a-8836k]), Congress made provision for the Federal Trade Commission and declared its powers.\n Section 4 (section 8836d) defines commerce as:\n'Commerce among the several states or with foreign nations, or in any territory of the United States or in the District of Columbia, or between any such territory and another, or between any such territory and any state or foreign nation or between the District of Columbia and any state or territory or foreign nation.'\n\n Section 5 (section 8836e):\n'That unfair methods of competition in commerce are hereby declared unlawful. The commission is hereby empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations, except banks, and common carriers subject to the acts to regulate commerce, from using unfair methods of competition in commerce. Whenever the commission shall have reason to believe that any such person, partnership, or corporation, has been or is using any unfair method of competition in commerce, and if it shall appear to the commission that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, it shall issue and serve upon such person, partnership, or corporation a complaint stating its charges in that respc t, and containing a notice of a hearing upon a day and at a place therein fixed at least thirty days after the service of said complaint. The person, partnership, or corporation so complained of shall have the right to appear at the place and time so fixed and show cause why an order should not be entered by the commission requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from the violation of the law so charged in said complaint. ... If upon such hearing the commission shall be of the opinion that the method of competition in question is prohibited \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 423]\n\u00a0\n by this act, it shall make a report in writing in which it shall state its findings as to the facts, and shall issue and cause to be served on such person, partnership, or corporation an order requiring such person, partnership, or corporation to cease and desist from using such method of competition.'\n\n Section 5 further provides that the commission may apply to the designated Circuit Court of Appeals to enforce an order--\n'and shall certify and file with its application a transcript of the entire record in the proceeding, including all the testimony taken and the report and order of the commission. Upon such filing of the application and transcript the court shall cause notice thereof to be served upon such person, partnership, or corporation and thereupon shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and the question determined therein, and shall have power to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such transcript a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside the order of the commission. The findings of the commission as to the facts, if supported by testimony, shall be conclusive. ... The judgment and decree of the court shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court upon certiorari as provided by section 240 of the Judicial Code. Any party required by such order of the commission to cease and desist from using such method of competition may obtain a review of such order in said Circuit Court of Appeals by filing in the court a written petition praying that the order of the commission be set aside. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith served upon the commission, and thereupon the commission forthwith shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the record as hereinbefore provided. Upon the filing of the transcript the court shall have the same jurisdiction to affirm, set aside, or modify the order of the commission as in the case of an application by the commission for an \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 424]\n\u00a0\n enforcement of its order, and the findings of the commission as to the facts, if supported by testimony, shall in like manner be conclusive.'\n\n Sections 6 and 7 (sections 8836f, 8836g) empower the commission to require reports and compile information concerning corporations; to inquire concerning execution of decrees restraining violations of the anti- trust acts; to investigate alleged violations of such acts; to recommend readjustments of corporate business; to publish information and make reports to Congress; to classify corporations and make rules and regulations; to investigate trade conditions; to act, under orders of the court, as a master in chancery in certain designated circumstances, etc.\n Undertaking to proceed under section 5, June 4, 1917, the commission issued a complaint containing two counts against respondents. The first related to unfair methods of competition, and the second charged violation of section 3 of the Clayton Act, approved October 15, 1914 (chapter 323, 38 Stat. 730 [Comp. St.  8835c]). Respondents denied both charges. After taking much testimony the commission held there was no evidence to support the second count; but it ruled that respondents had practiced unfair competition and ordered that they--\n'their officers and agents, cease and desist from requiring purchasers of cotton ties to also buy or agree to buy, a proportionate amount of American Manufacturing Company's bagging and fr ther that the respondents cease and desist from refusing to sell cotton ties unless the purchasers buy or agree to buy from them corresponding amounts of American Manufacturing Company's bagging, or any amount of cotton bagging of any kind.'\n\n Upon respondents' petition the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, annulled the commission's order. 258 Fed. 314, 169 C. C. A. 330. It said:\n'We think there is no evidence to support any general practice of the respondents to refuse to sell ties unless the purchaser bought at the same time the necessary amount of the American Manufacturning \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 425]\n\u00a0\n Company's bagging, and that the commission has no jurisdiction to determine the merits of specific individual grievances.'\n\n The challenged order is based solely upon the first count of the complaint which follows:\n'Federal Trade Commission v. Anderson Gratz and Benjamin Gratz, Copartners Doing Business under the Firm Name and Style of Warren, Jones & Gratz, P. P. Williams, W. H. Fitzhugh, and Alex. Fitzhugh, Copartners Doing Business under the Firm Name and Style of P. P. Williams & Co., and Charles O. Elmer.\n\n'The Federal Trade Commission having reason to believe, from a preliminary investigation made by it, that Anderson Gratz and Benjamin Gratz, copartners doing business under the firm name and style of Warren, Jones & Gratz, P. P. Williams, W. H. Fitzhugh, and Alex. Fitzhugh, copartners doing business under the firm name and style of P. P. Williams & Co., and Charles O. Elmer, all of whom are hereinafter referred to as respondents, have been and are using unfair methods of competition in interstate commerce in violation of the provisions of section 5 of the act of Congress approved September 26, 1914, entitled 'An act to create a Federal Trade Commission, to define its powers and duties, and for other purposes,' and it appearing that a proceeding by it in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public, issues this complaint, stating its charges in that respect, on information and belief, as follows:\n\n'I.\n\n'Paragraph 1: That the respondents Anderson Gratz and Benjamin Gratz are copartners doing business under the firm name and style of Warren, Jones & Gratz, having their principal office and place of business \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 426]\n\u00a0\n in the city of St. Louis and state of Missouri, and are engaged in the business of selling, in interstate commerce, either directly to the trade, or through the respondents hereinafter named, steel ties made and used for binding bales of cotton, and which steel ties are manufactured by the Carnegie Steel Company of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and also selling, in the same manner, jute bagging, used to wrap bales of cotton, and which jute bagging is manufactured by the American Manufacturing Company, of St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n'Paragraph 2: That the respondents P. P. Williams, W. H. Fitzhugh, and Alex. Fitzhugh are copartners doing business under the firm name and style of P. P. Williams & Co., having their principal office and place of business in the city of Vicksburg and state of Mississippi, and the said last-named respondents and the said respondent Charles O. Elmer, who is located and doing business at the city of New Orleans and state of Louisiana, are the selling and distributing agents of the said firm of Warren, Jones & Gratz, and sell and distribute the ties and bagging, manufactured as aforesaid, in interstate commerce, principally to jobbers and dealers, who resell the same to retailers, cotton ginners, and farmers.\n\n'Paragraph 3: That with the purpose, intent, and effect of discouraging and stifling competition in interstate commerce in the sale of such bagging, all of the respondents do now refuse and for more than a year last past have refused, to sell and of such ties unless the prospective purchaser thereof would also buy from them bagging to be used with the number of ties proposed to be bought; that is to say, for each six of such ties proposed to be bought from the respondents the prospective purchaser is required to buy six yards of such bag ing.'\n\n It is unnecessary now to discuss conflicting views concerning validity and meaning of the act creating the commission and effect of the evidence presented. The \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 427]\n\u00a0\n judgment below must be affirmed, since, in our opinion, the first count of the complaint is wholly insufficient to charge respondents with practicing 'unfair methods of competition in commerce' within the fair intendment of those words. We go no further and confine this opinion to the point specified.\n When proceeding under section 5 it is essential, first, that, having reason to believe a person, partnership, or corporation has used an unfair method of competition in commerce, the commission shall conclude a proceeding 'in respect thereof would be to the interest of the public'; next, that it formulate and serve a complaint stating the charges 'in that respect,' and give opportunity to the accused to show why an order should not issue directing him to 'cease and desist from the violation of the law so charged in said complaint.' If after a hearing the commission shall deem 'the method of competition in question is prohibited by this act,' it shall issue an order requiring the accused 'to cease and desist from using such method of competition.'\n If, when liberally construed, the complaint is plainly insufficient to show unfair competition within the proper meaning of these words there is no foundation for an order to desist-the thing which may be prohibited is the method of competition specified in the complaint. Such an order should follow the complaint; otherwise it is improvident and, when challenged, will be annulled by the court.\n The words 'unfair method of competition' are not defined by the statute and their exact meaning is in dispute. It is for the courts, not the commission, ultimately to determine as matter of law what they include. They are clearly inapplicable to practices never heretofore regarded as opposed to good morals because characterized by deception, bad faith, fraud, or oppression, or as against public policy because of their dangerous tendency unduly to hinder competition or create monopoly. The act was \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 428]\n\u00a0\n certainly not intended to fetter free and fair competition as commonly understood and practiced by honorable opponents in trade.\n Count 1 alleges, in effect: That Warren, Jones & Gratz are engaged in selling, either directly to the trade or through their correspondents, cotton ties produced by the Carnegie Steel Company and also jute bagging manufactured by the American Manufacturing Company. That P. P. Williams & Co., of Vicksburg, and C. O. Elmer, of New Orleans, are the selling and distributing agents of Warren, Jones & Gratz, and as such sell and distribute their ties and bagging to jobbers and dealers, who resell them to retailers, ginners, and farmers. That with the purpose and effect of discouraging and stifling competition in the sale of such bagging all the respondents for more than a year have refused to sell any of such ties unless the purchaser would buy from them a corresponding amount of bagging- six yards with as many ties.\n The complaint contains no intimation that Warren, Jones & Gratz did not properly obtain their ties and bagging as merchants usually do; the amount controlled by them is not stated; nor is it alleged that they held a monopoly of either ties or bagging or had ability, purpose or intent to acquire one. So far as appears, acting independently, they undertook to sell their lawfully acquired property in the ordinary course, without deception, misrepresentation, or oppression, and at fair prices, to purchasers willing to take it upon terms openly announced.\n Nothing is alleged which would justify the conclusion that the public suffered injury or that competitors had reasonable ground for complaint. All question of monopoly or combination being out of the way, a private merchant, acting with entire good faith, may properly refuse to sell, except in conjunction, such closely associated articles as ties and bagging. If real competition is to continue, the right of the individual to exercise reasonable discretion \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 429]\n\u00a0\n in respect of his own business methods must be preserved. United States v. Colgate, \n250 U.S. 300\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 465; United States v. A. Schrader's Son, Inc. (March 1, 1920), \n252 U.S. 85\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 251.\n The first count of the complaint fails to show any unfair method of competition practiced by respondents and the order oased thereon was improvident.\n The judgment of the court below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY concurs in the result.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissenting, with whom Mr. Justice CLARKE concurs.\n First. The court disposes of the case on a question of pleading. This, under the circumstances, is contrary to established practice. The circumstances are these:\n The pleading held defective is not one in this suit. It is the pleading by which was originated the proceeding before the Federal Trade Commission, an administrative tribunal, whose order this suit was brought to set aside. No suggestion was made in the proceeding before the commission that the complaint was defective. No such objection was raised in this suit in the court below. It was not made here by counsel. The objection is taken now for the first time and by the court.\n This suit, begun in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, was brought to set aside an order of the Federal Trade Commission. Before the latter the matter involved was thoroughly tried on the merits. There was a complaint and answers. Thirty-five witnesses were examined and cross-examined. A report of proposed findings as to facts was submitted by the examiner and exceptions were filed thereto. Then, the case was heard before the commission, which made a finding of facts, stated its conclusions as to the law, and ultimately issued the order in question. The proceedings occupied more \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 430]\n\u00a0\n than 16 months. The report of them fills 400 pages of the printed record. In my opinion it is our duty to determine whether the facts found by the commission are sufficient in law to support the order, and also, if it is questioned, whether the evidence was sufficient to support the findings of fact.\n Second. If the sufficiency of the complaint is held to be open for consideration here, we should, in my opinion, hold it to be sufficient. The complaint was filed under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act which declares unlawful 'unfair methods of competition in commerce,' empowers the commission to prevent their use, and directs it to issue and serve 'a complaint stating its charges in that respect' whenever it has reason to believe that a concern 'has been or is using' such methods. The function of the complaint is solely to advise the respondent of the charges made so the he may have due notice and full opportunity for a hearing thereon. It does not purport to set out the elements of a crime like an indictment or information, nor the elements of a cause of action like a declaration at law or a bill in equity. All that is requisite in a complaint before the commission is that there be a plain statement of the thing claimed to be wrong so that the respondent may be put upon his defence. The practice of the Federal Trade Commission in this respect, as in many others, is modeled on that which has been pursued by the Interstate Commerce Commission for a generation and has been sanctioned by this as well as the lower federal courts. United States Leather Co. v. Southern Ry. Co., 21 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 323, 324; Clinton Sugar Refining Co. v. C. & N. W. Ry. Co., 28 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 364, 367; Stuarts Draft Milling Co. v. Southern Ry. Co., 31 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 623, 624; New York Central, etc., R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission (C. C.) 168 Fed. 131, 138, 139; Dickerson v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. (C. C.) 187 Fed. 874, 878; Texas & Pacific Ry. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, 162 \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 431]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 197, 215, 16 Sup. Ct. 666;C incinnati, Hamilton & Dayton Ry. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 142, 149\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 648.\n The complaint here under consideration stated clearly that an unfair method of competition had been used by respondents, and specified what it was, namely, refusing to sell cotton ties unless the customer would purchase with each six ties also six yards of bagging. The complaint did not set out the circumstances which rendered this tying of bagging to ties an unfair practice. But this was not necessary. The complaint was similar in form to those filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission on complaints to enforce the prohibition of 'unjust and unreasonable charges' or of 'undue or unreasonable preference or advantage' which the act to regulate commerce imposes (Comp. St.  8565). It is unnecessary to set forth why the rate specified was unjust or why the preference specified is undue or unreasonable, because these are matters not of law but of fact to be established by the evidence. Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351, 361\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 370. So far as appears neither this nor any other court has ever held that an order entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission may be set aside as void, because the complaint by which the proceeding was initiated, failed to set forth the reasons why the rate or the practice complained of was unjust or unreasonable; and I cannot see why a different rule should be applied to orders of the Federal Trade Commission issued under section 5.1 \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 432]\n\u00a0\n In considering whether the complaint is sufficient, it is necessary to bear in mind the nature of the proceeding under review. The proceeding is not punitive. The complaint is not made with a view to subjecting the respondents to any form of punishment. It is not remedial. The complaint is not filed with a view to affording compensation for any injury alleged to have resulted from the matter charged, nor with a view to protecting individuals from any such injury in the future. The proceeding is strictly a preventive measure taken in the interest of the general public. And what it is brought to prevent is not the commission of acts of unfair competition, but the pursuit of unfair methods. Furthermore, the order is not self-executory. Standing alone it is only informative and advisory. The commission cannot enforce it. If not acquiesced in by the respondents, the commission may apply to the Circuit Court of Appeals to enforce it. But the commission need not take such action, and it did not do so in respect to the order here in question. Respondents may, if they see fit, become the actors and ask to have the order set aside. That is what was done in the case at bar.\n The proceeding is thus a novelty. It is a new device in administrative machinery, introduced by Congress in the year 1914, in the hope thereby of remedying conditions in business which a great majority of the American people regarded as menancing the general welfare, and which for more than a generation they had vainly attempted to remedy by the ordinary processes of law. It was believed that widespread and growing concentration in industry and commerce restrained trade, and that monopolies were acquiring increasing control of business. Legislation designed to arrest the movement and to secure integration of existing combinations had been enacted by some of the states as early as 1889. In 1890 Congress passed the Sherman Law (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830). It was followed by much \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 433]\n\u00a0\n legislation in the states2 and many official investigations. Between 1906 and 1913 reports were made by the Federal Bureau of Corporations of its investigations into the petroleum industry, the tobacco industry, the steel industry, and the farm implement industry. A special committee of Congress investigated the affairs of the United States Steel Corporation. And in 1911 this court rendered its decision in Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 U.S. 1\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734, and in American Tobacco Co. v. United States, \n221 U.S. 106\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 632. The conviction became general in America, that the legislation of the past had been largely ineffective. There was general agreement that further legislation was desirable. But there was a clear division of opinion as to what its character should be. Many believed that concentration (called by its opponents monopoly) was inevitable and desirable; and these desired that concentration should be recognized by law and be regulated. Others believed that concentration was a source of evil; that existing combinations could be disintegrated, if only the judicial machinery were perfected; and that further concentration could be averted by providing additional remedies, and particularly through regulating competition. The latter view prevailed in the Sixty-Third Congress. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[253 U.S. 421, 434]\n\u00a0\n The Clayton Act (Act Oct. 15, 1914, c. 323, 38 Stat. 730) was framed largely with a view to making more effective the remedies given by the Sherman law. The Federal Trade Commission Act (Act Sept. 26, 1914, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717) created an administrative tribunal, largely with a view to regulating competition.\n Many of the duties imposed upon the Trade Commission had been theretofore performed by the Bureau of Corporations. That which was in essence new legislation was the power conferred by section 5. The belief was widespread that the great trusts had acquired their power, in the main, through destroying or overreaching their weaker rivals by resort to unfair practices. \n4\n As Standard Oil rebates led to the creation of the Interstate Commerce Commission,5 other unfair methods of competition, which the investigations of the trusts had laid bare, led to the creation of the Federal Trade Commission. It was hoped that, as the former had substantially eliminated rebates, the latter might put an end to all other unfair trade practices, and that it might prove possible thereby to preserve the competitive system. It was a new experiment on old lines; and the machinery employed was substantially similar.\n In undertaking to regulate competition through the Trade Commission, Congress (besides resorting to administrative as distinguished from judicial machinery) departed in two important respects from the methods and measures theretofore applied in dealing with trusts and restraints of trade:\n\n\n (1)\n Instead of attempting to inflict punishment for having done prohibited acts, instead of enjoining the \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 435]\n\u00a0\n continuance of prohibited combinations and compelling disintegration of those formed in violation of law, the act undertook to preserve competition through supervisory action of the commission. The potency of accomplished facts had already been demonstrated. The task of the commission was to protect competitive business from further inroads by monopoly. It was to be ever vigilant. If it discovered that any business concern had used any practice which would be likely to result in public injury-because in its nature it would tend to aid or develop into a restraint of trade-the commission was directed to intervene, before any act should be done or condition arise violative of the Anti-Trust Act. And it should do this by filing a complaint with a view to a thorough investigation; and, if need be, the issue of an order. Its action was to be prophylactic. Its purpose in respect to restraints of trade was prevention of diseased business conditions, not cure. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[253 U.S. 421, 436]\n\u00a0\n (2) Instead of undertaking to define what practices should be deemed unfair, as had been done in earlier legislation, the act left the determination to the commission. \n7\n Experience with existing laws had taught that definition, being necessarily rigid, would prove embarrassing and, if rigorously applied, might involve great hardship. Methods of competition which would be unfair in one industry, under certain circumstances, might, when adopted in another industry, or even in the same industry under different circumstances, be entirely unobjectionable. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[253 U.S. 421, 437]\n\u00a0\n Furthermore, an enumeration, however comprehensive, of existing methods of unfair competition must neces arily soon prove incomplete, as with new conditions constantly arising novel unfair methods would be devised and developed. In leaving to the commission the determination of the question whether the method of competition pursued in a particular case was unfair, Congress followed the precedent which it had set a quarter of century earlier, when by the act to regulate commerce it conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission power to determine whether a preference or advantage given to a shipper or locality fell within the prohibition of an undue or unreasonable preference or advantage. \n9\n See Pennsylvania Co. v. United States, supra, \n236 U.S. 361\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 370; Texas & Pacific Railway v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n162 \nU.S. 197, 219\n, 220 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 666. Recognizing that the question whether a method of competitive practice was unfair would ordinarily depend upon special facts, Congress imposed upon the commission the duty of finding the facts, and it declared that findings of fact so made (if duly supported by evidence) were to be taken as final. The question whether the method of competition pursued could, on those facts, reasonably be held by the commission to constitute an unfair method of competition, being a question of law, was necessarily left open to review by the court. Compare Interstate Commerce Commission v. Diffenbaugh, \n222 U.S. 42\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 22; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R., \n145 U.S. 263\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 844.\n Third. Such a question of law is presented to us for decision, and it is this: Can the refusal by a manufacturer to sell his product to a jobber or retailer, except upon condition that the purchaser will buy from him also his \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 438]\n\u00a0\n trade requirements in another article or articles, reasonably be found by the commission to be an unfair method of competition under the circumstances set forth in the findings of fact? If we were called upon to consider the sufficiency of the complaint, and that merely, the question for our decision would be, whether the particular practice could, under any circumstances, reasonably be deemed an unfair method of competition. But as this suit to set aside the order of the commission brings before us its findings of fact, we must determine whethere these are sufficient to support their conclusion of law that the practice constituted--\n'under the circumt ances therein set forth, unfair methods of competition in interstate commerce against other manufacturers, dealers and distributors in the material known as sugar-bag cloth, and against manufacurers, dealers and distributors of the bagging known as rewoven bagging and second-hand bagging in violation of' the statute.\n\n It is obvious that the imposition of such a condition is not necessarily and universally an unfair method; but that it may be such under some circumstances seems equally clear. Under the usual conditions of competitive trade the practice might be wholly unobjectionable. But the history of combinations has shown that what one may do with impunity, may have intolerable results when done by several in co-operation. Similarly what approximately equal individual traders may do in honorable rivalry may result in grave injustice and public injury, if done by a great corporation in a particular field of business which it is able to dominate. In other words, a method of competition fair among equals may be very unfair if applied where there is inequality of resources. \n10\n Without providing for those cases where the method of competition here involved would be unobjectionable, \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 439]\n\u00a0\n Massachusetts legislated against the practice, as early as 1901, by a statute (chapter 478) of general application. Its highest court, in applying the law which it held to be constitutional, described the prohibited method as 'unfair competition.' Commonwealth v. Strauss, 188 Mass. 229, 74 N. E. 308; Id., 191 Mass. 545, 78 N. E. 136, 11 L. R. A. (N. S.) 968, 6 Ann. Cas. 842. Compare People v. Duke, 19 Misc. Rep. 292, 44 N. Y. Supp. 336. The (Federal) Bureau of Corporations held the practice, which it described as 'full-line forcing' to be highly reprehensible. \n11\n Congress, by section 3 of the Clayton Act, specifically prohibited the practice in a limited field under certain circumstances. An injunction against the practice has been included in several decrees in favor of the government entered in cases under the Sherman Law. \n12\n In the decree by which the American Tobacco Company was disintegrated pursuant to the mandate of this court, each of the fourteen companies was enjoined from 'refusing to sell to any jobber any brand of any tobacco product manufactured by it, except upon condition that such jobber shall purchase from the vendor some other brand or product also manufactured and sold by it. ...' United States v. American Tobacco Co. (C. C.) 191 Fed. 371, 429. The practice here in question is merely one form of the so-called 'tying clauses' or 'conditional requirements' which have been declared in a discerning study of the whole subject to be 'perhaps the most interesting of any of the methods of unfair competition.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n The following facts found by the commission, and which the Circuit Court of Appeals held were supported by sufficient evidence, show that the conditions in the \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 440]\n\u00a0\n cotton tie and bagging trade were in 1918 such that the Federal Trade Commission could reasonably find that the tying clause here in question was an unfair method of competition: Dotton, America's chief staple, is marketed in bales. To bale cotton, steel ties and jute bagging are essential. The Carnegie Steel Company, a subsidiary of the United States Steel Corporation, manufactures so large a propertion of all such steel ties that it dominates the cotton tie situation in the United States and is able to fix and control the price of such ties throughout the counr y. The American Manufacturing Company manufactures about 45 per cent. of all bagging used for cotton baling; one other company about 20 per cent.; and the remaining 35 per cent. is made up of second hand bagging and a material called sugar-bag cloth. Warren, Jones & Gratz, of St. Louis, are the Carnegie Company's sole agents for selling and distributing steel ties. They are also the American Manufacturing Company's sole agents for selling and distributing jute bagging in the cotton-growing section west of the Mississippi. By virtue of their selling agency for the Carnegie Company, Warren, Jones & Gratz held a dominating and controlling position in the sale and distribution of cotton ties in the entire cottongrowing section of the country, and thereby it was in a position to force would-be purchasers of ties to also buy from them bagging manufactured by the American Manufacturing Company. A great many merchants, jobbers, and dealers in bagging and ties throughout the cotton-growing states were many times unable to procure ties from any other firm than Warren, Jones & Gratz. In many instances Warren, Jones & Gratz refused to sell ties unless the purchaser would also buy from them a corresponding amount of bagging, and such purchasers were oftentimes compelled to buy from them bagging manufactured by the American Manufacturing Company in order to procure a sufficient supply of steel ties. \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 441]\n\u00a0\n These are conditions closely resembling those under which 'full-line forcing,' 'exclusive-dealing requirements' of 'shutting off materials, supplies or machines from competitors'-well-known methods of competition, have been held to be unfair, when practiced by concern holding a preponderant position in the trade. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. The Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the order of the commission solely on the ground that it was without authority to determine the merits of specific individual grievances, and that the evidence did not support its finding that Warren, Jones & Gratz had--\n'adopted and practiced the policy of refusing to sell steel ties to those merchants and dealers who wished to buy from them unless such merchants and dealers would also buy from them a corresponding amount of jute bagging.'\n\n The reason assigned by the Circuit Court of Appeals for so holding was that the evidence failed to show that the practice complained of ( although acted on in individual cases by respondents) had become their 'general practice.' But the power of the Trade Commission to prohibit an unfair method of competition found to have been used is not limited to cases where the practice had become general. What section 5 declares unlawful is not unfair competition. That had been unlawful before. What that section made unlawful were 'unfair methods of competition'; that is, the method or means by which an unfair end might be accomplished. The commission was directed to act, if it had reason to believe that an 'unfair method of competition in commerce has been or is being used.' The purpose of Congress was to prevent any unfair method which may have been used by any concern in competition from becoming its general practice. It was only by stopping its use before it became a general practice, \n\n[253 U.S. 421, 442]\n\u00a0\n that the apprehended effect of an unfair method in suppressing competition by destroying rivals could be averted. As the Circuit Court of Appeals found that the evidence was sufficient to support the facts set forth above, and since on those facts the commission could reasonably hold that the method of competition in question was unfair under the circumstances, it had power under the act to issue the order complained of.\n In my opinion the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See Report Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, June 13, 1914, Sixty-Third Congress, Second Session, No. 597, p. 13:: 'It is believed that the term 'unfair competition' has a legal significance which can be enforced by the commission and the courts, and that it is no more difficult to determine what is unafir competition than it is to determine what is a reasonable rate or what is an unjust discrimination. The committee was of the opinion that it would be better to put in a general provision condemning unfair competition than to attempt to define the numerous unfair practices, such as local price cutting, interlocking directorates, and holding companies intended to restrain substantial competition.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Laws on Trusts and Monopolies, Compiled under direction of the Clerk of the House Committee on the Judiciary, Sixty-Third Congress, by Nathan B.

This contemplates even the regulation of prices. Others hold that private monopoly is intolerable, unscientific, and abnormal, but recognize that a commission is a necessary adjunct to the preservation of competition and to the practical enforcement of the law. ...\n\n'The commission which is proposed by your committee in the bill submitted is founded upon the latter purpose and idea. \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'Unfair Competition,' by William S.

Ripley (1907) p. x. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Senator Cummins, chairman of the committee which reported the bill, said (Cong. Rec. vol. 51, p. 11455):\n'Unfair competition must usually proceed to great lengths and be destructive of competition before it can be seized and denounced by the anti-trust law. In other cases it must be associated with, coupled with, other vicious and unlawful practices in order to bring the person or the corporation guilty of the practice within the scope of the anti-trust law. The purpose of this bill in this section and in other sections which I hope will be added to it, is to seize the offender before his ravages have gone to the length necessary in order to bring him within the law that we already have.\n\n'We knew little of these things in 1890. The commerce of the United States has largely developed in the last 25 years. The modern methods of carrying on business have been discovered and put into operation in the last quarter of a century; and as we have gone on under the anti-trust law under the decisions of the court in their effort to enforce that law, we have observed certain forms of industrial activity which ought to be prohibited whether in and of themselves they restrain trade or commerce or not. We have discovered that their tendency is evil; we have discovered that the end which is inevitably reached through these methods is an end which is destructive of fair commerce between the states. It is these considerations which, in my judgment, have made it wise, if not necessary to supplement the anti-trust law by additional legislation, not in antagonism to the anti-trust law, but in harmony with the anti-trust law, to more effectively put into the industrial life to America the principle of the anti-trust law, which is fair, reasonable competition, independence to the individual, and disassociation among the corporations. ... ' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] See Report Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, June 13, 1914, Sixty-Third Congress, Second Session, No. 597, p. 13: 'The committee gave careful consideration to the question as to whether it would attempt to define the many and variable unfair practices which prevail in commerce and to forbid their continuance or whether it would, by a general declaration condemning unfair practices, leave it to the commission to determine what practices were unfair. It concluded that the latter course would be the better. ...' See also 'Unfair Competition,' by W. H. S. Stevens (University of Chicago Press, 1916) pp. 1, 2.

DUBOIS ELECTRIC CO.(1920)\nNo. 300\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles Alvin Jones and M. W. Acheson, Jr., both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. W. C. Miller, of Clearfield, Pa., for respondent. \n\n[253 U.S. 212, 213]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action begun by Pancoast, to recover for personal injuries, and continued after his death by the petitioner as ancillary administrator. At a former trial the plaintiff had a verdict but it was set aside and a new trial ordered by the Cr cuit Court of Appeals. Du Bois Electric Co. v. Fidelity Title & Trust Co., 238 Fed. 129, 132, 151 C. C. A. 205, L. R. A. 1917C, 907. At the new trial the plaintiff again got a verdict and judgment, but the Circuit Court of Appeals set them aside, this time simply reversing the judgment without ordering a new trial. 253 Fed. 987, 165 C. C. A. 668. An opportunity was allowed to that Court to correct the error and as it was not corrected the present writ of certiorari was granted. \n249 U.S. 606\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 290; Id., \n249 U.S. 597\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 388. Of course if the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals was right on the merits a new trial should have been ordered. Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n228 U.S. 364\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 523, Ann. Cas. 1914D, 1029; Myers v. Pittsburgh Coal Co., \n233 \nU.S. 184, 189\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 559. But as it has been necessary to direct the record to be certified up, it is necessary also to consider the merits of the case and to determine whether the Circuit Court of Appeals was right with regard to them.\n Nothing turns upon the form of the pleadings. The evidence for the plaintiff was in conflict with that for the defendant upon important points, but we shall state the case as the jury might have found it to be if they believed the plaintiff's evidence, as the verdict shows they did. A member of a political party requested the defendant to suspend a political banner, which he furnished, across one of the principal streets in the borough of Dubois, between the Commercial Hotel and the Deposit National Bank. He asked the defendant to put it up, take it down after the election and attend to it for him, saying that he did not want to have anything to do with it. The defendant put up the banner, at first suspending it by a \n\n[253 U.S. 212, 214]\n\u00a0\n rope, but the rope breaking, substituted for it a wire cable of the defendant's, and, the plaintiff says, did so without further orders. This cable was fastened on the hotel side by taking two turns round a chimney and clamping the end. The chimney stood thirtyone inches from the edge of the cornice over the street, was twenty-one inches square at the base, and had a tin flashing from the roof inserted between the courses of brick two or three courses above the roof. According to the plaintiff's evidence the cable was attached above the flashing. The lower corners of the banner were attached to the buildings on their respective sides. Five days after the banner was suspended the man who employed the defendant caused it to string electric lights along the wire, not otherwise interfering with the work. The same day in the afternoon, the weather being stormy, the banner dragged the chimney over and a brick struck Pancoast on the head, making a comminuted fracture of the skull. The defendant put up the banner a third time after this fall, again, the plaintiff says, without further direction, and when the election was over took it down.\n If these were the facts, and, except with regard to the extent of the defendant's control, they could not be disputed, manifestly the verdict was warranted. It did not leave the defendant free from any duty to Pancoast and the other travelers in the street that they had no contract with it. An act of this kind that reasonable care would have shown to endanger life, might have made the actor guilty of manslaughter, if not, in an extreme case, of murder. Rigmaidon's Case, Lewin, 180.

The same considerations apply to civil liability for personal injuries from similar causes that would have been avoided by reasonable care. See Gray v. Boston Gas Light Co., 114 Mass. 149, 19 Am. Rep. 324. A man is not free to introduce a danger \n\n[253 U.S. 212, 215]\n\u00a0\n into public places even if he be under no contract with the persons subjected to the risk.\n It hardly is denied that there was evidence of negligence, but it ws held by the Circuit Court of Appeals that the defendant's relation to the work ceased when the banner was hung, that it had no further control over it and was not liable for what happened thereafter. Of course it is true that when the presence or absence of danger depends upon the subsequent conduct of the person to whom control is surrendered, the previous possessor may be exonerated when the control is changed. Curtin v. Somerset, 140 Pa. 70, 21 Atl. 244, 12 L. R. A. 322, 23 Am. St. Rep. 220; Murphey v. Caralli, 3 Hurlst. & Colt. 462; Thornton v. Dow, 60 Wash. 622, 111 Pac. 899, 32 L. R. A. (N.

But how far this principle will be carried may be uncertain. Union Stock Yards Co. v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n196 \nU.S. 217, 223\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 226, 2 Ann. Cas. 525. And when as here the danger had been called fully into existence by the defendant it could not escape liability for the result of conditions that it alone knew, had created and had arranged to have continue, by stepping out of the control a few days before the event came to pass. Harris v. James, 45 L. J., Q. B. 545; Todd v. Flight, 9 C. B. N. S. 377; Swords v. Edgar, 59 N. Y. 28, 17 Am. Rep. 295; Godley v. Hagerty, 20 Pa. 387, 59 Am. Dec. 731; Joyce v. Martin, 15 R. I. 558, 10 Atl. 620; Jackman v. Arlington Mills, 137 Mass. 277, 283; Dalay v. Savage, 145 Mass. 38, 41, 12 N. E. 841, 1 Am. St. Rep. 429; Clifford v. Atlantic Cotton Mills, 146 Mass. 47, 49, 15 N. E. 84, 4 Am. St. Rep. 279.\n But it could not be said as matter of law that the defendant had stepped out of control. The facts in their legal aspect probably were somewhat hazy. Presumably the tenant of the hotel simply permitted what was done and had no other relation to it than such as might be imposed upon his by the law. Evidently the defendant handled the banner when it wanted to, and no one else \n\n[253 U.S. 212, 216]\n\u00a0\n touched it. The defendant's employer if he told the truth not only did not intermeddle but might be found to have expressly required the defendant to take the responsibility. All the probabilities are that such control as there was remained with the defendant. The defendant got more than it was entitled to when the jury were instructed that even if the fall was due to negligence in putting up the banner, the defendant would not be liable unless by arrangement it had assumed a continuing duty to maintain the banner in a safe condition. The testimony on the two sides was contrasted and it was left to the jury to say which they would believe.\n As we have implied, we regard it as too plain for discussion that the plaintiff's evidence if believed warranted a finding that the defendant undertook the care of the banner while it was up. An effort is made to establish an error in allowing an amendment to the declaration after the statute of limitations had run. The declaration originally alleged negligence in the use of the chimney and that the fall was due to the use of the chimney as alleged. The amendment alleged also that defendant maintained the banner. If any objection is open it is enough to say that the original declaration was sufficient and that the amendment plainly left the cause of action unchanged.\n Judgment reversed.\n Judgment of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFIRST NAT BANK OF CANTON, PA v. WILLIAMS(1920)\nNo. 618\nArgued: March 3, 1920Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. John B. Stanchfield, of New York City, for appellant.\n Messrs. Solicitor General King and La Rue Brown, of Boston, Mass., for appellee.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 504, 508]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, whose place of business is within the Middle district of Pennsylvania, brought this suit in the United States District Court for that district, seeking an injunction to prevent John Skelton Williams, Comptroller of the Currency, from doing certain things under color of his office declared to be threatened, unlawful, arbitrary, and oppressive.\n The bill alleges that, in order to injure complainant's president, towards whom he entertained personal ill will, the Comptroller determined to destroy its business, and to that end he had maliciously persecuted and oppressed it for three years, in the following ways, among others: By often demanding special reports and information beyond the powers conferred upon him by law; by disclosing confidential and official information concerning it to banks, members of Congress, representatives of the press, and the public generally; by inciting litigation against it and its officers; by publishing and disseminating false statements, charging it with unlawful acts and improper conduct and reflecting upon its solvency; and by distributing to depositors, stockholders and others alarming statements intended to affect its credit, etc., etc.-and further that, unless restrained, he would continue these and similar malicious and oppressive practices.\n Williams is a citizen of Virginia, officially stationed at Washington. He was not summoned while in the Middle district of Penny lvania, but a subpoena was served upon him in Washington by the United States marshal. Having \n\n[252 U.S. 504, 509]\n\u00a0\n specially appeared, he successfully challenged the jurisdiction of the court; and the cause is here upon certificate to that effect.\n Generally, a District Court cannot acquire jurisdiction over an individual without service of process upon him while in the district for which it is held. But here a national bank seeks to enjoin the Comptroller, and the claim is that by statutory direction the proceeding must be had in the district where the association is located, and not elsewhere. The court below took the contrary view. 260 Fed. 674.\n Determination of the matter requires consideration of three sections of the Judicial Code.\n'Sec. 24. The District Courts shall have original jurisdiction as follows: ...\n\n'Sixteenth. Of all cases commenced by the United States, or by direction of any officer thereof, against any national banking association, and cases for winding up the affairs of any such bank; and of all suits brought by any banking association established in the district for which the court is held, under the provisions of title 'National Banks,' Revised Statutes, to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction, as provided by said title. And all national banking associations established under the laws of the United States shall, for the purposes of all other actions by or against them, real, personal, or mixed, and all suits in equity, be deemed citizens of the states in which they are respectively located.'\n\n'Sec. 49. All proceedings by any national banking association to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, under the provisions of any law relating to national banking associations, shall be had in the district where such association is located.'\n\n'Sec. 51. Except as provided in the five succeeding sections, no person shall be arrested in one district for trial \n\n[252 U.S. 504, 510]\n\u00a0\n in another, in any civil action before a District Court; and, except as provided in the six succeeding sections, no civil suit shall be brought in any district court against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant; but where the jurisdiction is founded only on the fact that the action is between citizens of different states, suit shall be brought only in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.'\n\n Comp. St.  991, 1031, 1033\n\n\n If sections 24 and 49 properly construed restrict this proceeding to the district where the bank is located, they displace section 51 pro tanto and authorize service of process upon defendant wherever found. United States v. Congress Construction Co., \n222 \nU.S. 199, 203\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 44.\n It is said for appellee that both sections 24 and 49 relate to injunction proceedings brought under the National Banking Law-such proceedings as are thereby expressly authorized and no others. And further that such law only authorizes suit by a bank to enjoin the Comptroller when he undertakes to act because of its alleged refusal to redeem circulating notes. R. S.  5237 (Comp. St.  9824).\n The Act of February 25, 1863, establishing national banks (12 Stats. 665, 681, c. 58):\n'Sec. 59. And be it further enacted, that suits, actions, and proceedings by and against any association under this act may be had in any circuit, district, or territorial court of the United States held within the district in which such assocaition may be established.'\n\n An act to provide a national currency, secured by a pledge of United States bonds, approved June 3, 1864 (13 Stats. 99, 116, c. 106):\n'Sec. 57. And be it further enacted, that suits, actions and proceedings, against any association under this act, may be had in any circuit, district, or territorial court of the United States held within the district in which such association may be established; or in any state, county, or \n\n[252 U.S. 504, 511]\n\u00a0\n municipal court int he county or city in which said association is located, having jurisdiction in similar cases: Provided, however, that all proceedings to enjoin the Comptroller under this act shall be had in a circuit, district, or territorial court of the United States, held in the district in which the association is located.'\n\n In Kennedy v. Gibson (1869), 8 Wall. 498, 506 (19 L. Ed. 476) this court ruled that section 57 should be construed as if it read: 'And be it further enacted, that suits, actions and proceedings by and against,' etc., the words 'by and' having been accidentally omitted. 'It is not to be supposed that Congress intended to exclude the associations from suing in the courts where they can be sued.' 'Such suits may still be brought by the associations in the courts of the United States.' And it further held 'that receivers also may sue in the courts of the United States by virtue of the act, without reference to the locality of their personal citizenship.'\n The Revised Statutes:\n'Sec. 629. The Circuit Courts shall have original jurisdiction as follows: ...\n\n'Tenth. Of all suits by or against any banking association established in the district for which the court is held, under any law providing for national banking associations.\n\n'Eleventh. Of all suits brought by (or against) any banking association established in the district for which the court is held, under the provisions of title 'The National Banks,' to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, or any receiver acting under his direction, as provided by said title.'\n\n'Sec. 736. All proceedings by any national banking association to enjoin the Comptroller of the Currency, under the provisions of any law relating to national banking associations, shall be had in the district where such association is located.'\n\n Parts of the foregoing subsections 10 and 11 were \n\n[252 U.S. 504, 512]\n\u00a0\n joined in subsection 16,  24, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  991), and section 736 became section 49, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1031).\n What constitutes a cause arising 'under' the laws of the United States has been often pointed out by this court. One does so arise where an appropriate statement by the plaintiff, unaided by any anticipation or avoidance of defenses, discloses that it really and substantially involves a dispute or controversy respecting the validity, construction or effect of an act of Congress. If the plaintiff thus asserts a right which will be sustained by one construction of the law, or defeated by another, the case is one arising under that law. Tennessee v. Union & Planters' Bank, \n152 U.S. 454\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 654; Boston & Montana Mining Co. v. Montana Ore Purchasing Co., \n188 U.S. 632\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 434; Devine v. Los Angeles, \n202 U.S. 313\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 652; Taylor v. Anderson, \n234 U.S. 74\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 724; Hopkins v. Walker, \n244 \nU.S. 486, 489\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 711. Clearly the plaintiff's bill discloses a case wherein his right to recover turns on the construction and application of the National Banking Law; and we think the proceeding is one to enjoin the Comptroller under provisions of that law within the true intendment of the Judicial Code.\n The decree below must be\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFORGED STEEL WHEEL CO. v. LEWELLYN(1920)\nNo. 526\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs.\n George B. Gordon, of Pittsburgh, Pa., and George Sutherland, of Salt Lake City, Utah, for petitioner.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for respondent. \n\n[251 U.S. 511, 512]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action brought by petitioner against Lewellyn, Collector of Internal Revenue in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, to recover the sum of $246,920.18 exacted from petitioner as a tax under the Munitions Tax Act, and paid under protest. Interest was also prayed from November 27, 1917\n\n\n The tax was exacted upon the ground (and it was so alleged) that that sum was the tax on the amount of the net profits received by petitioner from the manufacture and sale of certain steel forgings used in the manufacture of shells.\n The circumstances said to show the tax to have been illegally exacted were detailed, of which there was denial by the collector, and upon issues thus formed the case was tried to a jury, which, in submission to the instructions of the court, returned a verdict for petitioner for the amount prayed. Judgment upon the verdict for the sum of $263,258.06 was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n The Court of Appeals considered in one opinion this case and Carbon Steel Co. v. Lewellyn and Worth Bros. Co. v. Lederer, 258 Fed. 533. The last two cases we have just decided (\n251 U.S. 501\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 283, 64 L. Ed. --; \n251 U.S. 507\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 282, 64 L. Ed. --), and we can immediately say that, if this case does not differ from them in its facts, it does not in principle. It will turn, as they did, upon the construction of section 301 of the Munitions Tax Act (39 Stat. 756, 781 [Comp. St.  6336 1\/4 b]) which imposes upon 'every person manufacturing ... shells ... \n\n[251 U.S. 511, 513]\n\u00a0\n or any part' [italics ours] of them, a tax of 12 1\/2 per cent. for each taxable year upon the entire net profits received or accrued for such years from the sale or disposition of the shells manufactured in the United States. The contention in the Worth Case was explicitly, as it is in this case, that the words 'any part,' as used in the act, 'mean a substantially finished part'-a part, as there said, which has relation 'to the whole structure and to the purpose it is intended to subserve.' Here it is said:\n'The fundamental idea of a manufactured article is that it must be so nearly completed as to be serviceable for the purpose for which it was designed.'\n\n The reasoning of the Worth Case, covers, therefore, the contention here, and rejects it, if, as we have said, the facts be the same, and we think they are. There are some circumstances of complexity, but they are easily resolved and do not disturb the principle of decision. Of the facts the Court of Appeals said:\n'From the proofs it appears the British government made contracts with certain persons whereby the latter agreed to supply it with high explosive shells in compliance with the specifications, requirement, and inspection of the said government. To fulfill such shell contract the contractor made subcontracts with the Forged Steel Wheel Company, by which the latter agreed to manufacture and furnish to said contractor, rough steel sheel forgins of the character provided in the contract, as to chemical constituents, tensile strength, size, shape, etc. To fulfill its contract, the Forged Steel Wheel Company either made, had made, or bought in the market, the grade of steel required. This steel was of a common commercial type known as rounds. These rounds in nicked and broke into eighteen-inch lengths, which it then heated and put through two forging processes, by the first of which a holde was pierced from one end of the round to within two inches of the other; by the second, the round was lengthened by drawing \n\n[251 U.S. 511, 514]\n\u00a0\n it through three successive rings of a hydraulic press. The output of the Forged Steel Wheel Company's work was a hollow steel body or shell form, of suitable composition, shape, and length, from which to make, to the British government standards, the high explosive projectiles contracted for. The weight of such shell forms was about 170 pounds. To make this shell form suitable for use as a shell the contractor to whom the Forged Steel Wheel Company then delivered it was required to dress, bore, and machine it down to 77 pounds; this required some 27 distinct and separate processes.'\n\n The court, after further comment on the facts, and consideration of the opinion of the District Court and its reasoning, and distinguishing the cases that influenced the District Court, said:\n'But in the excise law in question Congress is dealing with the imposing of taxes as the main object, and with the work done as a mere incident to aid in determining the tax. In that aspect the quantum of the work done is immaterial.'\n\n And again:\n'The crucial question is not the quantum of the manfacture measured by steps, but the fact of manufacture resulting in profits.'\n\n Replying to the contention that the purpose of Congress was not to tax any one but the manufacturer of a completed shell or the maker of a completed part of a shell, and that the forging of the Whell Company was not a completed part of a shell, the Court of Appeals said:\n'It is manifest that, standing alone, the statute neither expresses nor implies any warrant or implication for limiting the broad, inclusive, generic words 'any part' to the restricted, specific, qualified term 'any completed part.\"\n\n The Court of Appeals also considered the rule of construction that statutes levying taxes should not be extended by implication beyond the clear import of their language and the cases from which the rule was deduced. The rule was conceded; its application to the present controversy was denied. \n\n[251 U.S. 511, 515]\n\u00a0\n For the sake of brevity we consider only the cited decisions of this court. They are Tide Water Oil Co. v. United States, \n171 \nU.S. 210, 218\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 837; Worthington v. Robbins, \n139 U.S. 337\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 581; Anheuser-Busch Association v. United States, \n207 U.S. 556\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 204. These were customs cases, and the statutes were given an interpretation on account of their purpose. They are, besides, not in point. In the first one the statute had the words 'wholly manufactured,' and, giving effect to them, it was decided that boxes made from shooks imported from Canada, though nailed together and the sides of the boxes thus formed trimmed in the United States, were not boxes 'wholly manufactured' in the United States, and entitled, upon being exported, to a drawback under a statute which allowed a drawback on articles 'wholly manufactured of materials imported.' The Worthington Case was cited. In that case a duty was exacted upon 'white hard enamel' under a statute which imposed a duty of 25 per cent. upon 'watches, watch cases, watch movements, parts of watches and watch materials.' This on the contention of the government that the enamel fell under the head of 'watch materials.' The contention was rejected; it being conceded that the enamel was used for many other purposes than for watch faces. In the Anheuser- Busch Case a claim of drawback upon corks exported with bottled beer was rejet ed. The ground of the claim was that the corks were subjected to a special treatment to be fit for use, and hence it was contended that they should be regarded as 'imported materials ... used in the manufacture of articles manufactured or produced in the United States'-that is, the bottled beer. We replied 'a cork put through the claimant's process is still a cork.' The cases, therefore, do not sustain the contention for which they are cited.\n Objection is made to the action of the Circuit Court of Appeals in simply reversing the judgment of the District Court and not remanding the case for a new trial. There \n\n[251 U.S. 511, 516]\n\u00a0\n was no objection made to that action and no request for a remand of the case, and besides there was nothing to retry. The case involves only propositions of law.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER dissent. \n\n\n\n","52":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFORT SMITH & W R. CO. v. MILLS(1920)\nNo. 42\nArgued: December 13, 1917Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. A. C. Dustin and C. M. Horn, both of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellants.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a bill in equity brought by the Fort Smith and Western Railroad Company and the trustee of a mortgage given to secure bonds of that road, to enjoin the receiver of the road from conforming to the Act of September 3, 5, 1916, c. 436; 39 Stat. 721 (Comp. St.  8680a-8680d), in respect of hours of service and wages, and to enjoin the District Attorney of the United States from proceeding to enforce the Act. The bill alleges \n\n[253 U.S. 206, 207]\n\u00a0\n that the physical property is worth over $7,000,000, but that no dividends ever have been paid upon the stock, that no interest has been paid upon the bonds since October 1, 1907, and that there is a yearly deficit in the earnings of the road. The receiver was appointed in proceedings to foreclose the mortgage. The bill further alleges that the railroad now ( 1917) is being carried on under an agreement with the men which the men desire to keep, but that the receiver, yielding to the threats of the District Attorney to prosecute him unless he does so, purposes to substitute the much more onerous terms of the Act. It is set up that the Act if construed to apply to this case is void under the Fift Amendment to the Constitution. The bill was dismissed by the District Court, on motion, for want of equity, and the plaintiffs appealed.\n The Act in question, known as the Adamson Law, was passed to meet the emergency created by the threat of a general railroad strike. It fixed eight hours as a day's work and provided that for some months, pending an investigation, the compensation of employees of railroads subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce should not be 'reduced below the present standard day's wage,' and that time in excess of eight hours should be paid for pro rata at the same rate. The time has expired long since but the rights of the parties require a decision of the case.\n In Wilson v. New, \n243 U.S. 332\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 298, L. R. A. 1017E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024, it was decided that the Act was within the constitutional power of Congress to regulate commerce among the States; that since, by virtue of the organic interdependence of different parts of the Union, not only comfort but life would be endangered on a large scale if interstate railroad traffic suddenly stopped, Congress could meet the danger of such a stoppage by legislation, and that, in view of the public interest, the mere fact that it required an expenditure to tide the country over the trouble would not of itself alone show a taking of property without due process of law. It was \n\n[253 U.S. 206, 208]\n\u00a0\n held that these principles applied no less when the emergency was caused by the combined action of men than when it was due to a catastrophe of nature; and that the expenditure required was not necessarily unconstitutional because it took the form of requiring the railroad to pay more, as it might have required the men to take less, during the short time necessary for an investigation ordered by the law.\n But the bill in Wilson v. New raised only the general objections to the Act that were common to every railroad. In that case it was not necessary to consider to what extremes the law might be carried or what were its constitutional limits. It was not decided, for instance, that Congress could or did require a railroad to continue in business at a loss. See Brooks-Scanlon Co. v. Railroad Commission of Louisiana, \n251 U.S. 396\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 183, 64 L. Ed. --. It was not decided that there might not be circumstances to which the Act could not be applied consistently with the Fifth Amendment, or that the Act in spite of its universal language must be construed to reach literally every carrier by railroad subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce. It is true that the first section of the statute purports to apply to any such carrier, and the third to the compensation of railway employees subject to this Act. But the statute avowedly was enacted in haste to meet an emergency, and the general language necessary to satisfy the demands of the men need not be taken to go further than the emergency required or to have been intended to make trouble rather than to allay it. We cannot suppose that it was meant to forbid work being done at a less price than the rates laid down, when both parties to the bargain wished to go on as before and when the circumstances of the road were so exceptional that the lower compensation accepted would not affect the market for labor upon other roads.\n But that is the present case. An insolvent road had succeeded in making satisfactory terms with its men, \n\n[253 U.S. 206, 209]\n\u00a0\n enabling it to go on, barely paying its way, if it did so, not without impairing even the mortgage security, not to speak of its capital. We must accept the allegations of the bill and must assume that the men were not merely negatively refraining from demands under the Act but, presumably appreciating the situation, desired to keep on as they were. To break up such a bargain would be at least unjust and impolitic and not at all within the ends that the Adamson Law had in view. We think it reasonable to assume that the circumstances in which, and the purposes for which the law was passed import an exception n a case like this.\n Decree reversed.\n Mr. Justice DAY, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS agree with this decision limiting the effect of the Adamson Law as stated, but adhere to the views concerning the constitutionality of the Act expressed by them in Wilson v. New. \n\n\n\n","53":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFORT SMITH LUMBER CO. v. STATE OF ARKANSAS EX REL ARBUCKLE(1920)\nNo. 394\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 532, 533]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Joseph M. Hill and Henry L. Fitzhugh, both of Ft. Smith, Ark., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. John D. Arbuckle and George Vaughan, both of Little Rock, Ark ., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the State of Arkansas against the plaintiff in error, a corporation of the State, to recover back taxes alleged to be due upon a proper valuation of its capital stock. The corporation owned stock in two other corporations of the State each of which paid full taxes and it contended that it was entitled to omit the value of such stock from the valuation of its own. This omission is the matter in dispute. The corporation defendso n the ground that individuals are not taxed for such stock or subject to suit for back taxes, and that the taxation is double, setting up the Fourteenth Amendment. The case was heard on demurrer to the answer and agreed facts, and the statute levying the tax was sustained by the Supreme Court of the State.\n The objection to the taxation as double may be laid on one side. That is a matter of State law alone. The Fourteenth Amendment no more forbids double taxation that it does doubling the amount of a tax; short of confiscation or proceedings unconstitutional on other grounds. Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 106; Tennessee v. Whitworth, \n117 \nU.S. 129, 136\n, 137 S., 6 Sup. Ct. 645; St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 367\n, 368 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 99. We are of opinion that it also is within the power of a State, so far as the Constitution of the United States is concernied, to tax its own corporations in respect of the stock held by them \n\n[251 U.S. 532, 534]\n\u00a0\n in other domestic corporations, although unincorporated stockholders are exempt. A State may have a policy in taxation. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59, 63\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 192. If the State of Arkansas wished to discourage but not to forbid the holding of stock in one corporation by another and sought to attain the result by this tax, or if it simply saw fit to make corporations pay for the privilege, there would be nothing in the Constitution to hinder. A discrimination between corporations and individuals with regard to a tax like this cannot be pronounced arbitrary, although we may not know the precise ground of policy that led the State to insert the distinction in the law.\n The same is true with regard to confining the recovery of back taxes to those due from corporations. It is to be presumed, until the contrary appears, that there were reasons for more strenuous efforts to collect admitted dues from corporations than in other cases, and we cannot pronounce it an unlawful policy on the part of the State. See New York ex rel. New York Clearing House Building Co. v. Barker, \n179 \nU.S. 279, 283\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 121. We have nothing to do with the supposed limitations upon the power of the State Legislature in the Constitution of the State. Those must be taken to be disposed of by the decisions of the State Court. As this case properly comes here by writ of error, an application for a writ of certiorari that was presented as a precaution will be denied.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice DAY, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissent. \n\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGALVESTON, H & S A R. CO. v. WOODBURY(1920)\nNo. 100\nArgued: Decided: December 13, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. T. J. Beall, of El Paso, Tex., for petitioner.\n Mr. Rufus B. Daniel, of El Paso, Tex., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On March 14, 1917, Mrs. Woodbury took the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway at San Antonio, \n\n[254 U.S. 357, 358]\n\u00a0\n Tex., for El Paso, Tex., and checked her trunk, which she took with her. It was lost and she sued the company in a state district court for the value of trunk and contents, which the jury found to be $500. Mrs. Woodbury was traveling on a coupon ticket purchased at Timmins, Ontario, from a Canadian railroad, entitling her to travel over it and connecting lines, from Timmins to El Paso and return, apparently with stop-over privileges. When the trunk was lost she was on her journey out. She was not told, when she purchased her ticket or when she checked her trunk, that there was any limitation upon the amount of the carrier's liability. It did not appear whether the ticket purchased contained notice of any such limitation, nor did it appear what was the law of Canada in this respect. The company insisted that Mrs. Woodbury was on an interstate journey, and that under the Act to Regulate Commerce (Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, as amended [Comp. St.  8563 et seq.]), it was not liable for more than $100, since it had duly filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and published a tariff limiting liability to that amount unless the passenger declared a higher value and paid excess charges, which Mrs. Woodbury had not done. She insisted that her transportation was not subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce, because it began in a foreign country, and that the liability was governed by the law of Canada, which should, in the absence of evidence, be assumed to be like the law of Texas, the forum, and that by the law of Texas the limitation of liability was invalid. The trial court held that she was entitled to recover only $100, and entered judgment for that amount. This judgment was reversed by the Court of Civil Appeals, which entered judgment for Mrs. Woodbury in the sum of $500. 209 S. W. 432. The case came here on writ of certiorari. \n250 U.S. 637\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 493. The only question before us is the amount of damages recoverable.\n If Mrs. Woodbury's journey had started in New York, \n\n[254 U.S. 357, 359]\n\u00a0\n instead of across the border in Canada, the provision in the published tariff would clearly have limited the liability of the carrier to $100; for her journey would have been interstate, although the particular stage of it on which the trunk was lost lay wholly within the state of Texas. Compare Texas & New Orleans Railroad Co. v. Sabine Tramway Co., \n227 U.S. 111\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 229. And the Carmack Amendment (Comp. St .  8604a, 8604aa), under which carriers may limit liability by published tariff, applies to the baggage of a passenger carried in interstate commerce (Boston & Maine Railroad Co. v. Hooker, \n233 U.S. 97\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 526, L. R. A. 1915B, 450 Ann. Cas. 1915D, 593), although it does not deal with liability for personal injuries suffered by the passenger (Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Maucher, \n248 U.S. 359\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 108). The subsequent legislation, the Cummins Amendment (Act March 4, 1915, c. 176, 38 Stat. 1196), as amended by the Act of August 9, 1916, c. 301, 39 Stat. 441 (Comp. St.  8592, 8604a), has not altered the rule regarding liability for baggage.\n But counsel for Mrs. Woodbury insists that solely because her journey originated in Canada the provisions of the Act to Regulate Commerce do not apply. The contention is that section 1 of the act of 1887 does not apply to the transportation of passengers from a foreign country to a point in the United States. To this there are two answers. The first is that the transportation here in question is not that of a passenger, but of property. Boston & Maine Railroad Co. v. Hooker, supra. The second is that the act does apply to the transportation of both passengers and property from an adjacent foreign country, such as Canada. Section 1 declares that the act applies to 'any common carrier ... engaged in the transportation of passengers or property ... from any place in the United States to an adjacent foreign country.' A carrier engaged in transportation by rail to an adjacent foreign country is, at least ordinarily, engaged in transportation also from that country to the United States. The test of the application of the act is not the direction of the movement, but \n\n[254 U.S. 357, 360]\n\u00a0\n the nature of the transportation as determined by the field of the carriers' operation. This is the construction placed upon the act by the Interstate Commerce Commission. International Paper Co. v. D. & H. Co., 33 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 270, 273, citing T. & P. Ry. Co. v. I. C. C., \n162 U.S. 197\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 666. It is in harmony with that placed upon the words of section 1 of the Harter Act (Act Feb. 13, 1893, c. 105, 27 Stat. 445 [Comp. St.  8029]), 'any vessel transporting merchandise or property from or between ports of the United States and foreign ports,' which in Knott v. Botany Mills, \n179 \nU.S. 69, 75\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 30, were construed to include vessels bringing cargoes from foreign ports to the United States. There is a later clause in section 1 which deals specifically with the transportation of property to or from foreign countries; but cases arising under that clause are not applicable here. That clause applies where the foreign country is not adjacent to the United States. The cases which hold that the act does not govern shipments from a foreign country in bond through the United States to another place in a foreign country, whether adjacent or not, are also not in point. Compare United States v. Philadelphia & Reading Ry. Co. (D. C.) 188 Fed. 484; In the Matter of Bills of Lading, 52 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 671, 726- 729; M. Canales v. Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway Co., 37 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 573.\n Since the transportation here in question was subject to the Act to Regulate Commerce, both carrier and passenger were bound by the provisions of the published tariffs. As these limited the recovery for baggage carried to $100, in the absence of a declaration of higher value and the payment of an excess charge, and as no such declaration was made and excess charge paid, that sum only was recoverable.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGAYON v. MCCARTHY(1920)\nNo. 540\nArgued: January 6, 1920Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Wm. S. Bennet, of New York City, for appellant and plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart, for appellee and defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, Gayon, was indicted in the Southern district of Texas for conspiring (section 37 of the Criminal Code [Comp. St.  10201]) with one Naranjo, of San Antonio, Texas, and with one Mendoza, of Laredo, Texas, about January 1, 1919, to hire and retain Foster Averitt, a citizen of the United States, to go to Mexico, there to enlist in military forces organized in the interest of Felix Diaz, then in revolt against the government of Mexico, with which the United \n\n[252 U.S. 171, 172]\n\u00a0\n States was at peace, in violation of section 10 of the Criminal Code, as amended May 7, 1917, 40 Stat. 39, chapter 11 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10174).\n Gayon was arrested in New York, and, after a full hearing before a commissioner of the United States, was held subject to the order of the District Court for his removal to Texas.\n Thereupon, by petition for writs of habeas corpus and certiorari, the case was removed to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, and, upon a hearing on a transcript of the evidence before the commissioner, that court discharged the writ of habeas corpus and entered an order that a warrant issue for the removal of the appellant to Texas. An appeal brings this order here for review.\n The principles and practice applicable to this case are abundantly settled. Greene v. Henkel, \n183 \nU.S. 249, 261\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 218; Beavers v. Haubert, \n198 U.S. 77\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 605; Hyde v. Shine, \n199 \nU.S. 62, 84\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 760; Tinsley v. Treat, \n205 U.S. 20\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 430; Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 475\n, 30 S.

Ct. 54.\n Of many errors assigned only two are argued, viz: That the court erred in holding: (1) That the acts committed by the appellant 'of which there was any evidence before the commissioner' constituted a crime under section 10 of the Penal Code, and (2) that the evidence before the commissioner showed probable cause for believing the defendant guilty of the crime charged in the indictment.\n By these assignments of error the correct rule of decision is recognized, that if there was before the commissioner or District Court evidence showing probable cause for believing the defendant guilty of having conspired with Naranjo or Mendoza, when either was in the Southern district of Texas, to hire or retain Averitt to go to Mexico to enlist in the insurgent forces operating under General Diaz against the Mexican government, the order of the District Court must be affirmed. \n\n[252 U.S. 171, 173]\n\u00a0\n The evidence before the commissioner, carried to the District Court, may be summarized as follows:\n The government introduced the indictment and, with the admission by Gayon that he was the person named therein, rested. This established a prima facie case in the absence of other evidence. Tinsley v. Treat, \n205 \nU.S. 20, 31\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 430, and cases cited.\n Thereupon the testimony of the accused and of one Del Villar was introduced by appellant, and that of Averitt by the government, which we condense into narrative form:\n For five years before the arrest, Del Villar, a political exile from Mexico, had maintained offices in New York, from which he had conducted a systematic propaganda in the interest of Felix Diaz and against the Mexican government.\n The accused, Gayon, is a Mexican citizen, and during several administrations prior to that of Carranza had served as consul for the Mexican government at Roma, Texas, and at other places within and without the United States. For about two years he had been secretary to Del Villar and for some time prior to his arrest was in the joint service and pay of Del Villar and General Aurelio Blanquet, the latter then in Mexico serving with the forces of Diaz.\n Naranjo was editor and publisher of a newspaper at San Antonio, Texas, called 'Revista Mexicana' (Mexican Review), which was opposed to the established Mexican government and favorable to the revolutionists operating in the interest of Diaz.\n On December 12, 1918, Gayon wrote from New York to Naranjo at San Antonio to secure an advertisement in the Review for 'my work 'El General Blanquet,\" saying, 'There are some reasons that you may know in the next few days why I want a big circulation of the book,' asking if he might send some copies to be sold at the newspaper \n\n[252 U.S. 171, 174]\n\u00a0\n office, and concluding, 'I will await your letters hoping to give you good news in my next letter.'\n On December 23, 1918, Gayon wrote Naranjo, addressing him as 'My dear Friend,' and saying that he had received his letter of the 18th instant. In this letter a discussion of the sale of his book 'El General Blanquet' is followed by comment on the activities of other persons, in which he discourages new projects and urges joining 'with the National Union Committees,' which he states had already passed the embryonic state and now constitute a reality. He concludes:\n'God grant us, now that we are on the threshold of success, we may leave aside our obstinate custom of projecting, and go ahead to produce results exclusively.'\n\n On January 14, and again on January 21, 1919, he addressed Naranjo as 'My dear Friend' and discussed further advertising and circulating of his book.\n This correspondence makes it clear enough that Gayon, although in New York, in December, 1918, and January, 1919, was in close association with Naranjo, and that the two were actively engaged in promoting opposition to the established Mexican government.\n On January 5, 1919, Foster Averitt, an American citizen, whose home was in Texas, called at the office of Gayon, and what passed between them is derived from the testimony of the two, as follows:\n Averitt had recently resigned from the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis and, being without employment, says that he called at the office of Gayon, for the purpose of securing, if possible, a position in Mexico or Central America as an engineer. He was wearing his uniform as midshipman of the United States Navy and he first showed Gayon some official papers, which the latter did not read, and then said that he was of the United States Navy, and that he must go at once Mexico to see Generals Diaz and Blanquet personally. He did not give \n\n[252 U.S. 171, 175]\n\u00a0\n any reason for desiring to see these men but asked for letters of introduction to them, which Gayon refused until he could confer with Del Villar. Averitt returned the next day and, after discussing with Gayon conditions in Mexico, the location of the several armed forces near the border, and whether he should go by sea to Vera Cruz or overland, he again left for the day. On returning the next day he received from Gayon two letters, one addressed to Naranjo, at San Antonio, and one to 'General Aurelio Blanquet, General Headquarters, Mexico.'\n Gayon had no knowledge of or acquaintance with Averitt before his first call at his office and he did not present any letters of introduction, but in the letter to Naranjo Gayon introduced him as 'undertaking a trip to Mexico on special mission to General Felix Diaz and Aurelio Blanquet,' and requested that he 'supply him the necessary information to enable him to make his trip as quickly as possible.'\n The letter which he gave to Averitt addressed to General Blanquet opens with this paragraph:\n'The bearer, Mr. Foster Averitt, Marine Guard of the United States, will inform you about the reasons for his trip and of the work we are undertaking here. I kindly request from you, after meeting Mr. Foster [ sic], to be good enough to introduce him to General Felix Diaz, as he wants to take up some matters with both of you.'\n\n The remainder of the letter explains how he had given publicity to 'the recent successful arrival' of the general in Mexico and the motives inspiring the movement of reorganization under the leadership of General Diaz. It predicts early recognition by our government of the belligerency of the Diaz insurgents and urges the general to write as often as possible to enable 'us to continue our campaign of propaganda.'\n Supplied with these letters, Averitt straightway went to San Antonio and presented his letter to Naranjo, who, \n\n[252 U.S. 171, 176]\n\u00a0\n after some conferences with him, gave him a letter to General Santiago Mendoza, at Laredo, on the border. This letter was presented to Mendoza and through him arrangements were made for Averitt's crossing into Mexico with two or three others, but they were arrested by customs guards and the proceedings we are considering followed.\n In the interviews in New York there was suggestion of payment of expenses and a commission for Averitt, but Gayon, saying that the furnishing of either would violate the noutrality laws of the United States, told him there would be no difficulty in his getting a commission from General Blanquet on his arrival in Mexico and the last thing he said to him when leaving was 'that he expected that he should be at least a colonel when he saw him again down there.' He told him it might be possible to have his expenses made up to him when he arrived in Mexico, and, as a matter of fact, he received $15 from General Mendoza at Laredo.\n The statute which Gayon is charged with violating provides:\n'That whoever within the territory or jurisdiction of the United States ... hires or retains another ... to go beyond the limits or jurisdiction of the United States with intent to be enlisted ... in the service of another foreign ... people' shall be punished as provided.\n\n And the overt acts charged in the indictment are: That Gayon delivered to Averitt at New York a letter addressed to Naranjo, and at the same time gave him instructions with respect to presenting it and impliedly promised Averitt that upon his arrival in Mexico he would be given a commission in the army of General Blanquet; that at the same time he delivered to Averitt a letter addressed to General Blanquet, who was then in Mexico in command of revolutionary forces; that Averitt visited and held conferences with Naranjo, who gave him a letter to Mendoza, at Laredo, in the Southern district of \n\n[252 U.S. 171, 177]\n\u00a0\n Texas; and that Averitt, under instructions received from Naranjo, called upon and conferred with Mendoza at Laredo and with him arranged to enter Mexico with others, with intent to join the forces of Diaz under General Blanquet.\n While the narration of what took place between Gayon and Averitt does not show a hiring of the latter in the ordinary sense of the word, yet, when taken with the conduct of Averitt in going immediately to Texas, and in attempting to cross into Mexico, plainly, it tends to show that Gayon retained Averitt in the sense of engaging him to go to Mexico, that he was induced to enter into that engagement by the promise that he would be given a commission in the forces of Diaz when he arrived there and that he would probably be reimbursed for his expenses.\n There was also evidence tending to show that by communication and concerted action between Gayon, Naranjo and Mendoza, Averitt was induced to go from New York to the border and would have succeeded in reaching Mexico and joining the insurgent forces but for the vigilance of the United States officers who arrested him. The evidence also is that Mendoza conferred with Averitt and acted in promotion of the conspiracy when in the Southern district of Texas, thus establishing the jurisdiction of the court to which the indictment was returned, under Hyde and Schneider v. United States, \n225 U.S. 347\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 793, Ann. Cas. 1914A, 614, and Brown v. Elliott and Moore v. Elliott, \n225 U.S. 392\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 812\n\n\n The word 'retain' is used in the statute as an alternative to 'hire' and means something different from the usual employment with payment in money. One may be retained, in the sense of engaged, to render a service as effectively by a verbal as by a written promise, by a prospect for advancement or payment in the future as by the immediate payment of cash. As stated long ago by a noted Attorney General, in an opinion dealing with this statute:\n\n\n[252 U.S. 171, 178]\n\u00a0\n 'A party may be retained by verbal promise or invitation for a declared or known purpose. If such a statute could be evaded or set at naught by elaborate contrivances to engage without enlisting, to retain without hire, to invite without recruiting, ... it would be idle to pass acts of Congress for the punishment of this or any other offenses.' Opinions of the Attorney General, vol. 7, pp. 367, 378, 379.\n This discussion of the record makes it sufficiently clear that there was substantial evidence before the commissioner and the court tending to show that section 10 of the Criminal Code had been violated and that there were was probable cause for believing the appellant guilty of conspiring with Naranjo and Mendoza to compass that violation, as charged in the indictment, and therefore the order of the District Court must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGILBERT v. STATE OF MINN.(1920)\nNo. 79\nArgued: November 10, 1920Decided: December 13, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 325, 326]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Nordlin and Frederick A. Pike, both of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. James E. Markham, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Clifford L. Hilton, Atty. Gen., for State of Minnesota.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Minnesota makes it unlawful 'to interfere with or discourage the enlistment of men in the military or naval forces of the United States or of the state of Minnesota.'\n Its second and third sections are as follows:\n'Sec. 2. Speaking by Word of Mouth against Enlistment Unlawful.-It shall be unlawful for any person in any public place, or at any meeting where more than five persons are assembled, to advocate or teach by word of mouth or otherwise that men should not enlist in the military or naval forces of the United States or the state of Minnesota.\n\n'Sec. 3. Teaching or Advocating by Written or Printed Matter against Enlistment Unlawful.\n\n -It shall be unlawful \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 327]\n\u00a0\n for any person to teach or advocate by any written or printed matter whatsoever, or by oral speech, that the citizens of this state should not aid or assist the United States in prosecuting or carrying on war with the public enemies of the United States.'\n Section 4 defines a citizen to be 'any person within the confines of the state,' and section 5 declares violations of the act to be gross misdemeanors and punishable by fine and imprisonment. (Gen. St. Supp. 1917 ,  8521-2 to 8521-5).\n The indictment charged that Gilbert at a time and place designated in the state, and under the conditions prohibited by section 2, the United States being then and there at war with the kingdom and imperial government of Germany, used the following language:\n'We are going over to Europe to make the world safe for democracy, but I tell you we had better make America safe for democracy first. You say, what is the matter with our democracy? I tell you what is the matter with it: Have you had anything to say as to who should be President? Have you had anything to say as to who should be Governor of this state? Have you had anything to say as to whether we would go into this war? You know you have not. If this is such a good democracy, for Heaven's sake why should we not vote on conscription of men? We were stampeded into this war by newspaper rot to pull England's chestnuts out of the fire for her. I tell you if they conscripted wealth like they have conscripted men, this war would not last over forty-eight hours, ...'\n\n A demurrer to the indictment was overruled, and Gilbert was tried and convicted. The judgment was that he pay a fine of $500 and be imprisoned in the county jail of the county of Goodhue for one year, and pay the costs of the prosecution. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state.\n The statute, it is contended, is repugnant to the Constitution of the United States in that: (1) 'All power of legislation \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 328]\n\u00a0\n regarding the subject-matter contained in the statute is conferred upon Congress and withheld from the states.' (2) And that the statute is obnoxious to the 'inherent right of free speech respecting the concerns, activities and interests of the United States of America and its government.'\n We shall consider the objections in their order. It is said in support of the exclusive power in Congress, that Congress alone can under the Constitution \"provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States,' 'declare war,' 'raise and support armies,' 'to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.\" To these affirmative delegations of power to Congress, there is added, it is said, a prohibition to the states to 'engage in war, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent danger as will not admit of delay.' And, 'that the state of Minnesota is not a party to the war now [then] being waged. If it is not engaged in any war, and until it does so engage, legislation such as a belligerent sovereign might enact, is beyond its province.' These specific grounds of objection to the statute are attempted to be reinforced by analogy to the power of Congress over interstate commerce to the exclusion of the interference of the states.\n The bases of the objections seem to be that plaintiff in error had an accountability as a citizen of the United States different from that which he had as a citizen of the state, and that therefore he was not subject to the power or jurisdiction of the state exercised in the act under review. Manifestly, to support the contention something more is necessary than the letter of the cited constitutional provisions. The broader proposition must be established that a state has no interest or concern in the United States or its armies or power of protecting them from public enemies.\n Undoubtedly, the United States can declare war and it, \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 329]\n\u00a0\n not the states, has the power to raise and maintain armies. But there are other considerations. The United States is composed of the states, the states are constituted of the citizens of the United States, who also are citizens of the states, and it is from these citizens that armies are raised and wars waged, and whether to victory and its benefits, or to defeat and its calamities, the states as well as the United States are intimately concerned. And whether to victory or defeat depends upon their morale, the spirit and determination that animates them-whether it is repellant and adverse or eager and militant, and to maintain it eager and militant against attempts at its debasement in aid of the enemies of the United States, is a service of patriotism, and from the contention that it encroaches upon or usurps any power of Congress, there is an instinctive and immediate revolt. Cold and technical reasoning in its minute consideration may indeed insist on a separation of the sovereignties and resistance in each to any co-operation from the other, but there is opposing demonstration in the fact that this country is one composed of many and must on occasions be animated as one, and that the constituted and constituting sovereignties must have power of co-operation against the enemies of all. Of such instance, we think, is the statute of Minnesota and it goes no farther. It, therefore, has none of the character of the illustrations adduced against it, nor the possibility of conflict of powers which they condemn. This was the view of the Supreme Court of the state, and the court expressed it with detail and force of reasoning. The same view of the statute was expressed in State v. Holm, 139 Minn. 267, 166 N. W. 181, L. R. A. 1918C, 304, where, after a full discussion, the contention was rejected that the Espionage Law of June 15, 1917 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10212a-10212h), abrogated or superseded the statute, the court declaring that the fact that the citizens of the state are also citizens of the United States and owe a duty to the nation, does not absolve them from duty to the state nor preclude a state from \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 330]\n\u00a0\n enforcing such duty. 'The same act,' it was said, 'may be an offense or transgression of both' nation and state, and both may punish it without a conflict of their sovereignties. Numerous cases were cited commencing with Moore v. Illinois, 14 How. 13, and terminating with Halter v. Nebraska, \n205 U.S. 341\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 419, 10 Ann. Cas. 525.\n The latter case is especially pertinent in its sentiment and reasoning. It sustained a statute of Nebraska directed against the debasement of the national flag to trade uses against the contention that the flag being the national emblem was subject only to the control of the national power. In sustaining the statute it was recognized that in a degradation of the flag there is a degradation of all of which it is the symbol, that is, 'the national power and national honor,' and what they represent and have in trust. To maintain and reverence these, to 'encourage patriotism and love of country among its people,' may be affirmed, it was said, to be a duty that rests upon each state, and that 'when, by its legislation, the state encourages a feeling of patriotism towards the nation, it necessarily encourages a like feeling towards the state.'\n And so with the statute of Minnesota. An army is an instrument of government, a necessity of its power and honor, and, it may be, of its security. An army, of course, can only be raised and directed by Congress; in neither has \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 331]\n\u00a0\n the state power, but it has power to regulate the conduct of its citizens and to restrain the exertion of baleful influences against the promptings of patriotic duty to the detriment of the welfare of the nation and state. To do so is not to usurp a national power; it is only to render a service to its people, as Nebraska rendered a service to its people when it inhibited the debasement of the flag.\n We concur, therefore, in the final conclusion of the court, that the state is not inhibited from making 'the national purposes its own purposes, to the extent of exerting its police power to prevent its own citizens from obstructing the accomplishment of such purposes.'\n The statute, indeed, may be supported as a simple exertion of the police power to preserve the peace of the state. As counsel for the state say:\n'The act under consideration does not relate to the raising of armies for the national defense, nor to rules and regulations for the government of those under arms. It is simply a local police measure, aimed to suppress a species of seditious speech which the Legislature of the state has found objectionable. If the Legislature has otherwise power to prohibit utterances of the character of those here complained of, the fact that such suppression has some contributory effect on the federal function of raising armies is quite beside the question.'\n\n And the state knew the conditions which existed, and could have a solicitude for the public peace, and this record justifies it. Gilbert's remarks were made in a public meeting. They were resented by his auditors. There were protesting interruptions, also accusations and threats against him, disorder, and intimations of violence. And such is not an uncommon experience. On such occasions feeling usually runs high and is impetuous; there is a prompting to violence, and, when violence is once yielded to, before it can be quelled, tragedies may be enacted. To preclude such result or a \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 332]\n\u00a0\n danger of it is a proper exercise of the power of the state. Presser v. Illinios, \n116 U.S. 267\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 580.\n The next contention is that the statute is violative of the right of free speech, and therefore void. It is asserted that the right of free speech is a natural and inherent right, and that it, and the freedom of the press, 'were regarded as among the most sacred and vital possessed by mankind when this nation was born, when its Constitution was framed and adopted.' And the contention seems necessary for the plaintiff in error to support. But without so deciding or considering the freedom asserted as guaranteed or secured either by the Constitution of the United States or by the Constitution of the state, we pass immediately to the contention, and for the purposes of this case may concede it; that is, concede that the asserted freedom is natural and inherent, but it is not absolute; it is subject to restriction and limitation. And this we have decided. In Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 247, 249, we distinguished times and occasions, and said that 'the most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic;' and in Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 204, 206\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 249, 250 (63 L. Ed. 561), we said:\n'That the First Amendment, while prohibiting legislation against free speech as such, cannot and obviously was not intended to give immunity to every possible use of language.'\n\n See, also, Debs v. United States, \n249 U.S. 211\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 252; Abrams v. United States, \n250 U.S. 616\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 17. In Schaefer v. United States, \n251 U.S. 466\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 259, commenting on those cases and their contentions, it was said that the curious spectacle was presented of the Constitution of the United States being invoked to justify the activities of anarchy or of the enemies of the United States, and by a strange perversion of its precepts it was adduced against itself. And we did more than reject the contention, we forestalled all repetitions of it, and the contention in the case at bar is a repetition of it. It is a direct assault upon \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 333]\n\u00a0\n the statute of Minnesota, and a direct assertion in spite of the prohibition of the statute that one can by speech teach or advocate that the citizens of the state should not aid or assist 'the United States in prosecuting or carrying on war with the public enemies of the United States,' and be protected by the Constitution of the United States.\n The same conditions existed as in the cited cases, that is, a condition of war and its emergency existed, and there was explicit limitation to section 3 in the charge of the trial court to the jury. The court read sections 2 and 3 of the statute to the jury, and said:\n'I take it from the reading of the whole indictment that it is prosecuted under section 3, which I have just read to you.'\n\n Gilbert's speech had the purpose they denounce. The nation was at war with Germany, armies were recruiting, and the speech was the discouragement of that-its purpose was necessarily the discouragement of that. It was not an advocacy of policies or a censure of actions that a citizen had the right to make. The war was flagrant; it had been declared by the power constituted by the Constitution to declare it, and in the manner provided for by the Constitution. It was not declared in aggression, but in defense, in defense of our national honor, in vindication of the 'most sacred rights of our nation and our people.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n This was known to Gilbert for he was informed in affairs and the operations of the government, and every word that he uttered in denunciation of the war was false, was deliberate misrepresentation of the motives which impelled it, and the objects for which it was prosecuted. He could have had no purpose other than that of which he was charged. It would be a travesty on the constitutional privilege he invokes to assign him its protection.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 334]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs in the result.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, being of the opinion that the subject-matter is within the exclusive legislative power of Congress, when exerted, and that the action of Congress has occupied the whole field, therefore dissents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n Joseph Gilbert, manager of the organization department of the Nonpartisan League was sentenced to fine and imprisonment for speaking on August 18, 1917, at a public meeting of the league, words held to be prohibited by chapter 463 of the laws of Minnesota, approved April 20, 1917 (Gen. St. Supp. 1917,  8521-1 to 8521-6). Gilbert was a citizen of the United States, and apparently of a state other than Minnesota. He claimed seasonably that the statute violated rights guaranteed to him by the federal Constitution. This claim has been denied; and, in my opinion, erroneously.\n The Minnesota statute was enacted during the World War; but it is not a war measure. The statute is said to have been enacted by the state under its police power to preserve the peace; but it is in fact an act to prevent teaching that the abolition of war is possible. Unlike the federal Espionage Act of June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 217, 219 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10212a-10212h), it applies equally whether the United States is at peace or at war. It abridges freedom of speech and of the press, not in a particular emergency, in order to avert a clear and present danger, but under all circumstances. The restriction imposed relates to the teaching of the doctrine of pacifism, and the Legislature in effect proscribes it for all time. The statute does not in terms prohibit the teaching of the doctrine. Its prohibition is more specific and is directed against the teaching of certain applications of it. This specification operates, as will be seen, rather to extend, than to limit, the scope of the prohibition. \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 335]\n\u00a0\n Sections 1 and 2 prohibit teaching or advocating by printed matter, writing, or word of mouth that men should not enlist in the military or naval forces of the United States. The prohibition is made to apply whatever the motive, the intention, or the purpose of him who teaches. It applies alike to the preacher in the pulpit, the professor at the university, the speaker at a political meeting, the lecturer at a society or club gathering. Whatever the nature of the meeting and whether it be public or private, the prohibition is absolute, if five persons are assembled. The reason given by the speaker for advising against enlistment is immaterial. Young men, considering whether they should enter these services as a means of earning a livelihood or as a career, may not be told that, in the opinion of the speaker, they can serve their country and themselves better by entering the civil service of state or nation, or by studying for one of the professions, or by engaging in the transportation service, or in farming or in business, or by becoming a workman in some productive industry. Although conditions may exist in the army or the navy which are undermining efficiency, which tend to demoralize those who enter the service and would render futile their best efforts, the state forbids citizens of the United States to advocate that men should not enlist until existing abuses or defects are remedied. The prohibition imposed by the Minnesota statute has no relation to existing needs or desires of the government. It applies although recruiting is neither in process nor in contemplation. For the statute aims to prevent, not acts, but beliefs. The prohibition imposed by section 3 is even more farreaching than that provided in sections 1 and 2. Section 3 makes it punishable to teach in any place a single person that a citizen should not aid in carrying on a war, no matter what the relation of the parties may be. Thus the statute invades the privacy and freedom of the home. Father and mother may not follow the promptings of religious belief, \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 336]\n\u00a0\n of conscience or of conviction, and teach son or daughter the doctrine of pacifism. If they do, any police officer may summarily arrest them.\n That such a law is inconsistent with the conceptions of liberty hitherto prevailing seems clear. But it is said that the guaranty against abridging freedom of speech contained in the First Amendment of the federal Constitution applies only to federal action; that the legislation here complained of is that of a state; that the validity of the statute has been sustained by its highest court as a police measure; that the matter is one of state concern; and that consequently this court cannot interfere. But the matter is not one merely of state concern. The state law affects directly the functions of the federal government. It affects rights, privileges, and immunities of one who is a citizen of the United States; and it deprives him of an important part of his liberty. These are rights which are guaranteed protection by the federal Constitution; and they are invaded by the statute in question.\n Congress has the exclusive power to legislate concerning the army and navy of the United States, and to determine, among other things, the conditions of enlistment. It has likewise exclusive power to declare war, to determine to what extent citizens shall aid in its prosecution and how effective aid may best be secured. Congress, which has power to raise an army and naval forces by conscription when public safety demands, may, to avert a clear and present danger, prohibit interference by persuasion with the process of either compulsory or voluntary enlistment. As an incident of its power to declare war it may, when the public safety demands, require from every citizen full support, and may, to avert a clear and present danger, prohibit interference by persuasion with the giving of such support. But Congress might conclude that the most effective army or navy would be one composed wholly of men who had enlisted with full appreciation of \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 337]\n\u00a0\n the limitations and obligations which the service imposes, and in the face of efforts to discourage their doing so.3 It might conclude that the most effective army would be one composed exclusively of men who are firmly convinced that war is sometimes necessary if honor is to be preserved, and also that the particular war in which they are engaged in a just one. Congress, legislating for a people justly proud of liberties theretofore enjoyed and suspicious or resentful of any interference with them, might conclude that even in times of great danger, the most effective means of securing support from the great body of citizens is to accord to all full freedom to criticize the acts and administration of their country, although such freedom may be used by a few, to urge upon their fellow citizens not to aid the government in carrying on a war, which reason or faith tells them is wrong, and will therefore bring misery upon their country.\n The right to speak freely concerning functions of the federal government is a privilege or immunity of every citizen of the United States which, even before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, a state was powerless to curtail. It was held in Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 44, that the United States has the power to call to the seat of government or elsewhere any citizen to aid it in the conduct of public affairs; that every citizen has the correlative right to go there or anywhere in the pursuit of public or private business; and that 'no power can exist in a state to obstruct this right which would not enable it to defeat the purpose for which the government was established.' The right of a citizen of the United States to take part, for his own or the country's benefit, in the making of federal laws and in the conduct of the government, necessarily includes the right to speak or write about them; to endeavor to make his own opinion concerning laws existing \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 338]\n\u00a0\n or contemplated prevail; and, to this end, to teach the truth as he sees it. Were this not so, 'the right of the people to assemble for the purpose of petitioning Congress for a redress of grievance or for anything else connected with the powers or duties of the national government' would be a right totally without substance. See United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 U.S. 542\n, 552; The Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 79. Full and free exercise of this right by the citizen is ordinarily also his duty; for its exercise is more important to the nation than it is to himself. Like the course of the heavenly bodies, harmony in national life is a resultant of the struggle between contending forces. In frank expression of conflicting opinion lies the greatest promise of wisdom in governmental action; and in suppression lies ordinarily the greatest peril. There are times when those charged with the responsibility of government, faced with clear and present danger, may conclude that suppression of divergent opinion is imperative; because the emergency does not permit reliance upon the lower conquest of error by truth. And in such emergencies the power to suppress exists. But the responsibility for the maintenance of the army and navy, for the conduct of war and for the preservation of government, both state and federal, from 'malice domestic and foreign levy,' rests upon Congress. It is true that the states have the power of self-preservation inherent in any government to suppress insurrection and repel invasion; and to that end they may maintain such a force of militia as Congress may prescribe and arm. Houston v. Moore, 5 Wheat. 1. But the duty of preserving the state governments falls ultimately upon the federal government. Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 77; The Prize Cases, 2 Black, 635, 668; Texas v. White, 7 Wall. 700, 727. And the superior responsibility carries with it the superior right. The states act only under the express direction of Congress. See National Defense Act, June 3, 1916, c. 134, 39 Stat. \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 339]\n\u00a0\n 166; Selective Service Act, May 18, 1917, c. 15, 40 Stat. 76 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2044a-2044k). The fact that they may stimulate and encourage recruiting, just as they may stimulate and encourage interstate commerce, Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, \n148 \nU.S. 312, 329\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 622, does not give them the power by police regulations or otherwise to exceed the authority expressly granted to them by the federal government. See Kurtz v. Moffitt, \n115 U.S. 487\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 148; Prigg v. Pennsylvania, 16 Pet. 539. Congress, being charged with responsibility for those functions of government, must determine whether a paramount interest of the nation demands that free discussion in relation to them should be curtailed. No State may trench upon its province.\n Prior to the passage of the Minnesota statute it had been the established policy of the United States, departed from only once in the life of the nation,4 to raise its military and naval forces in times of war as in peace conclusively by voluntary enlistment. Service was deemed a privilege of Americans, not a duty exacted by law. Specific provision had been made to ensure that enlistment should be the result of free, informed, and deliberate choice. \n5\n The law of the United States left an American as \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 340]\n\u00a0\n free to advise his fellows not to enter the army or the navy as he was free to recommend their enlistment. The government had exacted from American citizens no service except the prompt payment of taxes. Although war had been declared, such was still the policy, and the law of the United States when Minnesota enacted the statute here in question.\n The Minnesota statute was, when enacted, inconsistent with the law of the United States, because at that time Congress still permitted free discussion of these governmental functions. Later, and before Gilbert spoke the words complained of, the federal Espionage Law was enacted, but the Minnesota statute was also inconsistent with it. The federal act did not prohibit the teaching of any doctrine; it prohibited only certain tangible obstructions to the conduct of the existing war with the German Empire committed with criminal intent. It was so understood and administered by the Department of Justice. \n6\n Under the Minnesota law, teaching or advice that men \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 341]\n\u00a0\n should not enlist is made punishable although the jury should find (1) that the teaching or advocacy proved wholly futile and no obstruction resulted; (2) that there was no intent to obstruct; and the court, taking judicial notice of facts, should rule (3) that, when the words were written or spoken, the United States was at peace with all the world. That this conflict was not merely a technical one, but a cause of real embarrassment and danger to the federal government, we learn from one of the officials intrusted with the administration of the Espionage Act:\n'In the state of Minnesota because of what was claimed to be either inadequate federal law or inadequate federal administration, state laws of a sweeping character were passed and enforced with severity. Whether justified or not in adopting this policy of repression, the result of its adoption increased discontent, and the most serious cases of alleged interference with civil liberty were reported to the federal government from that state.'7\n\n In Johnson v. Maryland, \n254 U.S. 51\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 16, 65 L. Ed. --, decided November 8, 1920, this court held that the power of Congress to establish post roads precluded the state from requiring of a post office employe using the state highway in the transportation of mail the customary evidence of competency to drive a motortruck, although the danger to public safety was obvious and it did not appear that the federal government had undertaken to deal with the matter by statute or regulation. The prohibition of state action rests, as the court pointed out there, 'not upon any consideration of degree, but upon the entire absence of power on the part of the states to touch the instrumentalities of the United States.' As exclusive power over enlistments in the army and the navy of the United States and the responsibility for the conduct of war is vested by the federal Constitution in Congress, \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 342]\n\u00a0\n legislation by a state on this subject is necessarily void unless authorized by Congress. It is so when Congress makes no regulation, because by omitting to make regulations Congress signifies its intention that, in this respect, the action of the citizen shall be untrammeled. This would be true, even if the subject in question were one over which Congress and the states have concurrent power. For where Congress has occupied a field theretofore open also to state legislation, it necessarily excludes all such. Southern Railway v. Reid, \n222 U.S. 424\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 140; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Hardwick Farmers' Elevator Co., \n226 U.S. 426\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 174, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 203. Here Congress not only had exclusive power to act on the subject; it had exercised that power directly by the Espionage Law before Gilbert spoke the words for which he was sentenced. The provisions of the Minnesota statute and its title preclude a contention that its purpose was to prevent breaches of the peace. Compare Ex parte Meckel (Tex. Cr. R.) 220 S. W. 81. But neither the fact that it was a police regulation, New York Central Railroad Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C. 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D. 1139, nor the fact that it was legislation in aid of congressional action, would, if true, save the statute. For 'when the United States has exercised its exclusive powers ... so far as to take possession of the field, the states no more can supplement its requirements than they can annul them.' Penna. R. R. Co. v. Pub. Service Comm., \n250 \nU.S. 566, 569\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 36, 37 (63 L. Ed. 1142); Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Washington, \n222 U.S. 370\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 160. The exclusiveness of the power of the federal government with which this state legislation interferes springs from the very roots of political sovereignty. The states may not punish treason against the United States, People v. Lynch, 11 Johns. (N. Y.) 549; Ex parte Quarrier, 2 W. Va. 569; although indirectly acts of treason may affect them vitally. No more may they arrogate to themselves authority to punish the teaching of pacifism which the Legislature of Minnesota appears \n\n[254 U.S. 325, 343]\n\u00a0\n to have put into that category. Compare Schaefer v. United States, \n251 U.S. 466\n, 494, note, 40 Sup. Ct. 259.\n As the Minnesota statute is in my opinion invalid because it interferes with federal functions and with the right of a citizen of the United States to discuss them, I see no occasion to consider whether it violates also the Fourteenth Amendment. But I have difficulty in believing that the liberty guaranteed by the Constitution, which has been held to protect against state denial the right of an employer to discriminate against a workman because he is a member of a trade union, Coppage v. Kansas, \n236 U.S. 1\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 240, L. R. A. 1915C, 960, the right of a business man to conduct a private employment agency, Adams v. Tanner, \n244 U.S. 590\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 662, 61 L. Ed 1336, L. R. A. 1917F, 1163, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 973, or to contract outside the state for insurance of his property, Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578, 589\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 427, although the Legislature deems it inimical to the public welfare, does not include liberty to teach, either in the privacy of the home or publicly, the doctrine of pacifism; so long, at least, as Congress has not declared that the public safety demands its suppression. I cannot believe that the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment includes only liberty to acquire and to enjoy property. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In Gustafson v. Rhinow, 175 N. W. 903, the Supreme Court of Minnesota sustained a law of the state giving to soldiers who served in the war against Germany $15 for each month or fraction of a month of service, against an attack that the soldiers were soldiers of the United States. The court expressed the concern and interest of the state as follows: 'It is true that the federal government alone has power to declare war, but, having done so, the government and people of Minnesota became bound to defend and support the national government. While the states of the nation are sovereign in a cerain field, they are also members of the family of states constituting the national organization.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Words of President Wilson in his war message to Congress, April 2, 1917. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] See General John A.

Recruits signed up on misrepresentated facts or partial information do not make good soldiers. They resent being fooled just as you would, and will never yield their full value to a government whose agents obtained their services in a way not fully square.

Repeatedly their attention has been called to the fact that expression of private or public opinion relating to matters of governmental policy or of political character must not be confused with willful attempts to interfere with our conduct of the war.

GEORGE G PRENDERGAST CONST CO.(1920)\nNo. 127\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. David Goldsmith, of St. Louis, Mo., for plaintiffs in error.[ Goldsmith v. George G Prendergast Const Co \n252 U.S. 12\n (1920) ]\n\n\n[252 U.S. 12, 14]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hickman P. Rodgers, of St. Louis, Mo., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit was brought in the circuit court of the city of St. Louis by the Construction Company to recover upon a special tax-bill issued by the city of St. Louis for the construction of the sewer in what is known as Manchester Road sewer district No. 111, city of St. Louis. The Construction Company recovered a judgment on the tax-bills against the plaintiffs in error, who were owners of abutting property. Upon appeal to the Supreme Court of Missouri the judgment below was affirmed upon hearing and rehearing. Prendergast Const. Co. v. Goldsmith, 273 Mo. 184, 201 S. W. 354.\n The record discloses that the sewer, for the construction of which the assessment was made, was constructed in a certain boulevard known as Kingshighway Boulevard. On the east of this boulevard, and fronting on the same for a considerable distance, is a tract belonging to the city, and known as Tower Grove Park; this property was not assessed for the building of the sewer. This omission is alleged to be of such an arbitrary and discriminatory character as to render the ordinance making the assessment void as a deprivation of federal constitutional rights \n\n[252 U.S. 12, 15]\n\u00a0\n secured to the plaintiffs in error by the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The circuit court made findings of fact in which it found that there was no evidence tht the municipal assembly of the city of St. Louis, in passing the ordinances in question, was actuated by motives of fraud or oppression; that such motives, if any, must be inferred solely from the failure to incorporate parcels or tracts of land in the sewer district, the topography of which might render it necessary or expedient to then, or thereafter, drain the water or sewage therefrom into the sewer. The court recites the nature of the title of the tract known as Tower Grove Park.\n It appears that the park had been conveyed to the city, the grantor reserving therefrom a strip 200 feet wide, surrounding the same. The court found that the western front of the tract, thus conveyed to the city included the western gate or entrance of the park and the strip of 200 feet in width, surrounding the park proper, and embraced a total frontage along Kingshighway of about 1470 feet, and that none of the property included within Tower Grove park and the strip of 200 feet in width, reserved for a residence property, was included within the taxing district for such sewer construction. The court also finds that with the exception of an area composing some 300 feet, each way, located at the southwestern corner of the Park, the western part of the park for a distance of some 600 feet east of Kingshighway is of an elevation higher than Kingshighway between Arsenal street and Magnolia avenue, and the natural drainage thereof is in the main westwardly towards Kingshighway and that before the building of the sewer in question surface water and hydrants drained from said part of the park through drains and gutters under said street and sidewalk to a point west of Kingshighway. That whatever drains for surface and hydrant water existed in said western and north western \n\n[252 U.S. 12, 16]\n\u00a0\n portion of the park led into that section of the sewer in question, situated in Kingshighway adjoining the park; but the court finds that it is unable to determine from the evidence as to when such connection with said sewer was accomplished, or by whom. The court also finds that at the time the work in question was performed it was provided by the revised ordinances of the city of St. Louis that water draining from roofs of houses should not flow over sidewalks, but should be conducted through pipes to a sewer if available, and if not then through pipes below the sidewalk, and into the open gutter of the street. The court does not find from the evidence that it was not possible or feasible to drain the surface water falling upon or collected from that portion of Tower Grove Park, and the reserved strip of 200 feet, which is higher than and inclined towards Kingshighway, from the surface of said land in any other manner than through or by the district sewer constructed in Kingshighway, and that sewage from houses upon said reserved strip, if any there ever be, cannot be disposed of by means other than said sewer.\n As conclusions of law the court finds that it was within the powers of the municipal assembly, in the passage of the ordinances establishing the sewer district wherein the work sued for was performed, to embrace and designate therein only such real estate as, in their judgment, should be benefited thereby; that the discretion vested in the municipal legislature was not subject to review by this court, unless the powers of the legislature were affirmatively shown to have been exercised fraudulently, oppressively or arbitrarily. And the court found that the mere omission of the lands from said district which might, at one time, be reasonably included in the sewer district in question, or as to which it is reasonable to assume that the same would be more conveniently served by the sewer in question than any other, did not justify \n\n[252 U.S. 12, 17]\n\u00a0\n the court in concluding that the municipal assembly, in omitting said lands from the sewer district in question, was actuated by motives of fraud, or oppression; or that the prima facie liability of defendants established by the certified special tax-bill is thereby rebute d and overturned.\n On the facts and conclusions of law the judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Missouri.\n The establishment of sewer districts was committed to local authorities by the charter of the city of St. Louis which had the force and effect of a statute of the State. That charter provided that within the limits of the district prescribed by ordinance recommended by the board of public improvements, the municipal assembly might establish sewer districts, and such sewers may be connected with a sewer of any class or with a natural course of drainage. See section 21, Woerner's Revised Code of St. Louis 1907, p. 410.\n The mere fact that the court found that a part of Tower Grove Park might have been drained into the sewer, it was held by the Missouri courts, under all the circumstances, did not justify judicial interference with the exercise of the discretion vested in the municipal authorities. The court commented on the fact that it was not shown that any considerable amount of surface water was conducted away from the park by this sewer. Much less do such findings afford reason for this court in the exercise of its revisory power under the federal Constitution to reverse the action of the state courts, which fully considered the facts, and refused to invalidate the assessment.\n As we have frequently declared, this court only interferes with such assessments on the ground of violation of constitutional rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment, when the action of the state authorities is found to be arbitrary, or wholly unequal in operation and effect. \n\n[252 U.S. 12, 18]\n\u00a0\n We need but refer to some of the cases in which this principle has been declared.

U S(1920)\nNo. 153\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Thomas D. Halpin, of Lapeer, Mich., Harrison Geer, of Detroit, Mich., and L. T. Michener, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Spellacy, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The railroad from Port Huron to Flint, in Michigan, sixty miles in length, was completed on December 12, 1871. It was built by the Port Huron & Lake Michigan Railroad Company. By foreclosure of a mortgage executed \n\n[252 U.S. 112, 117]\n\u00a0\n by that corporation and several consolidations it became on October 31, 1900, the property of the Grand Trunk Western Railway Company and has since been a part of its system. For forty-one years after the completion of this sixty-mile road the mails were carried over it by the successive owners under the usual postal contracts and payment was made for the service quarterly at full rates. In 1912 the Postmaster General, concluding that this was a land-aided railroad within the provisions of section 13 of the Act of July 12, 1876, c. 179, 19 Stat. 78, 82 (Comp. St .  7485),1 restated the account for the twelve full years during which the road had been operated by the Grand Trunk Western. Twenty per cent. of the mail pay for that period was found to be $50,359.70; and this amount he deducted from sums accruing to the company under the current mail contract. He also reduced by twenty per cent. the amount otherwise payable under the current contract for carrying the mail over this part of its system. Thus he deducted altogether $52,566.87 from the amount payable on June 30, 1913. The road had in fact been built without any aid through grant of public lands. None had passed to the Grand Trunk Western when it acquired the road; and, so far as appears, that company had no actual knowledge that any of its predecessors in title had acquired any public land because of its construction. The company insisted that the $52,566.87 thus deducted from its mail pay was withheld without warrant in law, and brought this suit in the Court of Claims to recover the amount. 53 Ct. Cl. 473. Its petition was dismissed and the case comes here on appeal. Whether the company is entitled to relief depends upon the legal effect of the following facts. \n\n[252 U.S. 112, 118]\n\u00a0\n By Act of June 2, 1856, c. 44, 11 Stat. 21, Congress granted to Michigan public land to aid in the construction of certain lines of railroad a part extending easterly of Flint to Port Huron-another part, westerly of Flint to Grand Haven. The act contained in Section 5 the usual mail provision. \n2\n In 1857 the Legislature of Michigan granted these lands to two companies on condition that they accept the obligations of the grant within sixty days. Each company filed within the specified time a partial acceptance, refusing to accede to the taxation features of the grant. Thereupon the rights of each to any part of the public lands was declared forfeited by the state authorities for failure to comply with the state legislation. Subsequently the companies filed maps of definite location in the General Land Office of the Interior Department, which were approved by that office; and on June 3, 1863, the Secretary of the Interior certified to the Governor of Michigan 30,998.76 acres of land lying west of Flint for the company which was to build the line from Grand Haven to Flint, the Detroit and Milwaukee Railway Company. On November 1, 1864, he certified 6,428.68 acres, all but 97 40\/100 acres of which lay east of Flint, for the company which was to build the line from Flint to Port Huron, the Port Huron & Milwaukee Railway Company. Neither company constructed its line nor received any patent for land. The rights of way and other property of the Port Huron & Milwaukee Railway Company passed through a foreclosure sale to the Port Huron & Lake Michigan Railroad Company; and this corporation built the road in question dr ing the years 1869, 1870 and 1871\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 112, 119]\n\u00a0\n But it made no application for any part of these lands until three weeks before the completion of the road. Then, on November 18, 1871, it petitioned the State Board of Control, which was charged with the disposition of the public lands, to confer upon it both the 30,998.76 acres west of Flint and the 6,428.68 acres east of Flint which the Secretary of the Interior had certified; and in so applying it asked for the land 'for the purpose of aiding in the construction' of its contemplated railroad which was described as extending from Grand Haven to Flint and thence to Port Huron. The board approved of making the grant 'for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the road'; but no further action was taken until May 1, 1873, when upon a new petition of the company which recited the former proceedings and the completion of 'sixty miles of the unfinished portion of said line' the board directed the transfer of all the land to it. The resolution of the board was followed on May 30, 1873, by a patent for all the land from the Governor of the state, its formal acceptance by the company subject to the provisions of the Act of Congress of June 3, 1856, and action by it to take possession of the land and to dispose of it for the benefit of the company. In 1877 the Supreme Court of Michigan held in Bowes v. Haywood, 35 Mich. 241, that the patent so far as it purported to transfer the 30, 988.76 acres west of Flint was void under the Michigan legislation, because there had not, in fact, been any claim or pretense that the company ever contemplated building the line west of Flint; and in Fenn v. Kinsey, 45 Mich. 446, 8 N. W. 64 (1881), that court held that an act of the Michigan Legislature passed May 14, 1877 (Laws 1877, No. 132), which purported to ratify the patent, was inoperative so far as it concerned the lands west of Flint because it impaired rights reserved to the United States by the Act of June 3, 1856. Meanwhile, Congress had relinquished to Michigan, by joint resolution of March 3, 1879, No. 15, 20 Stat. 490, its reversionary \n\n[252 U.S. 112, 120]\n\u00a0\n interest in the lands;3 and thereafter the Legislature of Michigan (Act of June 9, 1881, Laws Mich. 1881, p. 362), ratified as to the six thousand acres east of Flint, the action theretofore taken by the state authorities, declaring also that 'all deeds and conveyances heretofore executed by the Port Huron & Lake Michigan Railroad Company' 'shall be deemed to be of full force and effect' and that 'the rest and residue of said lands is vested in said company, its successors or assigns.' Whether there remained then any land which had not been disposed of by that company or one of its successors does not appear; but it does not appear that when in 1875 proceedings were taken to foreclose the mortgage under which the appellant claims title to the road, the trustee to whom the lands had been transferred for the company's benefit was joined for the purpose of including all such interest in the property to be sold.\n The Act of June 3, 1856, had contemplated a grant of six sections (3, 840 acres) per mile of road to be constructed. That would have been 230, 400 acres for the sixty miles. The company which built them and those claiming under it received at most 6,428 acres. The case is one of apparent hardship. Was the judgment of the Court of Claims denying relief required by the applicable rules of law?\n First. If the railroad was land-aided, payment of more than eighty per cent. of the full rates otherwise provided by law was unauthorized; and it was the duty of the Postmaster General to seek to recover the overpayment. Revised \n\n[252 U.S. 112, 121]\n\u00a0\n Statutes,  4057 (Comp. St.  7606). He was under no obligation to establish the illegality by suit. Having satisfied himself of the fact he was at liberty to deduct the amount of the overpayment from the moneys otherwise payable to the company to which the overpayment had been made. Wisconsin Central Railroad Co. v. United States, \n164 U.S. 19\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 45. There was no attempt to include in the deduction any alleged overpayment to any of appellant's predecessors in title. Balances due for carrying the mails, although arising under successive quadrennial contracts, are regarded as running accounts, and moneys paid in violation of law upon balances certified by the accounting officers may be recovered by means of a later debit in these accounts. It matters not how long a time elapsed before the error in making the overpayment was discovered or how long the attempt to recover it was deferred. The statute of limitations does not ordinarily run against the United States and would not present a bar to a suit for the amount. See United States v. Thompson, \n98 U.S. 486\n. It is true that when a department charged with the execution of a statute gives it a construction and acts upon that construction uniformly for a series of years, the court will look with disfavor upon a change whereby parties who have contracted with the government upon the faith of that construction would be injured. United States v. Alabama Great Southern Railroad Co., \n142 U.S. 615\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 306. But here the practice long continued of paying the full rate instead of eighty per cent. thereof was not due to any construction of a statute which the department later sought to abandon, but to what is alleged to be a mistake of fact-due perhaps to an oversight. To such a case the rule of long-continued construction has no application. The appellant must be held to have taken the road with notice of the burdens legally imposed upon it.\n Second. If the road was land-aided, it is immaterial that the company which later carried the mail over it received \n\n[252 U.S. 112, 122]\n\u00a0\n none of the land and obtained no benefit from the grant. The obligation to carry mails at eighty per cent. of rates otherwise payable attached to the road like an easement or charge; and it affects every carrier who may thereafter use the railroad, whatever the nature of the tenure. Chicago, Saint Paul, etc., Railway v. United States, \n217 U.S. 180\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 470. The appellant expressly disclaims any contention that the mail clause should not apply because the quantity of land covered by the grant was small as compared with that contemplated by the Act of June 3, 1856, and with the cost of the road.\n Third. It is contended that this railroad was not land-aided, because it had, in fact, been completed without the aid either of funds or of credit derived from these public lands. Whether the Port Huron & Lake Michigan Company which built the railroad was in fact aided by the land grant in so doing is immaterial. Before the road had been fully completed it asked that the land be granted to it in aid of the construction, and for this purpose only could the grant be made under the act of Congress. It accepted from the state a patent for the land whcih recited that such was the purpose of the conveyance; and it expressly assented to the terms and conditions of the grant imposed by the Act of June 3, 1856. Thereafter it proceeded to dispose of the land. Throughout this period the Port Huron & Lake Michigan Company remained the owner of the railroad. It had been authorized by its charter to receive the land grant and necessarily to assent to the conditions upon which alone the grant could be made to it. It is true that the mortgage upon its property, under which appellant claims title, was executed before the company had applied for the grant; and it does not appear that the mortgage purported specifically to cover public lands; but the trustee under the mortgage claimed these lands as after-acquired property and the company's interest in them was, by special proceeding, made subject \n\n[252 U.S. 112, 123]\n\u00a0\n to the foreclosure proceedings. The appellant is therefore in no better position than the Port Huron & Lake Michigan Company to question the charge upon the railroad imposed by acceptance of the grant.\n Fourth. Appellant points to the fact that the patent to thel ands lying west of Flint was later held to be void by the Supreme Court of the State, and insists that thereby the charge or condition concerning the carriage of the mail must be held to have been relinquished. But the patent to the lands east of Flint never was declared void; the company's title to them never was questioned; and the objection to the patent to the western lands did not apply to them. That objection was that the Port Huron & Lake Michigan Railway Company was not a 'competent party' to receive the western lands within the meaning of the eleventh section of the Michigan Act of 1857 (Laws 1857, No. 126), because it did not propose to construct a line from Grand Haven to Owosso. Bowes v. Haywood, supra, 246. And the attempt by the Legislature to make it a 'competent party' through the Act of 1877 violated the obligations of the federal government's grant. Fenn v. Kinsey, supra. The only flaw in the title to the lands east of Flint lay in the fact that the railway had not been completed within ten years of the Act of June 3, 1856, as required by that act. This requirement, however, was a condition subsequently annexed to an estate in fee, and the title remained valid until the federal government should take action by legislation or judicial proceedings to enforce a forfeiture of the estate. Schulenberg v. Harriman, 21 Wall. 44, 63, 64; Railroad Land Co. v. Courtright, 21 Wall. 310, 316. So far from doing so Congress relinquished by joint resolution its reversionary interest in the land, and thereby removed all possibility of objection on its part to the validity of the patnet; and the state of Michigan later ratified the patent by legislation admitted to be valid.\n Fifth. The appellant urges that the illegality of the patent \n\n[252 U.S. 112, 124]\n\u00a0\n to the western lands constituted a failure of consideration which voided the contract with the government. The burden of the mail clause, it says, could be imposed only by contract between the government and Port Huron & Lake Michigan Company. The contract was for land west as well as east of Flint-and the land west could legally be granted only if the company contemplated building the road westward to Grand Haven. As there was not even a pretense that it contemplated such construction, the contract was illegal. The government's claim under the mail clause must fail, because no rights can be acquired under an illegal contract. So the appellant contends. Such a view is the result of regarding the transaction as a promise by the railway to the government to carry the mail at a price fixed by Congress, on consideration of 36,000 acres of public land. A contract of this sort would create a purely personal obligation attaching 'to the company, and not to the property'-clearly not to a mere licensee. However, it is settled that the obligation in question is not of this nature but does attach to the property, even when used by a licensee. Chicago, St. Paul, etc., Ry. v. United States, \n217 U.S. 180\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 470. The obligation of a land-aided railway to carry the mail at a price fixed by Congress is a charge upon the property. The public lands were granted to Michigan to aid the construction of certain railways upon certain conditions. The Legislature of Michigan could not dispose of the lands except in accordance with the terms of the grant. By the Act of February 14, 1857, it accepted the grant and enacted legislation to give legal effect to the conditions of it. Section 4 of the act is as follows:\n'Said railroads shall be and forever remain public highways for the use of the government of the United States, free from toll or other charge upon the transportation of any property or troops of the United States; and the United States mail shall be transported over said railroads, \n\n[252 U.S. 112, 125]\n\u00a0\n under the direction of the Post Office Department, at such price as Congress may by law direct. ...'\n\n The order of the Board of Control of May 1, 1873, directing the transfer of the land to th Port Huron & Lake Michigan Company, and the patent issued by the Governor were founded upon the authority of section eleven of this act; and under date of May 30, 1873, the company accepted the lands with the burdens they imposed. The railroad, whose owners and constructors accepted aid derived from these lands, became charged by operation of law with the burden of transporting the mails. The question whether that company would have accepted the land with its burdens if it had foreseen the invalidity of the title to the western lands, is wholly immaterial. The burden attached upon the acceptance of any aid whatsoever no matter how disproportionate to the cost of constructing the portion so aided.\n The transaction called illegal was one between the company and the state authorities. The United States was no party to it. It had merely supplied property which the parties to it used. The government never objected to the disposition made of it; and evidenced its approval by passage of the joint resolution of March 3, 1879. No reason exists why rights by way of charge upon the railroad which were acquired by the government through the acceptance of six thousand acres of public land, should be invalidated by the alleged illegality of the state authorities' action in issuing a patent to a wholly different tract.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 13.

And be it further enacted, that the United States mail shall be transported over said roads, under the direction of the Post Office Department, at such price as Congress may, by law, direct: Provided, that until such price is fixed by law, the Postmaster General shall have the power to determine the same.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Resolution of March 3, 1879, 'That the United States hereby releases to the state of Michigan any and all reversionary interest which may remain in the United States in such of the lands granted to, and acquired by the said state of Michigan by act of Congress of June third, eighteen hundred and fifty-six, and certified to the said state in accordance with said act, as were granted to aid the construction of the road from Grand Haven to Flint, and then to Port Huron. This release shall not in any manner affect any legal or equitable rights in said lands, which have been acquired, but all such rights shall be and remain unimpaired.' \n\n\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT NORTHERN R.

W. 306), and the Railroad Company\n Messrs. Oliver E. Sweet, of Pierre, S. D., Clarence C. Caldwell, of Sioux Falls, S. D., and P. W. Dougherty, of Pierre, S. D., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In Great Northern Railway Co. v. Minnesota, \n238 U.S. 340\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 753, the question was whether an order of the Railroad and Warehouse Commission of Minnesota directing the railway to install at a named station a cattle-weighing scale was rightly sustained by the Supreme Court of the state. It \n\n[253 U.S. 71, 72]\n\u00a0\n was found by that court (a) that out of 259 stations on the railway line in Minnesota where stockyards for handing cattle existed there were but 54 supplied with cattle-weighing scales, all of which the railway had voluntarily installed; (b) that although such scales had no direct part in transportation, they were convenient in stock dealings, and a station possessing one had an advantage over a place where none existed; in fact, that at the 54 stations where they had been voluntarily installed it had come to pass that they were used, not by shippers for the purposes of their transportation business, but by those who bought and sold cattle.\n Coming to consider the contention of the railway that the order to put in the scales was repugnant to the Fourteenth Amendment as a taking of its property without due process, since as a carrier no obligation rested upon it to put in the scales, it was pointed out that the test was whether h e order was so arbitrary and unreasonable as to exceed the power of government, or was justified by the public necessities which the carrier could lawfully be compelled to meet. Holding that as the duty of the railway was confined to furnishing appliances for its business of transportation and that cattle scales were not of such a character it followed that the railway could not be compelled to supply them as a means for building up the business of trading in cattle however much the public might be benefited thereby, the defense of the railway was maintained and the order of the Commission was held to be wanting in due process and void. The result it was pointed out could not be avoided by the suggestion that the order was intended to correct a discrimination which existed in favor of certain stations which had scales, since in substance to say that would be to correct one discrimination by creating another.\n Shortly before the argument in this court of the Minnesota case just referred to, the firm of Cahill & Redman \n\n[253 U.S. 71, 73]\n\u00a0\n petitioned the Board of Railroad Commissioners of South Dakota for an order requiring the Great Northern Railway Company to install and maintain a cattle scale adjacent to its cattle yards at Albee station. It was alleged in the petition that no means otherwise of weighing cattle existed at Albee, that the public necessities of the cattle trade required the scale, and that the number of cattle shipped from the place justified the outlay by the railway.\n The railway answered, denying any duty on its part to install the scale, and asserted that to compel it to put the scale in would deprive it of its property without due process, and would besides deny it the equal protection of the laws, both in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n At the hearing which followed there was no showing that any cattle had been shipped over the railway into Albee. It was indisputably established, however: (a) That not only the defendant railway but the other roads operating in the state of South Dakota had at some of their stations installed stock yard scales which presumably, in the absence of all proof to the contrary, had been voluntarily installed; (b) that all shipments of cattle from Albee during the preceding three years amounted only to 56 carloads, all of which were moved in interstate commerce, that is, to St. Paul, Minn., and that with regard to less than carload lots two cattle shipped in intrastate commerce constituted thr sole movement; (c) that the universal rule on all railroads throughout the United States is to determine the weight of cattle shipped in carload lots, for the purposes of ascertaining the freight charges, not by weight taken on scales at the point of shipment, but by a track scales at or adjacent to the point of delivery; (d) that the business of dealing in cattle at Albee would be facilitated and probably increased by the existence there of a cattle scale where cattle dealt in could be weighed, and that the public want in this respect had come to be increasingly felt since the removal by its owner of a \n\n[253 U.S. 71, 74]\n\u00a0\n private scale which the public had used at a time previous to the demand made upon the railway to install the cattle scale here in question.\n The Commission in its findings, while pointing out that the complainants had testified that, besides the benefit to the public, there would be an advantage to shippers by the establishment of the scale, as it would enable the shippers to load their cattle, so as to avoid any loss resulting from a failure to bring the loaded car up to the minimum weight required for carload shipments, added the following:\n'The testimony of the other witnesses, including those appearing for the railway company, is to the effect that the only use to which a stock scale is put is for the accommodation and convenience of stock buyers and persons making sales of live stock to the buyers at stockyards in arriving at the weights as to the basis for the purchase and sale.'\n\n In the meanwhile the Minnesota case had been decide and therefore when the Commission came to apply the law to the facts by it found in this case it was called upon to determine how far the ruling in that case deprived it of power to grant the relief prayed in this. Discharging that duty, it held that the Minnesota case was inapplicable, because in South Dakota there was a common knowledge that railroad cattle scales when established were for the benefit of both the public and shippers, enabling all who took cattle into the railroad yards whether for shipment or otherwise to ascertain their weight. After referring to the relation in certain aspects which cattle scales, when installed, bore to carload and less than carload shipments, and that a law of the state provided for the inspection of cattle scales when installed by railways at their cattle yards, it was pointed out that, in accordance with many adjudged cases establishing that it was a part of the duty of a carrier to install stockyards in which to hold cattle intended for shipment and to receive inbound cattle when unloaded, it had by further legislation been made the duty of carriers \n\n[253 U.S. 71, 75]\n\u00a0\n to establish stockyards at their stations. Declaring that no difference in principle existed between the duty to furnish stockyards and the duty to install stock scales, the conclusion of the Commission was thus summed up:\n'After a very careful examination of the evidence in this record, this commission is of the opinion and finds that live stock scales are a necessary facility at stockyards for the weighing of live stock received for the purposes of shipment, not only for the convenience of the public at large, live stock buyers and individual shippers, but in the necessary weighing preliminary to properly loading and subsequent to the unloading of live stock at such stockyards, and that there is an actual public necessity for the installation of a stockyards scale at the stockyards of the defendant at its station at Albee, in Grant county, in this state.'\n\n Conforming to these conclusions, the order awarded directed the installation of a stock scale of a certain capacity 'in such a manner as to permit of the weighing of live stock loaded into and unloaded from cars at that station, as well as the weighing of stock received into the stockyards at Albee.'\n An intermediary court to which the case was removed held that as the furnishing of a stock scale was no part of the duty of a common carrier, the railway could not be compelled to furnish it without taking its property without due process of law, and that this result would be all the more flagrantly brought about by compelling the railway to furnish the scale upon the theory that if furnished it would afford a facility for the trading in cattle at the place where it was installed.\n The complainant and the Board of Railroad and Warehouse Commissioners, as appellants, in invoking the reversal of the judgment of the intermediary court and the affirmance of the order of the Board, as stated by the Supreme Court of the state, in that court relied solely upon \n\n[253 U.S. 71, 76]\n\u00a0\n two grounds:\n'First, that local buyers and sellers of live stock have the right to demand the installation of stockyard scales for their own convenience in buying live stock; and, second, that it is the duty of the carrier to furnish the shipper such facilities as will enable him to avoid underloading cars where the rate is fixed upon minimum loads, and to ascertain the cost of shipping stock in the car in excess of the minimum carload weight.'\n\n Disposing of the first of these contentions the court said:\n'The fallacy of the first proposition is so clear that discussion would be idle. The carrier owes no duty to the local buyer or seller of live stock until the stock is tendered at the stockyards for shipment.'\n\n In passing upon the second proposition the court quoted a passage from a text-book (10 Corpus Juris, 59), in which, after stating the general duty of a common carrier to furnish appliances necessary or appropriate for discharging its dutie as a common carrier, it was declared:\n'The duty of a carrier of live stock it is said cannot be efficiently discharged without the aid of pens or yards in which the live stock offered for shipment can be received and handled with safety and without inconvenience to the public, before being loaded in the cars in which they are to be transported and such duty is strictly analogous to the duty of the carrier to construct and maintain a secure depot for inanimate freight.'\n\n Applying such doctrine the court, without citation of authority or reference to any legislative enactment or administrative practice supporting the view, and without referring to the South Dakota statutes relied upon by the Board, making it obligatory upon the carrier to put in cattle pens at all stations, without imposing any such duty to put in cattle scales, but, on the contrary, giving power only to inspect such scales when put in, held, wholly as a matter of first impression, that the identity between the two (cattle yards and cattle scales) was so complete that \n\n[253 U.S. 71, 77]\n\u00a0\n the obligation which existed to erect cattle yards at every station also established the duty to install cattle scales at every station. The judgment of the intermediary court was therefore reversed and the order of the Board affirmed.\n Eliminating, as this conclusion did, all the questions pressed before the Board obviously with the purpose of taking the case out of the reach of the Minnesota decision, based upon a supposed duty to put in scales because of the advantage which would result to dealers in cattle, it clearly follows that this case is decisively controlled by the ruling in the Minnesota case, and therefore leaves us only the duty to apply that ruling. Coming to do so, the judgment below is therefore reversed and the cause remanded with directions for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREAT WESTERN SERUM CO. v.

Judgment went for the defendant, and we are asked to reverse it upon the ground that--\n'As a conclusion of law the court should have found that the Act of Congress of March 4, 1915, created an obligation to pay for the appellant's materials, and that the facts show an implied contract to purchase and to pay for such materials.'\n\n The act provides:\n'In case of an emergency arising out of the existence of foot and mouth disease, rinderpest, contagious pleuro pneumonia, or other contagious or infectious disease of animals, which in the opinion of the Secretary of Agriculture threatens the live stock industry of the country, he may expend in the city of Washington or elsewhere, out of any money in the treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sum of $2, 500,000, which sum is hereby appropriated, or so much thereof as he determines to be necessary, in the arrest and eradication of any such disease, including the payment of claims growing out of past and future purchases and destruction, in co-operation with the states, of animals affected by or exposed to, or of materials contaminated by or exposed to, any such disease, wherever found and irrespective of ownership, under like or substantially similar circumstances, when such owner has complied with all quarantine regulations, and said sum shall be immediately available for the purposes specified.' 38 Stat. 1115. \n\n[254 U.S. 240, 242]\n\u00a0\n There was no purchase of the destroyed articles or agreement therefor- none is claimed-and we think it quite clear that no contractual obligation by the United States to pay for them can be implied from the act itself.\n\n The judgment below must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","61":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREEN v. FRAZIER(1920)\nNo. 811\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Thomas C. Daggett, of St. Paul, Minn., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Frederick A. Pike, of St. Paul, Minn., for certain defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action by taxpayers of the state of North Dakota against Lynn J. Frazier, Governor, John N. \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 234]\n\u00a0\n Hagan, Commissioner of Agriculture and Labor, William Langer, Attorney General, and Obert Olson, State Treasurer, and the Industrial Commission of that state, to enjoin the enforcement of certain state legislation. The defendants Lynn J. Frazier, as Governor, William Langer, as Attorney General, and John Hagan, as Commissioner of Agriculture and Labor, constitute the Industrial Commission, created by the Act of February 25, 1919, of the Sixteenth Legislative Assembly of the state of North Dakota ( Laws 1919, c. 151).\n The laws involved were attacked on various grounds, state and federal. The Supreme Court of North Dakota sustained the constitutionality of the legislation. So far as the decision rests on state grounds it is conclusive, and we need not stop to inquire concerning it. Davis v. Hildebrant, \n241 U.S. 565\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 708. The only ground of attack involving the validity of the legislation which requires our consideration concerns the alleged deprivation of rights secured to the plaintiffs by the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution. It is contended that taxation under the laws in question has the effect of depriving plaintiffs of property without due process of law.\n The legislation involved consists of a series of acts passed under the authority of the state Constitution, which are: (1) An act creating an Industrial Commission of North Dakota, which is authorized to conduct and manage on behalf of that state certain utilities, industries, enterprises, and business projects, to be established by law. The act gives authority to the commission to manage, operate, control, and govern all utilities, enterprises, and business projects owned, undertaken, administered, or operated by the state of North Dakota, except those carried on in penal, charitable, or educational institutions. To that end certain powers and authority are given to the commission, among others: The right of eminent domain; to fix the buying price of things bought, \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 235]\n\u00a0\n and the selling price of things sold, incidental to the utilities, industries, enterprises, and business projects, and to fix rates and charges for services rendered, having in mind the accumulation of a fund with which to replace in the general funds of the state the amount received by the commission under appropriations made by the act; to procure the necessary funds for such utilities, industries, enterprises, and business projects by negotiating the bonds of the state in such amounts and in such manner as may be provided by law. $200,000 of the funds of the state are appropriated to carry out the provisions of the act . (2) The Bank of North Dakota Act (Laws 1919, c. 147), which establishes a bank under the name of 'The Bank of North Dakota,' operated by the state. The Industrial Commission is placed in control of the operation and management of the bank, and is given the right of eminent domain to acquire necessary property. Public funds are to be deposited in the bank, and the deposits are guaranteed by the state of North Dakota. Authority is given to transfer funds to other departments, institutions, utilities, industries, enterprises, or business projects, and to make loans to counties, cities, or political subdivisions of the state, or to state or national banks, on such terms as the commission may provide. Loans to individuals, associations, and private corporations are authorized, when secured by duly recorded first mortgages on lands in the state of North Dakota. An appropriation of $100,000 is made immediately available to carry out the provisions of the act. (3) An act (Laws 1919, c. 148) providing for the issuing of bonds of the state in the sum of $2,000,000, the proceeds of which are to constitute the capital of the Bank of North Dakota. The earnings of the bank are to be paid to the state treasurer. Tax levies are authorized sufficient to pay the interest on the bonds annually. The bonds shall mature in periods of five years, and the board of equalization is authorized to levy a tax in an amount \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n equal to one-fifth of the amount of their principal. The state treasurer is required to establish a bank bond payment fund into which shall be paid moneys received from taxation, from appropriations and from bank earnings. $ 10,000 is appropriated for the purpose of carrying the act into effect. (4) An act (Laws 1919, c. 154) providing for the issuing of bonds in the sum of not exceeding $10,000,000, to be known as 'Bonds of North Dakota, Real Estate Series.' These bonds are to be issued for the purpose of raising money to procure funds for the Bank of North Dakota to replace such funds as may have been employed by it from time to time in making loans upon first mortgages upon real estate. The faith and credit of the state of North Dakota are pledged for the payment of the bonds. Moneys derived from the sale of the bonds are to be placed by the Industrial Commission in the funds of the bank, and nothing in the act is to be construed to prevent the purchase of the bonds with any funds in the Bank of North Dakota. It is further provided that the state board of equalization shall, if it appears that the funds in the hands of the state treasurer are insufficient to pay either principal or interest, accruing within a period of one year thereafter, make a necessary tax levy to meet the indicated deficiency. Provision is made for the repeated exercise of the powers granted by the act, for the purposes stated. An appropriation of $10,000 is made for carrying into effect the provisions of this act. (5) An act ( Laws 1919, c. 152) declaring the purpose of the state of North Dakota to engage in the business of manufacturing and marketing farm products, and to establish a warehouse, elevator, and flour mill system under the name of 'North Dakota Mill & Elevator Association,' to be operated by the state. The purpose is declared that the state shall engage in the business of manufacturing farm products and for that purpose shall establish a system of warehouses, elevators, flu r mills, factories, plants, machinery \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n and equipment, owned, controlled, and operated by it under the name of the 'North Dakota Mill & Elevator Association.' The Industrial Commission is placed in control of the association, with full power, and it is authorized to acquire by purchase, lease, or right of eminent domain, all necessary property or properties, etc.; to buy, manufacture, store, mortgage, pledge, sell, and exchange all kinds of raw and manufactured farm products, and by-products, and to operate exchanges, bureaus, markets and agencies within and without the state, and in foreign countries. Provision is made for the bringing of a civil action against the state of North Dakota on account of causes of action arising out of the business. An appropriation is made out of state funds, together with the funds procured from the sale of state bonds, to be designated as the capital of the association. (6) An act (Laws 1919, c. 153) providing for the issuing of bonds of the state of North Dakota in a sum not exceeding $5,000,000, to be known as 'Bonds of North Dakota, Mill & Elevator Series,' providing for a tax and making other provisions for the payment of the bonds, and appropriations for the payment of interest and principal thereof. The bonds are to be issued and sold for the purpose of carrying on the business of the Mill & Elevator Association. The faith and credit of the state of North Dakota are pledged for the payment of the bonds, both principal and interest. These bonds may be purchased with funds in the Bank of North Dakota. Taxes are provided for sufficient to pay the bonds, principal and interest, taking into account the earnings of the association. The sum of $10,000 is appropriated from the general funds of the state to carry the provisions of the act into effect. (7) The Home Building Act (Laws 1919, c. 150) declares the purpose of the state to engage in the enterprise of providing homes for its residents and to that end to establish a business system operated by it under the name of the 'Home Building Association \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n of North Dakota,' and defines its duties and the extent of its powers. The Industrial Commission is placed in control of the 'Home Building Association,' and is given the power of eminent domain, and the right to purchase and lease the requisite property. Provision is made for the formation of home building unions. The price of town homes is placed at $5, 000, and of farm homes at $10,000. A bond issue of $2,000,000, known as 'Bonds of North Dakota, Home Building Series,' is provided for.\n There are certain principles which must be borne in mind in this connection, and which must control the decision of this court upon the federal question herein involved. This legislation was adopted under the broad power of the state to enact laws raising by taxation such sums as are deemed necessary to promote purposes essential to the general welfare of its people. Before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment this power of the state was unrestrained by any federal authority. That amendment introduced a new limitation upon state power into the federal Constitution. The states were forbidden to deprive persons of life, liberty or property without due process of law. What is meant by due process of law this court has had frequent occasion to consider, and has always declined to give a precise meaning, preferring to leave its scope to judicial decisions when cases from time to time arise. Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 100\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 14.\n The due process of law clause contains no specific limitation upon the right of taxation in the states, but it has come to be settled that the authority of the states to tax does not include the right to impose taxes for merely private purposes. Fallbrook Irrigation District v. Bradley, \n164 U.S. 155\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 56. In that case the province of this court in reviewing the power of state taxation was thoroughly discussed by the late Mr. Justice Peckham speaking \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n for the court. Concluding the discussion of that subject (\n164 U.S. 158\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 63), the Justice said:\n'In the Fourteenth Amendment the provision regarding the taking of private property is omitted, and the prohibition against the state is confined to its depriving any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law. It is claimed, however, that the citizen is deprived of his property without due process of law, if it be taken by or under state authority for any other than a public use, either under the guise of taxation or by the assumption of the right of eminent domain. In that way the question whether private property has been taken for any other than a public use becomes material in this court, even where the taking is under the authority of the state instead of the federal government.'\n\n Accepting this as settled by the former adjudications of this court, the enforcement of the principle is attended with the application of certain rules equally well settled.\n The taxing power of the states is primarily vested in their Legislatures, deriving their authority from the people. When a state Legislature acts within the scope of its authority it is responsible to the people, and their right to change the agents to whom they have intrusted the power is ordinarily deemed a sufficient check upon its abuse. When the constituted authority of the state undertakes to exert the taxing power, and the question of the validity of its action is brought before this court, every presumption in its favor is indulged, and only clear and demonstrated usurpation of power will authorize judicial interference with legislative action.\n In the present instance under the authority of the Constitution and laws prevailing in North Dakota the people, the Legislature, and the highest court of the state have declared the purpose for which these several acts were passed to be of a public nature, and within the taxing authority of the state. With this united action of people, \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n Legislature and court, we are not at liberty to interfere unless it is clear beyond reasonable controversy that rights secured by the federal Constitution have been violated. What is a public purpose has given rise to no little judicial consideration. Courts, as a rule, have attempted no judicial definition of a 'public' as distinguished from a 'private' purpose, but have left each case to be determined by its own peculiar circumstances. Gray, Limitations of Taxing Power,  176.\n'Necessity alone is not the test by which the limits of state authority in this direction are to be defined, but a wise statesmanship must look beyond the expenditures which are absolutely needful to continue the existence of organized government, and embrace others which may tend to make that government subserve the general well-being of society, and advance the present and prospective happiness and prosperity of the people.' Cooley, Justice, in People v. Salem, 20 Mich. 452, 4 Am. Rep. 400.\n\n Questions of policy are not submitted to judicial determination, and the courts have no general authority of supervision over the exercise of discretion which under our system is reposed in the people or other departments of government. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 569\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 259; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Kansas, \n233 U.S. 389\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 612, L. R. A. 1915C, 1189\n\n\n With the wisdom of such legislation, and the soundness of the economic policy involved we are not concerned. Whether it will result in ultimate good or harm it is not within our province to inquire.\n We come now to examine the grounds upon which the Supreme Court of North Dakota held this legislation not to amount to a taking of property without due process of law. The questions involved were given elaborate consideration in that court, and it held, concerning what may in general terms be denominated the 'banking legislation,' that it was justified for the purpose of providing \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 241]\n\u00a0\n banking facilities, and to enable the state to carry out the purposes of the other acts, of which the Mill & Elevator Association Act is the principal one. It justified the Mill & Elevator Association Act by the peculiar situation in the state of North Dakota, and particularly by the great agricultural industry of the state. It estimated from facts of which it was authorized to take judicial notice, that 90 per cent. of the wealth produced by the state was from agriculture, and stated that upon the prosperity and welfare of that industry other business and pursuits carried on in the state were largely dependent; that the state produced 125,000,000 bushels of wheat each year. The manner in which the present system of transporting and marketing this great crop prevents the realization of what are deemed just prices was elaborately stated. It was affirmed that the annual loss from these sources (including the loss of fertility to the soil and the failure to feed the by-products of grain to stock within the state), amounted to fifty-five millions of dollars to the wheat raisers of North Dakota. It answered the contention that the industries involved were private in their nature, by stating that all of them belonged to the state of North Dakota, and therefore the activities authorized by the legislation were to be distinguished from business of a private nature having private gain for its objective.\n As to the Home Building Act, that was sustained because of the promotion of the general welfare in providing homes for the people, a large proportion of whom were tenants moving from place to place. It was believed and affirmed by the Supreme Court of North Dakota that the opportunity to secure and maintain homes would promote the general welfare, and that the provisions of the statutes to enable this feature of the system to become effective would redound to the general benefit.\n As we have said, the question for us to consider and determine \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 242]\n\u00a0\n is whether this system of legislation is violative of the federal Constitution because it amounts to a taking of property without due process of law. The precise question herein involved so far as we have been able to discover has never been presented to this court. The nearest approach to it is found in Jones v. City of Portland, \n245 U.S. 217\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 112, L. R. A. 1918C, 765, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 660, in which we held that an act of the state of Maine (Rev. St. 1903, c. 4,  87) authorizing cities or towns to establish and maintain wood, coal and fuel yards for the purpose of selling these necessaries to the inhabitants of cities and towns, did not deprive taxpayers of due process of law within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In that case we reiterated the attitude of this court towards state legislation, and repeated what had been said before, that what was or was not a public use was a question concerning which local authority, legislative and judicial, had especial means of securing information to enable them to form a judgment, and particularly that the judgment of the highest court of the state, declaring a given use to be public in its nature, would be accepted by this court unless clearly unfounded. In that case the previous decisions of this court, sustaining this proposition, were cited with approval, and a quotation was made from the opinion of the Supreme Court of Maine justifying the legislation under the conditions prevailing in that state. We think the principle of that decision is applicable here.\n This is not a case of undertaking to aid private institutions by public taxation as was the fact in Citizens' Saving & Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 665. In many instances states and municipalities have in late years seen fit to enter upon projects to promote the public welfare which in the past have been considered entirely within the domain of private enterprise.\n Under the peculiar conditions existing in North Dakota, which are empa sized in the opinion of its highest court, \n\n[253 U.S. 233, 243]\n\u00a0\n if the state sees fit to enter upon such enterprises as are here involved, with the sanction of its Constitution, its Legislature and its people, we are not prepared to say that it is within the authority of this court, in enforcing the observance of the Fourteenth Amendment, to set aside such action by judicial decision.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","62":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARRIS v. BELL(1920)\nNo. 51\nArgued: January 26, 1920Decided: November 15, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 103, 104]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James C. Davis, of Muskogee, Okl., for appellants.\n Messrs. William M. Matthews, of Kansas City, Mo., and George S. Ramsey, of Muskogee, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By this suit certain conveyances of lands allotted in the name and right of a Creek Indian after his death were assailed, and their cancellation sought, by the heirs who \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 105]\n\u00a0\n made them. On the final hearing the District Court upheld two of the conveyances (235 Fed. 626), and that decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (250 Fed. 209, 162 C. C. A. 345). The present appeal is by the heirs.\n The circumstances to be considered are as follows: By the act of March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, as modified by the act of June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500, provision was made for the allotment and distribution of the Creek tribal lands and funds among the members of the tribe. An enrollment was to be made of (a) all members living on April 1, 1899; (b) all children born to members after that date up to and including July 1, 1900, and living on the latter date; and (c) all children born to members after July 1, 1900, up to and including May 25, 1901, and living on the latter date. All who were so enrolled were to share in the allotment and distribution. If any of these died before receiving his allotment and distributive share, the lands and moneys to which he 'would be entitled if living' were to 'descend to his heirs' and be 'allotted and distributed to them accordingly.' A provision in the act of March 3, 1905, plainly intended to amend and supplement the earlier acts, authorized the inclusion of all children born between May 25, 1901, and March 4, 1905, and living on the latter date. 33 Stat. 1071, c. 1479\n\n\n Originally all lands allotted to living members in their own right were subjected to specified restrictions on alienation; but those allotted in the right of deceased members were left unrestricted up to the passage of the act of April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137. Skelton v. Dill, \n235 U.S. 206\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 60; Adkins v. Arnold, \n235 \nU.S. 417, 420\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 118; Mullen v. United States, \n224 U.S. 448\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 494; Brader v. James, \n246 \nU.S. 88, 94\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 285; Talley v. Burgess, \n246 \nU.S. 104, 107\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 287. Section 19 of that act materially revised the restrictions respecting lands of living allottees, and section 22 dealt with the alienation of inherited lands, including, as this court has \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n held, lands allotted in the name and right of a member after his death. Talley v. Burgess, supra, \n246 U.S. 108\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 287. Section 22 read as follows:\n'That the adult heirs of any deceased Indian of either of the Five Civilized Tribes whose selection has been made, or to whom a deed or patent has been issued for his or her share of the land of the tribe to which he or she belongs or belonged, may sell and convey the lands inherited from such decedent; and if there be both adult and minor heirs of such decedent, then such minors may join in a sale of such lands by a guardian duly appointed by the proper United States court for the Indian Territory. And in case of the organization of a state or territory, then by a proper court of the county in which said minor or minors may reside or in which said real estate is situated, upon an order of such court made upon petition filed by guardian. All conveyances made under this provision by heirs who are full-blood Indians are to be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, under such rules and regulations as he may prescribe.'\n\n Section 5 of the same act directed that all patents or tribal deeds for allotments should issue 'in the name of the allottee'-meaning the member in whose right the allotment was made-and provided that if he were then dead the title should inure to and vest in 'his heirs,' as if the patent or deed 'had issued to the allottee during his life.' A like provison is found in section 32 of the act of June 25, 1910, c. 431, 36 Stat. 855.\n Further provisions bearing on the alienation of lands of living allottees and also inherited lands were embodied in the act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, to be noticed presently.\n The lands in question were allotted in the name and right of Freeland Francis, a Creek child who was born in 1903, was lawfully enrolled June 10, 1905, and died twelve days later. After his death the allotment was \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n duly selected and made by the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes, and in regular course a patent or deed was issued in his name. His heirs, to whom the title passed under the statutes already noticed, were his mother, Annie Francis (now Harris), his half-brother, Mack Francis, his brother, Amos, and his sister, Elizabeth. These were all enrolled Creeks-three being full-blood Indians and one a half-blood.\n January 15, 1908, after the allotment was perfected, the mother, who was an adult, sold and conveyed her interest, and that conveyance was approved by the Secretary of the Interior, July 6, 1910, the approval as indorsed on the deed reading:\n'The conveyance by Annie Francis of her interest as full-blood Indian heir in and to the within described lands allotted to Freeland Francis, a new-born Creek citizen, Roll No. 1070, who died prior to May 27, 1908, is hereby approved in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress approved April 26, 1906.'\n\n The half-brother, Mack, sold and conveyed his interest in 1910, after he attained his majority, but the validity of that transaction is not questioned. He was not a full-blood Indian, but a half-blood.\n January 15, 1912, the interest of Amos and Elizabeth, who were minors, was sold and conveyed by their guardian under the direction and approving order of the county court wherein the guardianship of their persons and property was pending.\n At the time of Freeland's death the family was residing in that part of the Indian Territory which on the advent of statehood (November 16, 1907) became Wagoner county, and shortly after his death they removed to and ever since have resided in what became Okmulgee county. The lands are in the latter county and it was in the county court thereof that the guardian's sale and conveyance were directed and approved. \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n The conveyance by the mother, who was a full-blood Indian, and that by the guardian of Amos and Elizabeth, who were full bloods, are the ones to be considered on this appeal. All rights under them are held by parties who were defendants in the District Court and are appellees here.\n The grounds on which the conveyances are assailed are four in number- one directed at both conveyances, one at that of the mother alone and two solely at that of the guardian. They will be taken up in this order.\n\n 1. \nIt is urged that the heirs took the lands as allottees and not as heirs of Freeland-in other words, that they received the lands as a direct allotment to them and not as an inheritance-and therefor that such of them as were full-blood Indians were restrained and disabled from disposing of the lands by reason of the restrictions applicable to living allottees of the full blood. If the premise were right, the conclusion would be unavoidable. See section 19, act of 1906, supra, and section 1, act of 1908, supra. But the premise is not right, as is shown by statutes already mentioned, such as section 28 of the act of 1901, section 7 of the act of 1902 and section 5 of the act of 1906. The allotment was made in virtue of the right of Freeland, who was one of those among whom the tribal property was to be distributed. Under the statutes that right was not extinguished by his death but was preserved for his heirs; and it was preserved for them because they were his heirs; and not because their relation to it was otherwise different from that of other members of the tribe. Such individual claims as they had to the tribal lands were to be satisfied by their individual allotments. What they were to receive in the right of Freeland was the lands and moneys to which 'he would be entitled if living'; and these were to 'descend' to and vest in them as 'his heirs,' as if he had received the same 'during his life.' Putting aside the distinctions between title by purchase and title by descent \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n which prevail in the absence of controlling statutes, and giving effect to the letter and spirit of what Congress has enacted, we think it is manifest that these heirs must be regarded as having received these lands as an inheritance from Freeland, and not as a direct allotment to them. Perryman v. Woodward, \n238 \nU.S. 148, 150\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 830; Talley v. Burgess, supra.\n\n 2. \nThe first restrictions applicable to Creek lands such as these were embodied in section 22 of the act of 1906, hereinbefore set forth. As respects the mother's conveyance, which was executed January 15, 1908, all that was necessary under that section to make the conveyance effective-the mother being an adult full-blood Indian-was that it be approved by the Secretary of the Interior. As before shown, it was approved by that officer July 6, 1910. But it is urged that before his approval was given all power to approved had been taken from him and lodged elsewhere by the act of May 27, 1908. Evidently the Secretary did not so construe that act when his approval was given, else he would have withheld it. Not only so, but his action in this instance was in accord with the practice of his office for a considerable period and also with an opinion rendered to him by the Attorney General. 27 Op. Attys. Gen. 530. This administrative view is, of course, entitled to respect, and those who have relied thereon ought not lightly to be put in peril. But it is not controlling. We have examined the act, including section 9, upon which reliance is had, and are of opinion that as to conveyances made prior to the act the power of the Secretary to examine and approve or disapprove under section 22 of the prior enactment was not taken away. The act contains no express revocation of that power, nor any provision inconsistent with its continued exercise as to prior conveyances. The provision in section 9, that no conveyance of any interest of any fullblood Indian heir shall be valid 'unless approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n estate' of the deceased allottee, taken according to its natural import, prescribes a rule for future rather than prior conveyances; and no reason is perceived for rejecting its natural import. Had there been a purpose to cut off action by the Secretary as to conveyances already made, some of which were before him at the time, it is but reasonable to believe that other words aptly expressing that purpose would have been used. The matter hardly would have been left to conjecture or uncertain implication. Besides, the absence of such a purpose is measurably reflected by the declaration in section 1 that 'the Secretary of the Interior shall not be prohibited by this act from continuing to remove restrictions as heretofore.' The lapse of two and one-half years between the execution of the conveyance and its approval is not material, there being no lawful intervening disposal. Pickering v. Lomax, \n145 U.S. 310\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 860; Lykins v. McGrath, \n184 U.S. 169\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 450.\n\n 3. \nSection 6 of the act of 1908 subjects the persons and property of minor allottees to the jurisdiction of the probate courts of the state, and in a proviso says:\n'No restricted lands of living minors shall be sold or incumbered, except by leases authorized by law, by order of the court or otherwise.'\n\n One ground on which the guardian's sale on behalf of the minor heirs, Amos and Elizabeth, is assailed is that it was in violation of this proviso. But in our opinion the proviso does not include or affect inherited lands. It refers, as a survey of the act shows, to lands of living minor allottees and not to lands inherited from deceased allottees. Section 9 expressly recognizes that the latter may be sold, and this proviso cannot be taken as prescribing the contrary. The word 'living' evidently is intended to mark the distinction. What is intended is to make sure that minor allottees receive the benefit of the restrictions prescribed in section 1, and not to impose others. Apparently it was apprehended that the general language of section 6 might be taken as enabling probate \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n courts and guardians to sell without regard to those restrictions and the office of the proviso is to prevent this. So understood, it is in accord with the general scheme of the act and not in conflict with any other provision.\n\n 4. \nThe remaining objection to the guardian's conveyance is that it was not approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of Freeland, the deceased allottee.\n The situation out of which the objection arises is at least novel. Freeland died June 22, 1905, and the conveyance was made January 15, 1912. Statehood had intervened and counties had been organized where there were none before. He resided and died in what afterwards became Wagoner county, and under the local law the county court of that county is the one which at the time of the conveyance would have had jurisdiction of the settlement of his estate. The court in the Indian Territory which would have had such jurisdiction prior to statehood was no longer in existence. The conveyance was not approved by the county court of Wagoner county, but was approved by the county court of Okmulgee county, which under the local law was the only court having jurisdiction of the guardianship of the persons and property of the minors, Amos and Elizabeth. The lands were in that county and the minors, as also the other heirs, were residing there.\n Section 6 of the act of 1908 and other congressional enactments explicitly subject the persons and property of Indian minors of the Five Civilized Tribes to the jurisdiction of the probate courts of Oklahoma. In that state the county courts are the probate courts.\n Section 9 of the same act declares:\n'That the death of any allottee of the Five Civilized Tribes shall operate to remove all restrictions upon the alienation of said allottee's land: Provided, that no conveyance of any interest of any full-blood Indian heir in \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n such land shall be valid unless approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of said deceased allottee.'\n\n If in this instance the same court had had jurisdiction of the guardianship of the minor heirs and of the settlement of the estate of the deceased allottee, no embarrassment would have ensued; but as that was not the case, the question arises whether it was essential that the guardian's conveyance, directed and approved as it was, by the court having control of the guardianship, should also be approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the deceased allottee's estate. The Circuit Court of Appeals answered in the negative; and, while the question is not free from difficulty, we think that solution of it is right.\n Of course, the purpose in requiring any approval is to safeguard the interests of the full-blood Indian heir. Where he is a minor he can convey only through a guardian, and no court is in a better situation to appreciate and safeguard his interests than the one wherein the guardianship is pending. Besides, as a general rule, a guardianship carries with it exclusive power to direct the guardian and to supervise the management and disposal of the ward's property. It is so in Oklanhoma. This rule is so widely recognized and so well grounded in reason that a purpose to depart from it ought not to be assumed unless manifested by some very clear or explicit provision. The act of 1908 contains no manifestation of such a purpose outside the proviso in section 9. That proviso seems broad, but so is the provision in section 6 subjecting the persons and property of minor Indians to local guardianship. As both are in the same act, they evidently were intended to operate harmoniously and should be construed accordingly. The proviso does not mention minors under guardianship; and to regard its general words as including them will either take all supervision of the sale of their interest in \n\n[254 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n inherited lands from the court in which the guardianship is pending, or subject that court's action to the approval of another court of the same rank. In either event conflict and confusion will almost certainly ensue and be detrimental to the minor heirs. But, if the proviso be regarded, as well it may, as referring to heirs not under guardianship-in other words, to adult heirs-the two provisions will operate in entire harmony and all full-blood heirs will receive the measure of protection intended. We think this is the true construction.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAUPT v. U S(1920)\nNo. 85\nArgued: November 10, 1920Decided: December 6, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Benjamin Carter, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Daniel L. Morris, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Aransas Pass is an inlet, naturally too shallow for ocean navigation, connecting the waters of the Gulf of Mexico and those of Aransas Bay and the bay of Corpus Christi on the coast of Texas. The problem of obtaining a navigable channel through this pass occupied the attention of the government and of private enterprise for many \n\n[254 U.S. 272, 273]\n\u00a0\n years prior to 1912, when a channel of the desired depth of 20 feet was obtained.\n This is a suit instituted by the appellant, Haupt, a distinguished engineer and the patentee of improvements in dikes and breakwaters, to recover a large sum of money for the use which he claims the government made of his invention in the construction of jetties, which, with dredging, resulted in the creating of the Aransas Pass channel in 1912. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition holding that no contract, express or implied, with the United States was shown for the use of appellant's patented invention and that it was therefore without jurisdiction.\n A resume of what was done in the effort to procure the channel, which is necessary to a decision of the case, will develop the relations of the appellant to the enterprise and to the government on which he bases his claim.\n Between 1880 and 1889 the United States government constructed what is designated in the record as the 'Mansfield Jetty,' 5,500 feet in length, designed to deepen the channel through the Pass; but it had no appreciable effect on the depth of water and the work was suspended in 1889\n\n\n In 1890 the state of Texas chartered the Aransas Pass Harbor Company, a private corporation, organized for the purpose of improving the channel at Aransas Pass, and in the same year Congress authorized (26 Stat. 105) the company to construct such jetties and breakwaters as might be necessary to create and permanently maintain a navigable channel 'across the outer bar which obstructs the entrance to Aransas Pass harbor.' This company built the jetty designated in the record as the 'Nelson jetty,' about 1,800 feet in length, which also failed to deepen the channel and was abandoned in 1893.\n In 1894 another act of Congress (28 Stat. 26) granted an extension of time to the same company to further pursue its objects, and at this point in the history the appellant appeared \n\n[254 U.S. 272, 274]\n\u00a0\n with United States patent No. 380,569 for certain improvements in dikes and breakwaters for improving the channels of rivers and harbors.\n In the view we take of the case it will be a sufficient statement of the principle involved in, and of the claims of, appellant's patent to say that the inventor aimed to accomplish results with a single jetty, of a form specially adapted to each locality, which had theretofore been accomplished only with two or more jetties. The claims are variously worded, as usual, but the substance of the alleged discovery is, that the study of the conformation of the bottom and shores of a given locality and of the prevailing currents, tidal and other, will enable one skilled in the art to so apply the principles disclosed in the patent as to give such form and location to a single breakwater or jetty that it will 'cut the advancing waves' and 'resist and decompose the flood resultant' in such manner that, without the aid of a second jetty or of dredging, it will scour out and main tain a channel of the required depth in a designated location.\n The appellant granted a license to the Aransas Pass Harbor Company to use his patented device or design, on condition that the work should be done under his supervision, and he thereupon prepared the necessary plans and drawings for the construction which he thought would effectuate the desired result. The cost of the jetty, as thus designed by the appellant, was too great for the resources of the company and, upon request, he eliminated a portion of it which reduced the estimated cost by one-half. The jetty thus modified consisted of a reverse curve or letter  and a contract for the construction of it was let in July, 1895. Work was prosecuted vigorously until the following January, by which time it was ascertained that a portion of the first, the 'Mansfield jetty,' which had been reported officially as having disappeared, was still in place and in such a position, it was claimed, as to \n\n[254 U.S. 272, 275]\n\u00a0\n prevent free erosion by the currents as they had been and would be modified by the new jetty under construction. Thereupon a contract was let for the removal of a part of the 'Mansfield jetty,' but in May, 1897, before the new jetty was completed or the old one removed, all work was suspended.\n This suspension in the month of May, 1897, marks the end of the effort to obtain the desired channel through private enterprise, and Congress, in May of the following year, by resolution called upon the Secretary of War to prepare and submit plans for the deepening of the Pass to at least 20 feet. Six months later a board created by the War Department reported in favor of two jetties, to be supplemented by dredging. It was recommended that the northerly jetty should be located substantially upon the line of the one partially constructed by the Aransas Pass Harbor Company and the other some distance southerly from it.\n While the subject was thus before Congress, appellant brought his plan for dealing with the problem to the attention of the committee, and proposed to enter into a contract to construct and maintain the desired channel for a much less sum of money than the estimated cost of the work recommended by the War Department board. His proposition was given serious attention and, although it was rejected, he was assured by members of the congressional committee that they desired to give his plan a trial, as well they might, for, if it had proved successful, it would have resulted in a great saving to the government in dealing with many like situations and problems.\n Before any further work was done, the Aransas Pass Harbor Company conveyed to the United States the jetty or breakwater, which we have seen was constructed as designed by appellant, and Congress, in 1899, appropriated $60,000 for dredging and improving the Pass, but with the proviso that the Secretary of War was authorized 'to \n\n[254 U.S. 272, 276]\n\u00a0\n contract for the removal of that portion of the old government jetty (the Mansfield jetty) in said harbor from the end nearest the curved jetty' Constructed by the Aransas Pass Harbor Company, but in such manner as not to interfere with that jetty. This is a plain indication of interest on the part of Congress in appellant's theory or method of dealing with the problem, for he was claiming that the old jetty constituted an obstruction to the action of the water and prevented the jetty which the Harbor Company had built under his direction from scouring out the desired channel.\n That appropriation was expended and three years later, in 1902, Congress appropriated $250,000 for continuing the improvement of the Pass, but again with the proviso:\n'That the work shall be confined to the completion of the north jetty, in accordance with the designs and specifications of the Aransas Pass Harbor Company, and in the continuance of the work heretofore carried out on said jetty by said company.'\n\n Here again is plainly evidenced the purpose of Congress to give appellant's theory a full and fair trial, for, it should be noted, as yet it had never been reduced to actual practice.\n Plans and specifications for the contract under this second appropriation were drawn by the government engineer in charge and were by him submitted to the Aransas Pass Harbor Company and the appellant suggested amendments, which were adopted. Among other things done under this contract was the removal of a considerable part of the Mansfield jetty which the appellant had claimed so affected the action of the currents as to prevent the obtaining of the desired results from his construction.\n Three years later, in 1905, Congress appropriated a further sum of $ 100,000, and in 1906 a like amount, for the improvement of the Pass and in each case the provision was incorporated that the money was to be applied to \n\n[254 U.S. 272, 277]\n\u00a0\n construction 'in accordance with the design and specifications of the Aransas Pass Harbor Company and in continuation of the work heretofore done.'\n The findings of the Court of Claims are: That in compliance with the provisions of these various acts the work of improvement was continued and completed in 1906, in accordance with the plans and specifications, as modified by appellant; that from 1896 to 1906 the depth and width of the channel were variable and shifting, with a ruling depth of only 6 feet of water in 1908; and that the evidence does not show to the satisfaction of the court that the so-called Haupt jetty, which was constructed under appellant's direction, 'did produce, or would have produced, a navigable channel of the necessary or proper depth for navigation purposes.'\n It is upon the terms in which the three appropriations were made in 1902, 1905, and 1906, each for the construction or completion of the project 'in accordance with the design and specifications of the Aransas Pass Harbor Company,' that the appellant relies, and from them, it is argued, that a contract to pay him for the use of his design and for the impairment of his patent should be derived. But we not only have the Court of Claims finding that the experiment of attempting to procure the desired channel by appellant's method and under his plans, pursued through many years and definitely for 4 years, from 1902 to 1906, at an expense to the government of $450,000, resulted in failure, but we have the further action of Congress, next to be described, which clearly shows the correctness of the court's conclusion.\n In March, 1906, as we have seen, the work of improvement according to the plans as modified by the appellant was completed without securing the required channel. In the following December a board appointed by the War Department to further consider the Aransas Pass project, recommended that the spacing which Haupt had left \n\n[254 U.S. 272, 278]\n\u00a0\n between the end of his jetty and St. Joseph's Island, for its influence on the currents, should be closed and that a parallel jetty should be built to the south of the Haupt jetty, thus making the project one of two jetties, instead of the single jetty of appellant's plan.\n In 1907 Congress appropriated $200,000, and authorized contracts for the additional amount of $290,000 for improving the Pass 'in accordance with the plans submitted in its report of December 22, 1906, by the board of engineers created by authority of the act of June 13, 1902.' It will be seen that all reference to appellant's method of solving the problem disappeared from this act, which adopted the new plan of solution.\n Contracts were made under this appropriation of 1907 and a second jetty, generally parallel to the Haupt jetty, was commenced in March, 1908, and completed in 1911. The Court of Claims finds: That, beginning with 1912, coastwise and seagoing vessels have been going through the Pass and that in that year the port of 'Aransas Pass' was given the status of a commercial port on a par with Galveston by the Railway Commission of Texas; that 'dredging was necessarily done in the years 1912 and 1915, inclusive, to obtain a proper navigable depth of channel in the pass'; and that this construction as ultimately completed 'did not embody and of the devices of the plaintiff's (appellant's) letters patent No. 380,569.'\n It is, of course, essential to recovery by appellant on a quantum meruit, that he should prove a contract express or implied, on the part of the government to pay him, that his patented method of construction was used, and what the value of it was. Gibbons v. United States, 8 Wall. 269; Ball Engineering Co. v. White Company, \n250 U.S. 46\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 396. The three acts requiring the money appropriated to be used in accordance with the design and specifications of the Aransas Pass Harbor Company, which were prepared by \n\n[254 U.S. 272, 279]\n\u00a0\n appellant, implied clearly that Congress intended to give the experimental construction of appellant a fair trial and common honesty would infer a disposition, but not a contract, to pay for the use of the patented form of construction, if it should be found to be valuable. But, saying as much as it did, the failure of Congress to say more imports a determination on its part to hold within its discretion the decision as to the usefulness of appellant's ideas and as to what, if anything, should be paid for them. The absence of any reference to appellant or to his patent and of any words implying a contract to pay him, from the three acts of Congress in which reference is so distinctly made to the specifications embodying his ideas, is unmistakable evidence that Congress deliberately dealt with appellant's theories as still in the experimental stage, and that it was willing to use the public money to give them a trial in practice, but that payment for them was reserved for consideration until their usefulness should be established, and this, the finding by the Court of Claims shows, was never done.\n For these reasons, to the sufficient finding that the construction which produced the desired channel did not embody any of the devices of the appellant's patent, we must add that the record fails wholly to show anything from which a promise by the government to pay for the use of such devices can reasonably be implied, and therefore the judgment of the Court of Claims must be affirmed.\n Being of opinion that our conclusion would not be affected by any findings to be made on the points asked for in the appellant's motion to remand for additional findings of fact, that motion is denied.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAWKE v.

A demurrer to the petition was sustained in the court of common pleas. Its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals of Franklin County, which judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Ohio, and the case was brought here.\n A joint resolution proposing to the states this amendment to the Constitution of the United States was adopted on the 3d day of December, 1917. 40 Stat. 1050. The amendment prohibits the manufacture, sale or transportation of \n\n[253 U.S. 221, 225]\n\u00a0\n intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from, the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes. The several states were given concurrent power to enforce the amendment by appropriate legislation. The resolution provided that the amendment should be inoperative unless ratified as an amendment of the Constitution by the Legislatures of the several states, as provide in the Constitution, within seven years from the date of the submission thereof to the states. The Senate and House of Representatives of the state of Ohio adopted a resolution ratifying the proposed amendment by the General Assembly of the state of Ohio, and ordered that certified copies of the joint resolution of ratification be forwarded by the Governor to the Secretary of State at Washington and to the presiding officer of each House of Congress. This resolution was adopted on January 7, 1919; on January 27, 1919, the Governor of Ohio complied with the resolution. On january 29, 1919, the Secretary of State of the United States proclaimed the ratification of the amendment, naming 36 states as having ratified the same, among them the state of Ohio.\n The question for our consideration is: Whether the provision of the Ohio Constitution, adopted at the general election, November, 1918, extending the referendum to the ratification by the General Assembly of proposed amendments to the federal Constitution is in conflict with article 5 of the Constitution of the United States. The amendment of 1918 provides:\n'The people also reserve to themselves the legislative power of the referendum on the action of the General Assembly ratifying any proposed amendment to the Constitution of the United States.'\n\n Article 5 of the federal Constitution provides:\n'The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments \n\n[253 U.S. 221, 226]\n\u00a0\n to this Constitution, or, on the application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress: Provided that no amendment which may be made prior to the year one thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any manner affect the first and fourth clauses in the ninth section of the first article; and that no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate.'\n\n The Constitution of the United States was ordained by the people, and, when duly ratified, it became the Constitution of the people of the United States. McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 402. The states surrendered to the general government the powers specifically conferred upon the nation, and the Constitution and the laws of the United States are the supreme law of the land.\n The framers of the Constitution realized that it might in the progress of time and the development of new conditions require changes, and they intended to provide an orderly manner in which these could be accomplished; to that end they adopted the fifth article.\n This article makes provision for the proposal of amendments either by two-thirds of both houses of Congress, or on application of the Legislatures of two-thirds of the states; thus securing deliberation and consideration before any change can be proposed. The proposed change can only become effective by the ratification of the Legislatures of three- fourths of the states, or by conventions in a like number of states. The method of ratification is left to the choice of Congress. Both methods of ratification, by Legislatures or conventions, call for \n\n[253 U.S. 221, 227]\n\u00a0\n action by deliberative assemblages representative of the people, which it was assumed would voice the will of the people.\n The fifth article is a grant of authority by the people to Congress. The determination of the method of ratification is the exercise of a national power specifically granted by the Constitution; that power is conferred upon Congress, and is limited to two methods, by action of the Legislatures of three-fourths of the states, or conventions in a like number of states. Dodge v. Woolsey, 18 How. 331, 348. The framers of the Constitution might have adopted a different method. Ratification might have been left to a vote of the people, or to some authority of government other than that selected. The language of the article is plain, and admits of no doubt in its interpretation. It is not the function of courts or legislative bodies, national or state, to alter the method which the Constitution has fixed.\n All of the amendments to the Constitution have been submitted with a requirement for legislative ratification; by this method all of them have been adopted.\n The only question really for determination is: What did the framers of the Constitution mean in requiring ratification by 'legislatures'? That was not a term of uncertain meaning when incorporated into the Constitution. What it meant when adopted it still means for the purpose of interpretation. A Legislature was then the representative body which made the laws of the people. The term is often used in the Constitution with this evident meaning. Article 1, section 2, prescribes the qualifications of electors of Congressmen as those 'requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state Legislature.' Article 1, section 3, provided that Senators shall be chosen in each state by the Legislature thereof, and this was the method of choosing senators until the adoption of the Seventeenth Amendment, which made \n\n[253 U.S. 221, 228]\n\u00a0\n provision for the election of Senators by vote of the people, the electors to have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state Legislature. That Congress and the states understood that this election by the people was entirely distinct from legislative action is shown by the provision of the amendment giving the Legislature of any state the power to authorize the executive to make temporary appointments until the people shall fill the vacancies by election. It was never suggested, so far as we are aware, that the purpose of making the office of Senator elective by the people could be accomplished by a referendum vote. The necessity of the amendment to accomplish the purpose of popular election is shown in the adoption of the amendment. In article 4 the United States is required to protect every state against domestic violence upon application of the Legislature, or of the executive when the Legislature cannot be convened. Article 6 requires the members of the several Legislatures to be bound by oath, or affirmation, to support the Constitution of the United States. By article 1, section 8, Congress is given exclusive jurisdiction over all places purchased by the consent of the Legislature of the state in which the same shall be. Article 4, section 3, provides that no new states shall be carved out of old states without the consent of the Legislatures of the states concerned.\n There can be no question that the framers of the Constitution clearly understood and carefully used the terms in which that instrument referred to the action of the Legislatures of the states. When they intended that direct action by the people should be had they were no less accurate in the use of apt phraseology to carry out such purpose. The members of the House of Representatives were required to be chosen by the people of the several states. Article 1, section 2.\n The Constitution of Ohio in its present form, although \n\n[253 U.S. 221, 229]\n\u00a0\n making provision for a referendum, vests the legislative power primarily in a General Assembly, consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives. Article 2, section 1, provides:\n'The legislative power of the state shall be vested in a General Assembly consisting of a Senate and House of Representatives, but the people reserve to themselves the power to propose to the General Assembly laws and amendments to the Constitution, and to adopt or reject the same at the polls on a referendum vote as hereinafter provided.'\n\n The argument to support the power of the state to require the approval by the people of the state of the ratification of amendments to the federal Constitution through the e dium of a referendum rests upon the proposition that the federal Constitution requires ratification by the legislative action of the states through the medium provided at the time of the proposed approval of an amendment. This argument is fallacious in this-ratification by a state of a constitutional amendment is not an act of legislation within the proper sense of the word. It is but the expression of the assent of the state to a proposed amendment.\n At an early day this court settled that the submission of a constitutional amendment did not require the action of the President. The question arose over the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment. Hollingsworth et al. v. Virginia, 3 Dall. 378. In that case is was contended that the amendment had not been proposed in the manner provided in the Constitution as an inspection of the original roll showed that it had never been submitted to the President for his approval in accordance with article 1, section 7, of the Constitution. The Attorney General answered that the case of amendments is a substantive act, unconnected with the ordinary business of legislation, and not within the policy or terms of the Constitution investing \n\n[253 U.S. 221, 230]\n\u00a0\n the President with a qualified negative on the acts and resolutions of Congress. In a footnote to this argument of the Attorney General, Justice Chase said:\n'There can, surely, be no necessity to answer that argument. The negative of the President applies only to the ordinary cases of legislation. He has nothing to do with the proposition, or adoption, of amendments to the Constitution.'\n\n The court by a unanimous judgment held that the amendment was constitutionally adopted.\n It is true that the power to legislate in the enactment of the laws of a state is derived from the people of the state. But the power to ratify a proposed amendment to the federal Constitution has its source in the federal Constitution. The act of ratification by the state derives its authority from the federal Constitution to which the state and its people have alike assented.\n This view of the amendment is confirmed in the history of its adoption found in 2 Watson on the Constitution, 1301 et seq. Any other view might lead to endless confusion in the manner of ratification of federal amendments. The choice of means of ratification was wisely withheld from conflicting action in the several states.\n But it is said this view runs counter to the decision of this court in Davis v. Hildebrant, \n241 \nU.S. 565\n, 36 S. Ct. 708. But that case is inapposite. It dealt with article 1 section 4, of the Constitution, which provides that the times, places, and manners of holding elections for Senators and Representatives in each state shall be determined by the respective Legislatures thereof, but that Congress may at any time make or alter such regulations, except as to the place for choosing Senators. As shown in the opinion in that case, Congress had itself recognized the referendum as part of the legislative authority of the state for the purpose stated. It was held, affirming the judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio, that the referendum provision of the state Constitution, when applied to a law redistricting the state with a \n\n[253 U.S. 221, 231]\n\u00a0\n view to representation in Congress, was not unconstitutional. Article 1, section 4, plainly gives authority to the state to legislate within the limitations therein named. Such legislative action is entirely different from the requirement of the Constitution as to the expression of assent or dissent to a proposed amendment to the Constitution. In such expression no legislative action is authorized or required.\n It follows that the court erred in holding that the state had authority to require the submission of the ratification to a referendum under the state Constitution, and its judgment is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","66":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHAYS v. PORT OF SEATTLE(1920)\nNo. 70\nArgued: November 12, 1919Decided: January 5, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. William F. Hays, of Seattle, Wash., pro se.\n Messrs. L. T. Turner, C. E. Claypool, and Harold Preston, all of Seattle, Wash., for appellees. \n\n[251 U.S. 233, 234]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant filed his bill in equity for an injunction to restrain the enforcement of an act of the Legislature of the state of Washington, approved March 11, 1913 (Sess. Laws, p. 195), entitled 'An act vacating a portion of Smith's Cove waterway, in the city of Seattle, and vesting the title of the vacated portion in the port of Seattle,' upon the ground (a) that it impaired the obligation of an existing contract between him and the state, in violation of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States; and (b) that it deprived him of property without due process of law, contrary to section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment. The District Court on final hearing dismissed the bill (226 Fed. 287), and the case is brought here by direct appeal under section 238, Judicial Code ( Act March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1157 [Comp. St.  1215]), because of the constitutional questions.\n The facts, shortly stated are as follows: Under an act of the Legislature approved March 9, 1893 (Sess. Laws, p. 241), which made provision for the excavation by private contract of waterways for the uses of navigation, complainant and another party to whose rights he has succeeded obtained a contract with the state, acting by the Commissioner of Public Lands, which was approved by the Governor on March 7, 1896. It provided for the excavation by complainant of Smith's Cove waterway, in Seattle Harbor, extending from the outer harbor line through the intervening tide lands to the head of Smith's Cove, the excavated material to be used for filling in and raising above high tide the adjacent tide and shore lands belonging to the state of Washington. For doing this he was to be entitled to compensation equivalent to the cost of the work plus 15 per centum and interest, for which he was to have a lien upon the tide and shore lands so filled in. The state agreed to hold these lands subject to the operation of the contract pending its execution, and \n\n[251 U.S. 233, 235]\n\u00a0\n subject to the ultimate lien of the contractor thereon, and that it would perform by its authorized agents all things required by the act of 1893 to be performed by the state. The contract provided for and specified the character of the bulkheads and retaining walls to be used, reserving, however, to the Commissioner of Public Lands the right to modify these plans and specifications as to 'shape, form, and character of material' as might appear necessary. The contract required complainant at his own cost to excavate also a waterway to extend from the north end of the Smith's Cove waterway across the peninsula separating the cove from Salmon Bay, such excavation to be made under the direction and in accordance with the plans of an engineer to be designated by the Governor of the state or the Secretary of War of the United States, and when excavated to be owned, possessed, and controlled by the United States or by the state, free of cost to them, if the right of way and the privilege of excavating across the peninsula should be accorded to the contractor free of cost or if fair compensation should be made to him therefor. Work was to be commenced within 60 days and completed within 2 years from the date of approval.\n On May 4, 1896, complainant entered upon performance of the contract and commenced driving piles for the construction of a bulkhead. Almost immediately he was notified by the Commissioner of Public Lands that the latter elected to exercise the right, as provided by the contract, to change the form of bulkhead. This had the effect of requiring a suspension of work until modified plans and specifications for the bulkheads should be prepared. Complainant did suspend the work, and it never was resumed thereafter. There were negotiations and correspondence between him and the Commissioner of Public Lands looking to the preparation of the modified plans and specifications, but they resulted in nothing. \n\n[251 U.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n Each party seems to have insisted that it was the duty of the other to furnish them.\n Complainant contends that he was at all times ready and prepared to carry out the contract on his part, but was prevented from doing so by acts and omissions of the state and its representatives, including the failure to furnish plans for the modified form of bulkhead and a failure to furnish complainant with a right of way across the peninsula between the head of Smith's Cove and Salmon Bay. Defendants contend that repeatedly, and in particular in the month of November, 1898, complainant was notified that his plans were wholly inadequate and would be insufficient for the purpose for which the retaining wall was designed, and that on the latter occasion he was notified to submit proper plans and specifications and to commence operations within ten days after their approval.\n While the excavation project thus remained in suspense, and pursuant to an act authorizing establishment of port districts, approved March 14, 1911 (Sess. Laws, p. 412), the port of Seattle was established as a municipal corporation with territorial limits including Smith's Cove waterway, Salmon Bay, and the intervening peninsula. This act conferred extensive powers for the regulation, control, and improvement of the harbor and navigable and nonnavigable waters within such district, in the interest of the public.\n Thereafter, by the statute that is now under attack (Sess. Laws 1913, p. 195) it was enacted that the northerly part of the Smith's Cove waterway should be vacated and the title thereto vested in the port of Seattle. Complainant was fully advised of this legislative measure, even prior to its enactment.\n After it took effect, which was in June, 1913, the port commission took possession of the waterway, exercised control over it, and did a considerable amount of excavation, \n\n[251 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n filling, and bulkhead construction, having spent large sums of money therein between the taking effect of the act and November 14, 1914, when the bill of complaint was filed.\n Coming to the questions raised upon the present appeal: The averments of the bill setting up the alleged obligations of complainant's contract with the state, and the contention that they were impaired by the act of 1913, presented a controversy under the Constitution of the United States, and (a sufficient amount being involved) conferred jurisdiction upon the federal court irrespective of the citizenship of the parties, and at the same time warranted a direct appeal to this court under section 238, Judicial Code. Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 508\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88.\n The merits remain for determination.\n Upon the first constitutional point, it is important to note the distinction between a statute that has the effect of violating or repudiating a contract previously made by the state and one that impairs its obligation. Had the Legislature of Washington, pending performance or after complete performance by complainant, passed an act to alter materially the scope of his contract, to diminish his compensation, or to defeat his lien upon the filled lands, there would no doubt have been an attempted impairment of the obligation. The legislation in question had no such purpose or effect. It simply, after 17 years of delay without substantial performance of the contract, provided that the project should be abandoned and title to the public lands turned over to the municipality. Supposing the contract had not been abandoned by complainant himself or terminated by his long delay, its obligation remained as before, and formed the measure of his right to recover from the state for the damages sustained. Brown v. Colorado, \n106 \nU.S. 95, 98\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 175; St. paul Gaslight Co. v. St. Raul, \n181 U.S. 142\n, 148-150, 21 Sup. Ct. 575; Dawson v. \n\n[251 U.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n Columbia Trust Co., \n197 \nU.S. 178, 181\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 420; Lord v. Thomas, 64 N. Y. 107; Caldwell v. Donaghey, 108 Ark. 60, 64, 156 S. W. 839, 45 L. R. A. (N. S.) 721, Ann. Cas. 1915B, 133.\n We deem it clear also that the act of 1913 had not the effect of depriving complainant of property without due process of law, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment. Assuming he had property rights and that they were taken, it clearly was done for a public purpose, and there was adequate provision for compensation in sections 886-890, Rem. & Bal. Code of Washington, which entitle any person having a claim against the state to begin an action thereon in a designated court upon the mere giving of security for costs, whereupon service of the complaint is to be made upon the Attorney General and secretary of state, the action is to proceed in all respects as other actions, with a right of appeal to the Supreme Court, and, in case of a final judgment against the state, a transcript of it is to be furnished to the auditor of state, who is required thereupon to 'audit the amount of damages and costs therein awarded, and the same shall be paid out of the state treasury.' If his claim has not been barred by limitation of time, this statute constitutes an adequate provision for assured payment of any compensation due to complainant without unreasonable delay; and hence satisfies the requirement of due process of law as clearly as if the ascertainment of compensation had preceded the taking. Bragg v. Weaver, \n251 U.S. 57\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 62, 64 L. Ed. --, decided December 8, 1919\n\n\n The District Court, besides finding complainant's case to be otherwise without merits, held in effect that he was barred from relief in equity by laches, because after the taking effect of the act of 1913 he stood by for more than a year and permitted the port commission to enter upon extensive improvements and expend large moneys on the waterway and adjoining lands, before he began his suit. The only answer made to this is that the defense of laches was not pleaded. But in the equity practice of the courts \n\n[251 U.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n of the United States (excepted from the Conformity Act, see Rev. Stat.  913, 914 [Comp. St.  1536, 1537]), laches is a defense that need not be set up by plea or answer. It rests upon the long-established doctrine of courts of equity that their extraordinary relief will not be accorded to one who delays the assertion of his claim for an unreasonable length of time, especially where the delay has led to a change of conditions that would render it unjust to disturb them at his instance. It is for the complainant in his bill to excuse the delay in seeking equitable relief, where there has been such; and if it be not excused his laches may be taken advantage of either by demurrer or upon final hearing.

Worthington and Vernon E. West, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioners.\n Mr. F. H. Stephens, of Washington, D. C., for the District of Columbia.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the court.\n The certificate made by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia as the basis for the questions which \n\n[254 U.S. 20, 21]\n\u00a0\n are propounded shows that they relate to a pending suit to recover taxes assessed by the District of Columbia upon intangible property pursuant to an act of Congress and paid under protest on the ground that the assessment was 'illegal and void in whole and in its several parts.' It suffices to say that the questions, which are stated in the margin,1 express the purpose of the court below to ask our instructions as to the constitutionality of the act of Congress in the light of the construction of that act which was the basis of the assessment of which complaint is made.\n At bar the subject is discussed as if the case were here on error or appeal, and on the other hand it is prayed that the power conferred in a case where a certificate is pending to order up the whole record be exerted. But as the want of power in the court below to make the certificate has been suggested and as that naturally arises on the face of the record and will if well founded preclude present inquiry into other questions, we come to consider that subject.\n It is indisputable that the court below had no power to certify questions to this court in any case where its judgment or decree would be susceptible of review in this court on error or appeal. Arant v. Lane, \n245 \nU.S. 166, 168\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 94. \n\n[254 U.S. 20, 22]\n\u00a0\n Whether the power to certify exists therefore must be decided by a consideration of section 250 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227), which deals with the right to review by error or appeal. As when that section is considered it appears that its third paragraph in express terms confers power on this court to review on error or appeal judgments or decrees of the court below 'in cases involving the construction or application of the Constitution of the United States, or the constitutionality of any law of the United States, or the validity or construction of any treaty made under its authority,' it is at once demonstrated that the court below was devoid of any authority to make the certificate and hence that this court has no jurisdiction to answer the questions.\n But it is suggested that, as it was held in American Security & Trust Co. v. District of Columbia, \n224 U.S. 491\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 553, that the power conferred upon this court by paragraph 6 of section 250 to review on error or appeal judgments or decrees of the court below 'in cases in which the construction of any law of the United States is drawn in question by the defendant' embraced only the construction of laws of general operation, as distinguished from those which were local to the District of Columbia, therefore the grant of power to determine the constitutionality of acts of Congress must be treated as applying only to such acts as are general in character, as to which it is insisted the act involved in this case is not one.\n But the contention disregards the suggestion of a difference between the two subjects which was made in the American Security Case and overlooks the implication resulting from a subsequent case directly dealing with the same matter. United Surety Co. v. American Fruit Co., \n238 U.S. 140\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 828\n\n\n In addition, as the paragraphs of section 250 in question but re- enact provisions of prior statutes which had been construed as conveying authority to review controversies \n\n[254 U.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n concerning the constitutional power of Congress to enact local statutes ( Parsons v. Dist. of Columbia, \n170 U.S. 45\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 521; Smoot v. Heyl, \n227 U.S. 518\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 336), the proposition conflicts with the settled rule that, where provisions of a statute had previous to their re-enactment a settled significance, that meaning will continue to attach to them in the absence of plain implication to the contrary (Latimer v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 501, 504\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 242; Anderson v. Pacific Coast S. S. Co., \n225 \nU.S. 187, 199\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 626; Louisville Cement Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n246 \nU.S. 638, 644\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 408).\n That a decision below, which merely deals with and interprets a local statute, is not subject to review by error or appeal, affords no basis for saying that the exertion of the infinitely greater power to determine whether Congress had constitutional authority to pass a statute local in character should be necessarily subjected to a like limitation. To the contrary, the elementary principle is that the right to pass upon the greater question, the constitutional power of Congress, draws to it the authority to also decide all the essential incidents, even though otherwise there might not be a right to consider them.

U S(1920)\nNo. 162\nArgued: January 21, 1920Decided: February 2, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Simon Lyon and R. B. H. Lyon, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General Alex. C. King, of Atlanta, Ga., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover taxes paid under the Spanish War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898, c. 448,  29, 30, 30 Stat. 448, 464, 465, repealed by the Act of April 12, 1902, c. 500,  7, 32 Stat. 96, 97, the repeal to take effect on July 1, 1902. By the Act of June 27, 1902, c. 1160,  3, 32 Stat. 406, the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to refund taxes upon legacies collected upon contingent beneficial interests that should not have become vested before July 1, 1902, and this claim is made under the last mentioned act. The claim was held by the Court of \n\n[251 U.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Claims to be barred by the Statute of Limitations. In view of the decision in Sage v. United States, \n256 U.S. 33\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 415, it is admitted by the Government that the judgment cannot be sustained on that ground, and therefore that matter need not be discussed, but it is contended that the judgment was right because the legacies taxed had become vested before July 1, 1902. Whether they had become vested within the meaning of the refunding act is the only question in the case.\n The facts are these: Arthur Hendricks died domiciled in New York on March 5, 1902, and his will was proved on March 17, 1902. The claimant was executor and trustee under the will. By that instrument the sum of $50,000 was left to the claimant in trust for Florence Lester for life, the remainder to go to the residue. The residue was left to the testator's five sisters. On July 1, 1902, the time for proving claims against the estate had not expired, but before that date the executor, having correctly estimated that a large sum would be left after all debts, paid over $135,780 to the five sisters in equal shares and 'established the trust fund' for Florence Lester, that is, as we understand the finding, transferred the sum of $50,000 to his separate account as trustee. The taxes in question were levied on these two amounts.\n There is no doubt that if the claimant had retained the funds in his hands, as he had a legal right to do, the interest of the legatees would not have been vested in possession within the meaning of the statute, whatever the probabilities and however solvent the estate. United States v. Jones, \n236 U.S. 106\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 261, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 316; McCoach v. Pratt, \n236 U.S. 562\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 421. He contends that the same is true if he saw fit to pay over legacies before the time came when they could be demanded as of right. We will assume that, if the estate had proved insufficient, the executor not only would have been responsible but could have recovered such portion of his payments as was needed to pay debts. \n\n[251 U.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n Still the consequence asserted does not follow. There can be no question that the interest of the sisters was held in possession, and so was that of the trustee, although he happened to be the same person as the executor. The interest was vested also in each case. The law uses familiar legal expressions in their familiar legal sense, and the distinction between a contingent interest and a vested interest subject to be divested is familia to the law. Gray, Rule Against Perpetuities,  108. The remote possibility that the funds in the hands of the legatees might have to be returned no more prevented their being vested in possession and taxable than the possibility that a life estate might end at any moment prevented one that began before July 1, 1902, being taxed at its full value as fixed by the mortuary tables. United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., \n222 \nU.S. 158, 160\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 59. In that case it was contended that the life estate was contingent so far as not actually enjoyed.\n It is argued with regard to the trust for Florence Lester that the case stands differently because the life tenant received no income from it before July 1, 1902. But for the purposes of this act the interest in a fund transferred from an estate to a trustee for ascertained persons is vested in possession no less than when it is conveyed directly to them. See United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., supra.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHIAWASSEE RIVER POWER CO. v. CAROLINA-TENNESSEE POWER CO.(1920)\nNo. 208\nArgued: January 30, 1920Decided: March 22, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Eugene R. Black, of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Julius C. Martin, of Asheville, N. C., for defendant in error. \n\n[252 U.S. 341, 342]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Carolina-Tennessee Power Company, a public utility, was incorporated by a private law of North Carolina with broad powers, including that of taking by eminent domain riparian lands of and water rights in any nonnavigable stream of the state. It filed locations for two hydro-electric plants on the Hiawassee river and proceeded to acquire by purchase and by condemnation the lands and water rights necessary for that development. Thereafter the Hiawassee River Power Company was organized under the general laws of the state and threatened to locate and develop on that river hydro-electric plants which would necessarily interfere with the development undertaken by the Carolina-Tennessee Company. The latter brought in the superior court of Cherokee county a suit in the nature of a bill to quiet title. The case was tried in that court with the aid of a jury. Many issues of fact were raised and many questions of state law presented. A decree entered for the plaintiff below wasr eversed by the Supreme Court of the state and a new trial was ordered. Carolina-Tennessee Power Co. v. Hiawassee River Power Co., 171 N. C. 248, 88 S. E. 349. The second trial resulted also in a decree for plaintiff below which was affirmed by the state Supreme Court. 175 N. C. 670, 96 S. E. 99. The case comes here on writ of error.\n The federal question relied upon as giving jurisdiction to this court is denial of the claim that the private law incorporating the Carolina- Tennessee Company is invalid, because it conferred upon that company broad powers of eminent domain, whereas the general law, under which the Hiawassee Company was later organized, conferred no such right; the contention being that thereby the guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment of privileges and immunities and equal protection of the laws had been violated. But this claim was not presented to nor passed upon by the \n\n[252 U.S. 341, 343]\n\u00a0\n Supreme Court of the state. The only basis for the contention that it was so presented is the fact that, when the Carolina-Tennessee Company offered in evidence at the trial in the superior court the private law as its charter, objection was made to its admission 'on the ground that the same was in terms and effect a monopoly and a void exercise of power by the state Legislature which undertook to provide it, it being opposed and obnoxious to the bill of rights and the Constitution and in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment,' and that the admission of this evidence is among the many errors assigned in the Supreme Court of the state. The law, whether valid or invalid, was clearly admissible in evidence, as it was the foundation of the equity asserted in the bill. No right under the federal Constitution was necessarily involved in that ruling. The reference to the 'bill of rights and the Constitution' made when objecting to the admissibility of the evidence was to the state Constitution and the point was not again called to the attention of that court. Compare Hulbert v. Chicago, \n202 \nU.S. 275, 279\n, 280 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 617. The claim of invalidity under the state Constitution was specifically urged in that court as a reason why the Carolina-Tennessee Company should be denied relief and the claim was passed upon adversely to the plaintiff in error; but no reference was made in that connection to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n If a general statement that the ruling of the state court was against the Fourteenth Amendment were a sufficient specification of the claim of a right under the Constitution to give this court jurisdiction (see Clarke v. McDade, \n165 \nU.S. 168, 172\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 284; Capital City Dairy Co. v. Ohio, \n183 \nU.S. 238, 248\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 120; Marvin v. Trout, \n199 \nU.S. 212, 217\n, 224 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 31), still the basis for a review by this court is wholly lacking here. For the Fourteenth Amendment was mentioned only in the trial court. In the Supreme Court of the state no mention was made of it in the assignment of errors; nor was it, so far as appears by the record, otherwise presented to or \n\n[252 U.S. 341, 344]\n\u00a0\n passed upon by that court. The denial of the claim was specifically set forth in the petition for the writ of error to this court and in the assignment of errors filed here. But obviously that was too late. Chicago, Indianapolis, etc., Ry. v. McGuire, \n196 \nU.S. 128, 132\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 200. The omission to set it up properly in the Supreme Court of the state was not cured by the allowance of the writ of error by its Chief Justice. Appleby v.

Davis, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Robert L. Williams, F. H. Stephens, and P. H. Marshall, all of Washington, D. C., for the District of Columbia. \n\n[254 U.S. 135, 136]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here upon a writ of certiorari granted to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals that affirmed a conviction of the petitioner of doing business as a pawnbroker and charging more than six per cent. interest, without a license, which is forbidden by the Act of Congress of February 4, 1913, c. 26, 37 Stat. 657. 48 App. D. C. 380.\n The external facts are not disputed. The defendant had been in business as a pawnbroker in Washington but anticipating the enactment of the present law removed his headquarters to a place in Virginia at the other end of a bridge leading from the city. He continued to use his former building as a storehouse for his pledges but posted notices on his office there that no applications for loans would be received or examination of pledges made there. He did, however, maintain a free automobile service from there to Virginia and offered to intending borrowers the choice of calling upon him in person or sending their application and security by a dime messenger service not belonging to him but established in his Washington building. If the loan was made, in the latter case the money and pawn ticket were brought back and handed to the borrower in Washington. When a loan was paid off the borrower received a redemption certificate, presented it in Washington and got back his pledge. The defendant estimated the number of persons applying to the Washington office for loans or redemption at fifty to seventy-five a day. His Washington clerk, a witness in his behalf, put it at from seventy-five to one hundred. We may take it that there was a fairly steady stream of callers, as is implied by the automobile service being maintained. It is said with reference to the charge of the judge to which we shall advert that there was a question \n\n[254 U.S. 135, 137]\n\u00a0\n for the jury as to the defendant's intent. But we perceive none. There is no question that the defendant intentionally maintained his storehouse and managed his business in the way described. It may be assumed that he intended not to break the law but only to get as near to the line as he could which he had a right to do, but if the conduct described crossed the line, the fact that he desired to keep within it will not help him. It means only that he misconceived the law.\n As to whether the conduct described did contravene the law, it is urged that a pledgee has a right to keep the pledged property where he likes and as he likes provided he returns it in proper condition when redeemed. But that hardly helps the defendant. To keep for return, whatever latitude there may be as to place and mode, is part of the duty of a pledgee, and in the case of one who makes a business of lending on pledges is as much a part of his business as making the loan. As we read the statute its prohibition is not confined to cases where the whole business is done in Washington. If an essential part of it is done there and a Washington office is used as a collecting centre, it does not matter that care is taken to complete every legal transaction on the other side of the Potomac. We cannot suppose that it was intended to allow benefits so similar to those coming from business done wholly in the city to be derived from acts done there and yet go free. We are of opinion that upon the undisputed evidence the defendant was guilty of a breach of the law and turn at once to the question which seemed to warrant allowing the case to be brought to this Court.\n The question relates to the charge of the judge. The judge said to the jury that the only question for them to determine was whether they believed the concurrent testimony of the witnesses for the Government and the defendant describing the course of business that we have stated and as to which there was no dispute. Those facts, \n\n[254 U.S. 135, 138]\n\u00a0\n he correctly instructed them, constituted an engaging in business in the District of Columbia. This was excepted to and the jury retired. The next day they were recalled to Court and were told that there really was no issue of fact for them to decide; that they were not warranted in capriciously saying that the witnesses for the Government and the defendant were not telling the truth; that the course of dealing constituted a breach of the law; that it was their duty to accept this exposition of the law; that in a criminal case the Court could not peremptorily instruct them to find the defendant guilty but that if the law permitted he would. The Court added that a failure to bring in a verdict could only arise from a fiagrant disregard of the evidence, the law, and their obligation as jurors. On an exception being taken the judge repeated that he could not tell them in so many words to find the defendant guilty but that what he said amounted to that; that the facts proved were in accord with the information and that the Court of Appeals had said that that showed a violation of law.\n This was not a case of the judge's expressing an opinion upon the evidence, as he would have had a right to do, Graham v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 474, 480\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 148. The facts were not in dispute, and what he did was to say so and to lay down the law applicable to them. In such a case obviously the function of the jury if they do their duty is little more than formal. The judge cannot direct a verdict it is true, and the jury has the power to bring in a verdict in the teeth of both law and facts. But the judge always has the right and duty to tell them what the law is upon this or that state of facts that may be found, and he can do the same none the less when the facts are agreed. If the facts are agreed the judge may state that fact also, and when there is no dispute he may say so although there has been no formal agreement. Perhaps there was a regrettable peremptoriness of tone- \n\n[254 U.S. 135, 139]\n\u00a0\n butthe jury were allowed the technical right, if it can be called so, to decide against the law and the facts-and that is all there was left for them after the defendant and his witnesses took the stand. If the defendant suffered any wrong it was purely formal since, as we have said, on the facts admitted there was no doubt of his guilt. Act of February 26, 1919, c. 48, 40 Stat. 1181, amending section 269 of the Judicial Code; Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231, 36 Stat. 1087 (Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  1246).\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n It has long been the established practice of the federal courts that, even in criminal cases, the presiding judge may comment freely on the evidence and express his opinion whether facts alleged have been proved Since Sparf v. United States, \n156 \nU.S. 51, 715\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 273, it is settled that, even in criminal cases, it is the duty of the jury to apply the law given them by the presiding judge to the facts which they find. But it is still the rule of the federal courts that the jury in criminal cases renders a general verdict on the law and the facts; and that the judge is without power to direct a verdict of guilty although no fact is in dispute. United States v. Taylor (C. C.) 11 Fed. 470; Atchison, etc., Ry. v. United States, 172 Fed. 194, 96 C. C. A. 646, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 756. What the judge is forbidden to do directly, he may not do by indirection. Peterson v. United States, 213 Fed. 920, 130 C. C. A. 398. The judge may enlighten the understanding of the jury and thereby influence their judgment; but he may not use undue influence. He may advise; he may persuade; but he may not command or coerce. He does coerce when without convincing the judgment he overcomes the will by the weight of his authority. Compare Hall v. Hall, L. R. 1, P. & D. 481, 482. \n\n[254 U.S. 135, 140]\n\u00a0\n The character of the charge in this case is illustrated by the following paragraph:\n'In conclusion I will say that a failure to bring in a verdict in this case can arise only from a willful and flagrant disregard of the evidence and the law as I have given it to you and a violation of your obligation as jurors. Of course, gentlemen. I cannot tell you in so many words to find defendant guilty, but what I say amounts to that.'\n\n In my opinion, such a charge is a moral command, and, being yielded to, substitutes the will of the judge for the conviction of the jury. The law, which in a criminal case forbids a verdict directed 'in so many words,' forbids such a statement as the above. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It is said that if the defendant suffered any wrong it was purely formal; and that the error is of such a character as not to afford, since the Act of February 26, 1919, c. 48, 40 Stat. 1181, a basis for reversing the judgment of the lower court. Whether a defendant is found guilty by a jury or is declared to be so by a judge is not, under the federal Constitution, a mere formality. Blair v. United States, 241 Fed. 217, 230, 154 C. C. A. 139. The offense here in question is punishable by imprisonment. Congress would have been powerless to provide for imposing the punishment except upon the verdict of the jury. Callan v. Wilson, \n127 U.S. 540\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1301; Thompson v. Utah, \n170 U.S. 343\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 620. I find nothing in the act to indicate that it sought to do so.\n Because the presiding judge usurped the province of the jury, I am unable to concur in the judgment of the court.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice DAY concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare People v.

ORMES(1920)\nNo. 86\nArgued: January 23, 1920Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Solicitor General King, for appellants.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n Miss Mary O'Toole, of Washington, D. C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit in equity, brought by the late Belva A. Lockwood in her lifetime in the Supreme Court of the District Columbia, to establish an equitable lien for attorney's fees upon a fund of $1,200 in the treasury of the United States, appropriated by Congress (Act of March 4, 1915, c. 140, 38 Stat. 962, 981) to pay a claim found by the Court of Claims to be due to one Susan Sanders, who was made defendant together with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States. There were appropriate prayers for relief by injunction and the appointment of a receiver. Defendant Sanders voluntarily appeared and answered, denying her indebtedness to plaintiff; the other defendants answered, admitting the existence of the fund, and declaring that as a matter of comity and out of deference to the court it would be retained under their control to await the final disposition of the case, but objecting to the jurisdiction of the court over the cause upon the ground that debts due from the United States have no situs in the District of Columbia, that there was nothing to show that either the United States or the defendant Sanders had elected to make the sum alleged to be due from the United States payable to her in the District, and that in the absence of personal service upon her the court could make no decree that would protect the United States. There was a final decree adjudging that \n\n[252 U.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n the sum of $90 was due from the defendant Sanders to Mrs. Lockwood, with costs, and appointing a receiver to collect and receive from the Secretary of the Treasury the $1,200 appropriated in favor of Sanders, directing the Secretary to pay the latter sum to the receiver, and decreeing that his receipt should be a full acquittance to the United States for any and all claims and demands of the parties arising out of or connected with said claim. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer appealed to the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia; the defendant Sanders not appealing. That court affirmed the decree (McAdoo v. Ormes, 47 App. D. C. 364), and a further appeal, taken by the officials of the Treasury under section 250, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1227), brings the case here.\n The principal contention is that, because the object of the suit and the effect of the decree were to control the action of the appellants in the performance of their official duties, the suit was in effect one against the United States. But since the fund in question has been appropriated by act of Congress for payment to a specified person in satisfaction of a finding of the Court of Claims, it is clear that the officials of the Treasury are charged with the ministerial duty to make payment on demand to the person designated. It is settled that in sucha case a suit brought by the person entitled to the performance of the duty against the official charged with its performance is not a suit against the government. So it has been declared by this court in many cases relating to state officers. Board of Liquidation v. McComb, \n92 U.S. 531\n, 541; Louisiana v. Jumel, \n107 \nU.S. 711, 727\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 128; In re Ayers, \n123 \nU.S. 443, 506\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 164. In Minnesota v. Hitchcock, \n185 \nU.S. 373, 386\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 650, 655 ( 46 L. Ed. 954), while holding that a suit against officers of the United States might be in effect a suit against the United States, the court said:\n'Of course, this statement has no reference to and does not include those cases in which officers of the United States are sued, in appropriate \n\n[252 U.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n form, to compel them to perform some ministerial duty imposed upon them by law, and which they wrongfully neglect or refuse to perform. Such suits would not be deemed suits against the United States within the rule that the government cannot be sued except by its consent, nor within the rule established in the Ayers Case.'\n\n And in Parish v. MacVeagh, \n214 U.S. 124\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 556, the court upheld the right of a claimant, in whose favor an appropriation had been mad by Congress, to have a mandamus against the Secretary of the Treasury requiring him to pay the claim. To the same effect, Roberts, Treasurer, v. United States, \n176 \nU.S. 221, 231\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 376.\n In the present case it is conceded, and properly conceded, that payment of the fund in question to the defendant Sanders is a ministerial duty, the performance of which could be compelled by mandamus. But from this it is a necessary consequence that one who has an equitable right in the fund as against Sanders may have relief against the officials of the Treasury through a mandatory writ of injunction, or a receivership which is its equivalent, making Sanders a party so as to bind her and so that the decree may afford a proper acquittance to the government. The practice of bringing suits in equity for this purpose is well established in the courts of the District. Sanborn v. Maxwell, 18 App. D. C. 245; Roberts v. Consaul, 24 App. D. C. 551, 562; Jones v. Rutherford, 26 App. D. C. 114; Parish v. McGowan, 39 App. D. C. 184, s. c. on appeal McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 295\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 543. Confined, as it necessarily must be, to cases where the officials of the government have only a ministerial duty to perform, and one in which the party complainant has a particular interest, the practice is a convenient one, well supported by both principle and precedent.\n Section 3477, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  6383), regulating the assignment of claims against the United States, is not an obstacle. As has been held many times, the object of Congress in this legis lation \n\n[252 U.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n was to protect the government, not the claimant; and it does not stand in the way of giving effect to an assignment by operation of law after the claim has been allowed. Erwin v. United States, \n97 U.S. 392\n, 397; Goodman v. Niblack, \n102 U.S. 556\n, 560; Price v. Forrest, \n173 U.S. 410\n, 423-425, 19 Sup. Ct. 434.\n In support of the contention that a court of equity may not control the action of an officer of the United States within the scope of his authority, Wells v. Roper, \n246 U.S. 335\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 317, is cited; but it is not in point. The official duty sought to be subjected to control in that case was not ministerial, but required an exercise of official discretion, as the opinion shows. \n246 U.S. 338\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 317.\n It is further objected that debts due from the United States have no situs at the seat of government, and Vaughan v. Northup, 15 Pet. 1, 6, Mackey v. Cox, 18 How. 100, 105, and Wyman v. Halstead, \n109 \nU.S. 654, 657\n, 3 S., sup. Ct. 417, are cited. But in the present case the qus tion of situs is not material. If the jurisdiction as to the defendant Sanders had depended upon publication of process against her as a nonresident under section 105 of the District Code (Act of March 3, 1901, c. 854, 31 Stat. 1189, 1206), upon the theory that her claim against the government was 'property within the District,' the point would require consideration. But the jurisdiction over her rests upon her having voluntarily appeared and answered the bill without objection. Hence there is no question that the decree binds her, and so constitutes a good acquittance to the United States as against her.\n The decree will be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","72":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHULL v. PHILADELPHIA & R. RY. CO.(1920)\nNo. 151\nArgued: January 16, 1920Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Charles D. Wagaman and Harvey R. Spessard, both of Hagerstown, Md., for petitioner. \n\n[252 U.S. 475, 476]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry H. Keedy, Jr., of Hagerstown, Md., for respondent.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 475, 477]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action brought in a state court of Maryland under the federal Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908 (35 Stat. 65, c. 149 [ Comp. St.  8657-8665]), as amended April 5, 1910 (36 Stat. 291, c. 143), by petitioner, as administratrix of John M. Hull, deceased, to recover damages because of his death, occurring, as alleged, while he was employed by defendant in interstate commerce. The trial court directed a verdict in favor of defendant, the Court of Appeals of Maryland affirmed the resulting judgment upon the ground that the deceased, at the time he was killed, was not in the employ of defendant within the meaning of the act of Congress (132 Md. 540, 104 Atl. 274), and upon this federal question the case is brought here by certiorari.\n The pertinent facts are not in dispute. John M. Hull, at the time he was killed and for a long time before, was in the general employ of the Western Maryland Railway Company, an interstate carrier operating, among other lines, a railway from Hagerstown, Md., to Lurgan, Pa., at which point it connected with a railway owned and operated by defendant, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, which extended from Lurgan to Rutherford, in the same state. Through freight trains were operated from Hagerstown to Rutherford over these two lines, and Hull was employed as a brakeman on such a train at the time he received the fatal injuries. On the previous day a crew employed by the Western Maryland Railway Company, and of which he was a member, had taken a train hauled by a Western Maryland engine from Hagerstown to Rutherford, and at the time in question the same crew was returning with a train from Rutherford \n\n[252 U.S. 475, 478]\n\u00a0\n to Hagerstown. Before starting they received instructions from the yardmaster at Rutherford (an employe of defendant company) as to the operation of the train, including directions to pick up seven cars at Harrisburg. They proceeded from Rutherford to Harrisburg, stopped there for the purpose of picking up the seven cars, and while this was being done Hull was run over and killed by one of defendant's locomotives.\n The through freight service was conducted under a written agreement between the two railway companies, which was introduced in evidence and constitutes the chief reliance of petitioner. Its provisions, so far as they need to be quoted, are as follows:\n'2. Freight trains to run through between Hagerstown and Rutherford in both directions and each company agrees to supply motive power in the above proportions [based upon mileage] so as to equalize the service performed.\n\n ...\n'4. Crews of each road to run through with their engines over the line of the other company.\n\n'5. Each company to compensate the other for the use of the other's engines and crews on their line at the following rates per hour: ... Time to begin at Rutherford n d Hagerstown when crew is called for . ... Time to cease when the engines arrive on the fire track at Rutherford and Hagerstown. ...\n\n'6. The division of earnings of the traffic not to be disturbed or in any way affected by this arrangement.\n\n'7. Each company to furnish fuel and other supplies to its own engines and crews; any furnished by one to the other to be upon agreed uniform rates.\n\n ...\n'9. Neither company to be expected to do the engine cleaning and wiping for the other; where done, a charge of seventy-five (75) cents per engine to be made. \n\n[252 U.S. 475, 479]\n\u00a0\n\n'10. Each company to be responsible and bear all damage and expenses to persons and property caused by all accidents upon its road.\n\n\n ...\n'16. Each company to relieve and turn as promptly as practicable the engines and crews of the other at ends of runs.\n\n'17. Each company to have the right to object and to enforce objection to any unsatisfactory employe of the other running upon its lines.\n\n'18. All cases of violation of rules or other derelictions by the employes of one company while upon the road of the other shall be promptly investigated by the owning company, and the result reported to the employing company, with or without suggestions for disciplining, the employing company to report to the other the action taken.\n\n'19. Accident reports on prescribed forms to be promptly made of all such occurrences, and where a crew of one company is operating upon the road of the other, a copy must be sent to the proper officer of each company.\n\n'20. Employes of each company to be required to report promptly, on notice, to the proper officer of the other, for investigations of accidents, etc., the fullest co-operation to be given by the one company to the other in all such matters.\n\n'21. The employes of each company while upon the tracks of the other shall be subject to and conform to the rules, regulations, discipline and orders of the owning company.'\n\n We hardly need repeat the statement made in Robinson v. Balt. & Ohio R. R., \n237 \nU.S. 84, 94\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 491, that in the Employers' Liability Act Congress used the words 'employe' and 'employed' in their natural sense, and intended to describe the conventional relation of employer and employe. The simple question is whether, under the \n\n[252 U.S. 475, 480]\n\u00a0\n facts as recited and according to the general principles applicable to the relation, Hull had been transferred from the employ of the Western Maryland Railway Company to that of defendant for the purposes of the train movement in which he was engaged when killed. He was not a party to the agreement between the railway companies, and is not shown to have had knowledge of it; but, passing this, and assuming the provisions of the agreement can be availed of by petitioner, it still is plain, we think, from the whole case, that deceased remained for all purposes-certainly for the purposes of the act-an employe of the Western Maryland Company only. It is clear that each company retained control of its own train crews; that what the latter did upon the line of the other road was done as a part of their duty to the general employer; and that, so far as they were subject while upon the tracks of the other company to its rules, regulations, discipline, and orders, this was for the purpose of coordinating their movements to the other operations of the owning company, securing the safety of all concerned, and furthering the general object of the agreement between the companies. See Standard Oil Co. v. Anderson, \n212 \nU.S. 215, 226\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 252.\n North Carolina R. R. Co. v. Zachary, \n232 U.S. 248\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 305, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 159, is cited, but is not in point, since in that case the relation of the parties was controlled by a dominant rule of local law, to which the agreement here operative has no analogy.\n The Court of Appeals of Maryland did not err in its disposition of the federal question, and hence its judgment is\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE (dissenting).\n The Western Maryland Railroad Company owned a line of railroad extending from Hagerstown, Md., to Lurgan, where it connected with the line of the Reading \n\n[252 U.S. 475, 481]\n\u00a0\n Company, extending to Rutherford, in Pennsylvania. The two companies entered into a contract by which through freight trains, made up and manned by crews primarily employed by either, should run through over the rails of the other company to Rutherford of Hagerstown, as the case might be. A crew from either line arriving at the terminus of the other should return with a train made up by the company operating the latter-together with any cars which might be 'picked up' on the way.\n Thus, for the purposes of operation, the line over which train crews worked was 81 miles in length, 34 miles of Western Maryland track and 47 miles of Reading track, and the relation of the men to the company, other than the one which originally employed them, while on its line, was defined by the contract quoted from in the opinion of the court.\n Five of the paragraphs of this contract seem to me decisive of what that relation was, and of this case, viz.:\n'5. Each company to pay the other an agreed compensation for the service of its engines and crews while on its line.\n\n'10. Each company to be responsible and bear all damage and expenses to persons and property caused by all accidents on its road.\n\n'17. Each company to have the right to object to, and to enforce objection to, any unsatisfactory employe of the other running upon its lines.\n\n'18. All violations of rules or other derelictions by employes of one company while on the road of the other shall be promptly investigated by the owning company and the result reported to the employing company, with or without suggestions for disciplining, the employing company to report to the other the action taken.\n\n'21. The employes of each company while upon the \n\n[252 U.S. 475, 482]\n\u00a0\n tracks of the other shall be subject to and conform to the rules, regulations, discipline and orders of the owning company.'\n\n The deceased brakeman, Hull, was killed on the Reading tracks at Harrisburg 30 miles away from any Western Maryland track, by the alleged negligence of a Reading engineer, when engaged, under the direction of a local Reading yardmaster, in 'picking up' cars to be added to a train which was made up by the Reading Company at Rutherford and dispatched by Reading officials from that terminal.\n Thus, when he was killed, Hull was working on the Reading Railroad, subject to the 'rules, regulations, discipline and orders' of the Reading Company and at the moment was acting under specific direction of a Reading yardmaster. The Reading Company was paying for the service which he was rendering when he was killed, it had authority to cause his discharge if his service was not satisfactory to it (paragraphs 17 and 18 of the contract, supra), and it had specifically contracted to be responsible for all damage to persons and property caused by accidents on its line growing out of the joint operation. It is admitted that the service he was rendering was in the movement of interstate commerce, but upon the facts thus stated it is concluded in the opinion, that he was not within the scope of the act providing that--\n'Every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several states ... shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier in such commerce, or, in case of the death,' etc. 35 Stat. c. 149,  1, p. 65 ( Comp. St.  8657).\n\n I cannot concur in this decision of the court for the reason that the case seems to me to be ruled by a conclusion as to the applicable law, stated in a strongly reasoned opinion in Standard Oil Co. v. Anderson, \n212 U.S. 215\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 252, in this paragraph:\n'One may be in the general service of another, and, \n\n[252 U.S. 475, 483]\n\u00a0\n nevertheless, with respect to particular work, may be transferred, with his own consent or acquiescence,t o the service of a third person, so that he becomes the servant of that person with all the legal consequences of the new relation.'\n\n By the contract of hiring Hull was in the general service of the Maryland Company, but 'by his consent and acquiescence,' he was transferred to the service of the Reading Company whenever his train passed onto its tracks. From that moment until his return to the Maryland Company's tracks again he was engaged exclusively in the work of the Reading Company, that company paid for his services, he was under its 'rules, regulations, discipline and orders,' and it had authority to cause his discharge if his service was not satisfactory. He was under the control of that company as to what he was to do and as to the details of the manner of doing it as completely as if he had no other employer. He ceased for the time being to be the servant of the Maryland Company and became the servant of the Reading Company. \n212 \nU.S. 215, 224\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 252.\n The federal Employers' Liability Act does not require that a person shall be in the exclusive employ of a railroad common carrier in order to come within its scope. It provides that such carrier shall be 'liable in damages to any person injured while he is employed (engaged) by it in interstate commerce,' and it is impossible for me to accept the conclusion that Hull, when in the pay of the Reading Company, assisting in operating Reading interstate trains on Reading tracks, under the direction solely of Reading officials, general and local, was not 'employed' by it in interstate commerce, within the meaning of this provision.\n We are not dealing here with mere words or with merely 'conventional relations,' but with very serious realties. Enacted as the federal Employers' Liability Act was to bring the United States law up to the humanitarian level \n\n[252 U.S. 475, 484]\n\u00a0\n of the laws of many of the states, by abolishing the unjust and irritating fellow servant rule, by modifying the often harsh contributory negligence rule, and by otherwise changing the common-law liability of interstate rail carriers to their employes, it should receive a liberal construction to promote its important purpose. Its terms invite the application of the rule, widely applied by other courts and clearly approved by this court, in the case cited, that a man may be in the general service of one, and also, with respect to a part of his service-to particular work-be in the service of another employer, so that he becomes for the time being the servant of the latter 'with all the legal consequences of that relation.' The line of demarcation could not be more clearly drawn than it was in this case, and the rule seems to me to be sharply and decisively applicable.\n In the opinion of the court it is said:\n'It is clear that each company retained control of its own train crews.'\n\n Upon the contrary, it seems to me, it is clear that neither company retained any control whatever over the crews primarily employed by it while they were on the line of the other company. '21. The employes of each company, while upon the tracks of the other, shall be subject to and conform to the rules, regulations, discipline and orders of the owning company,' was the contract between the two companies under which they were operating when Hull was negligently killed. \n\n\n\n","73":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nIN RE PETERSON(1920)\nNo. 28\nArgued: March 15, 1920Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 300, 301]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Abram J. Rose, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n[253 U.S. 300, 303]\n\u00a0\n Mr. George Zabriskie, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition for a writ of mandamus and\/or prohibition brought by Walter Peterson, receiver of the Interstate Coal Company, against the Honorable Augustus N. Hand, Judge of the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York. The facts and the specific relief sought are these: \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 304]\n\u00a0\n Peterson had brought an action at law in that court against Arthur Sidney Davison to recover a balance of $21,014.43, alleged to be due for coal sold and delivered as shown by a long schedule annexed. The answer substantially admitted the items set forth in the schedule filed by plaintiff, but denied that it presented a full account of the transactions between the parties, and alleged that there were other deliveries of coal and other payments which the defendant had made, and also that he was entitled to additional allowances. It further alleged, by way of counterclaim, that the plaintiff was indebted to him for failure to perform its contracts for coal in the sum of $9,999.10. In response to a demand for a bill of particulars, defendant filed schedules containing more than 200 items which he proposed to establish by way of defense.\n Upon motion of defendant and against the objection of plaintiff, Judge Hand appointed an auditor (254 Fed. 625), with instructions--\n'to make a preliminary investigation as to the facts, hear the witnesses, examine the accounts of the parties, and make and file a report in the office of the clerk of this court, with a view to simplifying the issues for the jury, but not to finally determine any of the issues in the action, the final determination of all issues of fact to be made by the jury on the trial, and the auditor to have power to compel the attendance of, and administer the oaths to, witnesses, the expense of the auditor, including the expense of the stenographer, to be paid by either or both parties to this action, in accordance with the determination of the trial judge.'\n\n The auditor ws further ordered to report on certain facts under 10 classifications. The design of this was largely to separate items in dispute from those as to which there was no real dispute, and also to set forth the detailed facts on which the specific claims made were rested; \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 305]\n\u00a0\n but the auditor was also thereby required to express his opinion on disputed issues thus:\n'6. The various penalties, commissions, cash discounts, and other deductions which defendant claims to be entitled to deduct from the invoice price of the various shipments, the items thereof which are admitted by plaintiff as proper deductions, and the items in dispute, with his opinion as to each of such disputed items.\n\n'7. His opinion as to the net amount due on each invoice of coal sold and delivered to defendant.'\n\n Thereupon application was made here for leave to file this petition. It prays that Judge Hand and the auditor named be prohibited from proceeding under the order appointing him; and it prays, also, that Judge Hand, or such other judge who may at the time hold the trial term of that court, be commanded to restore the case to the trial calendar, and that the same be tried in the regular and usual way. Leave to file the petition was granted (40 Sup. Ct. 178, 64 L. Ed. --), and an order to show cause issued. The petitioner insists that the District Court is without power to make the order appointing the auditor, and that proceedings thereunder would violate the Seventh Amendment to the Federal Constitution.\n First. Objection is made by respondent to the jurisdiction of this court. It is insisted that the District Court had jurisdiction of the parties and of the cause of action; that if the auditor should proceed to perform the duties assigned to him, and his report should be used at the trial before the jury, the plaintiff could protect his rights by exceptions which would be subject to review by the Circuit Court of Appeals; and that the writs prayed for may not be used merely to correct errors. But if proceedings pursuant to the appointment of an auditor would deprive petitioner of his right to a trial by jury, the order should, as was said in Ex parte Simons, \n247 \nU.S. 231, 239\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 497 (62 L. Ed. 1094) 'be dealt with now, before the plaintiff is put to the difficulties \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 306]\n\u00a0\n and the courts to the inconvenience that would be raised by' a proceeding 'that ultimately must be held to have been required under a mistake.' The objection to our jurisdiction is unfounded. We proceed, therefore, to the consideration of the merits of the petition.\n Second. The question presented is one of power in the District Court. If, under any circumstances, it could appoint an auditor with the duties here prescribed without the consent of the parties, the facts clearly warranted such action in this instance. The plaintiff sued for a balance alleged to be due on an account annexed containing 298 items. The defendant set up another account containing 402 items. Included in the latter, besides certain charges against defendant for additional deliveries, were over 30 cash items of credit not allowed for in the plaintiff's account. These 402 items were alleged to arise out of 123 different deliveries of cargoes (or partial cargoes) of coal made on 91 different days during a period of 11 months. The coal delivered was of various kinds and the invoice prices for the same kind differed from time to time. In respect to most of these deliveries, there were claims for allowances by way of penalties, commissions, and cash discounts; and, as to some, there were claims for allowances on account of freight.\n The District Court found that, in order to render possible an intelligent consideration of the case by court and jury, it was necessary to appoint an auditor and confer upon him two functions. The first was to segregate those itmes upon which the parties agreed and to classify those actually in controversy, and thus, having defined the issues, to aid court and jury by directing their attention to th matters in dispute. The second function of the auditor was to form a judgment and express an opinion upon such of the items as he found to be in dispute. In order to perform these functions, the auditor would be required, not merely to examine books, vouchers, and \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 307]\n\u00a0\n other papers, and to make computations, but to hear and pass upon conflicting testimony of the parties and of other witnesses. This full hearing, while obviously necessary to enable the auditor to form a trustworthy judgment on the disputed items, would serve also to narrow the field of controversy. For such a tentative trial acts as a sifting process, by which misunderstandings and misconceptions as to facts are frequently removed. In the course of it many contentions or assumptions made by one party or the other are abandoned. Agreement is thus reached as to some of the facts out of which liability is alleged to arise, even when the items to which they relate remain in dispute. See Fair v. Manhattan Ins. Co., 112 Mass. 329.\n The order expressly declared that the auditor should not 'finally determine any of the issues in this action, the final determination of all issues of fact to be made by the jury at the trial'; but it did no provide affirmatively what use should be made of the report at the trial. It may be assumed that, if accepted by the court, the report would be admitted at the trial before the jury as prima facie evidence both of the evidentiary facts and of the conclusions of fact therein set forth. The report, being evidence sufficient to satisfy the burden of proof (Wyman v. Whicher, 179 Mass. 276, 60 N. E. 612), would tend to dispense with the introduction at the trial before the jury of evidence on any matter not actually in dispute. The appointment of the auditor would thus serve to shorten the jury trial, by reducing both the number of facts to be established by evidence and the number of questions in controversy. A more intelligent consideration of the issues submitted to the jury for final determination would result.\n Third. Prior to the adoption of the federal Constitution there did not exist in England, or so far as appears in any of the colonies, any officer, permanent or temporary, \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 308]\n\u00a0\n who, in connection with trials by jury, exercised the powers of an auditor above described. An official called 'auditor' had long been known as part of the judicial machinery in certain cases brought in the commonlaw courts both of England and of the colonies; but the functions of the auditor in those cases were different. In the commonlaw action of account auditors were appointed in England, from the earliest times, to take the account, after the interlocutory judgment quod computet had been entered. But the parties were entitled to a jury trial before the interlocutory judgment was rendered; and further issues of fact arising before the auditor were not passed upon by him, but were certified to the court for trial by a jury. The use of this form of action was limited to cases where the defendant was under obligation to account to the plaintiff as guardian, bailiff, or receiver of his property. \n1\n In Maryland, by Acts 1785, c. 80,  12, the power of the court to appoint auditors was extended to all cases in which it might be necessary to examine and determine accounts; but the jury trial was not affected thereby, for the proceedings thereon were to be 'as in cases of account.' \n2\n In Connecticut auditors were appointed by the court in actions of 'book debt,' and the same practice was early introduced in Vermont and other states; but in this action the report of the auditor, if accepted by the court, is a substitute for the jury and operates to determine the issues of fact. \n3\n In New York \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 309]\n\u00a0\n actions on long accounts are determined now, as in colonial days, by referes, instead of by a jury. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The office of auditor, with functions and powers like those here in question, was apparently invented in Massachusetts. It was introduced there by chapter 142 of the c ts of the Legislature of the year 1818, and as a part of the judicial machinery it has received the fullest development in that state. No act of Congress has specifically authorized the adoption of the practice in the federal courts. We have therefore to decide, not only whether such appointment of auditors is consistent with the constitutional right of trial by jury, but also whether it is a power inherent in the District Court as a trial court.\n Fourth. The command of the Seventh Amendment that 'the right of trial by jury shall be preserved' does not require that old forms of practice and procedure be retained. Walker v. New Mexico & Southern Pacific Railroad, \n165 \nU.S. 593, 596\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 421. Compare Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 101\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 14. It does not prohibit the introduction of new methods for determining what facts are actually in issue, nor does it prohibit the introduction of new rules of evidence. Changes in these may be made. New devices \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 310]\n\u00a0\n may be used to adapt the ancient institution to present needs and to make of it an efficient instrument in the administration of justice. \n5\n Indeed, such changes are essential to the preservation of the right. The limitation imposed by the amendment is merely that enjoyment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and that the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be not interfered with.\n In so far as the task of the auditor is to define and simplify the issues, his function is, in essence, the same as that of pleading. The object of each is to concentrate the controversy upon the questions which should control the result. United States v. Gilmore, 7 Wall. 491, 494; Tucker v. United States, \n151 \nU.S. 164, 168\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 299. No one is entitled in a civil case to trial by jury, unless and except so far as there are issues of fact to be determined. It does not infringe the constitutional right to a trial by jury to require, with a view to formulating the issues, an oath by each party to the facts relied upon. Fidelity & Deposit Co. v. United States, \n187 U.S. 315\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 120. Nor does the requirement of a preliminary hearing infringe the constitutional right, either because it involves delay in reaching the jury trial, or because it affords opportunity for exploring in advance the evidence which the adversary purposes to introduce before the jury. Capital Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 U.S. 1\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 580. In view of these decisions, it cannot be deemed an undue obstruction of the right to a jury trial to require a preliminary hearing before an auditor.\n Nor can the order be held unconstitutional, as unduly interfering with the jury's determination of issues of fact, because it directs the auditor to form and express an opinion upon facts and items in dispute. The report will, unless rejected by the court, be admitted at the jury trial as \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 311]\n\u00a0\n evidence of facts and findings embodied therein; but it will be treated, at most, as prima facie evidence thereof. The parties will remain as free to call, examine, and cross-examine witnesses as if the report had not been made. No incident of the jury trial is modified or taken away either by the preliminary, tentative hearing before the auditor or by the use to which his report may be put. An order of a court, like a statute, is not unconstitutional because it endows an official act or finding with a presumption of regularity or of verity. Marx v. Hanthorn, \n148 \nU.S. 172, 182\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 508; Turpin v. Lemon, \n187 \nU.S. 51, 59\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 20; Reitler v. Harris, \n223 U.S. 437\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 248. In Meeker & Co. v. Lehigh Valley R. R., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 430\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691, it was held that the provision in section 16 of the Interstate Commerce Act (Comp. St .  8584), making the findings and order of the Commission prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated in suits brought to enforce reparation awards, does not infringe upon the right of trial by jury. See also Mills v. Lehigh Valley Railroad, \n238 U.S. 473\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 888; Chicago, etc., R. R. v. Jones, 149 Ill. 361, 382, 37 N. E. 247, 24 L. R. A. 141, 41 Am. St. Rep. 278. In the Meeker Case this court relied especially upon Holmes v. Hunt, 122 Mass. 505, 23 Am. Rep. 381, and called attention to the fact that there the statute making the report of an auditor prima facie evidence at the trial before a jury was held to be a legitimate exercise of legislative power over rules of evidence and in no wise inconsistent with the constitutional right of trial by jury. \n6\n The reasons for holding an auditor's report admissible as evidence are, in one respect, stronger than for giving such effect to the report of an independent tribunal like the Interstate Commerce \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 312]\n\u00a0\n Commission. The auditor is an officer of the court which appoints him. The proceedings before him are subject to its supervision, and the report may be used only if, and so far as, acceptable to the court.\n That neither the hearing before the auditor, nor the introduction of his report in evidence, abridges in any way the right of trial by jury was the conclusion reached in 1902 in the district of Massachusetts in Primrose v. Fenno, 113 Fed. 375, and 119 Fed. 801, 56 C. C. A. 313, the first reported case in which an auditor was appointed with the powers here conferred. The practice there established has been followed in the Southern District of New York, Vermeule v. Reilly, 196 Fed. 226; and in the Eastern District of Tennessee, United States v. Wells, 203 Fed. 146.\n Fifth. There being no constitutional obstacle to the appointment of an auditor in aid of jury trials, it remains to consider whether Congress has conferred upon District Courts power to make the order. There is here, unlike Ex parte Fisk, \n113 U.S. 713\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 724, no legislation of Congress which directly or by implication forbids the court to provide for such preliminary hearing and report. But, on the other hand, there is no statute which expressly authorizes it. The question presented is, therefore, whether the court possesses the inherent power to supply itself with this instrument for the administration of justice when deemed by it essential.\n Courts have (at least in the absence of legislation to the contrary) inherent power to provide themselves with appropriate instruments required for the performance of their duties. Compare Stockbridge Iron Co. v. Cone Iron Works, 102 Mass. 80, 87-90. This power includes authority to appoint persons unconnected with the court to aid judges in the performance of specific judicial duties, as they may arise in the progress of a cause. From the commencement of our government it has been exercised by the federal courts, when sitting in equity, by \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 313]\n\u00a0\n appointing, either with or without the consent of the parties, special masters, auditors, examiners, and commissioners. To take and report testimony; to audit and state accounts; to make computations; to determine, where the facts are complicated and the evidence voluminous, what questions are actually in issue; to hear conflicting evidence and make finding thereon are among the purposes for which such aids to the judges have been appointed. Kimberly v. Arms, \n129 \nU.S. 512, 523\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 355. Whether such aid shall be sought is ordinarily within the discretion of the trial judge; but this court has indicated that where accounts are complex and intricate, or the documents and other evidence voluminous, or where extensive computations are to be made, it is the better practice to refer the matter to a special master or commissioner than for the judge to undertake to perform the task himself. Heirs of P. E. Dubourg de St. Colombe v. United States, 7 Pet. 625; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. P. Ry. v. Tompkins, \n176 \nU.S. 167, 180\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 336. Of the appointment made in Field v. Holland,6 Cranch, 8, 21 (3 L. Ed. 136), Mr. Chief Justice Marshall said:\n'It is a reference to 'auditors,' a term which designates agents or officers of the court, who examine and digest accounts for the decisions of the court. They do not decree, but prepare material on which a decree may be made.'\n\n And in Railroad Co. v. Swasey, 23 Wall. 405, 410 (23 L. Ed. 136), Mr. Chief Justice Waite said of the master's report:\n'Its office is to present the case to the court in such a manner that intelligent action may be there had, and it is this action by the court, not the report, that finally determines the rights of the parties.'\n\n What the District Judge was seeking when he appointed the auditor in the case at bar was just such aid. He required it himself, because without the aid to be rendered through the preliminary hearing and report, the trial judge would be unable to perform his duty of defining to the jury the issues submitted for their determination and \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 314]\n\u00a0\n of directing their attention to the matters actually in issue. United States v. Reading Railroad, \n123 \nU.S. 113, 114\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 77. The hearing and report were also essential as shown above to enable the jury to perform their specific duty. Owing to the difference in the character of the proceedings and of the questions ordinarily involved, the occasion for seeking such aid as is afforded to a judge by special masters, auditors, or examiners arises less frequently at law than in equity. A compulsory reference with power to determine issues is impossible in the federal courts because of the Seventh Amendment, United States v. Rathbone, 2 Paine, 578, Fed. Cas. No. 16,121; but no reason exists why a compulsory reference to an auditor to simplify and clarify the issues and to make tentative findings may not be made at law, when occasion arises, as freely as compulsory references to special masters are made in equity. Reference of complicated questions of fact to a person specially appointed to hear the evidence and make findings thereon has long been recognized as an appropriate proceeding in an action at law. Heckers v. Fowler, 2 Wall. 123. The inherent power of a federal court to invoke such aid is the same whether the court sits in equity or at law. We conclude, therefore, that the order, in so far as it appointed the auditor and prescribed his duties, was within the power of the court.\n Sixth. The clause in the order which provides that 'the expense of the auditor, including the expense of a stenographer, to be paid by either or both parties to this action, in accordance with the determination of the trial judge' requires special consideration. As Congress7 has made \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 315]\n\u00a0\n no provision for paying from public funds either the fees of auditors or the expense of the stenographer, the power to make the appointment without consent of the parties is practically dependent upon the power to tax the expense as costs. May the compensation of auditor and stenographer be taxed as costs; and, if so, may the expense be imposed in the discretion of the trial court upon either party?\n Federal trial courts have, sometimes by general rule, sometimes by decision upon the facts of a particular case, included in the taxable costs expenditures incident to the litigation which were ordered by the court because deemed essential to a proper consideration of the case by the court or the jury. Equity rule 68 (33 Sup. Ct. xxxviii) provides for taxing the fees of masters, and rule 50 (33 Sup. Ct. xxxii) for the expense of a stenographer. Both rules embody substantially the practice which had theretofore prevailed generally in equity proceedings, and which in the Southern District of New York had been followed not only in equity, American Diamond Drill Co. v. Sullivan Machine Co. (C. C.) 32 Fed. 552; Id ., \n131 U.S. 428\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 794; Brickill v. Mayor, etc., of City of New York (C. C.) 55 Fed. 565; Hohorst v. Hamburg-American Packet Co. (C. C.) 76 Fed. 472; but also in admiralty,T he E. Luckenbach ( D. C.) 19 Fed. 847; Rogers v. Brown (D. C.) 136 Fed. 813. The expense of printing the records and briefs in the trial court has been made by rule of court in \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 316]\n\u00a0\n several of the circuits taxable as costs against the defeated party, Hake v. Brown (C. C.) 44 Fed. 734. Compare Kelly v. Springfield Ry. Co. (C. C.) 83 Fed. 183; Tesla Electric Co. v. Scott (C. C.) 101 Fed. 524. As early as 1843 Mr. Justice Story, sitting at circuit in Whipple v. Cumberland Cotton Manufacturing Co., 3 Story, 84, Fed. Cas. No. 17,515, approved, in an action at law for damages, although not specially authorized by any rule, the order of a survey, as 'necessary for the true understanding of the cause on both sides,' and ordered the expense paid by them. In cases in which courts have refused to tax as costs copies of stenographer's minutes and other expenditures incident to the litigation, attention has been called to the fact that they were made for the benefit of the party, as distinguished from expenditures incurred under order of the court, to make possible or to facilitate its consideration of the case. Stallo v. Wagner, 245 Fed. 636, 158 C. C. A. 64; New Hampshire Land Co. v. Tilton (C. C.) 29 Fed. 764. But see Bridges v. Sheldon (C. C.) 7 Fed. 17, 42.\n The allowance of costs in the federal courts rests, not upon express statutory enactment by Congress, but upon usage long continued and confirmed by implication from provisions in many statutes. Mr. Justice Woodbury in Hathaway v. Roach, 2 Woodb. & M. 63, Fed. Cas. No. 6,213; Mr. Justice Nelson in Costs in Civil Cases, 1 Blatchf. 652, Fed. Cas. No. 18, 284; The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 377. In Hathaway v. Roach, 2 Woodb. & M. 67, Fed. Cas. No. 6,213, it is said to have been the usage of the federal courts--\n'to conform to the state laws as to costs, when no express provision has been made and is in force by any act of Congress in relation to any particular item, or when no general rule of court exists on this subject.'\n\n And in The Baltimore, 8 Wall. 390, 391 (19 L. Ed. 463) this court stated that--\n'The costs taxed in the Circuit and District Courts were the same as were allowed at that time in the courts of the state, including such matters as travel and attendance of the parties, fees for copies of the case, and abstracts for the hearing, compensation for the \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 317]\n\u00a0\n services of referees, auditors, masters, and assessors, and many other matters, not embraced in the fee bills, since passed by Congress.'8\n\n Neither the Act of February 26, 1853, c. 80, 10 Stat. 161, Rev. Stats .  983 (Comp. St.  1624), nor any later act of Congress or rule of court, deals expressly or by implication with the subject of taxing as costs the expense of an auditor. The practice, if any, governing in this respect the courts of New York would, therefore, be followed in the federal courts. See Huntress v. Town of Epsom (C. C.) 15 Fed. 732. But, so far as appears, the preliminary hearing before an auditor in aid of jury trials is not a part of the judicial machinery of that state. The nearest analogy to it is the reference had in actions at law on long accounts as a substitute for a jury trial. The expense of the compulsory reference in such actions is so taxable. Code Civ. Proc.  3256. As there is no statute, federal or state, and no rule of court excluding auditors' fees and the expense of his stenographer from the items taxable as costs, no reason appears why they may not be included, like other expenditures ordered by the court with a view to securing an intelligent consideration of a case.\n Seventh. The further question is whether the District Court had power to make the expense of the auditor taxable in whole or in part against the prevailing party, if the trial judge should so determine. The advantages of such a flexible rule are obvious. But general principles governing the taxation of costs in actions at law followed by the federal courts since their organization, preclude its adoption.\n While in equity proceedings the allowance and imposition of costs is, unless controlled by statute or rule of court, a matter of discretion, it has been uniformly held \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 318]\n\u00a0\n that in actions at law the prevailing party is entitled to costs as of right (compare United States v. Schurtz, \n102 \nU.S. 378, 407\n, 219 S.), except in those few cases where by express statutory provision or by established principles costs are denied. \n9\n It has also been generally held that this right to costs of the prevailing party in actions at law extends to the entire costs in the trial court, and that the court is without power to make an apportionment based upon the fact that the prevailing party has failed in part of his claims, or that for other reasons only a part or none of the costs should in fairness be allowed. \n10\n This rule of practice established by long usage is confirmed by the language of section 983 of the Revised Statutes. It would, therefore, be held to prevail over a rule, if any, to the contrary established in the courts of the state. But the practice in the courts of New York appears to be in this respect in entire harmony with that of the federal courts. \n11\n In Whipple v. Cumberland Cotton Manufacturing Co., supra, the expense of the survey ordered by the court was imposed by it equally on the two parties; and the same disposition was made in Primrose v. Fenno, supra, where the auditor had been appointed at the instance of the court without objection by either party. But in Houlihan v. Corporation of \n\n[253 U.S. 300, 319]\n\u00a0\n St. Anthony (C. C.) 173 Fed. 496, and 184 Fed. 252, 106 C. C. A. 394, where the auditor was appointed by consent of the parties, the same court taxed both the auditor's and the stenographer's fees against the losing party, holding that it had discretion, if it was not obliged to do so; and a petition for writ of certiorari was denied by this court. \n220 U.S. 613\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 717.\n Although the order was erroneous in declaring that the expense of the auditor shall, instead of abiding the result of the action, be paid by one or both of the parties in accordance with the determination of the trial judge, the error does not require that either of the extraordinary remedies applied for here be granted. If the petitioner deems himself prejudiced by the error he may get redress through application to the District Court for a modification of the order, or after final judgment on writ of error, from the Circuit Court of Appeals.

J., for petitioner.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 32, 33]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Samuel Heyman, of Jersey City, N. J., for respondent.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an application of J. Raymond Tiffany as receiver, appointed by the Court of Chancery of New Jersey, of William Necker, Incorporated, for a writ of mandamus, or in the alternative a writ of prohibition, the object of which is to require the District Judge and the District Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey to order the assets of the corporation, in the hands of a federal receiver, to be turned over to applicant for administration by him as receiver appointed by the New Jersey Court of Chancery.\n An order to show cause why the prayer of the petition should not be granted was issued, a return was made by the District Judge and the matter was argued and submitted. The pertinent facts are: On September 30, 1916, creditors and shareholders of William Necker, Incorporated, a corporation of the state of New Jersey, filed a bill in the United States District Court of New Jersey alleging the \n\n[252 U.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n insolvency of the corporation, praying for the appointment of a receiver, and a distribution of the corporate assets among the creditors and shareholders. The bill alleged diversity of citizenship as a ground for jurisdiction. The defendant corporation appeared and answered, admitting the allegations of the bill, and joined in the prayer that its assets be sold and distributed according to law. Upon consent the District Court appointed a receiver. The estate is insolvent, and the assets in the hands of the federal receiver are insufficient to pay credtors, and shareholders will receive nothing. On April 1, 1919, 2 1\/2 years after the appointment of the federal receiver, creditors of William Necker, Incorporated, filed a bill in the Court of Chancery of New Jersey alleging the corporation's insolvency, praying that it be decreed to be insolvent, that an injunction issue restraining it from exercising its franchises, and that a receiver be appointed to dispose of the property, and distribute it among creditors and shareholders. A decree was entered in said cause adjudging the corporation insolvent, and appointing the petitioner, J. Raymond Tiffany, receiver. Thereupon Tiffany made application to the United States District Court asking that its injunction enjoining the corporation and all of its officers and all other persons from interfering with the possession of the federal receiver be dissolved, that the federal receivership be vacated, and that the federal receiver turn over the assets of the company then in his hands, less administration expenses, to the chancery receiver for final distribution-the contention being that the appointment of the chancery receiver and the proceedings in the state court superseded the federal proceeding, and deprived the federal court of jurisdiction.\n The federal receiver had made various reports and conducted the business of the corporation up until the time of the application in the Court of Chancery of New \n\n[252 U.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n Jersey, in which the applicant was appointed receiver. It appears that the applicants in the state court also filed their verified claims with the federal receiver, and that no creditor or shareholder made objection to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the federal court until the application in the state court.\n The federal District Court permitted the chancery receiver to intervene, heard the parties, and delivered an opinion in which the matter was fully considered. As a result of such hearing and consideration an order was entered in which it was recited that Tiffany, the state receiver, had made an application to the federal District Court for an order directing it to turn over to the chancery receiver all of the assets of the corporation in the possession of the federal receiver, and the District Court ordered, adjudged and decreed that the said application of J. Raymond Tiffany, receiver in chancery, 'be and the same hereby is denied.'\n By Judicial Code,  128 (Comp. St.  1120), the Circuit Court of Appeals is given appellate jurisdiction to review by appeal or writ of error final decisions in the District Courts, with certain exceptions not necessary to be considered. It is clear that the order made in the District Court refusing to turn over the property to the chancery receiver was a final decision within the meaning of the section of the Judicial Code to which we have referred, and from which the chancery receiver had the right to appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals. By the order the right of the state receiver to possess and administer the property of the corporation was finally denied. The words 'final decision in the District Court' mean the same thing as 'final judgments and decrees,' as used in former acts regulating appellate jurisdiction. Loveland on Appellate Jurisdiction of Federal Courts,  39. This conclusion is amply sustained by the decisions of this court. Savannah v. Jesup, \n106 U.S. 563\n, 1 Sup. Ct. 512; Gumbel v. Pitkin, \n113 U.S. 545\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 616; \n\n[252 U.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n Krippendorf v. Hyde, \n110 \nU.S. 276, 287\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 27. See also a well-considered case in the Circuit Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit- Dexter Horton National Bank v. Hawkins, 190 Fed. 924, 111 C. C. A. 514.\n It is well settled that where a party has the right to a writ of error or appeal, resort may not be had to the extraordinary writ of mandamus or prohibition. In re Harding, \n219 U.S. 363\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 324, 37 L. R. A. (N. S.) 392; Ex Parte Oklahoma, \n220 U.S. 191\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 426.

PEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK(1920)\nNo. 46\nArgued: December 16, 1919Decided: November 22, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 126, 127]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Adelbert Moot and Mrs. Helen Z. M. Rodgers, both of Buffalo, N. Y ., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. James S. G. Ivins, of Albany, N. Y., and Ralph Averill Kellogg, of Buffalo, N. Y., for the People of the State of New York.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 126, 128]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought by the State of New York to recover penalties from the Bridge Company for failure to place upon its bridge a roadway for vehicles and a pathway for pedestrians between Squaw Island in Niagara River and the mainland of New York State as required by ch. 666 of the Laws of 1915 of the State of New York. The defendant set up that the act was contrary to the Constitution of the United States in specified respects, but the plaintiff got judgment in the Supreme Court, which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 223 N. Y. 137, 119 N. E. 351.\n The Bridge Company originally was incorporated by a special charter from the State of New York. Laws of 1857, c. 753. As the bridge was to cross the Niagara River from Buffalo to Canada, a similar corporation was created under the laws of Canada, 20 Vict. c. 227, and subsequently the two corporations were consolidated, pursuant to Laws of New York, 1869, c. 550, and a Canadian Act, 32 and 33 Vict. c. 65, subject to all the duties of each of the consolidated companies. By the Act of Congress of June 30, 1870, c. 176, 16 Stat. 173, any bridge constructed across the Niagara River in pursuance of the New York Act of 1857 and any acts of the New York legislature then in force amending the same was authorized as a lawful structure subject to the supervision of the Secretary of War and his approval of the plans. By the New York Act of 1857, 'Said bridge may be constructed as well for the passage of persons on foot and in carriages and otherwise as for the passage of railroad trains,'  15. And 'whenever said bridge shall be complete for the passage of ordinary teams and carriages' the company may erect toll gates and charge tolls not exceeding certain rates for foot passengers, carriages, &c. The original Canadian act had words similar to those just quoted from \n\n[254 U.S. 126, 129]\n\u00a0\n  15, except that it said 'shall be constructed' instead of 'may be,' a fact to which we shall advert again.\n Between 1870 and 1874 the bridge was built as required by the charter with one draw across Black Rock Harbor and one across the main channel of the river. It crossed Squaw Island on a trestle, afterwards filled in, but was built as a railroad bridge exclusively without any provision for footpaths or roadways. By the Act of Congress of June 23, 1874, c. 475, 18 Stat. 275, it was declared a lawful structure and an established post route for the mail of the United States. In the year 1899 a plan for rebuilding the bridge with wings for roadways and footpaths was approved by the Secretary of War subject to changes at the expense of the Company if the Secretary should deem them advisable. The rebuilding took place in 1899-1901, but omitted the wings, and this modification was assented to by the Secretary of War.\n The Niagara River is navigable at this point. In pursuance of plans for improvement adopted by the United States, in 1906 it acquired from the State of New York the land under Black Rock Harbor, lying on the New York side of Squaw Island, and the adjacent portions of the Erie Canal, both being within the limits of the State and crossed by the bridge. Thereafter the improvements were carried out.\n In 1907 the Secretary of War gave notice to the Company that the bridge over Black Rock Harbor and Erie Canal obstructed navigation and that changes were required. The Company submitted plans again showing in dotted lines wings for roadways and footpaths, noting that they were not to be put in at present but that provision was made in the design for their future construction. The plans were approved and the bridge was built without the wings, the completion being reported by his resident representative to the Secretary of War.\n By chapter 666 of the Laws of New York for 1915, the charter \n\n[254 U.S. 126, 130]\n\u00a0\n of the Company was amended so as to require the construction of a roadway for vehicles and a pathway for pedestrians upon the draw across Black Rock Harbor, the Company being allowed to charge tolls not exceeding specified sums. The Company failed to comply with the requirement and the time limit had expired before this suit was brought to recover penalties imposed by the act. It is found that the construction was necessary for the public interest and convenience; that the cost of the changes is insignificant in comparison with the assets and net earnings of the Company, and that it does not appear that the investment would not yield a reasonable return.\n The first objections to the new requirement made by the State are that it impairs the obligation of the contract in the original charter and takes the Company's property without due process of law. The argument is based partly upon a reduction of the tolls from those mentioned in the charter of 1857, made by the Act of 1915. Concerning this it is enough to say that the objection is premature. The clause relating to the construction of the roadway and pathway is distinct from and independent of that which fixes the maximum rates to be charged. The latter might be invalid and the former good. If the rates are too low they can be changed at any time. The only question now before us is whether the additions shall be built. As to that it would be going very far in the way of limiting the reserved right to amend such charters, if it should be held that the State had not the power to require what originally was contemplated in permissive words as part of the scheme. But however that might be, the New York Act authorizing consolidation subjected this consolidated corporation to the duties of the Canadian as well as of the New York charter, and the Canadian Act made the arrangement for foot passengers and carriages a duty. The words that we have quoted plainly impose one. The \n\n[254 U.S. 126, 131]\n\u00a0\n opinion in Attorney General v. International Bridge Co., 6 Ontario App. 537, 543, implies that they do so by speaking of the abandonment of a portion of the work as probably an abuse of the Act of Parliament, and the same is clearly stated in Canada Southern Ry. Co. v. International Bridge Co., 8 App. Cases, 723, 729.\n It is argued that, the Canadian Act governing only the Canadian side, its adoption by New York carried the obligation no farther. But it appears to us that it would be quibbling with the rational understanding of the duty assumed to say that the Company could have supposed that it had a contract or property right to confine its building of the footpath and carriage-way to the Canada side of the boundary line.\n The New York Legislature of course confined its command to the half of the bridge within its jurisdiction. It may be presumed that if that command is obeyed either Canada or the Company will see the propriety of carrying the way and path across to the other shore. At all events the power of New York to insist upon its rights is not limited by speculation upon that point. As we agree with the Court of Appeals that this amendment to the charter was within the power reserved to the State the objection under the contract clause of the Constitution of course must fail, and, it would seem, that under the Fourteenth Amendment also. But as to the latter we may add, as the Court of Appeals added, that there is nothing to show that the addition to the structure will not yield a reasonable return; if that be essential in view of the charter. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n216 U.S. 262\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 330; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission, \n242 U.S. 603\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 234.\n The only argument that impresses us and the one that was most pressed is that this is an international bridge, and that Congress has assumed such control of it as to exclude any intermeddling by the State. It is said that \n\n[254 U.S. 126, 132]\n\u00a0\n the bridge as constructed was and is devoted wholly to international commerce and that when Congress authorized it in that form in 1874 that authority must be regarded as the charter under which it was maintained. Without repeating the considerations urged in support of this conclusion we will state the reasons that prevail with us. The part of the structure with which we are concerned is within the territorial jurisdiction of the State of New York. There was no exercise of the power of eminent domain by the United States. The State was the source of every title to that land and, apart from the special purposes to which it might be destined, of every right to use it. Any structure upon it considered merely as a structure is erected by the authority of New York. The nature and qualifications of ownership are decided by the State and although certain supervening uses consistent with those qualifications cannot be interfered with by the State, still the foundation of a right to use the land at all must be laid by State law. Not only the existence of the Company but its right to build upon New York land came from New York, as was recognized by the form of the original Act of Congress of 1870, which speaks of any bridge built 'in pursuance of' the New York statutes. It did not, as perhaps the New York Consolidation Act did, refer to those statutes simply as documents and incorporate them, it referred to them as the source of the Company's power.\n From an early date the State has been recognized as the source of authority in the absence of action by Congress. Willson v. Blackbird Creek Marsh Co., 2 Pet. 245; Escanaba Co. v. Chicago, \n107 U.S. 678\n, 2 Sup. Ct. 185. And this Court has been slow to interpret such action as intended to exclude the source of rights from all power in the premises. In a case of navigable waters wholly within a State, over which a right of way had been conveyed to the United States and which the United States was spending considerable \n\n[254 U.S. 126, 133]\n\u00a0\n sums to improve, it was held that, whether or nor Congress had power to authorize private persons to build in such waters without the consent of the State, an act making comprehensive regulations of work within them did not manifest a purpose to exclude the previously existing authority of the State over such work. Cummings v. Chicago, \n188 \nU.S. 410, 413\n, 428 S., et seq ., 23 Sup. Ct. 472.\n But it is said that a different rule applies to an international stream and that Congress has recognized the distinction by the Act of March 3, 1899, c. 425,  9, 30 Stat. 1151 (Comp. St.  9971). It is true that that statute makes a distinction, but the distinction is that bridges may be built across navigable waters wholly within the State if approved by the Chief of Engineers and the Secretary of War, but, with regard to waters not wholly within the State, only after the consent of Congress has been obtained. The Act does not make Congress the source of the right to build but assumes that the right comes from another source, that is, the State. It merely subjects the right supposed to have been obtained from there to the further condition of getting from Congress consent to action upon the grant.\n No doubt in the case of an international bridge the action of a State will be scrutinized in order to avoid any possible ground for international complaint, but the mere fact that the bridge was of that nature would not of itself take away the power of the State over its part of the structure if Congress were silent, any more than the fact that it was a passageway for interstate commerce or crossed a navigable stream. When Congress has acted we see no reason for not leaving the situation as Congress has seemed to leave it, if on the most critical examination we discover no intent to withdraw State control, but on the contrary an assumption that the control is to remain. We have adverted to the implications of the general law of 1899 and have mentioned the statutes that deal specifically with \n\n[254 U.S. 126, 134]\n\u00a0\n this bridge. The act of 1874 declaring the existing bridge lawful was a confirmation which it was natural to seek but was not a repeal of the authority given to the Company in 1870 to build subject to the approval of the Secretary of War. The superstructure has been rebuilt since 1874 and the Secretary of War twice has approved plans showing the carriage and footways. It is true that the Company never has sought to execute that part of the plan, but on the facts that we have stated it appears to us a strange contention that it has contract or property rights not to be required to build the bridge or that Congress by implication has forbidden the State to demand that the plan recognized by everyone from the beginning should at last be carried out.\n The conveyance of a part of the land under the bridge to the United States for a public purpose not connected with the administration of the Government did not affect the authority of New York over the residue within the State, and taken in connection with the acts of the Government before and after the grant does not invalidate the statute of 1915 even in part.

King, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice NRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By the Act of August 10, 1917, c. 53,  15, 40 Stat. 276, 282 (Comp. St. 1918,  3115 1\/8 l), a war measure known as the Lever Act, Congress prohibited the use after September 9, 1917, of food materials or feeds in the production of distilled spirits for beverage purposes and authorized the President to limit of prohibit their use in the production of malt or vinous liquors for beverage purposes, so far as he might, from time to time, deem it essential to assure an adequate supply of food, or deem it helpful in promoting the national security or defense. Under the power so conferred the President, by proclamation of December 8, 1917, prohibited the production after January 1, 1918, of any 'malt liquor except ale and porter' containing more than 2.75 per centum of alcohol by weight. By proclamation of September 16, 1918, the prohibition was extended to 'malt liquors, including near beer, for \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 279]\n\u00a0\n beverage purposes, whether or not such malt liquors contain alcohol'; and by proclamation of March 4, 1919, the prohibition was limited 'to intoxicating malt liquors.' Under section 2 of the act (section 3115 1\/8 ee) the duty of enforcing the above provisions was assigned to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. This act contained no provision prohibiting the sale of intoxicating or other liquors.\n On November 21, 1918, the so-called War-Time Prohibition Act (40 Stat. 1045, c. 212) was approved. It provided that:\n'After May first, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, no grains, cereals, fruit, or other food product shall be used in the manufacture or production of beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor for beverage purposes. After June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, no beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor shall be sold for beverage purposes except for export. ...' Section 1.\n\n On February 6, 1919, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled ( Treasury Decision 2788) that a beverage containing as much as one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol by volume would be regarded as intoxicating within the intent of the Act of November 21, 1918, and that after May 1, 1919, persons would not be permitted to qualify as brewers if the alcoholic content of their product equaled or exceeded that percentage. In so ruling the Commissioner adopted and applied to this prohibitory act the same classification of malt liquors which had been applied in administering the laws concerning the taxation of beer and other similar fermented liquors. \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 280]\n\u00a0\n For since 1902 (Treasury Decision 514) fermented liquor containing as much as one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol had been treated as taxable under Revised Statutes,  3339 and 3242 (Comp. St.  6143, 5965), and this classification was expressly adopted in the War Revenue Act October 3, 1917, c. 63,  307, 40 Stat. 311 (Comp. St. 1918,  6144b). The correctness of this construction of the act was promptly and earnestly controverted by the brewers, who insisted that Congress had intended to prohibit the production only of such beer or other malt liquors as were in fact intoxicating. The attempt was then made to remove the doubt by new legislation before May 1, 1919, when the act would by its terms become operative. On February 26 the House Committee on the Judiciary reported favorably an amendment to H. R. 13581 providing:\n'The words 'beer, wine or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors' in the war prohibition act shall be construed to mean any liquors which contain in excess of one-half of one per centum of alcohol.'\n\n The Sixty-Fifth Congress ended on March 4 without acting on this bill, and the Sixty-Sixth Congress did not convene in extra session until May 19. On June 30, the House Committee on the Judiciary reported substantially the same provision as section 1 of title 1 of H. R. 6810; but it was not enacted until October 28, 1919, when as the Volstead Act (Act Oct. 28, 1919, c. 85) it was passed over the President's veto.a \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 281]\n\u00a0\n Immediately after the passage of the Volstead Act, this suit was brought in the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York by Jacob Ruppert against Caffey, United States Attorney, and McElligott, Acting Collector of Internal Revenue, to enjoin the enforcement as against the plaintiff of the penalties provided in the War-Time Prohibition Act as amended by the Volstead Act. It was heard below on plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and defendants' motion to dismiss, and, having been dismissed, was brought here by direct appeal under section 238 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215). The bill alleged that plaintiff, the owner of a brewery and appurtenances, was on October 28, 1919, engaged in the manufacture of a beer containing more than one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol by volume, and less than 2.75 per centum by weight or 3.4 per centum by volume, and had then on hand a large quantity of such beer, and that this beer was not in fact intoxicating. Plaintiff contended (1) that the act of November 21, 1918, had become void or had expired by its own terms before the bill was filed; (2) that its prohibition by its terms was limited to beer which was in fact intoxicating; (3) that the Act of October 28, 1919, title 1,  1, which purported to extend the prohibition to the manufacture and sale of beer not in fact intoxicating, exceeded the war power of Congress; and that thereby violation of rights guaranteed to plaintiff by the Fifth Amendment was threatened.\n This case was heard and decided below with Dryfoos et al. v. Edwards and it was argued here on the same day with that case and Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., \n251 U.S. 146\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 106, 64 L. Ed. --, decided December 15, 1919. For the reasons set forth in \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 282]\n\u00a0\n the opinion in those cases, the Act of November 21, 1918, was and remained valid as against the plaintiff and had not expired. For the same reasons section 1 of title 1 of the Act of October 28, 1919, was not invalid, merely because it was new legislation. But it is insisted that this legislation is nevertheless void as against the plaintiff, because Congress could not, even under its full war powers, prohibit the manufacture and sale of nonintoxicants, and, at all events, could not without making compensation, extend the prohibition to nonintoxicating liquor acquired before the passage of the act. These objections require consideration.\n First. May the plaintiff show as a basis for relief that the beer manufactured by it with alcoholic content not greater than 2.75 per centum in weight and 3.4 per centum in volume is not in fact intoxicating? The government insists that the fact alleged is immaterial since the passage of the Volstead Act by which the prohibition of the manufacture and sale is extended to all beer and other malt liquor containing as much as one- half of 1 per centum of alcohol by volume.\n If the war power of Congress to effectively prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors in order to promote the nation's efficiency in men, munitions and supplies is as full and complete as the police power of the states to effectively enforce such prohibition in order to promote the health, safety and morals of the community, it is clear that this provision of the Volstead Act is valid and has rendered immaterial the question whether plaintiff's beer is intoxicating. For the legislation and decisions of the highest courts of nearly all of the states establish that it is deemed impossible to effectively enforce either prohibitory laws or other laws merely regulating the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors, if liability or inclusion within the law is made to depend upon the issuable fact whether or not a particular liquor made or sold as a beverage is intoxicating. In other words, it clearly appears \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 283]\n\u00a0\n that a liquor law, to be capable of effective enforcement must, in the opinion of the Legislatures and courts of the several states, be made to apply either to all liquors of the species enumerated, like beer, ale or wine, regardless of the presence or degree of alcoholic content; or if a more general description is used, such as distilled, rectified, spirituous, fermented, malt, or brewed liquors, to all liquors within that general description regardless of alcoholic content;b or to such of these liquors as contain \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 284]\n\u00a0\n a named percentage of alcohol; and often several such standards are combined, so that certain specific and generic liquors are altogether forbidden and such other liquors as contain a given percentage of alcohol.\n A test often used to determine whether a beverage is to be deemed intoxicating within the meaning of the liquor law is whether it contains one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol by volume. A survey of the liquor laws of the states reveals that in sixteen states the test is either a list of enumerated beverages without regard to whether they contain any alcohol or the presence of any alcohol in a beverage, age, regardless of quantity;c in eighteen States it\n [284-Continued.]\n[284-Continued.]\n[284-Continued.]\n___ People v.

It does not follow that because a transaction separately considered is innocuous it may not be included in a prohibition the scope of which is regarded as essential in the legislative judgment to accomplish a \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 292]\n\u00a0\n purpose within the admitted power of the government.' \n226 U.S. 201\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 46. 'It was competent for the Legislature of Mississippi to recognize the difficulties besetting the administration of laws aimed at the prevention of traffic in intoxicants. \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 293]\n\u00a0\n It prohibited, among other things, the sale of 'malt liquors.' In thus dealing with a class of beverages which in general are regarded as intoxicating, it was not bound to resort to a discrimination with respect to ingredients and processes of manufacture which, in the en \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 294]\n\u00a0\n deavor to eliminate innocuous beverages from the condemnation, would facilitate subterfuges and frauds and fetter the enforcement of the law. A contrary conclusion logically pressed would save the nominal power while preventing its effective exercise.' \n226 U.S. 204\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 47. 'The state, \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 295]\n\u00a0\n within the limits its we have stated, must decide upon the measures that are needful for the protection of its people, and, having regard to the artifices which are used to promote the sale of intoxicants under the guise of innocent \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 296]\n\u00a0\n beverages, it would constitute an unwarrantable departure from accepted principle to hold that the prohibition of the sale of all malt liquors, including the beverage in question, was beyond its reserved power.' \n226 U.S. 205\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 47. \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 297]\n\u00a0\n That the federal government would, in attempting to enforce a prohibitory law, be confronted with difficulties similar to those encountered by the states is obvious; and both this experience of the states and the need of the federal government of legislation defining intoxicating liquors as was done in the Volstead Act was clearly set forth in the reports of the House Committee on the Judiciary in reporting the bill to the 65th Congress, 3d Session, Report 1143, February 26, 1919, and to the 66th Congress, 1st Session, Report 91, June 30, 1919. Furthermore, recent experience of the military forces had shown the necessity \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 298]\n\u00a0\n of fixing a definite alcoholic test for the purpose of administering the limited prohibitory law included in the Selective Service Act of May 18, 1917, c. 15,  12, 40 Stat. 76, 82 (Comp. St. 1918,  2019a).l And the Attorney General, calling attention specifically to the claim made in respect to the 2.75 per cent. beer, had pointed out to Congress that definition of intoxicating liquor by fixed standards was essential to effective enforcement of the prohibition law.m It is therefore \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 299]\n\u00a0\n clear both that Congress might reasonably have considered some legislative definition of intoxicating liquor to be essential to effective enforcement of prohibition and also that the definition provided by the Volstead Act was not an arbitrary one.\n\n Plaintiff's argument is equivalent to saying that the war power of Congress to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors does not extend to the adoption of such means to this end as in its judgment are necessary to the effective administration of the law. The contention appears to be, that since the power to prohibit the manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors is not expressly granted to Congress, but is a power implied under section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution, which authorizes Congress 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' powers expressly enumerated, the power to prohibit nonintoxicants would be merely an incident of the power to prohibit intoxicants, and that it cannot be held to exist, because one implied power may not be grafted upon another implied power. This argument is a mere matter of words. The police power of a state over the liquor traffic is not limited to the power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors supported by a separate implied power to prohibit kindred nonintoxicating liquors so far as necessary to make the prohibition of intoxicants effective; it is a single broad power to make such laws, by way of prohibition, as may be required to effectively suppress the traffic in intoxicating liquors. Likewise the implied \n___ 'The importance of this matter has been very much emphasized by our present efforts to enforce the War Prohibition Act. The claim is being made that beer containing as much as 2 3\/4 per cent. of alcohol is not intoxicating. And if this must be made a question of fact to be decided by each jury, but little in the way of practical results can be expected. I am, however, most earnestly insisting that, in view of the rulings for many years by the Internal Revenue Department, Congress meant when it used the word 'beer' a beverage of the class generally known as beer if it contained as much as one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol.' Letter of Attorney General to Senator Morris Shepherd, July 29, 1919, read in Senate, September 5, 1919, 58 Congressional Record, 5185. \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 300]\n\u00a0\n war power over intoxicating liquors extends to the enactment of laws which will not merely prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors but will effectually prevent their sale. Furthermore, as stated in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., supra, while discussing the implied power to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquors:\n'When the United States exerts any of the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, no valid objection can be based upon the fact that such exercise may be attended by the same incidents which attend the exercise by a state of its police power. ...'\n\n The distinction sought to be made by plaintiff between the scope or incidents of an express power and those of an implied power has no basis in reason or authority. Thus, the Constitution confers upon Congress the express power 'to establish post offices and post roads.' Article 1,  8, cl. 7. From this is implied the power to acquire land for post offices in the several states, Battle v. United States, \n209 U.S. 36\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 422; and as an incident of this implied power to acquire land, the further power is implied to take it by right of eminent domain, Kohl v. United States, \n91 U.S. 367\n. Likewise, the Constitution confers by clause 3 the express power 'to regulate commerce ... among the several states'; but ther is implied for this purpose also the power to grant to individuals franchises to construct and operate railroads from state to state. California v. Pacific Railroad Co., \n127 \nU.S. 1, 39\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 1073. Incidental to this implied power to construct or authorize the construction of a railroad is the further implied power to regulate the relations of the railroad with its employes, Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 47\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44; to require safety appliances upon cars, even when used in intrastate commerce, Southern Railway v. United States, \n222 U.S. 20\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 2; and to regulate freight rates even to the extent of affecting intrastate rates, American Express Co. v. Caldwell, \n244 U.S. 617\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 656. Whether it be for purposes of national defense, or for the purpose \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 301]\n\u00a0\n of establishing post offices and post roads, or for the purpose of regulating commerce among the several states, Congress has the power 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' the duty so reposed in the federal government. While this is a government of enumerated powers, it has full attributes of sovereignty within the limits of those powers. In re Debs, \n158 U.S. 564\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 900. Some confusion of thought might perhaps have been avoided, if, instead of distinguishing between powers by the term 'express and implied,' the term 'specific and general' had been used. For the power conferred by clause 18 of section 8 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' powers specifically enumerated is also an express power. Since Congress has power to increase war efficiency by prohibiting the liquor traffic, no reason appears why it should be denied the power to make its prohibition effective.\n Second. Does the fact that title 1 of the Volstead Act took effect upon its passage render section 1 invalid as against the plaintiff? Prohibition of the manufacture of malt liquors with alchoholic content of one-half of 1 per cent. or more is permissible only because, in the opinion of Congress, the war emergency demands it. If, in its opinion, the particular emergency demands the immediate discontinuance of the traffic Congress must have the power to require such discontinuance. To limit the power of Congress so that it may require discontinuance only after the lapse of a reasonable time from the passage of the act would seriously restrict it in the exercise of the war powers. Hardship resulting from making an act take effect upon its passage is a frequent incident of permissible legislation; but whether it shall be imposed rests wholly in the discretion of the lawmaking body. That the prohibition of the manufacture of nonintoxicating beer, if permissible at all, may be made to take effect immediately follows necessarily from the principle acted upon in Mugler v. Kansas, 123 \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 302]\n\u00a0\n U. S. 623, 669, 8 Sup. Ct. 273, since the incidents attending the exercise by Congress of the war power to prohibit the liquor traffic are the same as those that attend the states' prohibition under the police power. In the Mugler Case, also, the breweries were erected at a time when the state did not forbid the manufacture of malt liquors, and there it was alleged that the prohibition, which became effective almost immediately, would reduce the value of one of the breweries by three- fourths and would render the other of little value. Here as there, the loss resulting to the plaintiff from inability to use the property for brewery purposes, is an incident of the peculiar nature of the property and of the war need which, we must assume, demanded that the discontinuance of use be immediate. Plaintiff cannot complain because a discontinuance later would have caused him a smaller loss. This, indeed, appears to be conceded so far as concerns the brewery and appurtenances. The objection on the ground that the prohibition takes effect immediately is confined to the prohibition of the sale of the beer on hand at the time of the passage of the act. But as to that also we cannot say that the action of Congress was unreasonable or arbitrary.\n Plaintiff contends however that even if immediate prohibition of the sale of its nonintoxicating beer is within the war power, this can be legally effected, only provided compensation is made; and it calls attention to the fact that in Barbour v. Georgia, \n249 \nU.S. 454, 459\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 316, following some earlier cases, the question was reserved whether, under the police power, the states could prohibit the sale of liquor acquired before the enactment of the statute. It should, however, be noted that, among the judgments affirmed in the Mugler Case, was one for violation of the act by selling beer acquired before its enactment (see \n123 \nU.S. 625, 627\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 273), and that it was assumed without discussion that the same rule applied to the brewery and its product (\n123 U.S. 669\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 273). But we are not required to determine here the limits \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 303]\n\u00a0\n in this respect of the police power of the states; nor whether the principle is applicable here under which the federal government has been declared to be free from liability to an owner, 'for private property injured or destroyed during war, by the operations of armies in the field, or by measures necessary for their safety and efficiency' (United States v. Pacific Railroad, \n120 \nU.S. 227, 239\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 490, 495 30 L. Ed. 634); in analogy to that by which states are exempt from liability for the demolition of a house in the path of a conflagration (see Lawton v. Steele, \n152 \nU.S. 132, 136\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 499); or for garbage of value taken (Reduction Co. v. Sanitary Works, \n199 U.S. 306\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 100; Gardner v. Michigan, \n199 U.S. 325\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 106); or for unwholesome food of value destroyed (North American Storage Co. v. Chicago, \n211 U.S. 306\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 101, 15 Ann. Cas. 276; Adams v. Milwaukee, \n228 \nU.S. 572, 584\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 610), for the preservation of the public health. Here, as in Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., supra, there was no appropriation of private property, but merely a lessening of value due to a permissible restriction imposed upon its use.\n It is urged that the act is particularly oppressive in respect to the beer on hand, because the plaintiff was engaged in manufacturing and selling a nonintoxicating beverage expressly authorized by the President in his proclamation of December 8, 1917, and prohibited by him later, only when conservation of all the food products of the country became necessary. The facts afford no basis on which to rest the claim of an equity in the plaintiff's favor. The specific permission from the President to manufacture 2.75 per cent. beer was not on the ground that such beer was nonintoxicating; nor was it a declaration by him that this beer was in fact nonintoxicating. The permission extended to all 'ale and porter' which, every one knows, are intoxicating liquors.n This permission to \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 304]\n\u00a0\n make 2.75 per cent. beer was withdrawn December 1, 1918, under proclamation of September 16, 1918; and no permission to manufacture specifically 2.75 per cent. beer was ever thereafter given by the President. His later proclamation (March 4, 1919) merely limited the prohibition of the use of foodstuffs to use in the production of 'intoxicating liquors.' Whether 2.75 per cent. beer was intoxicating was thus left by the President, not only without a decision, but without even an intimation. The statement of plaintiff that the 2.75 per cent. beer on hand was manufactured under permission of the President is wholly unfounded. It was not until July 1, 1919, when the War-Time Prohibition Act became operative in this respect that there was any prohibition of the sale of any liquors. So far as appears, all the beer which the plaintiff had on hand at the time of the passage of the Volstead Act was manufactured by the plaintiff long after the President had ceased to have any authority to forbid or to permit.\n Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, with whom concurred Mr. Justice DAY, and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, dissenting.\n I cannot accept either the conclusion announced by the court or the reasons advanced to uphold it. The importance of the principles involved impels a dissent.\n We are not now primarily concerned with the wisdom or validity of general legislation concerning liquors, nor with the intoxicating qualities of beer, nor with measures taken by a state under its inherent and wide general powers to provide for public safety and welfare. Our problem concerns the power of Congress and rights of the citizen after a declaration of war, but when active \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 305]\n\u00a0\n hostilities have ended and demobilization has been completed.\n The government freely admits, since the present cause stands upon motion to dismiss a bill which plainly alleges that the beer in question is nonintoxicating, we must accept that allegation as true and beyond controversy. In United States v. Standard Brewery, \n251 U.S. 210\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 139, 64 L. Ed. --, decided this day, we rule in effect that for many months prior to the Volstead Act, passed October 28, 1919, no law of the United States forbade the production or sale of nonintoxicating malt liquors. And so the question for decision here distinctly presented, is this: Did Congress have power on October 28, 1919, directly and instantly to prohibit the sale of a nonintoxicating beverage, theretofore lawfully produced and which until then could have been lawfully vended, without making any provision for compensation to the owner?\n The federal government has only those powers granted by the Constitution. The Eighteenth Amendment not having become effective, it has no general power to prohibit the manufacture or sale of liquors. But by positive grant Congress has been empowered 'to declare war,' 'to raise and support armies,' 'to provide and maintain a navy,' 'to make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,' 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers'; and to these it is attempted to trace the asserted power to prohibit sale of complainant's beer. See, concerning implied powers, Cooley's Principles of Constitutional Law, 105; Story on the Constitution (4th Ed.)  1243\n\n\n The argument runs: This court has held in Hamilton, Collector, v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., decided December 8th, that under a power implied because necessary and proper to carry into execution the above named powers relating to war, in October, 1919, Congress could prohibit the sale \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 306]\n\u00a0\n of intoxicating liquors. In order to make such a prohibition effective the sale of nonintoxicating beer must be forbidden. Wherefore, from the implied power to prohibit intoxicants the further power to prohibit this nonintoxicant must be implied.\n The query at once arises: If all this be true, why may not the second implied power engender a third under which Congress may forbid the planting of barley or hops, the manufacture of bottles or kegs, etc. The mischievous consequences of such reasoning were long ago pointed out in Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 6, 10 (32 L. Ed. 346), where, replying to a suggestion that under the expressly granted power to regulate commerce, Congress might control related matters, it was said:\n'The result would be that Congress would be invested, to the exclusion of the states, with the power to regulate, not only manufactures, but also agriculture, horticulture, stock raising, domestic fisheries, mining-in short, every branch of human industry. For is there one of them that does not contemplate, more or less clearly, an interstate or foreign market?'\n\n For sixty years Ex parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2, 120, 125 (18 L. Ed. 281 ), has been regarded as a splendid exemplification of the protection which this court must extend in time of war to rights guaranteed by the Constitution, and also as decisive of its power to ascertain whether actual military necessity justifies interference with such rights. The doctrines then clearly-I may add, courageously-announced, conflict with the novel and hurtful theory now promulgated. A few pertinent quotations from the opinion will accentuate the gravity of the present ruling:\n'Time has proven the discernment of our ancestors; for even these provisions, expressed in such plain English words, that it would seem the ingenuity of man could not evade them, are now, after the lapse of more than seventy years, sought to be avoided. Those great and \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 307]\n\u00a0\n good men foresaw that troublous times would arise, when rulers and people would become restive under restraint, and seek by sharp and decisive measures to accomplish ends deemed just and proper; and that the principles of constitutional liberty would be in peril, unless established by irrepealable law. The history of the world had taught them that what was done in the past might be attempted in the future. The Constitution of the United States is a law for rulers and people, equally in war and in peace, and covers with the shield of its protection all classes of men, at all times, and under all circumstances. No doctrine, involving more pernicious consequences, was ever invented by the wit of man than that any of its provisions can be suspended during any of the great exigencies of government. Such a doctrine leads directly to anarchy or despotism, but the theory of necessity on which it is based is false; for the government, within the Constitution, has all the powers granted to it, which are necessary to preserve its existence, as has been happily proved by the result of the great effort to throw off its just authority. ...\n\n'This nation, as experience has proved, cannot always remain at peace, and has no right to expect that it will always have wise and humane rulers, sincerely attached to the principles of the Constitution. Wicked men, ambitious of power, with hatred of liberty and contempt of law, may fill the place once occupied by Washington and Lincoln; and if this right is conceded, and the calamities of war again befall us, the dangers to human liberty are frightful to contemplate. If our fathers had failed to provide for just such a contingency, they would have been false to the trust reposed in them. They knew-the history of the world told them-the nation they were founding, be its existence short or long, would be involved in war; how often or how long continued, human foresight could not tell; and that unlimited power, wherever lodged \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 308]\n\u00a0\n at such a time, was especially hazardous to freemen. For this, and other equally weighty reasons, they secured the inheritance they had fought to maintain, by incorporating in a written constitution the safeguards which time had proved were essential to its preservation. Not one of these safeguards can the President, or Congress, or the judiciary disturb, except the one concerning the writ of habeas corpus.'\n\n By considering the circumstances existing when the War-Time Prohibition Act was challenged, in order to reach the conclusion announced in Hamilton, Collector, v. Kentucky Distilleries & Warehouse Co., supra, this court asserted its right to determine the relationship between such an enactment and the conduct of war; the decision there really turned upon an appreciation of the facts. And that the implied power to enact such a prohibitive statute does not spring from a mere technical state of war but depends upon some existing necessity directly related to actual warfare, was recognized. Treating that opinion as though it asserted the existence of a general power delegated to Congress to prohibit intoxicants, certain cases which declare our inability to interfere with a state in the exercise of its police power (Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 U.S. 192\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 44; Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 U.S. 31\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 10, etc.) are now cited, and it is said they afford authority for upholding the challenged statute. But those cases are essentially different from the present one, both as to facts and applicable principles; the power exercised by the states was inherent, ever present, limited only by the Fourteenth Amendment, and there was no arbitrary application of it; the power of Congress recognized in Hamilton, Collector, etc., and here relied upon, must be inferred from others expressly granted and should be restricted, as it always has been heretofore, to actual necessities consequent upon war. It can only support a measure directly relating to such necessities and only so long as the relationship continues. Whether these \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 309]\n\u00a0\n essentials existed when a measure was enacted or challenged, presents a question for the courts; and, accordingly, we must come to this ultimate inquiry: Can it be truthfully said, in view of the well-known facts existing on October 28, 1919, that general prohibition immediately after that day of the sale of nonintoxicating beer theretofore lawfully manufactured, could afford any direct and appreciable aid in respect of the war declared against Germany and Austria?\n What were the outstanding circumstances? During the nineteen months- April, 1917, to November, 1918-when active hostilities were being carried on, and for almost a year thereafter, Congress found no exigency requiring it to prohibit sales of nonintoxicating beers. The armistice was signed and actual hostilities terminated November 11, 1918. Our military and naval forces, with very few exceptions, had returned and demobilization had been completed. The production of war material and supplies had ceased long before and huge quantities of those on hand had been sold. The President had solemnly declared:\n'The war thus comes to an end; for, having accepted these terms of armistice, it will be impossible for the German command to renew it.'\n\n Also:\n'That the object of the war is attained.' 'The quiet of peace and tranquility of settled hopes has descended upon us.'\n\n July 10, 1919, he announced, 'The war ended in November, eight months ago;' and in a message dated October 27, 1919, he declared that war emergencies which might have called for prohibition 'have been satisfied in the demobilization of the army and navy.' Food supplies were abundant, and there is no pretense that the enactment under consideration was intended to preserve them. Finally, the statute itself contains no declaration that prohibition of nonintoxicants was regarded as in any way essential to the proper conduct or conclusion of the war or to restoration of peace. \n\n[251 U.S. 264, 310]\n\u00a0\n Giving consideration to this state of affairs I can see no reasonable relationship between the war declared in 1917, or the demobilization following (both of which in essence, if not by formal announcement, terminated before October, 1919), or restoration of peace (whose quiet had already descended upon us) and destruction of the value of complainant's beverage, solemnly admitted in this record to be nonintoxicating and which it manufactured, held and desired to sell in strict compliance with the laws of New York. Nor can I discover any substantial ground for holding that such destruction could probably aid in an appreciable way the enforcement of any prohibition law then within the competency of Congress to enact. It is not enough merely to assert such a probability; it must arise from the facts.\n Moreover, well settled rights of the individual in harmless property and powers carefully reserved to the states, ought not to be abridged or destroyed by mere argumentation based upon supposed analogies. The Constitution should be interpreted in view of the spirit which pervades it and always with a steadfast purpose to give complete effect to every part according to the true intendment-none should suffer emasculation by any strained or unnatural construction. And these solemn words we may neither forget nor ignore:\n'Nor shall any person ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.'\n\n'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.'\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE also dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n Note a: 'The term 'War Prohibition Act' used in this act shall mean the provisions of any act or acts prohibiting the sale and manufacture of intoxicating liquors until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States. The words 'beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors' in the War Prohibition Act shall be hereafter construed to mean any such beverages which contain one-half of 1 per centum or more of alcohol by volume: Provided, that the foregoing definition shall not extend to dealcoholized wine nor to any beverage or liquid produced by the process by which beer, ale, porter or wine is produced, if it contains less than one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol by volume, and is made as prescribed in section 37 of title II of this act, and is otherwise denominated than as beer, ale, or porter, and is contained and sold in, or from, such sealed and labeled bottles, casks, or containers as the commissioner may by regulation prescribe.' \n Note b: Cases to this effect are Marks v.

George, 136 La. 906, 67 South. 956); in Georgia, Acts 1919, p. 123, changed the rule of Howard v. Acme Brewing Co., supra, see note (d) 4. \n Note c: 1. Alabama:-Gen. Laws Sp.

State, 159 Ala. 71, 78, 48 South. 864, 867, (133 Am. St. Rep. 20) stated that 'or other liquors or beverages ... which if drunk to excess will produce intoxication' did not modify or limit the prohibition of the liquors enumerated. Any unenumerated liquor, however, must be proved to be intoxicating if drunk to excess.\n Gen. Laws 1919, Act 7, p. 6, in terms prohibits all liquors containing any alcohol. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Arizona: Constitution, art. 23,  1, prohibits 'ardent spirits, ale, beer, wine, or intoxicating liquor, or liquors of whatever kind.'\n Brown v. State, 17 Ariz. 314, 152 Pac. 578, held that 'beer' was prohibited, whether or not it was intoxicating. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Arkansas: Acts 1917, Act 13, p. 41, as amended by Acts 1919, Act 87, p. 75, prohibits 'any alcoholic, vinous, malt, spirituous, or fermented liquors.'\n Seibert v. State, 121 Ark. 258, 180 S. W. 990, held that the enumerated liquors are prohibited, whether they are intoxicating or not if they contained any alcohol.\n An earlier act contained the words 'or other intoxicating liquors,' following 'or fermented liquors.' It was held in Bradshaw v. State, 76 Ark. 562, 89 S. W. 1051, that this clause did not modify the enumerated liquors, and that they were prohibited, whether intoxicating or not. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Colorado: Sess.

In re Lockman, 18 Idaho, 465, 110 Pac. 253, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 759, held that the enumerated liquors are within the act whether or not they are intoxicating. Constitutional amendment of November 7, 1916 (prohibition). Sess. Laws 1917, p. 528. The enforcement laws are cumulative, including Sess. Laws 1915, c. 28; Sess.

(N. S.) 1007 ( 1910), held that liquor containing any alcohol whatever is prohibited. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] Kansas: Laws 1881, c. 128,  1 (Gen. Stat. 1915,  5498), prohibits 'any spirituous, malt, vinous, fermented or other intoxicating liquors.'\n Intoxicating Liquor Cases, 25 Kan. 751, 37 Am.

Stat. 1915,  5501), amended the act of 1881 as follows: 'All liquors mentioned in section 1 of this act shall be construed and held to be intoxicating liquors within the meaning of this act.'\n State v.

Trione, 97 Kan. 365, 155 Pac. 29, declared that the former case is no longer the law, and that the mere presence of the liquors mentioned makes the substance intoxicating for purposes of the prohibition statutes.\n See, also, Laws 1917, cc. 215, 216, 'Bone-Dry Prohibition Law.' \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Louisiana:-Shreveport Ice Co. v. Brown, 128 Louisiana, 408, held that a statute regulating the sale of 'spiritous and intoxicating liquors' includes only intoxicating liquors.\n Acts of Extra Session, 1910, No. 171, defines 'Grog-Shop' as a place where 'intoxicating spirituous, vinous, or malt liquors are sold' (and forbids them in prohibition territory).\n State v. Maroun,128 La. 829, 55 South. 472, held that the malt liquors must be intoxicating to be within the meaning of the statute. \n Acts 1914, No. 146, repeats a similar definition of grog-shop or blind tiger. Acts 1914, No. 211, forbids the manufacture of near-beer with more than 1.59 per cent. of alcohol by weight or 2 per cent. by volume, and prohibits the sale of the near-beer thus made under the same roof where any other beverage is sold.\n State v. George, 136 La. 906, 67 South. 953, seems to hold that this near-beer may be sold in prohibition territory where the 'grog-shops' are not allowed. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Maryland: Laws 1914, c. 831,  1, p. 1569 (prohibition in certain counties), forbids 'any spirituous, vinous, fermented, malt, or intoxicating liquors, or any mixture thereof containing alcohol for beverage purposes. ...'\n Laws 1916, c. 389,  1, p. 786, prohibits in a certain county 'any kindred preparation or beverage, having the appearance and taste of lager beer ... except those beverages that are labeled ... stating that the beverage is free of alcohol.'\n See, also, note (d) 9, and note (h).

It goes without saying, I think, that if a law merely prohibits intoxicating liquors and leaves to the jury in each case, from the evidence produced, to determine whether the liquor in question is, in fact, intoxicating or not, its efficient and uniform administration will be impossible. The term 'intoxicating' is too indefinite and uncertain to produce anything like uniform results in such trials. Of course, there are certain liquors so generally known to be intoxicating that any court would take judicial notice of this fact. But in the absence of a definition by Congress there will be innumerable beverages as to which the claim will be made that they do not contain enough alcohol to render them intoxicating. These contentions will produce endless confusion and uncertainty. These, I think, are substantially the reasons why Congress should itself provide a definition. \n Note n: Webster defines ale as 'an intoxicating liquor made from an infusion of malt by fermentation and the addition of a bitter, usually hops,' and porter as 'a malt liquor, of dark color and moderately bitter taste, possessing tonic and intoxicating qualities.' \n\n\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJETT BROS DISTILLING CO. v. CITY OF CARROLLTON(1920)\nNo. 108\nArgued: December 19, 1919Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Helm Bruce, of Louisville, Ky., for plaintiff in error.[ Jett Bros Distilling Co. v. City of Carrollton \n252 U.S. 1\n (1920) ]\n\n\n[252 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Mr. A. E. Stricklett, of Covington, Ky., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The city of Carrollton brought suit against Jett Bros. Distilling Company to recover balances alleged to be due as taxes upon distilled spirits belonging to the company held in a bonded warehouse in that city. The taxes sued for were those for the years 1907 to 1916, inclusive. It appears that during those years the city assessor undertook to assess for taxation the distilled spirits in the bonded warehouse and the city taxes were paid as thus assessed. This suit was brought to recover taxes for the above-mentioned years upon the theory that during that period the spirits should have been valued by the state board of valuation and assessment as provided by the statutes of Kentucky. Ky. St.  4105, 4114. It was alleged that the valuation by the city assessor was without authority of law, by mistake, and for a much less sum than that fixed for each of said years by the state board. It was also alleged that the company had notice of the valuation fixed by the state board; that the city assessor was without authority to assess spirits in bonded warehouses; that the value fixed by him was an inconsiderable sum, and much less than that fixed by the state board in accordance with the Kentucky Statutes. The Distilling Company took issue upon the petition. It pleaded the original levies for the years in question and the payment of the taxes for each and all of the said years. It pleaded that the whisky which it was sought to tax under the new levy of 1915-1916 had been removed from the bonded warehouse of the company, and was no longer its property, and that it could no longer protect itself as it could have done had the tax been levied while the spirits were in its possession. \n\n[252 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n In the nineteenth paragraph of the answer a defense was set up upon a ground of federal right under the Constitution. It was averred that during all the years covered by the amended petition it had been the rule, custom, habit, practice and system in the city of Carrollton to assess and cause to be assessed the real estate therein at an average of not more than 40 per cent. of its fair cash value, and to assess and cause to be assessed personal property in that city at an average of not more than 30 per cent. of its fair cash value; that the assessment made by the state board upon which taxes were sought to be recovered was made at 100 per cent. of the fair cash value of the whisky, and that the attempt of the plaintiff to collect the same, was in violation of the defendant's rights under the Constitution of the state of Kentucky and the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The circuit court gave judgment in favor of the city for the amounts claimed under the new levy of 1916, giving credit for the amounts paid under the original levies for the preceding years. The company appealed to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, where the judgment of the circuit court was affirmed. 178 Ky. 561, 199 S. W. 37. There was no other reference to the federal Constitution than that contained in the answer, so far as we have been able to discover, and the Court of Appeals dealt with the federal question, deemed to be before it, as follows (178 Ky. 566, 199 S. W. 39):\n'It is further asserted that the recent cases of Green v. Louisville & Interurban Railway Company and Green v. Louisville Railway Company, decided by the Supreme Court of the United States and reported in 37 Supreme Court Reports, 673, uproot the contention that the act is c nstitutional, and hold that the state board of valuation, and the city assessor and board of supervisors, acting independently of each other, and fixing different valuations \n\n[252 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n of the same property, work a discrimination, inimical both to the federal and state constitutions. In this, however, appellant is in error. It must be borne in mind that complaint is only made of the assessment. The warehouseman had his remedy, in case of an excessive or unfair valuation, by appearing before the board of valuation and assessment at the time he rereceived notice of the valuation fixed, and there make complaint as provided in section 4107, Kentucky Statutes. This appellant failed to do but acquiesced in the assessment by paying taxes both to the county and state on the valuation fixed by the state board. This being true, it cannot be heard to complain now.'\n\n The case is brought here by the allowance of a writ of error. As the judgment was rendered after the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, Judicial Code,  237 (Comp. St.  1214), became effective, that act must determine the right to have a review in this court.\n If the case can come here by writ of error, it is because there was drawn in question the validity of a statute, or authority, exercised under the state on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States. Before the petition for rehearing the contentions based upon constitutional grounds, by the plaintiff in error, were those embraced in the nineteenth paragraph of the answer, to which we have referred, and such as were deemed to be before the Court of Appeals of Kentucky in the portion of the opinion from which we have quoted. Neither the answer nor the opinion of the Court of Appeals shows that any claim under the federal Constitution was made assailing the validity of a statute of the state, or of an authority exercised under the state, on the ground of repugnancy to the federal Constitution. The answer, in the nineteenth paragraph, set up discrimination because of different valuations of the property of others, claimed to violate \n\n[252 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. The opinion of the Court of Appeals likewise discussed the discriminatory action alleged by the plaintiff in error.\n Drawing in question the validity of a statute or authority as the basis of appellate review has long been a subject of regulation in statutes of the United States, as we had occasion to point out in Champion Lumber Co. v. Fisher, \n227 \nU.S. 445, 450\n, 451 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 329. What is meant by the validity of a statute or authority was discussed by this court in Baltimore & Potomac Railroad Co. v. Hopkins, \n130 U.S. 210\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 503, in which this court, speaking by Mr. Chief Justice Fuller, said:\n'Whenever the power to enact a statute as it is by its terms, or is made to read by construction, is fairly open to denial and denied, the validity of such statute is drawn in question, but not otherwise.'\n\n And the Chief Justice added, upon the authority of Millingar v. Hartupee, 6 Wall. 258, 261, 262, that the word 'authority' stands upon the same footing.\n In order to give this court jurisdiction by writ of error under amended section 237, Judicial Code, it is the validity of the statute or authority which must be drawn in question. The mere objection to an exercise of authority under a statute, whose validity is not attacked, cannot be made the basis of a writ of error from this court. There must be a substantial challenge of the validity of the statute or authority upon a claim that it is repugnant to the federal Constitution, treaties, or laws, so as to require the state court to decide the question of validity in disposing of the contention. Champion Lumber Co. v. Fisher, 227 U. S. supra and cases cited.\n In the present case no such claim of the invalidity of a state statute or authority was raised in a manner requ ring the court below to pass upon the question in disposing of the rights asserted. As we have said, whatever the effect of a petition for rehearing, it came too late \n\n[252 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n to make the overruling of it, in the absence of an opinion, the basis of review by writ of error. It follows that the allowance of the writ of error in the present case did not rest upon a decision in which was drawn in question the validity of a statute of the state or any authority exercised under it because of repugnancy to the federal Constitution, and the writ of error must be dismissed; and it is so ordered.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJIN FUEY MOY v. U S(1920)\nNo. 44\nArgued: October 11, 1920Decided: December 6, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 189, 190]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. H. Ralph Burton, of Washington, D. C., John W. Dunkle, of Pittsburgh, Pa., and Blaine Mallan, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error was indicted and convicted for violating section 2 of an Act of Congress approved December 17, 1914, commonly known as the Harrison Anti-Narcotic Act (38 Stat. 785, ch. 1 [Comp. St.  6287h]).1 His motion in arrest of judgment having \n\n[254 U.S. 189, 191]\n\u00a0\n been overruled (253 Fed. 213), he brought the case here by direct writ of error under section 238, Judicial Code, upon the ground of the unconstitutionality of the act. Afterwards this question was set at rest by our decision in United States v. Doremus, \n249 U.S. 86\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 214, sustaining the act; but our jurisdiction continues for the purpose of disposing of other questions raised in the record. Brolan v. United States, \n236 U.S. 216\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 285; Pierce v. United States, \n252 U.S. 239\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 205.\n These questions relate to the sufficiency of the indictment, the adequacy of the evidence to warrant a conviction, the admissibility of certain evidence offered by defendant and rejected by the trial court, and the instructions given and refused to be given to the jury.\n The indictment contained twenty counts, differing only in matters of detail. Defendant was convicted upon eight counts, acquitted upon the others. Each count averred that on a date specified, at Pittsburgh, in the county of Allegheny, in the Western district of Pennsylvania, and within the jurisdiction of the court, defendant was a practicing physician, and did unlawfully, willfully, knowingly, and feloniously sell, barter, exchange, and give away certain derivatives and salts of opium, to wit, a specified quantity of morphine sulphate, to a person named, not in pursuance of a written order from such person on a form issued in blank for that purpose by the \n\n[254 U.S. 189, 192]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner of Internal Revenue under the provisions of section 2 of the act, 'in manner following, to-wit, that the said Jin Fuey Moy, at the time and place aforesaid, did issue and dispense' to the person named a certain prescription of which a copy was set forth, and that said person 'was not then and there a patient of the said Jin Fuey Moy, and the said morphine sulphate was dispensed and distributed by the said Jin Fuey Moy not in the course of his professional practice only; contrary to the form of the act of Congress,' etc.\n It is objected that the act of selling or giving away a drug and the act of issuing a prescription are so essentially different that to allege that defendant sold the drug by issuing a prescription for it amounts to a contradiction of terms, and the repugnance renders the indictment fatally defective. The government suggests that the clause as to issuing the prescription may be rejected as surplusage; but we are inclined to think it enters so intimately into the description of the offense intended to be charged that it cannot be eliminated, and that unless defendant could 'sell,' in a criminal sense, by issuing a prescription, the indictment is bad. If 'selling' must be confined to a parting with one's own property there might be difficulty. But by section 332 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10506):\n'Whoever directly commits any act constituting an offense, defined in any law of the United States, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, or procures its commission, is a principal.'\n\n Taking this together with the clauses quoted from section 2 of the Anti-Narcotic Act, it is easy to see, and the evidence in this case demonstrates, that one may take a principal part in a prohibited sale of an opium derivative belonging to another person by unlawfully issuing a prescription to the would-be purchaser. Hence there is no necessary repugnance between prescribing and selling, and the indictment must be sustained.\n The evidence shows that defendant was a practicing \n\n[254 U.S. 189, 193]\n\u00a0\n physician in Pittsburgh, registered under the act so as to be allowed to dispense or distribute opium and its derivatives without a written order in official form, 'in the course of his professional practice only'; that he was in the habit of issuing prescriptions for morphine sulphate without such written order and not in the ordinary course of professional practice; that he issued them to persons not his patients and not previously known to him, professed morphine users, for the mere purpose, as the jury might find, of enabling such persons to continue the use of the drug, or to sell it to others; in some cases he made a superficial physical examination, in others none at all; his prescriptions called for large quantities of morphine-8 to 16 drams at a time-to be used 'as directed', while the directions left the recipient free to use the drug virtually as he pleased. His charges were not according to the usual practice of medical men, but according to the amount of the drug prescribed, being invariably one dollar per dram. All the prescriptions were filled at a single drug store in Pittsburgh, the recipients being sent there by defendant for the purpose; and persons inquiring at that drug store for morphine were sent to defendant for a prescription. The circumstances strongly tended to show co-operation between defendant and the proprietors of the drug store. At and about the dates specified in the indictment-the spring of the year 1917-and for more than two years before, the number of prescriptions issued by defendant and filled at this drug store ran into the hundreds each month, all calling for morphine sulphate or morphine tablets in large quantities. In one case a witness who had procured from defendant two prescriptions-one in his own name for 10 drams, the other in the name of a fictitious wife for 6 drams-and had been directed by defendant to the specified drug store in order to have them filled, asked defendant to confirm the prescriptions by telephone so there would be no trouble; to which defendant replied:- \n\n[254 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n 'Oh, never mind; we do business together; we understand each other.'\n On another occasion the same witness, having received from defendant two prescriptions for 8 drams each, one in his own name, the other in the name of the supposed wife, stating in one case a Cleveland address, in the other a Pittsburgh address, presented them at the drug store to be filled, and was told by the manager that he would not fill any more prescriptions under a Pittsburgh address; 'they were taking too big a chance, and I must go back to the Chinaman and tell him what he told me, and he would understand-the Chinaman would understand.' Witness returned the two prescriptions to defendant, told him what the manager had said, and defendant retained those prescriptions and issued to the witness a new one for 16 drams in place of them, with which the witness returned to the drug store and procured the specified quantity of the drug.\n In each case where defendant was found guilty the evidence fully warranted the jury in finding that he aided, abetted, and procured a sale of morphine sulphate without written order upon a blank form issued by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, and that he did this by means of a prescription issued not to a patient and not in the course of his professional practice, contrary to the prohibition of section 2 of the act. Manifestly the phrases 'to a patient' and 'in the course of his professional practice only' are intended to confine the immunity of a registered physician, in dispensing the narcoticdrugs mentioned in the act, strictly within the appropriate bounds of a physician's professional practice, and not to extend it to include a sale to a dealer or a distribution intended to cater to the appetite or satisfy the craving of one addicted to the use of the drug. A 'prescription' issued for either of the latter purposes protects neither the physician who issues it nor the dealer who knowingly accepts and fills it. Webb v. United States, \n249 U.S. 96\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 217. \n\n[254 U.S. 189, 195]\n\u00a0\n Errors assigned to the instructions given and refused to be given by the trial judge to the jury are disposed of by what we have said.\n But a single point remains-hardly requiring mention-the refusal to permit defendant's wife to testify in his behalf. It is conceded that she was not a competent witness for all purposes, a wife's evidence not having been admissible at the time of the first Judiciary Act, and the relaxation of the rule in this regard by sec. 858, Rev. Stat. U. S., being confined to civil actions. Logan v. United States, \n144 U.S. 263\n, 299-302, 12 Sup. Ct. 617; Hendrix v. United States, \n219 \nU.S. 79, 91\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 193. But, it is said, the general rule does not apply to exclude the wife's evidence in the present case because she was offered not 'in behalf of her husband,' that is, not to prove his innocence, but simply to contradict the testimony of particular witnesses for the government who had testified to certain matters as having transpired in her presence. The distinction is without substance. The rule that excludes a wife from testifying for her husband is based upon her interest in the event, and applies irrespective of the kind of testimony she might give.\n The judgment under review is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 2. That it shall be unlawful for any person to sell, barter, exchange, or give away any of the aforesaid drugs except in pursuance of a written order of the person to whom such article is sold, bartered, exchanged, or given, on a form to be issued in blank for that purpose by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. ...

STATE OF MARYLAND(1920)\nNo. 289\nArgued: October 18, 1920Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. W. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Alexander Armstrong and J. Purdon Wright, both of Baltimore, Md., for the State of Maryland.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 51, 55]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The plaintiff in error was an employee of the Post Office Department of the United States, and while driving a government motor truck in the transportation of mail over a post road from Mt. Airy, Maryland, to Washington, was arrested in Maryland, and was tried, convicted and fined for so driving without having obtained a license from the State. He saved his constitutional rights by motion to quash, by special pleas which were overruled upon demurrer and by motion in arrest of judgment. The facts were admitted and the naked question is whether the State has power to require such an employe to obtain a license by submitting to an examination concerning his competence and paying three dollars, before performing his official duty in obedience to superior command.\n The cases upon the regulation of interstate commerce can not be relied upon as furnishing an answer. They deal with the conduct of private persons in matters in which the States as well as the general government have an interest and which would be wholly under the control of the States but for the supervening destination and the ultimate purpose of the acts. Here the question is whether the State can interrupt the acts of the general government itself. With regard to taxation, no matter how reasonable, or how universal and undiscriminating, the State's inability to interfere has been regarded as established since McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316. The decision in that case was not put upon any consideration of degree but upon the entire absence of power on the part of the \n\n[254 U.S. 51, 56]\n\u00a0\n States to touch, in that way at least, the instrumentalities of the United States; 4 Wheat. 429, 430; and that is the law today. Farmers' & Mechanics' Savings Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 \nU.S. 516, 525\n, 526 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 354. A little later the scope of the proposition as then understood was indicated in Osborn v. Bank of the United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 867 (6 L. Ed. 204)--\n'Can a contractor for supplying a military post with provisions, be restrained from making purchases within any State, or from transporting the provisions to the place at which the troops were stationed? or could he be fined or taxed for doing so? We have not yet heard these questions answered in the affirmative.'\n\n In more recent days the principle was applied when the governor of a soldier's home was convicted for disregard of a state law concerning the use of oleomargarine, while furnishing it to the inmates of the home as part of their rations. It was said that the Federal officer was not 'subject to the jurisdiction of the State in regard to those very matters of administration which are thus approved by Federal authority.' Ohio v. Thomas, \n173 \nU.S. 276, 283\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 453, 455 (43 L. Ed. 699). It seems to us that the foregoing decisions establish the law governing this case.\n Of course an employee of the United States does not secure a general immunity from state law while acting in the course of his employment. That was decided long ago by Mr. Justice Washington in United States v. Hart, Pet. C. C. 390, Fed. Cas. No. 15,316; 5 Op. Attys. Gen. 554. It very well may be that, when the United States has not spoken, the subjection to local law would extend to general rules that might affect incidentally the mode of carrying out the employment-as, for instance, a statute or ordinance regulating the mode of turning at the corners of streets. Commonwealth v. Closson, 229 Mass. 329, 118 N. E. 653, L. R. A. 1918C, 939. This might stand on much the same footing as liability under the common law of a state to a person injured by the driver's negligence. But even the most unquestionable and most universally applicable of state laws, such as those concerning \n\n[254 U.S. 51, 57]\n\u00a0\n murder, will not be allowed to control the conduct of a marshal of the United States acting under and in pursuance of the laws of the United States. Exparte Neagle, \n135 U.S. 1\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 658.\n It seems to us that the immunity of the instruments of the United States from state control in the performance of their duties extends to a requirements that they desist from performance until they satisfy a state officer upon examination that they are competent for a necessary part of them and pay a fee for permission to go on. Such a requirement does not merely touch the Government servants remotely by a general rule of conduct; it lays hold of them in their specific attempt to obey orders and requires qualifications in addition to those that the Government has pronounced sufficient. It is the duty of the Department to employ persons competent for their work and that duty it must be presumed has been performed. Keim v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 290, 293\n, 20 S. Sup.

U S(1920)\nNo. 154\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 147, 148]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander Britton and Evans Browne, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Spellacy, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, in its petition, alleges: That in June, 1906, it entered into contracts with the Post Office Department to transport the mails over three designated routes 'upon the conditions prescribed by law and the regulations of the Department applicable to railroad mail service'; that during the fiscal year 1907 (the petition was not filed until December 19, 1912) the Department withheld from its stipulated pay $3,355. 48, 'as a penalty imposed on account of late arrivals ... of trains, and failure to perform service on the ... mail routes'; and that such deductions were 'unlawfully withheld.' The prayer was for judgment for the full amount of the deductions, which are also designated in the record as fines or penalties. The petition was dismissed by the Court of Claims.\n The appellant acquiesced in the deductions when they were made, accepted the reduced compensation without protest or objection, except in one instance, when the item complained of was adjusted to its satisfaction, and continued to perform the contracts to the end of their \n\n[252 U.S. 147, 149]\n\u00a0\n four-year periods without complaint as to the reasonableness of the deductions involved. And thus it comes admitting that it freely entered into the contracts, fully performed them and accepted pay for such performance, but asking judgment for deductions which it avers were 'unlawfully withheld' more than five years before the petition was filed.\n The contracts were of the type, familiar in many reported cases, evidenced by 'distance circulars,' orders establishing the routes, specific agreements on the part of the contractor that it would perform the service 'upon the conditions prescribed by law and the regulations of the Department applicable to railroad service' and that the 'adjustment' should be 'subject to future orders and to fines and deductions.'\n Among the applicable 'conditions prescribed by law' were: R. S. 3962 ( Comp. St.  7450), that the Postmaster General might 'make deductions from the pay of contractors, for failure to perform service according to contract, and impose fines upon them for other delinquencies'; R. S. 4002 ( Comp. St.  7483), authorizing contracts for the conveyance of the mails 'with due frequency and speed'; and the act of June 26, 1906 (34 Stat. 467, 472), commanding the Postmaster General to require all railroads carrying mail to comply with the terms of their contracts 'as to time of arrival and departure of mails' and 'to impose and collect reasonable fines for delay' when not caused by unavoidable accidents or conditions.\n It is conceded by the appellant that the Postmaster General had authority under R. S. 3962, to make deductions from the pay when a 'trip was not performed' within 24 hours of the stipulated time for performance. But it is contended that he had no authority to make deductions or impose fines for shorter delays, and this is the sole question upon which this appeal is pursued into this court. \n\n[252 U.S. 147, 150]\n\u00a0\n It is argued for t e appellant: That power to make the disputed deductions must be found, if at all, in the provision of R. S. 3962, that the Postmaster General may 'make deductions from the pay of contractors for failure to perform service according to contract, and impose fines upon them for other delinquencies'; that when the contracts were made long departmental construction had limited the failure to perform service, described in the act, to 24 hours of delay in the arrival of trains; and that failure, from 1872, when the section was enacted, to 1907, to impose fines or deductions for shorter delays, amounted to a construction by the Department that authority to impose fines upon contractors for delinquencies did not warrant deductions for failure to maintain train schedules when the delay was less than 24 hours.\n We need consider only this last contention, and in reply it is pointed out that the findings of fact show: That the amount and rates of compensation were determined by the Department for the various routes between the 10th and 26th of September, 1906, though effective as of the 1st day of the preceding July; that in October, 1905, the Postmaster General, 'on account of the failure to observe schedules on routes or parts of routes,' issued an order that deductions should be made, in sums stated, after December 31, 1905, when trains arrived at termini or junction points 15 or more minutes late, a designated number of times in a quarter; and that the act of Congress approved June 26, 1906, referred to, declared it to be the duty of the Postmaster General to impose and collect reasonable fines for failure of railroads to comply with the terms of their contracts with respect to the time of arrival and departure of mails. This act was repealed in the following year, but the substance of it was immediately re-enacted in a more adaptable form.\n Thus the appellant had notice before it made the contracts \n\n[252 U.S. 147, 151]\n\u00a0\n under discussion that failure to maintain train schedules was regarded by Congress and the Department as a violation of mail-carrying contracts, justifying the imposition of fines or deductions, and that both believed there was authority under the customary contracts and the law to impose such deductions. The act of June 26, 1906, was not a grant of new power to the Postmaster General to impose such fines or deductions, but was an imperative direction to him to exercise the power which, it assumes, he already had for that purpose.\n This action of Congress and of the Department is sufficient answer to the claim, if it were otherwise sound, that failure to exercise the power to impose fines for such a cause amounted to a departmental declaration that no such power existed.\n But the contention is not sound. Failure, within moderate limits, to maintain train schedules, may well have been regarded by the Postmaster General as a necessary evil to be tolerated and not to call for the exercise of his power to impose fines under the statute, when more flagrant neglect to maintain such schedules might very justly require him to exercise such authority in order to prevent intolerable public inconvenience. We cannot doubt that the contracts of the appellant, and the law which was a part of them, furnished ample authority for the action of the Department in this case and that omission to exercise such power did not make against the proper use of it when, in the judgment of the Postmaster General, adequate occasion for its use should arise.\n We need not pursue the subject further. The principles involved are adequately and admirably discussed by the Court of Claims in its opinion rendered in the case of Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. United States, 53 Ct. Cl. 238, upon authority of which this case was decided.\n The judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKENNEY v. SUPREME LODGE OF THE WORLD, L O M(1920)\nNo. 269\nArgued: March 23, 1920Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Griffith R. Harsh, of Birmingham, Ala., for petitioner and plaintiff in error. \n\n[252 U.S. 411, 412]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. E. J. Henning, of San Diego, Cal., and Ralph C. Putnam, of Aurora, Ill., for respondent and defendant in error.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 411, 413]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action of debt brought in Illinois upon a judgment recovered in Alabama. The defendant pleaded \n\n[252 U.S. 411, 414]\n\u00a0\n to the jurisdiction that the judgment was for negligently causing the death of the plaintiff's intestate in Alabama. The plaintiff demurred to the plea, setting up Article IV, sections 1 and 2 of the Constitution of the United States. A statute of Illinois provided that no action should be brought or prosecuted in that State for damages occasioned by death occurring in another State in consequence of wrongful conduct. The Supreme Court of Illinois held that as by the terms of the statute the original action could not have been brought there, the Illinois Courts had no jurisdiction of a suit upon the judgment. The Circuit Court of Kane County having ordered that the demurrer be quashed its judgment was affirmed. 285 Ill. 188, 120 N. E. 631, 4 A. L. R. 964.\n In the Court below and in the argument before us reliance was placed upon Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., No. 1, \n191 U.S. 373\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 92, and language in Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 U.S. 265\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 1370, the former as showing that the clause requiring full faith and credit to be given to judgments of other State does not require a State to furnish a Court, and the latter as sanctioning an inquiry into the nature of the original cause of action in order to determine the jurisdiction of a court to enforce a foreign judgment founded upon it. But we are of opinion that the conclusion sought to be built upon these premises in the present case cannot be sustained.\n Davis Provision Co. v. Anglo-American Provision Co. was a suit by a foreign corporation on a foreign judgment against a foreign corporation. The decision is sufficiently explained without more by the views about foreign corporations that had prevailed unquestioned since Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 13 Pet. 579, 589-591; cited \n191 U.S. 375\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 92. Moreover no doubt there is truth in the proposition that the Constitution does not require the State to furnish a Court. But it also is true that there are limits to the power of exclusion and to the power to consider the nature of \n\n[252 U.S. 411, 415]\n\u00a0\n the cause of action before the foreign judgment based upon it is given effect.\n In Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 U.S. 230\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 641, it was held that the Courts of Mississippi were bound to enforce a judgment rendered in Missouri upon a cause of action arising in Mississippi and illegal and void there. The policy of Mississippi was more actively contravened in that case than the policy of Illinois is in this. Therefore the fact that here the original cause of action could not have been maintained in Illinois is not an answer to a suit uo n the judgment. See Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290; Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 U.S. 243\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292. But this being true, it is plain that a State cannot escape its constitutional obligations by the simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to Courts otherwise competent. The assumption that it could not do so was the basis of the decision in International Text Book Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 111\n, 112 S., 30 Sup. Ct. 481, 27 L. R. A. (N. S.) 493, 18 Ann. Cas. 1103, and the same principle was foreshadowed in General Oil Co. v. Crain, \n209 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 220 S., 228, 28 Sup. Ct. 475, and in Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 235\n, 236 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 641. See Keyser v. Lowell, 117 Feb. 400, 54 C. C. A. 574; Chambers v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n207 \nU.S. 142, 148\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 34, and cases cited. Whether the Illinois statute should be construed as the Mississippi Act was construed in Fauntleroy v. Lum was for the Supreme Court of the State to decide, but read as that Court read it, it attempted to achieve a result that the Constitution of the United States forbade.\n Some argument was based upon the fact that the statute of Alabama allowed an action to be maintained in a court of competent jurisdiction within the State 'and not elsewhere.' But when the cause of action is created the invalidity of attempts to limit the jurisdiction of other states to enforce it has been established by the decisions of this Court.

Ct. 397; and had these decisions been otherwise \n\n[252 U.S. 411, 416]\n\u00a0\n they would not have imported that a judgment rendered exactly as required by the Alabama statute was not to have the respect due to other judgments of a sister State.\n As the judgment below upheld a statute that was invalid as construed the writ of error was the proper proceeding and the writ of certiorari must be dismissed.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","82":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKNICKERBOCKER ICE CO. v. STEWART(1920)\nNo. 543\nArgued: December 16, 1919Decided: May 17, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 149, 150]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank R.

Stewart fell into the Hudson river and drowned-August 3, 1918. His widow, defendant in error, claimed under the Workmen's Compensation Law of New York (Consol. Laws N. Y. c. 67); the Industrial Commission granted an award against the company for her and the minor children; and both Appellate \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 156]\n\u00a0\n Division and the Court of Appeals approved it. Stewart v. Knickerbocker Ice Co., 226 N. Y. 302, 123 N. E. 382. The latter concluded that the reasons which constrained us to hold the Compensation Law inapplicable to an employe engaged in maritime work-Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900-had been extinguished by 'An act to amend sections twenty-four and two hundred and fifty-six of the Judicial Code, relating to the jurisdiction of the District Courts, so as to save to claimants the rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any state,' approved October 6, 1917. 40 Stat. 395, c. 97 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  991 \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 3]\n\u00a0\n, 1233).\n The provision of section 9, Judiciary Act 1789 (1 Stat. 76, c. 20), granting to United States District Courts 'exclusive original cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, ... saving to suitors, in all cases, the right of a common-law remedy, where the common law is competent to give it,' was carried into the Revised Statutes ( sections 563 and 711 [Comp. St.  1233]) and thence intot he Judicial Code ( clause 3, sections 24 and 256 [Comp. St.  991(3), 1233]). The saving clause remained unchanged until the statute of October 6, 1917, added 'and to claimants the rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any state.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[253 U.S. 149, 157]\n\u00a0\n In Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen (May, 1917) \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, we declared that under section 2, article 3, of the Constitution ('The judicial power shall extend to ... all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction'), and section 8, article 1 (Congress may make necessary and proper laws for carrying out granted powers), i n the absence of some controlling statute the general maritime law as accepted by the federal courts constitutes part of our \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 158]\n\u00a0\n national law applicable to the matters within admiralty and maritime jurisdiction'; also that 'Congress has paramount power to fix and determine the maritime law which shall prevail throughout the country.' And we held that, when applied to maritime injuries, the New York Workmen's Compensation Law conflicts with the rules adopted by the Constitution and to that extent is invalid. 'The necessary consequence would be destruction of the very uniformity in respect of maritime matters which the Constitution was designed to establish, and freedom of navigation between the states and with foreign countries would be seriously hampered and impeded.'\n We also pointed out that the saving clause taken from the original Judiciary Act had no application, since, at most, it only specified common- law remedies, whereas the remedy prescribed by the compensation law was unknown to the common law and incapable of enforcement by the ordinary processes of any court. Moreover, if applied to maritime affairs, the statute would obstruct the policy of Congress to encourage investments in ships.\n In Chelentis v. Luckenbach S. S. Co. (June, 1918) \n247 U.S. 372\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 501, an action at law seeking full indemnity for injuries received by a sailor while on shipboard, we said:\n'Under the doctrine approved in Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, no state has power to abolish the well recognized maritime rule concerning measure of recovery and substitute therefor the full indemnity rule of the common law. Such a substitution would distinctly and definitely \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 159]\n\u00a0\n change or add to the settled maritime law; and it would be destructive of the 'uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the states with each other or with foreign states.\"\n\n And concerning the clause, 'saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it,' this:\n'In Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen we definitely ruled that it gave no authority to the several states to enact legislation which would work 'material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law or interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.\" 'Under the saving clause a right sanctioned by the maritime law may be enforced through any appropriate remedy recognized at common law; but we find nothing therein which reveals an intention to give the complaining party an election to determine whether the defendant's liability shall be measured by common-law standards rather than those of the maritime law.'\n\n Thus we distinctly approved the view that the original saving clause conferred no substantive rights and did not authorize the states so to do. It referred only to remedies and to the extent specified permitted continued enforcement by the state courts of rights and obligations founded on maritime law.\n In Union Fish Co. v. Erickson, \n248 U.S. 308\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 112, an admiralty cause, a master sought to recover damages for breach of an oral contract with the owner of a vessel for services to be performed principally upon the sea. The latter claimed invalidity of the contract under a statute of California, where made, because not in writing and not to be performed within a year. We ruled:\n'The Circuit Court of Appeals correctly held that this contract was maritime in its nature and an action in admiralty thereon for its breach could not be defeated by the statute of \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 160]\n\u00a0\n California relied upon by the petitioner.' 'In entering into this contract the parties contemplated no services in California. They were making an engagement for the services of the master of the vessel, the duties to be performed in the waters of Alaska, mainly upon the sea. The maritime la controlled in this respect, and was not subject to limitation because the particular engagement happened to be made in California. The parties must be presumed to have had in contemplation the system of maritime law under which it was made.'\n\n See, also, The Black Heath, \n195 \nU.S. 361, 365\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 46, 47.\n As the plain result of these recent opinions and the earlier cases upon which they are based, we accept the following doctrine: The Constitution itself adopted and established, as part of the laws of the United States, approved rules of the general maritime law and empowered Congress to legislate in respect of them and other matters within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. Moreover, it took from the states all power, by legislation or judicial decision, to contravene the essential purposes of, or to work material injury to, characteristic features of such law or to interfere with its proper harmony and uniformity in its international and interstate relations. To preserve adequate harmony and appropriate uniform rules relating to maritime matters and bring them within control of the federal government was the fundamental purpose; and to such definite end Congress was empowered to legislate within that sphere.\n Since the beginning federal courts have recognized and applied the rules and principles of maritime law as something distinct from laws of the several states-not derived from or dependent on their will. The foundation of the right to do this, the purpose for which it was granted, and the nature of the system so administered, were distinctly pointed out long ago:\n'That we have a maritime law of our own, operative throughout the United States, cannot \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 161]\n\u00a0\n be doubted. ... One thing, however, is unquestionable; the Constitution must have referred to a system of law coextensive with, and operating uniformly in, the whole country. It certainly could not have been the intention to place the rules and limits of maritime law under the disposal and regulation of the several states, as that would have defeated the uniformity and consistency at which the Constitution aimed on all subjects of a commercial character affecting the intercourse of the states with each other or with foreign states.' The Lottawanna, 21 Wall. 558, 574, 575 (22 L. Ed. 654).\n\n The field was not left unoccupied; the Constitution itself adopted the rules concerning rights and liabilities applicable therein; and certainly these are not less paramount than they would have been if enacted by Congress. Unless this be true it is quite impossible to account for a multitude of adjudications by the admiralty courts. See Workman v. New York City, \n179 U.S. 552\n, 557, et seq., 21 Sup. Ct. 212.\n The distinction between the indicated situation created by the Constitution relative to maritime affairs and the one resulting from the mere grant of power to regulate commerce without more, should not be forgotten; also, it should be noted that federal laws are constantly applied in state courts-unless inhibited their duty so requires. Constitution, art. 6, clause 2; Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 55\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 44. Consequently mere reservation of partially concurrent cognizance to such courts by an act of Congress conferring an otherwise exclusive jurisdiction upon national courts, could not create substantive rights or obligations or indicate assent to their creation by the states.\n When considered with former decisions of this court, a satisfactory interpretation of the Act of October 6, 1917, is difficult, perhaps impossible. The Howell (D. C.) 257 Fed. 578, and Rohde v. Grant Smith Porter Co. (D. C.) 259 Fed. 304, illustrate some of the uncertainties. In the \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 162]\n\u00a0\n first, the District Court in New York dismissed a libel, holding that rights and remedies prescribed by the compensation law of that state are exclusive and pro tanto supersede the maritime law. In the second, the District Court of Oregon ruled that when a employe seeks redress for a maritime tort by an admiralty court, rights, obligations and liabilities of the respective parties must be measured by the maritime law and these cannot be barred, enlarged or taken away by state legislation. Other difficulties hang upon the unexplained words 'workmen's compensation law of any state.'\n Moreover, the act only undertook to add certain specified rights and remedies to a saving clause within a Code section conferring jurisdiction. We have held that before the amendment and irrespective of that section, such rights and remedies did not apply to maritime torts because they were inconsistent with paramount federal law-within that field they had no existence. Were the added words therefore wholly ineffective? The usual function of a saving clause is to preserve something from immediate interference-not to create; and the rule is that expression by the Legislature of an erroneous opinion concerning the law does not alter it. Endlich, Interpretation of Statutes,  372.\n Neither branch of Congress devoted much debate to the act under consideration-altogether, less than two pages of the Record (65th Cong. pp. 7605, 7843). The Judiciary Committee of the House made no report; but a brief one by the Senate Judiciary Committee, copied below,2 \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 163]\n\u00a0\n probably indicates the general legislative purpose. And, with this and accompanying circumstances, the words must be read.\n Having regard to all these things, we conclude that Congress undertook to permit application of workmen's compensation laws of the several states to injuries within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, and to save such statutes from the objections pointed out by Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen. It sought to authorize and sanction action by the states in presci bing and enforcing, as to all parties concerned, rights, obligations, liabilities\n___ The bill (S. 2916) proposes only to amend the Judicial Code by so enlarging the saving clause as to include the rights and remedies under the compensation law of any state. Inasmuch as not only the remedy but sometimes the right under the compensation plan is unknown to the common law, both rights and remedies are included in the bill. The bill, if enacted, will not disrupt the admiralty jurisdiction of the federal courts. The most that can be said of it will be that it is a recognition by Congress that a concurrent jurisdiction, state and federal, should exist over certain matters. Actions that were formerly triable in admiralty courts will still be triable there. Where the cases were formerly triable only in such courts, it will now be possible for the state, through its compensation plan, to determine the rights of the parties concerned. In other words, there being concurrent jurisdiction, the injured party, or his dependents, may bring an action in admiralty or submit a claim under the compensation plan. \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 164]\n\u00a0\n and remedies designed to provide compensation for injuries suffered by employes engaged in maritime work.\n And, so construed, we think the enactment is beyond the power of Congress. Its power to legislate concerning rights and liabilities within the maritime jurisdiction, and remedies for their enforcement, arises from the Constitution, as above indicated. The definite object of the grant was to commit direct control to the federal government, to relieve maritime commerce from unnecessary burdens and disadvantages incident to discordant legislation, and to establish, so far as practicable, harmonious and uniform rules applicable throughout every part of the Union.\n Considering the fundamental purpose in view and the definite end for which such rules were accepted, we must conclude that in their characteristic features and essential international and interstate relations, the latter may not be repealed, amended, or changed, except by legislation which embodies both the will and deliberate judgment of Congress. The subject was intrusted to it to be dealt with according to its discretion-not for delegation to others. To say that, because Congress could have enacted a compensation act applicable to maritime injuries, it could authorize the states to do so, as they might desire, is false reasoning. Moreover, such an authorization would inevitably destroy the harmony and uniformity which the Constitution not only contemplated, but actually established-it would defeat the very purpose of the grant. See Sudden & Christenson v. Industrial Accident Commission (Cal.) 188 Pac. 803.\n Congress cannot transfer its legislative power to the states-by nature this is nondelegable. In re Rahrer, \n140 \nU.S. 545, 560\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 865; Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 692\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 495; Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 496\n, 24 S. Sup.

Cas. 1917B, 845, notwithstanding the contention that it violated the Constitution-article 1,  8, cl. 3-this court sustained an act of Congress which prohibited the shipment of intoxicating liquors from one state into another when intended for use contrary to the latter's laws. Among other things, it was there stated that--\n'The argument as to delegation to the states rests upon a mere misconception. It is true the regulation which the Webb-Konyon Act contains permits state prohibitions to apply to movements of liquor from one state into another, but the will which causes the prohibitions to be applicable is that of Congress'-i. e., Congress itself forbade shipments of a designated character.\n\n And further:\n'The exceptional nature of the subject here regulated is the basis upon which the exceptional power exerted must rest'-i. e., different considerations would apply to innocuous articles of commerce.\n\n The reasoning of that opinion proceeded upon the postulate that, because of the peculiar nature of intoxicants which gives enlarged power concerning them, Congress might go so far as entirely to prohibit their transportation in interstate commerce. The statute did less.\n'We can see no reason for saying that although Congress in view of the nature and character of intoxicants had a power to forbid their movement in interstate commerce, it had not the authority to so deal with the subject as to establish a regulation (which is what was done by the Webb-Kenyon Law) making it impossible for one state to violate the prohibitions of the laws of another through the channels of interstate commerce. Indeed, we can see no escape from the conclusion that, if we accepted the proposition urged, we o uld be obliged to announce the contradiction in terms that, because Congress had exerted a regulation lesser in power than it was authorized to exert, therefore its action was void for excess of power.'\n\n See Delamater v. South Dakota, \n205 \nU.S. 93, 97\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 447, 10 Ann. Cas. 733. \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 166]\n\u00a0\n Here we are concerned with a wholly different constitutional provision-one which, for the purpose of securing harmony and uniformity, prescribes a set of rules, empowers Congress to legislate to that end, and prohibits material interference by the states. Obviously, if every state may freely declare the rights and liabilities incident to maritime employment, there will at once arise the confusion and uncertainty which framers of the Constitution both foresaw and undertook to prevent.\n In The Hamilton, \n207 U.S. 398\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 133, an admiralty proceeding, effect was given, as against a ship registered in Delaware, to a statute of that state which permitted recovery by an ordinary action for fatal injuries, and the power of a state to supplement the maritime law to that extent was recognized. But here the state enactment prescribes exclusive rights and liabilities, undertakes to secure their observance by heavy penalties and onerous conditions, and provides novel remedies incapable of enforcement by an admiralty court. See N. Y. Cent. R. R. Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; N. Y. Cent. R. R. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139; Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, supra. The doctrine of The Hamilton may not be extended to such a situation.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to take further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES, dissenting.\n In Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900, the question was whether there was anything in the Constitution or laws of the United States to prevent a State from imposing upon an employer a limited but absolute liability for the death of an employe upon a gang-plank between a vessel and a wharf, which the State unquestionably \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 167]\n\u00a0\n could have imposed had the death occurred on the wharf. A majority of the Court held the State's attempt invalid, and thereupon, by an Act of October 6, 1917, c. 97, 40 Stat. 395, Congress tried to meet the effect of the decision by amending  24, cl. 3, and  256, cl. 3, of the Judicial Code; Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231; 36 Stat. 1087. Those sections in similar terms declared the jurisdiction of the District Court and the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States, 'of all civil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.' The amendment added, 'and to claimants the rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any State.' I thought that claimants had those rights before. I think that they do now both for the old reasons and for new ones.\n I do not suppose that anyone would say that the words, 'The judicial Power shall extend ... to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction,' Const. Art. 3,  3, by implication enacted a whole code for master and servant at sea, hat could be modified only by a constitutional amendment. But somehow or other the ordinary common law rules of liability as between master and servant have come to be applied to a considerable extent in the admiralty. If my explanation, that the source is the common law of the several States, is not accepted, I can only say, I do not know how, unless by the fiat of the judges. But surely the power that imposed the liability can change it, and I suppose that Congress can do as much as the judges who introduced the rules. For we know that they were introduced and cannot have been elicited by logic alone from the mediaeval sea laws.\n But if Congress can legislate it has done so. It has adopted statutes that were in force when the Act of October 6, 1917, was passed, and to that extent has acted as definitely as if it had repeated the words used by the \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 168]\n\u00a0\n several States-a not unfamiliar form of law. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 207; Hobart v. Drogan, 10 Pet. 108, 119; Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 317, 318; Interstate Consolidated Street Ry. Co. v. Massachusetts, \n207 \nU.S. 79, 84\n, 85 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 26, 12 Ann. Cas. 555; Franklin v. United States, \n216 U.S. 559\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 434; Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., \n237 \nU.S. 300, 303\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 598. An Act of Congress, we always say, will be construed so as to sustain it, if possible and therefore if it were necessary, the words 'rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any State' should be taken to refer solely to laws existing at the time, as it certainly does at least include them. See United States v. Paul, 6 Pet. 141. Taking the act as so limited it is to be read as if it set out at length certain rules for New York, certain others more or less different for California, and so on. So construed the single objection that I have heard to the law is that it makes different rules for different places, and I see nothing in the Constitution to prevent that. The only matters with regard to which uniformity is provided for in the instrument so far as I now remember, are duties, imposts and excises, naturalization and bankruptcy, in Article 1,  8. As to the purpose of the clause concerning the judicial power in these cases nothing is said in the instrument itself. To read into it a requirement of uniformity more mechanical than is educed from the express requirement of enquality in the Fourteenth Amendment seems to me extravagant. Indeed it is contrary to the construction of the Constitution in the very clause of the Judiciary Act that is before us. The saving of a common law remedy adopted the common law of the several States within their several jurisdictions, and I may add by way of anticipation, included at least some subsequent statutory changes. Steamboat Co. v. Chase, 16 Wall. 522, 530-534; Kanpp, Stone & Co. Co. v. McCaffrey, \n177 \nU.S. 638, 645\n, 646 S., 20 Sup. Ct. 824; Rounds v. Cloverport Foundry & Machine \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 169]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n237 \nU.S. 303, 307\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 596. I cannot doubt that in matters with which Congress is empowered to deal it may make different arrangements for widely different localities with perhaps widely different needs. See United States v. Press Publishing Co., \n219 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 212, 21 Ann. Cas. 942.\n I thought that Clark Distilling Co. v. Western Maryland Ry. Co., \n242 U.S. 311\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 180, L. R. A. 1917B, 1218, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 845, went pretty far in justifying the adoption of state legislation in advance, as I cannot for a moment believe that apart from the Eighteenth Amendment special constitutional principles exist against strong drink. The fathers of the Constitution so far as I know approved it. But I can see no constitutional objection to such an adoption in this case if the Act of Congress be given that effect. I assume that Congress could not delegate to state legislatures the simple power to decide what the law of the United States should be in that district. But when institutions are established for ends within the power of the States and not for any purpose of affecting the law of the United States, I take it to be an admitted power of Congress to provide that the law of the United States shall conform as nearly as may be to what for the time being exists. A familiar example is the law directing the common law practice, &c., in the District Courts to 'conform, as near as may be, to the practice, &c. existing at the time' in the State Courts. Rev. Sts.  914 (Comp. St.  1537). This was held by the unanimous Court to be binding in Amy v. Watertown, No. 1, \n130 U.S. 301\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 530. See Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 207, 208; Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 317, 318. I have mentioned the scope given to the saving of a common law remedy and have referred to cases on the statutes adopting State pilotage laws. Other instances are to be found in the Acts of Congress, but these are enough. I think that the same principle applies here. It should be observed that the objection now dealt with is the only one peculiar to the adoption of local law in advance. That of \n\n[253 U.S. 149, 170]\n\u00a0\n want of uniformity applies equally to the adoption of the laws in force in 1917. Furthermore we are not called on now to consider the collateral effects of the act. The only question before us is whether the words in the Constitution, 'The judicial Power shall extend to ... all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction' prohibit Congress from passing a law in the form of the New York Workmen's Compensation Act-if not in its present form, at least in the form in which it stood on October 6, 1917. I am of opinion that the New York law at the time of the trial should be applied and that the judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Judiciary Act Sept. 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 73, 76, 77:\n'Sec. 9.

Mr. Ashurst, from the Committee on the Judiciary, submitted the following Report [to accompany S. 2916]:\n The Committee on the Judiciary, to which was referred the bill (S. 2916) to amend sections 24 and 256 of the Judicial Code, relating to the jurisdiction of the district courts, so as to save to claimants the rights and remedies under the workmen's compensation law of any state, having considered the same, recommend its passage without amendment.\n The Judicial Code, by sections 24 and 256, confers exclusive jurisdiction on the district courts of the United States of all civil cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction, 'saving to suitors in all cases the right of a common-law remedy where the common law is competent to give it.' It was declared by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen that 'the remedy which the compensation statute attempts to give is of a character wholly unknown to the common law, incapable of enforcement by the ordinary processes of any court and is not saved to suitors from the grant of exclusive jurisdiction.' \n\n\n\n\n","83":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKWOCK JAN FAT v. WHITE(1920)\nNo. 313\nArgued: Decided: June 7, 1920\n\n\n\n - \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 455]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Jackson H. Ralston, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart and Mr. Harry S. Ridgely, of Washington, D. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In January, 1915, Kwock Jan Fat, the petitioner, intending to leave the United States on a temporary visit to China, filed with the Commissioner of Immigration for the Port of San Francisco an application, as provided for by law, for a 'preinvestigation of his claimed status as an American citizen by birth.'\n He claimed that he was 18 years of age, was born at Monterey, Cal., was the son of Kwock Tuck Lee, then deceased, who was born in America of Chinese parents and had resided at Monterey for many years; that his mother at the time was living at Monterey; and that there were five children in the family-three girls and two boys.\n The Department of Immigration made an elaborate investigation of the case presented by this application, taking the testimony of the petitioner, of his mother, of his brother and one sister and of three white men, of whom the inspector said in his report:\n'The three white witnesses are representative men of this town and would have no motive in misstating the facts.'\n\n As a result of this inquiry, the original of his application, approved, signed and sealed by the Commissioner of Immigration at San Francisco, was delivered to the petitioner, and \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n with this evidence in his possession, which he was amply justified in believing would secure his readmission into the United States when he returned, he went to China.\n The record shows that during his absence anonymous information reached the San Francisco Immigration Office (in which there had been a change of officials) to the effect that petitioner's name was not Kwock Jan Fat, as claimed, but was Leu Suey Chong and that he had entered the United States in 1909 as the minor son of a merchant, Lew Wing Tong, of Oakland, Cal. Thereupon an investigation was conducted, chiefly by the comparison of photographs, for the purpose of determining the truthfulness of this anonymous suggestion, with the result that when the petitioner returned to San Francisco he was not allowed to land, and a few days thereafter was definitely denied entry to the country by the Commissioner of Immigration. Thereafter, this decision of the Commissioner was reconsidered, the case reopened and testimony for and against the petitioner was taken, but the Commissioner adhered to his denial of admission. The only reason given for the decision was 'the claimed American citizenship is not established to my satisfaction.'\n Thereupon as appeal was taken to the Secretary of Labor, who approved the order appealed from.\n Promptly thereafter the petition for a writ of habeas corpus in this case was filed, which is based chiefly upon two claims, viz.:\n\n\n (1)\n That the examining inspector reported to the Commissioner of Immigration as evidence, statements purporting to have been obtained from witnesses under promise that their names would not be disclosed, and that when demand was made for the names of such witnesses for purpose of reply, it was refused, with the result that petitioner did not have a fair hearing.\n\n\n (2)\n That the examining inspector did not record an \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n important part of the testimony of three white witnesses called by petitioner, with the result that it was not before the Commissioner of Immigration or the Secretary of Labor when they decided adversely to him, and thereby he was arbitrarily denied a fair hearing.\n A general demurrer to this petition was sustained by the District Court and on appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals that judgment was affirmed. The case is here on writ of certiorari.\n With the petition were filed all of the testimony and papers pertaining to the proceedings prior to the appeal to the Secretary of Labor, and since it is prayed that when the copyo f the proceedings thereafter had shall become available they may be made a part of the petition, it was proper for the courts below and is proper for this court to interpret the allegations of the petition, giving due effect to the immigration records filed with the petition and with respondent's return. Low Wah Suey v. Backus, \n225 \nU.S. 460, 469\n, 472 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 734\n\n\n It is not disputed that if petitioner is the son of Kwock Tuck Lee and his wife, Tom Ying Shee, he was born to them when they were permanently domiciled in the United States, is a citizen thereof, and is entitled to admission to the country. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n169 U.S. 649\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 456. But while it is conceded that he is certainly the same person who, upon full investigation was found, in March, 1915, by the then Commissioner of Immigration, to be a natural born American citizen, the calim is that that Commissioner was deceived and that petitioner is really Lew Suey Chong, who was admitted to this country in 1909, as a son of a Chinese merchant, Lew Wing Tong, of Oakland, Cal.\n It is fully settled that the decision by the Secretary of Labor, of such a question as we have here, is final, and conclusive upon the courts, unless it be shown that the proceedings were 'manifestly unfair,' were 'such as to pre vent \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n a fair investigation,' or show 'manifest abuse' of the discretion committed to the executive officers by the statute, Low Wah Suey v. Backus, supra, or that 'their authority was not fairly exercised, that is, consistently with the fundamental principles of justice embraced within the conception of due process of law,' Tang Tun v. Edsell, Chinese Inspector, \n223 \nU.S. 673, 681\n, 682 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 359, 363 (56 L. Ed. 606). The decision must be after a hearing in good faith, however summary, Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 \nU.S. 8, 12\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 201, and it must find adequate support in the evidence, Zakonaite v. Wolf, \n226 \nU.S. 272, 274\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 31.\n As to the first ground of complaint in the petition for habeas corpus.\n After the final decision by the Commissioner of Immigration adverse to petitioner, his counsel requested an opportunity to examine the record on which it was rendered. This request was granted, and promptly, thereafter, demand was made for permission to see the testimony referred to, but not reported, in a designated report of Inspector Wilkinson. Assistant Commissioner Boyce answered this request saying:\n'The portion of Inspector Wilkinson's report which was withheld from you contained no evidencd whatsoever and nothing material to the issue in this case. As a matter of fact this inspector's report in no way influenced my decision and was useful only in locating other material witnesses, whose testimony appears in the record.'\n\n This report appears in the record before us and is of a remarkable character. It is dated August 8th and after saying that 'only upon the assurance that the identity of the witness would be kept secret' could the information contained in it be obtained, the writer proceeds with much detail to narrate what, if believed, would be evidence of first importance making against the claim of petitioner. The report continues that after his first visit the inspector \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n returned to Monterey and learned from his confidential witness that in the interval he had inquired of 'an old Chinese resident,' who said that, 'Tuck Lee had no son,' and adds, 'I was unable to ascertain the name of this Chinese person.'\n On the margin of this letter is written August 8, 1917: 'Approved. Edward White' (the immigration Commissioner).\n In this manner, with much detail, statements of a person who must remain unknown, and in part derived from another person who must remain unknown, were communicated by the investigating inspector to his superior, who was to dispose of the case on the evidence which was furnished him, and he, in form at least, approved of this report. This approval is explained by the Acting Com issioner as referring to the recommendation contained in it that further investigation should be made, and there is confirmation of this explanation in the fact that the record shows that immediately thereafter evidence of the character suggested in the report was taken in affidavits which were open to the inspection of the petitioner. While we would not give the weight to these affidavits which the Commissioner of Immigration and the Secretary of Labor seem to have given to them, nevertheless, when taken with the statement of the Acting Commissioner that the inspector's report objected to was not allowed to influence his decision, we might not say that the taking and reporting of the testimony objected to of witnesses whose names are not disclosed, rendered the hearing so manifestly unfair as to require reversal, if there were nothing else objectionable in the record.\n There remains the question whether the hearing accorded to the petitioner was unfair and inconsistent with the fundamental principles of justice embraced within the conception of due process of law because an inspector failed to record in its proper place an important part of \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 460]\n\u00a0\n the testimony of three white witnesses called by the petitioner.\n A discussion of what the record shows and of the character of the witnesses involved will be necessary to an appreciation of the importance, in determining the issue presented, of having a full report of what was said and done by these three witnesses.\n When the petitioner, before going to China, applied for a preinvestigation of his claimed status as an American citizen, three white witnesses from Monterey were called in his behalf-two of whom were notable.\n Ernest Michaelis, for 26 years a justice of the peace and for many years the official collector of fish licenses, testified, making reference, for purpose of identification, to a photograph of the petitioner. He said he had known the parents of the boy since shortly after he himself went to live at Monterey in 1879; that there were two boys and three girls in the family; that he had seen the petitioner frequently as a little fellow when he went to collect fish licenses (the boy's father was a fisherman); and had known him ever since; and, referring to the photograph, he declared positively that he was sure of his identity and that he was born in Monterey. He added that the father of the boy was native born and was a voter in that community.\n W. E. Parker testified that he had been agent for the Wells Fargo Company at Monterey for 25 years, and was also chief of the fire department and city clerk for many years. He said, referring to a photograph of petitioner, that he had known the parents of the boy for many years and the boy himself since he was 5 or 6 years old; that he remembered two boys and at least one girl, but later he stated that he recalled that there were three girls in the family, and his identification of the petitioner by photograph was very definite. He stated that the father of the boy was a fisherman and shipped fish frequently \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 461]\n\u00a0\n by express so that he came to know him well and his wife also because she often transacted business for her husband. He recalled that after the fire and earthquake the petitioner was sent to school at San Francisco, but returned to Monterey every few months when he saw him.\n A third witness, Manuel Ortin, a retired business man, gave similar testimony, but it is not so definite and circumstantial as that of the others and need not be detailed.\n The government inspector to whom the case in this preliminary stage was referred, wrote the Commissioner of Immigration at San Francisco that the testimony of petitioner, of his alleged brother, his mother and three credible white witnesses had been taken; that the petitioner gave his testimony mostly in English, presented a good appearance, and 'tells his story in a straight-forward manner in a way to convince one that he is telling the truth,' and that 'the three white witnesses are representative men of this town andw ould have no motive in misstating the facts.' He concluded with the statement that in his mind there was no doubt that the Chinaman named Kwock Tuck Lee (claimed by applicant to be his father) had lived in Pacific Grove (the Chinatown of Monterey), and was a registered voter there; that he was married and had several children and that the testimony seemed to prove that the petitioner was a member of his family. He added that a sister of the boy lived at a given number in Chicago and suggested that her testimony should be taken. This sister's testimony was taken, as recommended, and then the inspector reported to the Commissioner of Immigration that her testimony did not vary in the main from that of the mother or brother of the petitioner; that 'the white witnesses, Judge Michaelis, and chief of the fire department and Wells Fargo agent, and retired grocer, Mr. Ortin, are men of standing in this town' and that he had no reason to doubt their testimony. He added that, taking the testimony as a whole, 'he \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 462]\n\u00a0\n believed the applicant made a good showing and recommended favorable action.' On this record the application was approved and the young man went to China.\n When the petitioner returned from China and the investigation was renewed Michaelis, Ortin, and another important white witness, Pugh, were examined at San Francisco by an inspector. Michaelis and Ortin testified substantially as they had done a year before, and Pugh, also a business man of Monterey, gave similar testimony and definitely identified the petitioner as the son of Kwock Tuck Lee. The examination of these witnesses, by question and answer, was taken down and is in the record, but no reference whatever was made to the fact that the petitioner was brought into their presence to test their recognition of him and his recognition of them, or of any examination in his presence. The testimony was in this form when it was sent to the Commissioner of Immigration for his consideration and decision, and, acting upon it, on September 6, 1917, he denied the petitioner admission to the country. After this decision, on September 12th, counsel for petitioner wrote the Commissioner that Michaelis, Pugh, and Ortin had told him that when they were examined at San Francisco they were confronted with the petitioner and that they recognized him, that he recognized them, and that the examining inspector was present and asked a number of questions, which were answered, and calls this to the attention of the Commissioner 'as it may have been an oversight on the part of the official stenographer in recording everything said and done at the hearing of the case.' On the same date affidavits by Michaelis, Pugh and Ortin were filed, in each of which, after referring to his examination at San Francisco, the affiant says in substance, as Michaelis does in form, that 'after being questioned by the inspector the affiant was confronted with Kwock Jan Fat who met him while the inspector was present and that said inspector \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 463]\n\u00a0\n heard everything said between affiant and Kwock Jan Fat;' and that affiant then told the inspector that the petitioner was the son of Tuck Lee, that he had known him from infancy, and that he was a native of Monterey.\n To this letter of counsel for petitioner an Acting Commissioner replied, saying:\n'With regard to the identification of the applicant by Messrs. Michaelis, Pugh and Ortin, you are advised that these witnesses were confronted with the applicant with the result that said witnesses mutually recognized and identified the applicant as the person whom they had known as Kwock Jan Fat, and the applicant was equally prompt in recognizing said witnesses. While I was advised of this incident and gave it full consideration in arriving at my decision, it was not made of record in connection with the statements taken from the witnesses. A copy of this letter will be placed with the record as evidence to the fact that there was mutual recognition between said witnesses and the applicant which will thus be available for the consideration of th Secretary on appeal.'\n\n This excerpt from the letter of an Acting Commissioner (the decision was rendered by the Commissioner personally) is the only form in which the facts and circumstances of the recognition of the petitioner by these important witnesses and their examination in his presence by the inspector was placed before the Secretary of Labor, and apparently there was no record whatever of either before the Commissioner of Immigration when he decided the case.\n Comment cannot add to the impression which this plain statement of facts should make upon every candid mind. Here was testimony being taken which was to become the basis for decision by men who must depend wholly upon the report of what was said and done by the witnesses. The men examined were important, intelligent and very \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 464]\n\u00a0\n certainly as dependable as any who were called. All they had said with respect to the identity and nativity of the petitioner when his photograph was exhibited to them was carefully reported, but when their knowledge of him and their acquaintance with him was put to the final test of having him brought before them (he had been in China for a year), nothing whatever was recorded of what they said and did. Very certainly this must be regarded as such an important part of the testimony of these most important witnesses that it may well have been of such character as to prove sufficient to determine the result in a case even much stronger against a claim of United States citizenship than was made in this record against the claim of petitioner, and a report which suppressed or omitted it was not a fair report and a hearing based upon it was not a fair hearing within the definition of the cases cited.\n The acts of Congress give great power to the Secretary of Labor over Chinese immigrants and persons of Chinese descent. It is a power to be administered, not arbitrarily and secretly, but fairly and openly, under the restraints of the tradition and principles of free government applicable where the fundamental rights of men are involved, regardless of their origin or race. It is the province of the courts, in proceedings for review, within the limits amply defined in the cases cited, to prevent abuse of this extraordinary power, and this is possible only when a full record is preserved of the essentials on which the executive officers proceed to judgment. For failure to preserve such a record for the information, not less of the Commissioner of Immigration and of the Secretary of Labor than for the courts, the judgment in this case must be reversed. It is better that many Chinese immigrants should be improperly admitted than that one natural born citizen of the United States should be permanently excluded from his country. \n\n[253 U.S. 454, 465]\n\u00a0\n The practice indicated in Chin Yow v. United States, \n208 U.S. 8\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 201, is approved and adopted, the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court for trial of the merits.\n Judgment reversed.\n Writ of habeas corpus to issue. \n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLE CRONE v. MCADOO(1920)\nNo. 304\nArgued: Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. George N. Baxter, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Solicitor General King, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a petition to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for mandamus to direct the Secretary of the Treasury to pay the amount of two certificates issued to the petitioner by the Secretary of State. The petitioner is receiver of the Orinoco Company, Limited. That Company had claims for damages against the United States of Venezuela, which, with others, by agreement \n\n[253 U.S. 217, 218]\n\u00a0\n between the two governments, the United States of America released upon receiving from the United States of Venezuela a certain sum in trust for the parties having the claims. By the Act of February 27, 1896, c. 34, 29 Stat. 32 (Comp. St.  6668), moneys so received are to be paid into the Treasury and the Secretary of State is to 'determine the amounts due claimants, respectively, ... and certify the same to the Secretary of the Treasury, who shall, upon the presentation of the certificates of the Secretary of State, pay the amounts so found to be due.' Each of such trust funds is declared to be 'appropriated for the payment to the ascertained beneficiaries thereof of the certificates' provided for. The answer alleged that there were pending in the same Supreme Court two bills in equity, one by a private person and one by the Orinoco Company, Limited, asserting claims to the fund, that the respondent and petitioner both are parties to those proceedings, the petitioner having submitted to the jurisdiction, and that the petitioner should be limited to those proceedings and await the result of the decrees. The petitioner demurred. The demurrer was overruled and the petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court and its judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n The theory of the answer seems to be that the purpose of the Act of Congress was to appopriate a fund to the claim and to transfer the claim to that fund, leaving the question of title open to litigation in the ordinary courts, as has been held in more or less similar cases. Butler v. Goreley, \n146 \nU.S. 308, 309\n, 310 S., 13 Sup. Ct. 84; Id., 147 Mass. 8, 12, 16 N. E. 734; United States v. Dalcour, \n203 \nU.S. 408, 422\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 58; Robertson v.

It is thought that Congress hardly can have sought to confer judicial powers upon the Secretary of State. United States v. Borcherling, \n185 \nU.S. 223, 234\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 607. And as the certificates are not gifts but are in recognition of outstanding claims, Williams v. Heard, \n\n[253 U.S. 217, 219]\n\u00a0\n \n140 U.S. 529\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 885, reversing s. c., 146 Mass. 545, 16 N. E. 437, judicial action is supposed to be necessary for the final determination of the right. But we cannot consider that question or the other arguments upon the merits of the case, because, Mr. McAdoo having resigned the office of Secretary of the Treasury, his successor was not substituted within twelve months; which is the limit for such substitution fixed by the Act of February 8, 1899, c. 121, 30 Stat. 822 ( Comp. St.  1594.) It is said that the Code of the District of Columbia,  1278, allows the petitioner to recover damages in the same proceeding and that the petition should be retained to charge Mr. McAdoo personally. But apart from other questions the damages are only incident to the allowance of the writ of mandamus, and as that cannot be allowed the whole proceeding is at an end. See Pullman Co. v. Knott, \n243 \nU.S. 447, 451\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 428; Pullman Co. v. Croom, \n231 \nU.S. 571, 577\n, 34 S. Sup.

Strode, of Amherst, Va., for appellants.\n Mr. Marion Erwin, of New York City, for the United States. \n\n[253 U.S. 94, 95]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The United States brought a bl l to charge Kellogg with a trust in respect of funds received by him from Greene and obtained from the plaintiff by Greene through his participation in some well known frauds. In \n224 U.S. 567\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 599, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1029, the representative of Leary was allowed to intervene and to assert a paramount claim upon the funds. In United States v. Leary, \n245 U.S. 1\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 1, it was established that the funds were held by Kellogg primarily as security to Leary against his liability upon a bail bond for Greene. The United States having obtained a judgment on the bail bond and the same having been paid by the Leary estate the present appellants filed a petition in the cause, in the District Court, to have the funds applied to the reimbursement (1) of expenditures in defending against proceedings in the Surrogate Court to secure payment of the judgment; (2) of expenditures in establishing and protecting the trust; and (3) of the sum of $40,802, the amount paid on the judgment, with interest from July 26, 1910, the date when the judgment was paid. The District Court allowed the last claim with interest at six per cent. less the clerk's poundage of one per cent. under Rev. St.  828 (Comp. St.  1383). (The details are immaterial.) It denied the other claims, and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 257 Fed. 246, 168 C. C. A. 330. Leary's administrators appealed.\n The only reason suggested for the claim on account of defending against proceedings on the judgment is that the United States in the present suit had impounded the funds available for payment. But the obligation to pay the judgment was absolute, not confinced to a payment from these funds, and the claim for the cost of resisting it has on foundation. We also are of opinion that the deduction of poundage by the clerk was proper as in other \n\n[253 U.S. 94, 96]\n\u00a0\n cases of money kept and paid out by him. But it is said that this item and the expense of defending the trust should be borne by the residue of the funds in the clerk's hands after deducting the amount paid in respect of the judgment. It is argued that the trust informally established by letters of Kellogg stating that he held it for Leary's protection to be applied in payment of his obligation in case it should be established, if construed with reasonable liberality, must embrace these elements to make the protection complete. Of course the upholding of Leary's claim against the United States was not contemplated in the terms of the trust because Leary's ignorance of the interest of the United States was essential to the validity of his position as a purchaser without notice. But it is thought that indemnity includes defences of the indemnifying fund against unexpected attacks, that if the trustee fails to make it the cestui que trust may do so, and that in either event the fund should be charged. It does not matter that the United States is the opposing party, as its rights in the fund are inferior to those that Leary now has successfully affirmed. Trustees of the Internal Improvement Fund of the State of Florida v. Greenough, \n105 U.S. 527\n\u00a0\n\n\n To these arguments the Government replies in the first place that they come too late; that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals that was before this court on the last occastion was treated as a final decree, which therefore fixed the amount that the appellants could recover beyond enlargement, and that as the prayer of the appellants was only for the transfer of so much of the fund as would pay the judgment on the bail bond with interest, nothing more can be asked now. This objection might raise difficulty if otherwise our opinion were in favor of the appellants; but as we think that the Circuit Court of Appeals was right with regard to the merits, we will assume for purposes of decision that the previous proceeding did not so precisely determine the appellants' \n\n[253 U.S. 94, 97]\n\u00a0\n rights as to prevent their demanding the foregoing items as incident to thec laim allowed.\n To charge the fund with these expenses is to charge the United States, and it begs the question to say that the United States in this respect is subordinate to the Leary claim. It is not subordinate unless Leary's costs ought to come out of the Government's pocket, even though limited to particular money there. The Government cannot be made to pay or to take subject to the deduction, because Leary, even though a bona fide purchaser, had no contract for it, and because to charge the fund apart from contract is merely a roundabout way of saying that the owner of the fund must pay charges of a kind that the United States never pays; (see National Bank of Genesee v. Whitney, \n103 U.S. 103\n, 104; United States v. Barker, 2 Wheat. 395) and charges for protecting the fund not for but against the United States.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice MCREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","86":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLEE v.

It answered in the negative. 147 Ga. 428, 94 S. E. 558. Thereupon the Court of Appeals reversed the judgment of the trial court ( 21 Ga. App. 558, 94 S. E. 888), and certiorari to the Supreme Court of the state was refused. The plaintiff then applied to this court for a writ of certiorari on the ground that he had been denied rights conferred by federal law, and the writ was granted.\n Whether two causes of action may be joined i. e. single count or whether two persons may be sued in a single count are matters of pleading and practice relating solely to the form of the remedy. When they arise in state courts the final determination of such matters ordinarily rests with the state tribunals, even if the rights there being enforced are created by federal law. John v. Paullin, \n231 U.S. 583\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 178; Nevada-California-Oregon Railway v. Burrus, \n244 U.S. 103\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 576.

It is only when matters nominally of procedure are actually matters of substance which affect a federal right, that the decision of the state court therein becomes subject to review by this court. Central Vermont Railway Co. v. White, \n238 U.S. 507\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 865, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 252; New Orleans & North Eastern Railroad Co. v. Harris, \n247 U.S. 367\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 535\n\n\n The federal Employers' Liability Act does not modify in any respect rights of employes against one another existing at common law. To deny to a plaintiff the right to join in one count a cause against another employe with a cause of action against the employer in no way abridges any substantive right of the plaintiff against the \n\n[252 U.S. 109, 111]\n\u00a0\n employer. The argument that plaintiff has been discriminated against because he is an interstate employe is answered, if answer be necessary, by the fact that the Supreme Court of Georgia had applied the same rule in Western & Atlantic R. R. et al. v. Smith, 144 Ga. 737, 87 S. E. 1082 (22 Ga. App. 437, 96 S. E. 230), where it refused under the state Employers' Liability Act (Civ. Code 1910,  2782 et seq.) to permit the plaintiff to join with the employer another railroad whose concurrent negligence was alleged to have contributed in producing the injury complained of. If the Supreme Court of Georgia had in this case permitted the joinder, we might have been required to determine whether, in view of the practice prevailing in Georgia, such decision would not impair the employer's opportunity to make the defenses to which it is entitled by the federal law. For, as stated by its Supreme Court in this case (147 Ga. 428, 431, 94 S. E. 558, 560):\n'If the carrier and its engineer were jointly liable under the conditions stated in the second question, a joint judgment would result against them, and they would be equally bound, regardless of the fact that the duties imposed upon them are not the same. The jury would have no power in such a case to specify the particular damages to be recovered of each, since Civil Code,  4512 [providing for verdicts in different amounts against the several defendants] is not applicable to personal torts.'\n\n But we have no occasion to consider this question. Refusal to permit the joinder did not deny any right of plaintiff conferred by federal law. Cases upon which petitioner most strongly relies (Southern Railway Co. v. Carson, \n194 U.S. 136\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 609; Alabama Great Southern Railway Co. v. Thompson, \n200 U.S. 206\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 161, 4 A n. Cas. 1147; Southern Railway Co. v. Miller, \n217 U.S. 209\n, 30 Sup.

Harold Hitchcock, of Boston, Mass., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Massachusetts has a statute providing for a tax upon incomes. Gen. Stats. Mass. 1916, c. 269. In the act imposing the tax it is provided:\n'If an inhabitant of this commonwealth receives income from one or more executors, administrators or trustees, none of whom is an inhabitant of this commonwealth or has derived his appointment from a court of this commonwealth, such income shall be subject to the taxes assessed by this act, according to the nature of the income received by the executors, administrators or trustees.' Section 9.\n\n The plaintiff in error is a resident of the state of Massachusetts, and was taxed upon income from a trust created by the will of one Matilda P. MacArthur formerly of Philadelphia. The plaintiff in error under the will of the decedent was the beneficiary of a trust thereby created. The securities were held in trust by the Girard Trust Company of Philadelphia. Those which were directly taxable to the trustee were held exempt from taxation in Massachusetts under the terms of the statute of that \n\n[253 U.S. 12, 14]\n\u00a0\n state. The securities the income form which was held taxable in Massachusetts consisted of the bonds of three corporations and certain certificates of the Southern Railway Equipment Trust. These securities were held in the possession of the trustee in Philadelphia. The trust was being administered under the laws of Pennsylvania. The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts held the tax to be valid. 230 Mass. 503, 120 N. E. 162.\n Of the nature of the tax the Chief Justice of Massachusetts, speaking for the Supreme Judicial Court, said:\n'The income tax is measured by reference to the riches of the person taxed actually made available to him for valuable use during a given period. It establishes a basis of taxation directly proportioned to ability to bear the burden. It is founded upon the protection afforded to the recipient of the income by the government of the commonwealth of his residence in his person, in his right to receive the income and in his enjoyment of the income when in his possession. That government provides for him all the advantages of living in safety and in freedom and of being protected by law. It gives security to life, liberty and the other privileges of dwelling in a civilized community. It exacts in return a contribution to the support of that government measured by the based upon the income, in the fruition of which it defends him from unjust interference. It is true of the present tax, as was said by Chief Justice Shaw in Bates v. Boston, 5 Cush. [Mass.] 93, at page 99: 'The assessment does not touch the fund, or control it; nor does it interfere with the trustee in the exercise of his proper duties; nor call him, nor hold him, to any accountability. It affects only the income, after it has been paid by the trustee' to the beneficiary.'\n\n We see no reason to doubt the correctness of this view of the nature and effect of the Massachusetts statute, and shall accept it for the purpose of considering the federal \n\n[253 U.S. 12, 15]\n\u00a0\n question before us, which arises from the contention of the plaintiff in error that the imposition of the tax was a denial of due process of law within the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution, because, it is alleged, the effect of the statute is to subject property to taxation which is beyond the limits and outside the jurisdiction of the state. To support this contention the plaintiff in error relies primarily upon the decision of this court in Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 U.S. 194\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 36, 4 Ann. Cas. 493. In that case we held that tangible, personal property, permanently located in another state than that of the owner, where it had acquired a situs, and was taxed irrespective of the domicile of the owner-was beyond the taxing power of the state, and that an attempt to tax such property at the owner's domicile was a denial of due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment. This ruling was made with reference to cars of the Transit Company permanently employed outside the state of the owner's residence. In that case this court in the opinion of Mr. Justice Brown, speaking for it, expressly said that the taxation of intangible personal property was not involved. \n199 U.S. 211\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 40, 4 Ann. Cas. 493.\n It is true that in some instances we have held that bonds and bills and notes although evidences of debt have come to be regarded as property which may acquire a taxable situs at the place where they are kept, which may be elsewhere than at the domicile of the owner. These cases rest upon the principle that such instruments are more than mere evidences of debt, and may be taxed in the jurisdiction where located, and where they receive the protection of local law and authority. Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189, 206\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 277; People ex rel. Jefferson v. Smith, 88 N. Y. 576, 585. At the last term we held in De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 U.S. 376\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 524, that stocks and bonds issued by domestic corporations, and mortgages secured \n\n[253 U.S. 12, 16]\n\u00a0\n on domestic real estate, although owned by an alien non-resident, but in the hands of an agent in this country with authority to deal with them, were subject to the Income Tax Law of October 3, 1913, 38 Stat. 166.\n In the present case we are not dealing with the right to tax securities which have acquired a local situs, but are concerned with the right of the state to tax the beneficiary of a trust at her residence, although the trust itself may be created and administered under the laws of another state.\n In Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 U.S. 54\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 40, L. R. A. 1918C, 124, we held that a bank deposit of a resident of Kentucky in the bank of another state, where it was taxed, might be taxed as a credit belonging to the resident of Kentucky. In that case Union Transit Co. v. Kentucky, supra, was distinguished and the principle was affirmed that the state of the owner's domicile might tax the credits of a resident although evidenced by debts due from residents of another state. This is the general rule recognized in the maxim 'mobilia sequuntur personam,' and justify, except under exceptional circumstances, the taxation of credits and beneficial interests in property at the domicile of the owner. We have pointed out in other decisions that the principle of that maxim is not of universal application and may yield to the exigencies of particular situations. But we think it is applicable here.\n It is true that the legal title of the property is held by the trustee in Pennsylvania. But it is so held for the benefit of the beneficiary of the trust, and such beneficiary has an equitable right, title and interest distinct from its legal ownership. 'The legal owner holds the direct and absolute dominion over the property in the view of the law; but the income, profits, or benefits thereof in his hands, belong wholly, or in part, to others.' 2 Story's Equity (11th Ed.)  964. It is this property right belonging \n\n[253 U.S. 12, 17]\n\u00a0\n to the beneficiary, realized in the shape of income, which is the subject- matter of the tax under the statute of Massachusetts.\n The beneficiary is domiciled in Massachusetts, has the protection of her laws, and there receives and holds the income from the trust property. We find nothing in the Fourteenth Amendment which prevents the taxation in Massachusetts of an interest of this character, thus owned and enjoyed by a resident of the state. The case presents no difference in principle from the taxation of credits evidenced by the obligations of persons who are outside of the state which are held taxable at the domicile of the owner. Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 U.S. 491\n.\n We find no error in the judgment and the same is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissenting. \n\n\n\n","89":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANNERS v. MOROSCO(1920)\nNo. 370\nArgued: Decided: March 22, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. David Gerber and Walter C. Noyes, both of New York City, and William J. Hughes, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.[ Manners v. Morosco \n252 U.S. 317\n (1920) ]\n\n\n[252 U.S. 317, 320]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Charles H. Tuttle, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 317, 323]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit by the author of a play called Peg O' My Heart to restrain the defendant, Morosco, from representing the play in motion pictures, in violation of the plaintiff's copyright; and also, although this is a subsidiary question, from producing the play at all. The defendant justifies under an agreement of January 19, 1912, and a supplemental agreement of July 20, 1914, both set forth in the bill. The ground upon which the right to produce the play in any way was denied was that the agreement gave rights only for five years. This construction was rejected by the District Court and the Circuit Court of appeals. Both Courts held also that the agreement conveyed the right to represent the play in moving pictures and on that ground dismissed the bill. 254 Fed. 737; 258 Fed. 557.\n By the first agreement the plaintiff, party of the first part 'does grant' to Morosco, the party of the second part, 'the sole and exclusive license and liberty to produce, perform and represent the said play in the United States of America and the Dominion of Canada,' subject to the terms and conditions of the contract. Morosco \n\n[252 U.S. 317, 324]\n\u00a0\n agrees 'to produce the play not later than January first, 1913, and to continue the said play for at least seventy-five performances during the season of 1913-1914 and for each theatrical season thereafter for a period of five years.' He agrees further to pay specified percentages on the gross weekly receipts as royalties, and that 'if during any one theatrical year ... said play has not been produced or presented for seventy-five performances, then all rights of the said party of the second part shall cease and determine and shall immediately revert to the said party of the first part.' Morosco further agrees to present the play in first-class theatres with competent companies and with Miss Laurette Taylor (the stage name of the author's wife) in the title role; the play to have a production in New York and to be continued on the road for at least one season or longer if considered advisable by both parties. No alterations, eliminations or additions are to be made without the approval of the author and the rehearsals and production of the play are to be under his direction. The author to have the right to print and publish the play but not within six months after the production of the play in New York City without consent. Morosco is not to let or transfer his rights without the author's consent. 'Should the play fail in New York City and on the road it shall be released for stock;' i. e., let to stock companies, with an equal division of royalties between plaintiff and defendant. By an addendum, after Miss Taylor should have finished her season her successor in the role of 'Peg' for any subsequent tours shall be mutually agreeable to both parties. The contract is declared binding upon the parties, 'their heirs, executors, assigns, administrators and successors.'\n The second agreement, in order to adjust controversies and to modify the first, authorized Morosco 'as long as this contract is in force' 'to produce, perform and represent' the play with or in as many companies as he saw fit, \n\n[252 U.S. 317, 325]\n\u00a0\n without engaging Laurette Taylor and without consulting the plaintiff as to the cast, rehearsals or production of the play. Morosco also was authorized to let or sell any of his rights under the contracts, but he was not to be released from his personal liability to pay the royalties as specified in the contracts. The play might be released for stock whenever the net profits realized from all the companies producing the play should be less than $2,000, and then the royat ies received from the stock theatres were to be divided equally. For four years from date neither party without consent of the other was to produce or give leave to produce the play by moving pictures and after that the rights of the parties were to be determined by and under the original agreement as if the supplemental agreement had not been made.\n As to the duration of the defendant's rights we agree with the Courts below. We perceive no ground for converting the defendant's undertaking to continue the play for seventy-five performances during the season of 1913- 1914, and for each season thereafter for five years, into a limit of the plaintiff's grant of rights. As was said in the District Court, it is a statement of the least the defendant was to do, not of the most that he was to have. The plaintiff was secured sufficiently by the forfeiture in case the play should not have been produced for seventy-five performances. The provisions in both contracts as to the release for stock are somewhat of an additional indication that it was expected that the arrangement was to last as long as the public liked the play well enough to make it pay, provided the defendant kept his half of the bargain performed.\n On the question principally argued we are of opinion that the majority below was wrong. The thing granted was 'the sole and exclusive license and liberty to produce, perform and represent' the play within the territorial limits stated, subject to the other terms of the contract. \n\n[252 U.S. 317, 326]\n\u00a0\n It may be assumed that those words might carry the right to represent the play in moving pictures if the other terms pointed that way, but to our mind they are inconsistent with any such intent. We need not discuss the abstract question whether, in view of the fact that such a mode of representation was familiar, it was to be expected that it should be mentioned if it was to be granted or should be excluded if it was to be denied. Every detail shows that a representation by spoken drama alone is provided for. The play is to be continued for seventy-five performances for the theatrical seasons named. This applies only to the regular stage. The royalties are adapted only to that mode of presentation. Harper Bros. v. Klaw (D. C.) 232 Fed. 609, 612. The play is to be presented in first- class theatres with a competent company and with Miss Laurette Taylor in the title role, which, of course, does not mean in moving pictures. The stipulations against alterations, eliminations or additions, and that the rehearsals and production of the play shall be under the direction of the author, denote the same thing, and clearly indicate that no other form of production is contemplated. The residuary clause, so to speak, by which the play is to drop to stock companies shows the lowest point to which the author was willing to let it go.\n The Courts below based their reasoning upon the impossibility of supposing that the author reserved the right to destroy the value of the right granted, however that right may be characterized, by retaining power to set up the same play in motion pictures a few doors off with a much smaller admission fee. We agree with the premise but not with the conclusion. The implied assumption of the contract seems to us to be that the play was to be produced only as a spoken drama, with respect for the author's natural susceptibility concerning a strict adhesion to the text. We need not amplify the argument presented below against the reservation of the right in \n\n[252 U.S. 317, 327]\n\u00a0\n question. As was said by Judge Hough in a similar case:\n'There is implied a negative covenant on the part of the [grantor ] ... not to use the ungranted portion of the copyright estate to the detriment, if not the destruction, of the licensees' estate. Admittedly, if Harper Bros. (or Klaw and Erlanger, for the matter of that) permitted photo-plays of Ben Hur to infest the country, the market for the spoken play would be greatly impaired, if not destroyed.' Harper Bros. v. Klaw (D. C.) 232 Fed. 609, 613.\n\n The result is tht the plaintiff is entitled to an injunction against the representation of the play in moving pictures, but upon the terms that the plaintiff also shall abstain from presenting or authorizing the presentation of the play in that form in Canada or the United States.\n Decree reversed. Injunction to issue upon the condition that the plaintiff shall neither represent nor authorize the representation of the play Peg O' My Heart in moving pictures while the contract with the defendant remains in force.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissenting.\n The decision of this case involves the construction of the written contract of January 19, 1912, as modified by that of July 20, 1914, and, centering its attention upon the claim of the defendant to moving picture rights the court dismisses in a single paragraph provisions in these contracts which seem to me to so clearly limit the rights of the defendant to a term expiring possibly in May, 1918, but certainly not later than May, 1919, that I cannot concur in the conclusion arrived at by my Associates.\n The court says:\n'As to the duration of the defendant's rights we agree with the Courts below. We see no ground for converting the defendant's undertaking to continue the play for seventy-five performances during the season of 1913-1914, \n\n[252 U.S. 317, 328]\n\u00a0\n and for each season thereafter for five years, into a limit of the plaintiff's grant of rights. As was said in the District Court, it is a statement of the least that defendant was to do, not of the most that he was to have.'\n\n This expression, that the third paragraph of the contract of January 19, 1912, 'is a statement of the least that defendant was to do, not of the most that he was to have,' is repeated in the opinion of each of the three courts as the sufficient reason for concluding, as the District Court said, that the contract gave to the defendant 'all the rights mentioned for all time.' It is not the first time that a catchy phrase has diverted attention from less picturesque realities.\n My reasons for concluding that the rights of the defendant were limited, as the court says his obligations were limited, to a term expiring not later than the close of the theatrical season of 1918-1919, may be briefly stated.\n The grant which it is concluded gave the defendant the exclusive license and liberty to 'produce, perform and represent' the play involved 'for all time' is in these words:\n'First. The party of the first part hereby grants ... to the party of the second part, subject to the terms, conditions and limitations hereinafter expressed, the sole and exclusive license and liberty to produce, perform and represent the said play in the United States' and Canada.\n\n In terms this is a 'license,' and in terms also it is subject to 'conditions and limitations' to follow in the contract, which are found in the third and fifth paragraphs.\n The third paragraph reads:\n'The party of the second part [defendant] agrees to produce the play not later than January 1st, 1913, and to continue said play for at least seventy-five performances \n\n[252 U.S. 317, 329]\n\u00a0\n during the season 1913-1914 and for each theatrical season thereafter for a period of five years.'\n\n The fifth paragraph provides that if the defendant shall fail to produce the play seventy-five times in any one theatrical year--\n'then all rights of the said party of the second part [the defendant] shall cease and determine and shall immediately revert to the said party of the first part.'\n\n This third paragraph expresses the agreement of the parties as to what the defendant was to do in consideration of the grant by the plaintiff in the first paragraph, and reading it and the fifth paragraph together, as one, we have the extreme extent and time limit of the defendant's obligation and the penalty forfeiture, is provided for the failure to perform at any time within that limit. The court says that the third paragraph expresses 'the least (all) that the defendant was to do,' so that his obligation under the contract ended with the fv e-year period, which obviously would be not later than the close of the theatrical season of 1918-1919. This being true, when did the reciprocal obligation of the plaintiff expire?\n That the obligation of the plaintiff continued 'for all time' is apparently derived wholly from the inference, as stated by the District Court, that the parties, if they had intended otherwise, 'could readily have fixed a time limit in the first paragraph by the addition of words such as 'for ____ years from' or 'until' a stated date.'\n It is very true that the parties could have written their contract in a different form, and certainly with much more precision of statement, than that in which they did write it, but it is also true that in making it in their own way and terms they granted a general license in the first paragraph, but made it subject to the 'terms, conditions and limitations' thereinafter to be expressed, and that they then went forward and expressed in the third paragraph the five-year limitation as we have seen it. The \n\n[252 U.S. 317, 330]\n\u00a0\n court holds that this five-year limitation applies to the defendant's obligation to perform but that it does not apply to the plaintiff's license to produce. I think it applies to both. Plainly the parties were undertaking to set down in their contract the mutual obligations which each intended to assume-those of the one in consideration of those of the other. The author granted the privilege of producing the play and the defendant agreed to produce it for at least 75 performances during each of five years. After that, the court concludes, the defendant was no longer bound by the contract to do anything which could advantage the plaintiff and therefore, clearly, the plaintiff should not continue thereafter under obligation to the defendant, unless the intention to be so bound is unmistakably expressed in his contract. The 'natural and normal' inference is that when the obligation of one party to such a contract as we have here is ended it was the intention that the obligation of the other party should end also.\n The inference that the license to produce continued after the obligation to produce expired, in my judgment, can be sustained only by neglecting the specific provision of the first paragraph, that the license granted is subject to the limitations which should follow, and which did follow in the third paragraph. It involves imposing, by judicial construction, heavy and unusual burdens upon the author of a successful dramatic composition in the interest of a commercial producer-a result which courts should not strain themselves to accomplish.\n A penalty of forfeiture being provided for failure of the defendant to perform at any time, I cannot see any substantial reason for inserting the five-year limitation except to fix a limit for the expiration of all rights of both parties and this, it seems to me, was its only function.\n The provision in the first contract that if the play should fail 'in New York and on the road,' and in the \n\n[252 U.S. 317, 331]\n\u00a0\n second that if the net profits for 'one theatrical season' should be less than $2,000, the play should be 'released for stock' and the royalties divided equally between the parties, would have ample scope for the application within the five-year period and therefore cannot properly be made the basis for the implied continuance of the license beyond that term.\n For the reasons thus briefly stated, I think that the parties expressed with sufficient clearness their intention that their mutual relations should all terminate with the expiration of the five-year period, and therefore I dissent from the opinion of the court.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","90":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARSHALL v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK(1920)\nNo. 294\nArgued: Decided: December 20, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 380, 381]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. S. Gilbert and Francis Gilbert, both of New York City, and William J. Hughes, of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Cortland A. Johnson and Robert P. Beyer, both of New York City, for the People of State of New York.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On December 4, 1917, the District Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York appointed H. Snowden Marshall general receiver of the property of the All Package Grocery Stores Company, a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware, but having a place of business and property in the state of New York. The latter state asked to have certain debts due to it declared payable as preferred claims out of the assets in the hands of the receiver. These debts consisted of (a) amounts due for annual franchise taxes assessed under section 182 of the New York Tax Law (Consol. Laws, c. 60); and (b) amounts due for license fees or taxes for the privilege of doing business within the state, assessed under section 181 of that law, and payable but once. The state asserted in its claim:\n'That said taxes accrued and became a lien on all the property of defendant corporation, pursuant to the provisions of the Tax Law of the state of New York, prior to the appointment of a receiver herein.'\n\n The District Court held that both \n\n[254 U.S. 380, 382]\n\u00a0\n classes of claims were taxes, but that the lien created by section 197 of the Tax Law applied only to annual franchise taxes, and that no provision of the law gave a lien for license taxes until a levy was made therefor. It accordingly allowed the preference as to the amounts due for annual franchise taxes, and denied it as to the amounts due for license taxes. Upon appeal by the state, the Circuit Court of Appeals held that, independently of specific statutory provisions, the law of New York as declared by its courts gave to the state as sovereign a lien or priority for payment of taxes over unsecured creditors, that this priority was a prerogative right, not a mere rule of administration, and that it applied, therefore, in the federal courts. Sweet v. All Package Grocery Stores Co. ( C. C. A.) 262 Fed. 727. The case came here on writ of certiorari. Marshall v. People of the State of N. Y., \n252 U.S. 577\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 396. The propriety of allowing to the state a preference as to amounts due for the annual franchise taxes is admitted by the receiver. No question of the relative priority of the state and the United States is involved. Nor does any question arise as to priority of the state over incumbrances. The single question is presented whether the state of New York has priority in payment out of the general assets of the debtor over other creditors whose claims are not secured by act of the parties nor accorded a preference, by reason of their nature, by the state Legislature or otherwise.\n At common law the crown of Great Britain, by virtue of a prerogative right, had priority over all subjects for the payment out of a debtor's property of all debts due it. The priority was effective alike whether the property remained in the hands of the debtor, or had been placed in the possession of a third person, or was in custodia legis. The priority could be defeated or postponed only through the passing of title to the debtor's property, absolutely or by way of lien, before the sovereign sought to enforce his right. Giles v. Grover, 9 Bing. 128, 139, 157, 183. In re Henley & Co., 9 Ch. D. 469. Compare United States v. \n\n[254 U.S. 380, 383]\n\u00a0\n National Surety Co., \n254 U.S. 73\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 29, 65 L. Ed. --, decided by this court November 8, 1920. The first Constitution of the state of New York (adopted in 1777) provided that the common law of England, which together with the statutes constituted the law of the colony on April 19, 1775, should be and continue the law of the state, subject to such alterations as its Legislature might thereafter make. This provision was embodied, in substance, in the later Constitutions. The courts of New York decided that, by virtue of this constitutional provision, the state, as sovereign, succeeded to the crown's prerogative right of priority, and that the priority was not limited to amounts due for taxes, but extended alike to all debts due to the state; e. g., to amounts due on a general deposit of state funds in a bank. Matter of Carnegie Trust Co., 151 App. Div. 606, 136 N. Y. Supp. 466; Id., 206 N. Y. 390, 99 N. E. 1096, 46 L. R. A. (N. S.) 260. This priority has been enforced by the courts of New York under a great variety of circumstances in an unbroken series of cases extending over more than half a century. \n1\n It has been enforced as a right and not as a rule of administration.\n This priority arose and exists independently of any statute. The Legislature has never, in terms, limited its scope; and the courts have rejected as unsound every contention made that some statute before them for construction had, by implication, effected a repeal or abridgement of the priority. \n2\n The only changes of the right made by statute have been by way of enlarging its scope in \n\n[254 U.S. 380, 384]\n\u00a0\n certain cases. Thus, while by the common law of England (King [in aid of Braddock] v. Watson, 3 Price, 6) and by that of New York (Wise v. L. & C. Wise Co., 153 N. Y. 507, 511, 47 N. E. 788) the priority does not obtain over a specific lien created by the debtor before the sovereign undertakes to enforce its right, the Legislature of New York extended the prerogative right, so as to give certain taxes priority over prior incumbrances. An extension of this nature is found in section 197 of the Tax Law which declares in respect to the annual franchise tax, that--\n'Such tax shall be a lien upon and bind all the real and personal property of the corporation, join-stock company or association liable to pay the same from the time when it is payable until the same is paid in full.'\n\n By reason of that provision the annual franchise tax takes priority over incumbrances on the corporate property. New York Terminal Co. v. Gaus, 204 N. Y. 512, 98 N. E. 11. Under the earlier law a debt for franchise taxes was not 'a technical lien on specific property' and had been ordered paid out of moneys in receivers' hands. Central Trust Co. v. New York City & Northern R. R. Co., 110 N. Y. 250, 259, 18 N. E. 92, 1 L. R. A. 260. In the case at bar the District Judge relied upon section 197 as justifying him in giving priority for the claim for annual franchise taxes; and in denying priority for the claim for license fees, because in respect to the latter no corresponding provision is to be found in the Tax Law. But he had no occasion to seek statutory support for the priority sought by the state; since here it does not seek to displace any prior lien. It asks merely to have its prerogative right enforced against property on which there is no prior lien and upon which it is impossible to levy, because the property has been taken out of the hands of the debtor and placed in the custody of the court for purposes of protection and distribution.\n Whether the priority enjoyed by the state of New York is a prerogative right or merely a rule of administration is a matter of local law. Being such, the decisions of the \n\n[254 U.S. 380, 385]\n\u00a0\n highest court of the state as to the existence of the right and its incidents will be accepted by this court as conclusive. Compare Lewis v. Monson, \n151 \nU.S. 545, 549\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 424; St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co. v. Water Commissioners, \n168 \nU.S. 349, 358\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 157; Archer v. Greenville Gravel Co., \n233 \nU.S. 60, 68\n, 69 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 567; Guffey v. Smith, \n237 \nU.S. 101, 113\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 526. The priority of the state extends to all property of the debtor within its borders, whether the debtor be a resident or nonresident and whether the property be in his possession or in custodia legis. The priority is therefore enforceable against the property in the hands of a receiver appointed by a federal court within the state. Duryea v. American Woodworking Machine Co. (C. C.) 133 Fed. 329; Conklin v. United States Shipbuilding Co. (C. C.) 148 Fed. 129, 130. Compare Franklin Trust Co. v. New Jersey, 181 Fed. 769, 104 C. C. A. 629; Washington-Alaska Bank v. Dexter Horton National Bank (C. C. A.) 263 Fed. 304. For a receiver appointed by a federal court takes property subject to all liens, priorities, or privileges existing or accruing under the laws of the state. In the case at bar a warrant for the amount of the license tax might have issued but for the appointment of the receiver, and if the levy had been made it would have become, under section 201 of the Tax Law, a lien on all the property of the company from 'the time an actual levy shall be made by virtue thereof.' Since the prerogative right of the state could not be enforced by levy and seizure, an application to the court for payment of the debt due was the appropriate remedy. In re Tyler, \n149 \nU.S. 164, 184\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 785.\n The state's right to be paid out of the assets prior to other creditors does not, as pointed out in In re Tyler, supra (quoting Greeley v. Provident Savings Bank, 98 Mo. 458, 11 S. W. 980), arise from an express lien on the assets existing at the time they passed into the receiver's hands. State v. Rowse, 49 Mo. 586, 592; George v. St. Louis Cable & Western Railway Co. (C. C.) 44 Fed. 117, 118; Hamilton \n\n[254 U.S. 380, 386]\n\u00a0\n v. David C. Beggs Co. (C. C.) 171 Fed. 157; Coy v. Title Guarantee & Trust Co. (D. C.) 212 Fed. 520, 523; Id., 220 Fed. 90, 135 C. C. A. 58, L. R. A. 1915E, 211. The right of priority has been likened to an equitable lien. State v. Rowse, supra. The analogous preference in payment given to claims for labor by state statutes, and to which the Bankruptcy Act gives priority, have been described as being 'tantamount' to a lien. In re Laird, 109 Fed. 550, 555, 48 C. C. A. 538; In re Bennett, 153 Fed. 673, 677, 82 C. C. A. 531. The priority is a lien in the broad sense of that term which includes 'those preferred or privileged claims given by statute or by admiralty law.' 2 Bouvier, Law Dict. (15th Ed. 1883) 88. The prerogative right of the state resembles the privilege accorded by the civil law of Louisiana to certain classes of debts which it was assumed in Burdon Central Sugar Refining Co. v. Payne, \n167 U.S. 127\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 754, would be enforced against property in the custody of a receiver appointed by a federal court. The fact that the right rests on the common law independently of any statute, does not, of course, affect the right of enforcement in the federal courts.\n City of Richmond v. Bird, \n249 U.S. 174\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 186, relied upon by the petitioner is not in point. The city sought there in vain to have taxes declared payable out of the bankrupt's assets in preference to the claim of the landlord thereon which was secured by a specific lien arising upon distraint. This court held that the city did not have such superior right since neither the laws of the United States nor those of Virginia accorded such priority. Here it is not sought to gain priority over a lien existing at the time when the receiver was appointed, and the priority over unsecured creditors is granted by the common law of New York.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See, in addition to cases cited in the text, Matter of Receivership of Columbian Insurance Co., 3 Abb.

S.(1920)\nNo. 73\nArgued: November 13, 1919Decided: January 12, 1920\n\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 342, 344]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Burt E. Barlow and A. R. Serven, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Under warrant of the Act of Congress approved August 5, 1909 (36 Stat. c. 6, pp. 11, 113), the government collected from the claimant, a corporation organized as an insurance company under the laws of Maryland, an excise tax for the years 1909, 1910, 1911, and 1912, and, under warrant of the Act of Congress of October 3, 1913 (38 Stat. c. 16, pp. 114, 166), it likewise collected an excise tax for the first two months of 1913, and an income tax for the remaining months of that year.\n This suit, instituted in the Court of Claims, to recover portions of such payments claimed to have been unlawfully collected, is here for review upon appeal from the judgment of that court.\n The claimant was engaged in casualty, liability, fidelity, guaranty and surety insurance, but the larger part of its business was employers' liability, accident, and, in the later of the years under consideration in this case, workmen's compensation insurance.\n By process of elimination the essential questions of difference between the parties ultimately became three, viz.:\n\n\n (1)\n Should claimant be charged, as a part of its gross income each year, with premiums collected by agents, but not transmitted by them to its treasurer within the year?\n\n\n (2)\n May the amount of gross income of the claimant be reduced by the aggregate amount of the taxes, salaries, brokerage and reinsurance unpaid at the end of each year, under the provisions in both the excise and income \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 345]\n\u00a0\n tax laws allowing deductions of 'net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds'?\n\n\n (3)\n Should the decrease in the amount of reserve funds required by law for the year 1913 from the amount required for 1912 be treated as 'released reserve' and charged to the company as income for 1913?\n Of these in the order stated.\n Section 38 of the Excise Tax Act (36 Stat. 112) provides that every corporation, organized under the laws of any state as an insurance company 'shall be subject to pay annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying on or doing business ... equivalent to one per centum upon the entire net income ... received by it from all sources during such year.'\n The Income Tax Act (38 Stat. 172) provides-section G, paragraph (a)- that the tax shall be levied upon the entire 'net income arising or accruing from all sources during the preceding calendar year.' But in paragraph (b), providing for deductions, gross income is described as that 'received within the year from all sources.' So that, with respect to domestic corporations, it is clear enough that no change was intended by the use of the expression 'arising or accruing' in the Income Tax Act, and that the tax should be levied under both acts upon the income 'received' during the year. Southern Pacific Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 330, 335\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 540\n\n\n The claimant did business in many states, through many agents, with whom it had uniform written contracts which allowed them to extend the time for payment of the premiums on policies, not to exceed thirty days from the date of policy, and required that on the 5th day of each calendar month they should pay or remit, in cash or its equivalent, the balance due claimant as shown by the last preceding monthly statement rendered to it. \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 346]\n\u00a0\n Under the provisions of such contracts obviously the agents were not required to remit premiums on policies written in November until the 5th of January of the next year and on policies written in December not until the following February.\n Much the largest item of the gross income of the company was premiums collected on policies of various kinds. Omitting reference to earlier and tenative returns by the claimant and amendments by the government, it came about that claimant took the final position that the only premiums with which it could properly be charged as net income 'received by it ... during each year' were such as were collected and actually paid to its treasurer within the year. This involved omitting from gross income each year 'premiums in course of collection by agents, not reported on December 31st,' which varied in amount from $584,000 in one year to $1,020,000 in another. The amount, if deducted one year, might appear in the return of the claimant for the next year, but the rate might be different.\n The government, on the other hand, contended that the claimant should return the full amount of premiums on policies written in each year, whether actually collected or not.\n The Court of Claims refused to accept the construction of either of the parties and held that the claimant should have returned, not all premiums written by it, but all which were actually received by it during the year and that receipt by its agents was receipt by the company, within the meaning of the act of Congress.\n The claimant contends that premiums paid to its agents but not remitted to its treasurer were not 'received by it during the year,' chiefly for the reason that while in the possession of the agents the money could not be attached as the company's property (Maxwell v. McGee, 66 Mass. [12 Cush.] 137), and because money, while thus in \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 347]\n\u00a0\n the possession of agents was not subject to beneficial use by the claimant and therefore cannot, with propriety, be said to have been received by it, within the meaning of the act.\n On the other hand it is conclusively argued: That payment of the premium to the agent discharged the obligation of the insured and called into effect the obligation of the insurer as fully as payment to the treasurer of the claimant could have done; that in the popular or generally accepted meaning of the words 'received by it' (which must be given to them, Maillard v. Lawrence, 16 How. 251), receipt by an agent is regarded as receipt by his principal; that under their contract collected premiums in possession of the agents of the claimant were subject to use by it in an important respect before they were transmitted to the treasurer of the company, for the agency contract provided that 'the agent will pay on demand, out of any funds collected by him for account of premium and not remitted to the company, such drafts as may be drawn on him by the company ... for the purpose of settling claims, deducting the amount from the next succeeding monthly remittance'; and that only imperative language in the statute would justify a construction which would place it in the power of the claimant, by private contract with its agents, to shift payment of taxes from one taxing year into another.\n The claimant withheld from its returns collections in the custody of its agents at the end of each year, and because in its amendments the government had included all premiums written in each year whether or not collected, the Court of Claims, having reached the conclusion thus approved by us, allowed the claimant ninety days in which to show the amount of premiums received by it and its agents within each of the years in controversy, but the claimant failed to make such a showing, and thereupon the court treated the return of premiums \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 348]\n\u00a0\n written as the correct one and very properly, so far as this item is concerned, dismissed claimant's petition.\n Second. In the same words the Excise and Income Tax Acts provide that 'the net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds' may be deducted from gross, in determining the amount of net, income to be taxed.\n Finding its authority in this provision of the law the claimant in all of its returns treated as 'reserves,' for the purpose of determining whether the aggregate amount of them each year was greater or less than in the preceding year, and of thereby arriving at the 'net addition to reserve funds' which it was authorized to deduct from gross income, the following, among others, viz.: 'Reserve for unearned premiums,' 'special reserve for unpaid liability losses,' and 'loss claims reserve.' Unearned premium reserve and special reserve for unpaid liability losses are familiar types of insurance reserves, and the government, in its amended returns, allowed these two items, but rejected the third, 'loss claims reserve.'\n The Court of Claims, somewhat obscurely, held that the third item should also be allowed. This 'loss claims reserve' was intended to provide for the liquidation of claims for unsettled losses (other than those provided for by the reserve for liability losses) which had accrued at the end of the tax year for which the return was made and the reserve computed. The finding that the insurance department of Pennsylvania, pursuant to statute, has at all times since and including 1909 required claimant to keep on hand, as a condition of doing business in that state, 'assets as reserves sufficient to cover outstanding losses,' justifies the deduction of this reserve as one required by law to be maintained, and the holding that it sould have been allowed for all of the years involved is approved. \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 349]\n\u00a0\n But the Court of Claims approved the action of the government in rejecting other claimed deductions of reserves for 'unpaid taxes, salaries, brokerage and reinsurance due other companies.' The court gave as its reason for this conclusion that the 'net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds,' which the act of Congress permitted to be deducted from gross income, was limited to reserves required by express statutory provision, and did not apply to reserves required by the rules and regulations of state insurance departments, when promulgated in the exercise of an appropriate power conferred by statute.\n In this the Court of Claims fell into error. It is settled by many recent decisions of this court that a regulation by a department of government, addressed to and reasonably adapted to the enforcement of an act of Congress, the administration of which is confided to such department, has the force and effect of law if it be not in conflict with express statutory provision. United States v. Grimaud, \n220 U.S. 506\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 480; United States v. Birdsall, \n233 \nU.S. 223, 231\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 512; United States v. Smull, \n236 \nU.S. 405, 409\n, 411 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 349; United States v. Morehead, \n243 U.S. 607\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 458. The law is not different with respect to the rules and regulations of a department of a state government.\n But it is contended by the claimant that it was required to provide 'reserves' for the payment of the rejected items of liability: Because the Court of Claims found that pursuant to statutes the insurance department of Pennsylvania required the company, as a condition of doing business in that state, to keep on hand 'assets as reserves' sufficient to cover all claims against the company 'whether due or accrued'; because the department of New York required it to maintain 'reserves sufficient to meet all of its accrued but unpaid indebtedness in each year'; and because the department of Wisconsin required it to carry 'sufficient reserves to cover all of its outstanding liabilities.' \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 350]\n\u00a0\n Whether this contention of the claimant can be justified or not depends upon the meaning which is to be given to the words 'reserve funds' in the two acts of Congress we are considering.\n The term 'reserve' or 'reserves' has a special meaning in the law of insurance. While its scope varies under different laws, in general it means a sum of money, variously computed or estimated, which, with accretions from interest, is set aside-'reserved'-as a fund with which to mature or liquidate, either by payment or reinsurance with other companies, future unaccrued and contingent claims, and claims accrued, but contingent and indefinite as to amount or time of payment.\n In this case, as we have seen, the term includes 'unearned premium reserve' to meet future liabilities on policies, 'liability reserve' to satisfy claims, indefinite in amount and as to time of payment, but accrued on liability and workmen's compensation policies, and 'reserve for loss claims' accrued on policies other than those provided for in the 'liability reserve,' but it has nowhere been held that 'reserve,' in this technical sense, must be maintained to provide for the ordinary running expenses of a business, definite in amount and which must be currently paid by every company from its income if its business is to continue, such as taxes, salaries, reinsurance, and unpaid brokerage.\n The requirements relied upon, of the insurance departments of New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin that 'assets as reserves' must be maintained to cover 'all claims,' 'all indebtedness,' 'all outstanding liabilities,' in terms might include the rejected items we are considering; but plainly the departments, in these expressions used the word 'reserves' in a nontechnical sense as equivalent to 'assets,' as is illustrated by the Massachusetts requirement that each company shall 'hold or reserve assets' for the payment of all claims and obliga tions. \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 351]\n\u00a0\n The distinction between the 'reserves' and general assets of a company is obvious and familiar and runs through the statements of claimant and every other insurance company. That provision for the payment of ordinary expenses such as we are considering was not intended to be provided for and included in 'reserve funds' as the term is used in the acts of Congress is plain from the fact that the acts permit deductions for such charges from income if paid within the year, and the claimant was permitted in this case to deduct large sums for such ordinary expenses of the business-specifically, large sums for taxes. The claimant did not regard any such charges as properly covered by 'reserves' and did not so include them in its statement for 1909. In its 1910 return 'unpaid taxes' and 'salaries' first appear as 'reserves,' and in 1911 'brokerage' and 'reinsurance' are added. This earlier, though it is now claimed to have been an uninstructed or inexpert, interpretation of the language of the acts, was nevertheless the candid and correct interpretation of it, and the judgment of the Court of Claims in this respect is approved.\n Third. The year 1913 was the only one of those under consideration in which the aggregate amount of reserves which the claimant was required by law to keep fell below the amount so required for the preceding year. The government allowed only 'unearned premium' and 'unpaid liability loss' reserves to be considered in determining deductions. In 1913 the 'unpaid liability loss reserve' decrease exceeded the 'unearned premium reserve' increase by over $270,000, and this amount the government added to the gross income of the claimant for the year, calling it 'released reserve,' on the theory that the difference in the amount of the reserves for the two years released the decrease to the claimant so that it could use it for its general purposes, and therefore constituted free income for the year 1913, in which the decrease occurred. \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 352]\n\u00a0\n This theory of the government was accepted by the Court of Claims and the addition to the gross income was approved.\n The statute does not in terms dispose of the question thus presented.\n Reserves, as we have seen, are funds set apart as a liability in the accounts of a company to provide for the payment or reinsurance of specific contingent liabilities. They are held, not only as security for the payment of claims, but also as funds from which payments are to be made. The amount 'reserved' in any given year may be greater than is necessary for the required purposes, or it may be less than is necessary; but the fact that it is less in one year than in the preceding year does not necessarily show either that too much or too little was reserved for the former year. It simply shows that the aggregate reserve requirement for the second year is less than for the first, and this may be due to various causes. If, in this case, it were due to an overstimate of reserves for 1912 with a resulting excessive deduction for that year from gross income, and if such excess was released to the general uses of the company and increased its free assets in 1913, to that extent it should very properly be treated as income in the year in which it became so available, for the reason that in that year, for the first time, it became free income, under the system for determining net income provided by the statute, and the fact that it came into the possession of the company in an earlier year in which it could be used only in a special manner, which permitted it to become nontaxable would not prevent its being considered as received in 1913 for the purposes of taxation, within the meaning of the act.\n The findings of fact in this case, however, do not show that the diminution in the amount of required reserves was due to excessive reserves in prior years or to any other cause by which the free assets of the company were increased \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 353]\n\u00a0\n in the year 1913, and the following finding of fact makes strongly against such a conclusion:\n'The decrease in employers' liability loss reserve for 1913, designated as 'released reserve,' did not in any respect affect or change claimant's gross income or disbursements, as shown by the state insurance reports.'\n\n It would not be difficult to suggest conditions under which the statutory permit to deduct net additions to reserve funds would result in double deduction in favor of an insurance company, but such deductions can be restored to income again only where it is clearly shown that subsequent business conditions have released the amount of them to the free beneficial use of the company in a real, and not in a mere bookkeeping sense. If this seemingly favorable treatment of insurance companies is to be otherwise corrected or changed, it is for Congress, and not for the courts, to amend the law.\n Since the findings of fact before us do not make the clear showing, which must be required, that the statutory deduction of net reserves in prior years was restored to the free use of the claimant in 1913, it should not have been charged as income with the decrease in that year, and, on the record before us, the holding of the Court of Claims must be reversed.\n There remains the question as to the statute of limitations.\n The government concedes that the case is in time with respect to the amended returns but claims that it is barred by R. S.  3226, 3227, and 3228 (Comp. St.  5949, 5950, 5951), with respect to taxes paid on the original returns for all of the years but 1913. The claimant made its original returns without protest except for the year 1909 and, without appeal to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, voluntarily paid the taxes computed on them for each of the years. Payment was made for 1909 in June, 1910; for 1910 in June 1911; for 1911 in June, 1912; for 1912 in June, 1913. No \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 354]\n\u00a0\n claim for a refund of any of these payments was made until April 30, 1915, and then the claim was in general terms:\n'For amounts paid by it in taxes which, through lack of information as to requirements of law or by error in computation, it may have paid in excess of the amount legally due.'\n\n This claim was rejected subsequent to the institution of this suit, which was commenced on February 8, 1916.\n This statement shows the right of the claimant plainly barred by its failure to appeal to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue (R. S.  3226 [ this is fundamental, King's County Savings Institution v. Blair, \n116 U.S. 200\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 353]), and also by its failure to institute suit within two years after the cause of action accrued (R. S.  3227).\n The claimant contends that the amended returns filed by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue were not amendments or modifications of the original returns, but were based upon a different principle, and, within the scope of Cheatham et al. v. United States, \n92 U.S. 85\n, constituted new assessments from which appeals were taken in time.\n But they are denominated 'amended returns,' and while in dealing with the same items the basis of computation was in some cases varied, in each case the purpose and effect of them was to increase the payment which the claimant was required to make under the law and the payments made on the original returns were credited on the amounts computed as due on the returns as amended.\n The inapplicability of Cheatham et al. v. United States, \n92 U.S. 85\n, is obvious, and the contention that the filing of the amended returns constituted the beginning of new proceedings which so superseded the original returns as to release the claimant from its entire failure to observe the statutory requirement for review of the latter is so unfounded \n\n[251 U.S. 342, 355]\n\u00a0\n that we cannot consent to enter upon a detailed discussion of it. This conclusion renders section 14 of the Act of Congress of September 8, 1916 ( 39 Stat. 772, c. 463 [Comp. St.  6336n]) inapplicable.\n It results that the judgment of the Court of Claims is modified, and, as so modified, affirmed, and the case is remanded to that court for proceedings in accordance with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCLOSKEY v. TOBIN(1920)\nNo. 79\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. R. H. Ward, of Wichita Falls, Tex., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Luther Nickels, of Eastland, Tex., and B. F. Looney, of Greenville, Tex., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Article 421 of the Penal Code of Texas defined, with much detail, the offense of barratry. In McCloskey v. San Antonio Traction Co. (Tex. Civ. App.) 192 S. W. 1116, a decree for an injunction restraining the plaintiff in error from pursuing the practice of fomenting and adjusting claims was reversed on the ground that this section had superseded the common law offense of barratry and that by the Code 'only an attorney at law is forbidden to solicit employment in any suit himself or by an agent.' Article 421 was then amended (Act March 29, 1917, c. 133 [Vernon's Ann. Pen. Code Supp. Tex. 1918, art. 421]) so as to apply to any person who 'shall seek to obtain \n\n[252 U.S. 107, 108]\n\u00a0\n employment in any claim, to prosecute, defend, present or collect the same by means of personal solicitation of such employment. ...' Thereafter McCloskey was arrested on an information which charged him with soliciting employment to collect two claims, one for personal injuries, the other for painting a buggy. He applied for a writ of habeas corpus, which was denied both by the county court and the Court of Criminal Appeals. The case comes here under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214); McCloskey having claimed below, as here, that the act under which he was arrested violates rights guaranteed him by the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The contention is that, since the state had made causes of action in tort as well as in contract assignable (Railway v. Ginther, 96 Tex. 295, 72 S. W. 166), they had become an article of commerce; that the business of obtaining adjustment of claims is not inherently evil; and that therefore, while regulation was permissible, prohibition of the business violates rights of liberty and propery and denies equal protection of the laws. The contention may be answered briefly. To prohibit solicitation is to regulate the business, not to prohibit it. Compare Brazee v. Michigan, \n241 U.S. 340\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 561, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 522. The evil against which the regulation is directed is one from which the English law has long sought to protect the community through proceedings for barratry and champerty. Co.

C., for petitioner.\n Mr. H. A. Toulmin, of Dayton, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Proceeding against Wagner and others in the United States District Court, Southern District of Ohio, Meccano, Limited, obtained a decree ( July 8, 1916) affirming the validity, and restraining infringement, of its patent for mechanical toys, also restraining unfair competition in making and selling such toys and the further infringement of its copyright upon trade catalogue and illustrated \n\n[253 U.S. 136, 138]\n\u00a0\n manual relating thereto. Meccano v. Wagner, 234 Fed. 912. An appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit. The same corporation instituted the present suit in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York (December 9, 1916) seeking like relief against John Wanamaker, a customer of Wagner.\n The trial court granted a preliminary injunction, asked upon the bill, supporting affidavits and exhibits-January 12, 1917, It expressed general agreement with the conclusions announced in the Ohio cause and said:\n'It seems quite apparent that the patent is infringed and that diagrams and directions as to construction have been borrowed by defendant from complainant's copyrighted catalogues, and that the system of construction adopted by the defendant is a direct imitation of complainant's system.'\n\n An appeal followed, pending which the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit (November, 1917), reversed the Ohio District Court's decree so far as it sustained the patent, approved it otherwise, and remanded the cause for further proceedings. Wagner v. Meccano, 246 Fed. 603, 158 C. C. A. 573.\n January 25, 1918, after argument, but before determination of appeal from the preliminary order, petitioner moved for final decision on the merits, claiming that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, 'is final and conclusive as to the case at bar, under principles enunciated by the Supreme Court.' Being opposed, the motion was denied- March 24, 1918. The court said of it:\n'This was a motion for a 'decision on the merits of this cause' by this court under the following circumstances: A suit was brought in the District Court for the Southern District of New York for an injunction for infringement of a copyright, and of a patent, and for unfair competition in the manufacture of a mechanical toy in absolute imitation of the plaintiff's. The plaintiff applied for and got \n\n[253 U.S. 136, 139]\n\u00a0\n an injunction pendente lite [241 Fed. 133], from which the defendant appealed. That appeal is still pending undetermined in this court. Meanwhile the plaintiff had in the District Court required the defendant to answer certain interrogatories, by which it appeared that the defendant procured from one Wagner the toys which it sold in alleged unfair competition and in violation of the patent, and also the 'manuals' which went with the toys and explained their uses, which are alleged to infringe the copyright. The interrogatories further showed that Wagner had agreed to hold the defendant harmless for any sales of the toys and manuals, and that in pursuance of that undertaking he had taken a share in the defense of this suit. While it did not appear exactly what that share was, it may be assumed, for the purpose of the motion only, that Wagner has assumed the chief conduct of the case, and that the defendant remains only formally represented.\n\n'The plaintiff sued Wagner in Ohio upon the three same causes of equity and obti ned a decree upon all. Later an appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and the decree was affirmed except as to the patent, which was declared invalid, and which the plaintiff has now withdrawn from this suit. No final decree has been entered, and the Ohio cause now stands for an accounting in the District Court. This motion is upon the record in the Ohio suit, which is made a part of the moving papers, and it presupposes that this court may pass a final decree for the plaintiff upon the appeal from the injunction pendente lite, upon the assumption that that record is a complete estoppel against the defendant here and leaves open no issues for determination between the parties.'\n\n'We pass the question of practice whether this court, under the doctrine of Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., \n177 U.S. 488\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 708, may enter a decree for the plaintiff upon such \n\n[253 U.S. 136, 140]\n\u00a0\n an appeal as that now pending. Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., supra, was a case where the bill was dismissed, and no case has so far held that the plaintiff could obtain an affirmative decree. As we think the motion must be denied upon the merits, we leave open the question whether the plaintiff may in any event so terminate the litigation. ... It is apparent that some of the issues are different from those litigated in Ohio; they involve, not only the defendant's rights to sell Wagner's toys and manuals, but any others which it may procure elsewhere. ... At best the rule in Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Mfg. Co., supra, is limited to those cases in which the court can see that the whole issues can be disposed of at once without injustice to the parties. Whatever may be the result here, it is apparent that the case involves more than can be so decided.' 250 Fed. 250, 162 C. C. A. 386.\n\n April 15, 1918, the court below reversed the challenged preliminary order. After stating that the trial court very naturally followed the Ohio District Court, it referred to the partial reversal of the decree there announced and expressed entire agreement with the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, in holding the patent invalid. And, having considered the evidence relating to copyright and unfair competition, it found no adequate ground for an injunction. 250 Fed. 450, 162 C. C. A. 386. The cause comes here by certiorari. See Ex parte Wagner, \n249 U.S. 465\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 317.\n Decrees by Circuit Courts of Appeals are declared final by section 128, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1120), in cases like the present one. We therefore had authority to bring this cause up by certiorari and may treat it as if here on appeal. Section 240, Judicial Code (Comp. St. 1217) Harriman v. Northern Securities Co., \n197 \nU.S. 244, 287\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 493; Denver v. New York Trust Co., \n229 \nU.S. 123, 136\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 657. The power of Circuit Courts of Appeals to review preliminary orders granting injunctions arises from section 129, Judicial Code, which has been often considered. Smith v. Vulcan Iron Works, \n165 U.S. 518\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 407; \n\n[253 U.S. 136, 141]\n\u00a0\n Mast, Foos & Co. v. Stover Manufacturing Co., \n177 \nU.S. 485, 494\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 708; Harriman v.

This power is not limited to mere consideration of, and action upon, the order appealed from; but, if insuperable objection to maintaining the bill clearly appears, it may be dismissed and the litigation terminated.\n The correct general doctrine is that whether a preliminary injunction shall be awarded rests in sound discretion of the trial court. Upon appeal, an order granting or denying such an injunction will not be disturbed, unless contrary to some rule of equity, or the result of improvident exercise of judicial discretion. Rahley v. Columbia Phonograph Co., 122 Fed. 623, 58 C. C. A. 639; Tea  Traction Co. v. Barron G. Collier, Inc., 195 Fed. 65, 66, 115 C. C. A. 82; Southern Express Co. v. Long et al., 202 Fed. 462, 120 C. C. A. 568; City of Amarillo et al. v. Southwestern Telegraph & Telephone Co., 253 Fed. 638, 165 C. C. A. 264. The informed judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals exercised upon a view of all relevant circumstances is entitled to great weight. And, except for strong reasons, this court will not interfere with its action. No such reasons are presented by the present record.\n Pending the New York appeal the situation underwent a radical change- the Circuit Court of Appeals, Sixth Circuit, reversed the decree upholding petitioner's patent. Evidently the trial court had granted the preliminary injunction in entire reliance upon that decree, and after its reversal the court below properly took notice of and considered the changed circumstances. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Ry. v. Dennis, \n224 \nU.S. 503, 505\n, 506 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 542.\n Petitioner maintains that its motion for final decree upon the merits should have been sustained. But the appeal was from an interlocutory order and the court could only exercise powers given by statute. On such an appeal a cause may be dismissed if it clearly appears that \n\n[253 U.S. 136, 142]\n\u00a0\n no ground exists for equitable relief; but finally to decide a defendant's rights upon the mere statement of his adversary, although apparently supported by ex parte affidavits and decrees of other courts, is not within the purview of the act. He is entitled to a day in court with opportunity to set up and establish his defenses. The motion for final judgment was properly overruled. Eagle Glass & Manufacturing Co. v. Rowe et al., \n245 \nU.S. 275, 281\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 80.\n Petitioner's motion to enter a disclaimer must be denied.\n If the two Circuit Courts of Appeals have expressed conflicting views, we cannot now declare which is right or undertake finally to decide the several issues involved upon their merits. The matter for review here is the action of the courts below upon the preliminary order for injunction and we may go no further. Leeds & Catlin Co. v.

W. 1183. Thereupon the Supreme Court took jurisdiction by writ of certiorari, rendered an opinion, quashed the judgment of affirmance, and remanded the cause to the Court of Appeals for decision. 271 Mo. 475, 196 S. W. 1132.\n Following the Supreme Court's opinion, the Court of Appeals ordered the judgment of the trial court 'reversed, annulled and for naught held and esteemed; that the said appellants be restored to all they have lost by reason of the said judgment; that the said appellants recover of the said respondent costs and charges herein expended, and have execution therefor.' A motion there for rehearing having been overruled, without more, this writ of error was sued out.\n The assignments of error here challenge the validity of sections 3037- 3040 and section 3342, Revised Statutes of Missouri 1909, because in conflict with the Federal Constitution. This claim was first set up in the Court of Appeals upon the motion for rehearing. \n\n[251 U.S. 256, 258]\n\u00a0\n The Missouri Constitution (article 6,  8, Amend. of 1884) gives the Supreme Court 'superintending control over the courts of appeals by mandamus, prohibition, and certiorari,' and provides (article 6,  6, Amend. 1884) that--\n'The last previous rulings of the Supreme Court on any question of law or equity shall, in all cases, be controlling authority in said courts of appeals.'\n\n In State ex rel. v. Ellison, 268 Mo. 225, 238, 186 S. W. 1075, 1078, a proceeding upon certiorari, and court declared:\n'We can undo what the Court of Appeals has done; ... and we can send the record back to them to be heard anew by them, ... but in the Kansas City Court of Appeals alone lies the jurisdiction to hear and to correctly and finally determine the case to which the instant proceeding is ancillary.'\n\n See, also, State ex rel. v. Ellison, 269 Mo. 151, 190 S. W. 274; Schmohl v. Travelers' Ins. Co. (Mo.) 197 S. W. 60.\n In the present cause, the Supreme Court said:\n'This is an original proceeding by certiorari. ... It is urged by relator as his ground for quashal that the opinion of the Court of Appeals is in conflict with the case of United Shoe Machinery Co. v. Ramlose, 210 Mo. 631. 109 S. W. 567. ... If this decision be opposed to what we said or the conclusion which we reached upon similar facts (if the facts are similar) in the Ramlose Case, we ought to quash the judgment of the Court of Appeals. This is the sole question to be determined.'\n\n Under the Missouri practice and circumstances here disclosed, we think the judgment of the Springfield Court of Appeals was final within the meaning of section 237, Judicial Code. No suggestion is made that further review by the Supreme Court could be had, as matter of discretion or otherwise.\n The only ground mentioned in the assignments of error upon which this writ could be sustained is conflict between specified sections of the Missouri statutes relating to transactions by foreign corporations and the Federal Constitution. But this point came too late, being first \n\n[251 U.S. 256, 259]\n\u00a0\n advanced below on the motion for rehearing. Godchaux Co. v.

CO. v. MILWAUKEE(1920)\nNo. 55\nArgued: November 10, 1919Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 100, 101]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edward S. Mach, of Milwaukee, Wis., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Clifton Williams, of Milwaukee, Wis., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A petition for a writ of mandamus was brought by the city of Milwaukee in a lower court of the state of Wisconsin \n\n[252 U.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n to compel the Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Company to pave at its own expense with asphalt upon a concrete foundation that portion of Centre street, called the railway zone, which lies between the trakcs and for one foot outside of them. The paving had been specifically ordered on November 8, 1915, by a city ordinance after the city had laid such a pavement on all of the street except the railway zone. Theretofore the street had been paved from curb to curb with macadam. The company admitted that the railway zone was in need of repaving at that time; but it insisted that under an ordinance of January 2, 1900, which constituted its franchise to lay tracks on Centre street, it was entitled to repair with macadam and could not be compelled to repave with asphalt.\n The case was heard in the trial court on a demurrer o the amended return. The demurrer was sustained, and the decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 165 Wis. 230, 161 N. W. 745. The company having failed after remittitur to file an amended return or take further action, judgment was entered by the trial court awarding a peremptory writ of mandamus directing it to pave the railway zone as directed in the ordinance. This judgment also was affirmed by the Supreme Court. 166 Wis. 163, 164 N. W. 844. The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1214). The single question presented is whether the ordinance of November 8, 1915, is void either under section 10 of article 1 of the federal Constitution, as impairing contract rights of the company, or under the Fourteenth Amendment, as depriving it of property without due process of law. The ordinance of January 2, 1900, which is the contract alleged to be impaired by the later ordinance, provides as follows:\n'Sec. 2. ... It shall be the duty of said railway company at all times to keep in good repair the roadway between the rails and for one foot on the outside of each rail \n\n[252 U.S. 100, 103]\n\u00a0\n as laid, and the space between the two inside rails of its double tracks with the same material as the city shall have last used to pave or repave these spaces and the street previous to such repairs, unless the railway company and the board of public works of said city shall agree upon some other material, and said company shall then use the material agreed upon. ...'\n\n The company contends that when this section is read in connection with section 9, it clearly appears that the obligation to repave cannot be imposed.\n First. The Supreme Court of the state held that the language of section 2 was not distinguishable from that involved in earlier cases in which it had held that a duty to keep 'in proper repair' without qualification was broad enough to require repaving and repairing with the same material with which the street was repaved. When this court is called upon to decide whether state legislation impairs the obligation of a contract, it must determine for itself whether there is a contract, and what its obligation is as well as whether the obligation has been impaired. Detroit United Railway v. Detroit, \n242 \nU.S. 238, 249\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 87. But, as stated in Southern Wisconsin Railway v. Madison, \n240 \nU.S. 457, 461\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 400, 401 (60 L. Ed. 739):\n'The mere fact that without the state decision we might have hesitated is not enough to lead us to overrule that decision upon a fairly doubtful point.'\n\n Among the cases relied upon by the state court is State ex rel. Milwaukee v. Milwaukee Electric Railway & Light Co., 151 Wis. 520, 139 N. W. 396, Ann. Cas. 1814B, 123, which was cited by this court in the Madison Case, \n240 U.S. 461\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 402 (60 L. Ed. 739), as a 'persuasive decision that the obligation to keep the space 'in proper repair' ... extends to' repaving the railway zone with asphalt when the rest of the street is being repaved with that material. But the company points to the clause in the ordinance of January 2, 1900, which provides for repair 'with the same material as the city shall have last used to pave or repair these spaces and the streets,' \n\n[252 U.S. 100, 104]\n\u00a0\n and insists that its obligation is, in any event, limited to repaving with such material as the city had last used between the rails. This would put upon the city the burden of paving the whole street in case of any innovation in paving save by agreement of the company and the city. It is not a reasonable construction of the provision.\n Second. Granted the duty to repave, and to repave with material other than that last used in the space between the tracks, was it reasonable for the city to require that the pavement be of asphalt upon a concrete foundation-a pavement which involved larger expense? The city alleged in its petition that the use of macadam by the railway was unreasonable, and that it is physically impossible to make a water-tigt bond between the water-bound macadam and the asphalt, so as to prevent water from seeping through under the asphalt, causing it to deteriorate in warm weather and to be lifted by freezing in cold weather. The allegation was not expressly admitted by the return and must be deemed to have been covered by its general denial of all allegations not expressly admitted; but neither party took steps to have this formal issue disposed of. The case differs, therefore, in this respect from the Madison Case, where there was an express finding that repavement of the railway zone with stone would have been unsuitable when the rest of the street was of asphalt. \n240 U.S. 462\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 400 (60 L. Ed. 739). The difference is not material. As the ordinance did not, as a matter of contract, preclude regulation in respect to paving, it was for the city to determine, in the first instance, what the public necessity and convenience demanded. Compare Fair Haven & Westville Railroad Co. v. New Haven, \n203 U.S. 379\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 74. We cannot say that its requirement that the railway zone be paved like the rest of the street with asphalt upon a concrete foundation was inherently arbitrary or unreasonable.\n Third. The company insists that the ordinance of \n\n[252 U.S. 100, 105]\n\u00a0\n November 8, 1915, is unreasonable and void, also, for an entirely different reason. It alleges in its return that for a long time prior to that date the earnings from its street railway system in Milwaukee were considerably under 6 per cent. of the value of the property used and useful in the business and were less than a reasonable return. It contends that this allegation was admitted by the demurrer; and that to impose upon the company the additional burden of paving with asphalt will reduce its income below a reasonable return on the investment and thus deprive it of its property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of the state answered the contention by saying:\n'The company can at any time apply to the Railroad Commission and have the rate made reasonable.'\n\n The financial condition of a public service corporation is a fact properly to be considered when determining the reasonableness of an order directing an unremunerative extension of facilities or forbidding their abandonment. Mississippi Railroad Commission v. Mobile & Ohio R. R. Co., \n244 U.S. 388\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 602; New York & Queen's Gas Co. v. McCall (\n245 \nU.S. 345, 350\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 122. But there is no warrant in law for the contention that merely because its business fails to earn full 6 per cent. upon the value of the property used, the company can escape either obligations voluntarily assumed or burdens imposed in the ordinary exercise of the police power. Compare Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Kansas, \n216 \nU.S. 262, 279\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 330; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway v. Arkansas, \n219 U.S. 453\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 275; Missouri Pacific Railway v. Omaha, \n235 U.S. 121\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 82.\n Fourth. The company also insists that the ordinance is void because it denies equal protection of the laws. The contention rests upon the fact that since entry of the judgment below the Supreme Court of the state has decided Superior v. Duluth Street Railway Co., 166 Wis. 487, 165 N. W. 1081, which the company alleges is not reconcilable with \n\n[252 U.S. 100, 106]\n\u00a0\n its decision in this case. The similarity of the ordinances and conditions in the two cases does not seem to us as clear as is asserted. But, however that may be, the Fourteenth Amendment does not, in guaranteeing equal protection of the laws, assure uniformity of judicial decisions (Backus v. Fort Street Union Depot Co., \n169 \nU.S. 557, 569\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 445), any more than in guaranteeing due process it assures immunity from judicial error (Central Land Co. v. Laidley, \n159 U.S. 103\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 80; Tracy v. Ginsberg, \n205 U.S. 170\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 461). Unlike Gelpcke v. Duu que, 1 Wall. 175, and Muhlker v. New York, \n197 U.S. 544\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 522, 49 L Ed 872, where protection was afforded to rights acquired on the faith of decisions later overruled, the company seeks here to base rights on a later decision between strangers which, it alleges, is irreconcilable on a matter of law with a decision theretofore rendered against it. The contention is clearly unsound.\n As we conclude that there was a contractual duty to repave arising from the acceptance of the franchise, we have no occasion to consider whether there was, as contended, also a statutory duty to do so arising under section 1862, Wisconsin Statutes, which provides that street railways shall 'be subject to such reasonable rules and regulations ... as the proper municipal authorities may by ordinance, from time to time prescribe.'\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","96":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINNEAPOLIS, ST P & S S M R.

Andrew Miller and Alfred Zuger, both of Bismarck, N.

Washburn Lignite Coal Co., \n254 U.S. 370\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 140, 65 L. Ed. --, just decided and was brought by a shipper to recover charges exacted in excess of the statutory rate. The shipments were made prior to the first judgment in the injunction suit, when the carrier was refusing to give effect to the schedule; and the excess was paid under protest \n\n[254 U.S. 376, 377]\n\u00a0\n and because the carrier would not deliver the coal on payment of the statutory rate. In the trial court there was a judgment against the shipper, and this was reversed by the Supreme Court with a direction to award the shipper the amount claimed. Merrick Co. v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S. S. M. R. Co., 35 N. D. 331, 160 N. W. 140. The carrier prosecutes this writ of error.\n The pleadings, the opinion of the Supreme Court, and the briefs in this court, show that the only controversy in that court was over the meaning and effect of the first judgment in the injunction suit as affirmed by this court 'without prejudice,' etc. On the part of the shipper it was insisted that that judgment finally and conclusively determined the validity of the statutory rate in respect of the period preceding its rendition; and on the part of the carrier it was insisted that the judgment was interlocutory merely and was entirely superseded and held for naught by the subsequent judgment of this court in the later proceeding. The court sustained the shipper's contention and rejected that of the carrier, saying:\n'The fallacy in respondent's [carrier's] contention, as we view it, lies in the unwarranted assumption that the latter judgment relates back and supersedes the first. When respondent [carrier] applied for and was granted leave to make a new showing as to the confiscatory character of the statutory rates, it amounted in legal effect to the commencement of a new action to determine a new issue; to wit, whether as applied to and in the light of facts subsequently arising, such statutory rates are confiscatory. The case was not reopened for the purpose of relitigating the issues formerly decided, nor was the former decree in any way affected. This is made clear by the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Missouri v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., \n241 U.S. 533\n.'\n\n In support of that view the court quoted portions of the opinion in the case cited, including the following:\n'In a rate case where an assertion of confiscation was \n\n[254 U.S. 376, 378]\n\u00a0\n not upheld because of the weakness of the facts supporting it, the practice came to be that the decree rejecting the claim and giving effect to the statute was, where it was deemed the situation justified it, qualified as 'without prejudice,' not to leave open the controversy as to the period with which the decree dealt, and which it concluded, but in order not to prejudice rights of property in the future if from future operation and changed conditions arising in such future, it resulted that there was confiscation. And the same limitation arising from a solicitude not to unduly restrain in the future the operation of the law came to be applied where the asserted confiscation was held to be established. In other words, the decree enjoining the enforcement of the statute in that case was also qualified as without prejudice to the enforcement of the statute in the future if a change in conditions arose. ... A complete illustration of the operation of the qualification is afforded by the North Dakota case, just cited [\n216 U.S. 579\n], since in that case as a result of the qualification 'without prejudice,' the case was subsequently reopened, and upon a consideration of new conditions arising in such future period, a different result followed [\n236 U.S. 585\n] from that which had been previously reached.'\n\n When we have in mind the question which the Supreme Court was called on to decide, and did decide, and the fact that the question was no longer an open one in this court, as is shown by our opinion in the Missouri Case ( \n241 U.S. 533\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 715), it is apparent that this writ of error is without any adequate basis.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\n\n\n","97":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMINNEAPOLIS, ST P & S S M R. CO. v. WASHBURN LIGNITE COAL CO.(1920)\nNo. 55\nArgued: January 29, 1920Decided: December 20, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 370, 371]\n\u00a0\n John L. Erdall, of Minneapolis, Minn., for plaintiff in error.\n Andrew Miller and Alfred Zuger, both of Bismarck, N. D., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was an action by a railroad company against a shipper, for whom it had carried many carloads of coal between points in the state of North Dakota, to recover for that service a compensation in addition to what was demanded and paid when the service was rendered. Judgment went against the carrier in the court of first instance, and again in the Supreme Court of the state (168 N. W. 684); and this writ of error was sued out on the theory that the judgment upheld and gave effect to a local rate statute which the carrier was contending was repugnant to the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. If this theory is not right, the writ of error must be dismissed, for it is without other support. See section 237, Judicial Code, as amended by Act Sept. 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726 ( Comp. St.  1214).\n To show what was involved and decided it is necessary to refer with some particularity to a prior litigation out of which the present case arose.\n In 1907 the state of North Dakota, by an act of its Legislature prescribed a schedule of maximum rates for carrying \n\n[254 U.S. 370, 372]\n\u00a0\n coal in carload lots between points within the state (chapter 51, Laws 1907); and this and other carriers refused to put the schedule into effect. Suits for injunctions against further disobedience were brought by the state in its Supreme Court, and the carriers defended on the ground that the schedule was confiscatory and therefore in conflict with the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. On the hearing that court sustained the schedule and directed that the injunctions issue. State v. N. P. Ry. Co., 19 N. D. 45 and 57, 120 N. W. 869, 25 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1001. The carriers brought the cases to this court on writs of error and it affirmed the judgments, but did so without prejudice to the right of the carriers to reopen the cases if an adequate trial of the schedule in the future enabled them to prove that it was confiscatory. N. P. Ry. v. N. D., \n216 \nU.S. 579, 581\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 423. Mandates to that effect issued and the state court modified its judgments accordingly. In obedience to the injunctions the carriers then put the schedule into effect in accordance with local laws (Rev. Code 1905,  4339-4342); that is to say, they printed and filed coal tariffs based on the maximum rates named in the schedule and gave public notice of their purpose to apply those tariffs. After trying the schedule for a year or more the carriers presented in the state court petitions wherein they told of the trial made, asserted their ability and readiness to prove that the schedule was confiscatory, and prayed permission to do so. The petitions were entertained, proofs were taken, and on a hearing the schedule was sustained and the existing injunctions continued. State v. N. P. R. Co., 26 N. D. 438, 145 N. W. 135. On writs of error prosecuted by the carriers those judgments were reversed by this court, because the proofs satisfied it that the schedule was not adequately remunerative, and the cases were remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the opinion. Nor. Pac. Ry. v. N. D., \n236 U.S. 585\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1. On receiving the mandates the state court set aside its judgments and dismissed the cases.'\n The injunctions in those cases were awarded without \n\n[254 U.S. 370, 373]\n\u00a0\n taking any bond and without imposing any terms or conditions other than reserving to the carriers, as before shown, a right to reopen the cases and again attack the schedule after subjecting it to a fairtrial. When this right was exercised the carriers did not ask a suspension of the injunctions pending a hearing and decision, and the injunctions remained in force until the cases were dismissed. Neither at the time of the dismissal nor at any prior stage of the proceedings was there any order saving or securing to the carriers a right to demand or collect additional compensation in respect of shipments whereon the schedule rate was demanded and paid while the injunctions were effective.\n The shipments as to which additional compensation is sought in the present case were made while the injunction against this carrier was in force; that is to say, after the schedule was sustained by the first judgments and before it was adjudged unremunerative as a result of the attack made after it had been in effect for a year or more. At the time of the shipments the carrier demanded and the shipper paid the maximum rate named in the schedule, it being the duly filed and published rate. The carrier did not then protest that it was entitled to more; nor did the shipper engage to pay more.\n In suing for further compensation the carrier took the position that the schedule was confiscatory and therefore invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment; that the coal was carried at the schedule rate because the injunction in the prior litigation compelled it; that the schedule ultimately was adjudged unremunerative and invalid and the injunction dissolved; and that in these circumstances there arose an obligation on the part of the shipper to pay an additional sum, such as with that already paid would amount to a reasonable compensation.\n The Supreme Court of the state put its judgment against the carrier on the following grounds: \n\n[254 U.S. 370, 374]\n\u00a0\n 1. There was no contract, express or implied, on the part of the shipper to pay any rate other than that shown in the tariff filed and published according to law-the court saying on this point:\n'Manifestly, if shippers cannot rely upon the rates as so published and filed, the requirement of publication becomes a mere trap for the unwary. In our judgment, it is wholly improper, in the absence of clear allegations of the rendition of services under a distinct protest, for a court to find that a shipper had, in effect, undertaken conditionally to pay according to a rate different from that published in compliance with the statute.'\n\n\n 2. \nThe injunction, in obedience to which the schedule was put into effect and maintained during the period covered by the shipments, was awarded without taking any bond or imposing any terms or conditions for the security of the carrier; and in these circumstances the damage arising from the injunction was damnum absque injuria, for which no recovery could be had-the court citing on this point Russell v. Farley, \n105 U.S. 433\n, 437-438 (26 L. Ed. 1060)1, and saying:\n'In reality the plaintiff's [carrier's] whole case seems properly hinged upon the real meaning and effect of the first decree of the United States Supreme Court. The matter that was settled in that suit [ meaning by that decree] was the right of the state to an injunction, and it was found that the state was entitled to the relief sought. Neither the state court nor the United States Supreme Court saw fit to impose any terms or conditions. ... The error in the plaintiff's [ carrier's] contention inheres in the failure to recognize the injunction as being the continuing expression of the court until such time as it \n\n[254 U.S. 370, 375]\n\u00a0\n may be modified or dissolved by a new judgment or decree. During such time it is impossible that there could have been any other measure of the rights and obligations of the parties than that provided in the decree itself. ... When that court finally dissolved the injunction, it did not reverse its prior judgment, nor, it seems to us, did it profess to give to the carriers any rights with respect to past shipments that did not exist at the time they were made. These rights were governed by the former decree.'\n\n\n 3. \nThe principle that one who has been unjustly enriched at the expense of another may be made to respond to the latter was without application, for here the shipper was responsible in no greater degree for what occurred than was the carrier.\n The opinion rendered by that court shows that it did not uphold or give effect to the statutory rate as such, but rested its decision on other independent grounds which appeared to it to preclude a recovery by the carrier. These grounds are broad enough to sustain the judgment, and, if not well taken, are not without substantial support. See Enterprise Irrigation District v. Farmers Mutual Canal Co., \n243 U.S. 157\n, 163-165, 37 Sup. Ct. 318. Some may possibly involve federal questions, but under the jurisdictional statute, as amended in 1916, they are not such as entitle the carrier to a review of the judgment on a writ of error.\n Writ of error dismissed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See also Meyers v.

The deeds were dated and delivered in Illinois February 28, 1913. A subsequent deed from the Realty Company and a mortgage by its grantee were also declared ineffective, but they need not be separately considered here. Wisconsin Trust Co. v. Munday, 168 Wis. 31, 168 N. W. 393, 169 N. W. 612.\n At the time of the transactions in question the applicable statutory provisions concerning foreign corporations were subsections 2 and 10 of section 1770b, Wisconsin Statutes 1911, which follow:\n'Sec. 1770b. 2. No corporation, incorporated or organized otherwise than under the laws of this state, except railroad corporations, corporations or associations created solely for religious or charitable purposes, insurance companies and fraternal or beneficiary corporations, societies, orders and associations furnishing life or casualty insurance or indemnity upon the mutual or assessment plan, shall transact business or acquire, hold, or dispose of property in this state until such corporation shall have caused to be filed in the office of the secretary of state a copy of its charter, articles of association or incorporation and all amendments thereto duly certified by the secretary of state of the state wherein the corporation was organized. ...\n\n'Sec. 1770b. 10. Every contract made by or on behalf of any such foreign corporation, affecting the personal liability thereof or relating to property within this state, before it shall have complied with the provisions \n\n[252 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n of this section, shall be wholly void on its behalf and on behalf of its assigns, but shall be enforceable against it or them.'\n\n The original proceeding was instituted March 30, 1913. While it was pending in the circuit court the Realty Company complied with section 1770b and obtained a license to do business and hold property in Wisconsin- October, 1915.O n May 11, 1917, the Legislature enacted Chapter 211, Laws of 1917, which amended subsection 1 of section 1770j of the statute to read:\n'Any corporation organized otherwise than under the laws of this state, having acquired, or attempted to acquire, legal title by deed, or lease to any real property in this state, before complying with the terms of section 1770b of the statutes, and which is now not required to comply with said section or which has thereafter, and before the passage of this section, complied with said section, shall be and is hereby relieved from any disability provided in said statute or prohibition therein contained, so far as said section relates to the acquisition and holding of the property so acquired, or attempted to be acquired, and the title so acquired, or attempted to be acquired, is hereby confirmed.'\n\n Plaintiffs in error unsuccessfully challenged the validity of section 1770b upon the ground of conflict with the contract clause, section 10, article 1, of the federal Constitution and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They further insisted that if section 1770j as amended by chapter 211, Laws of 1917, was not so applied as to validate the deeds in question, rights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed to them by the Fourteenth Amendment would be infringed.\n Obviously, no impairment of any federal right resulted from the construction placed upon section 1770j as amended in 1917. Whether that section did or did not validate a contract theretofore unenforceable was a question for the \n\n[252 U.S. 499, 503]\n\u00a0\n state court finally to decide-it involved no right under the Constitution or laws of the United States.\n Section 1770b was enacted prior to the transactions here in question and the settled doctrine is that the contract clause applies only to legislation subsequent in time to the contract alleged to have been impaired. Cross Lake Shooting & Fishing Club v. Louisiana, \n224 \nU.S. 632, 639\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 577.\n In support of the claim that subsection 10, section 1770b as construed by the court below conflicts with the due process clause it is said:\n'The contract between the defendants in error and the Realty Company and the deeds delivered in compliance therewith were all made in Illinois. They have been declared void in the state of Wisconsin. So applied the statute deprives plaintiffs in error of their property without due process of law.'\n\n Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578, 591\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 427, is relied upon as adequate authority to support the point presented; but we think it is wholly irrelevant.\n Where interstate commerce is not directly affected, a state may forbid foreign corporations from doing business or acquiring property within her borders except upon such terms as those prescribed by the Wisconsin statute.

Loomis, of Omaha, Neb ., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant in error brought this action to obtain possession of certain lands, formerly part of the Pottawatomie Indian Reservation and now in Pottawatomie county, Kan., which lie in the margins of the 400-foot strip claimed by it as legal successor to the original grantee. Counsel for plaintiffs in error well say but one question is presented for our determination:\n'Were the lands involved in this action 'public lands' within the meaning of the acts of Congress dated July 1, 1862, and July 2, 1864, granting ar ight of way to the Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad Company and its successors.'\n\n The cause were tried by the court below upon pleadings and agreed statement of facts; and a memorandum states the reasons for judgment favorable to the railroad.\n By the act of July 1, 1862 (12 Stat. 489, c. 120,  2), Congress granted a right of way 'two hundred feet in width on each side of said railroad where it may pass over the public lands' (Stuart v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, \n227 \nU.S. 342, 345\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 338), and declared:\n'The United States shall extinguish as rapidly as may be the Indian titles to all lands falling under the operation of this act and required for the said \n\n[253 U.S. 442, 444]\n\u00a0\n right of way and grants hereinafter made.'\n\n Some amendments added by the act of July 3, 1866 (14 Stat. 79) are not specially important here.\n It is said that under treaties of 1846 and 1861 with the United States (9 Stat. 853; 12 Stat. 1191) the Pottawatomie Reservation was no part of the 'public lands'; moreover that Congress lacked power to grant rights therein to a railroad company.\n In Kindred v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., \n225 \nU.S. 582, 596\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 780, lands in the Delaware Diminished Indian Reservation-east of the Pottawatomies-were declared 'public lands' within the intendment of the right of way clause, act of 1862, although then actually occupied by individual members of the Tribe under assignments executed as provided by treaty. That case renders clear the definite purpose of Congress to treat Indian Reservations, subject to its control, as public lands within the right of way provision. This provision is not to be regarded as bestowing bounty on the railroad; it stands upon a somewhat different footing from private grants, and should receive liberal construction favorable to the purposes in view.

Ct. 11.\n Whether Congress had power to make grants in respect of the lands here involved must be determined upon a consideration of their history.\n November 14, 1862, the railroad company accepted the act of 1862, and during 1865 and 1866 duly constructed its road through the Pottawatomie Reservation-so far as appears, without protest or objection.\n By the treaty of 1846 (article 4) the United States agreed to grant to the Pottawatomie Indians possession and title to a district 30 miles square, on the Kansas river, and to guarantee full and complete possession thereof 'as their land and home forever.' 9 Stat. 854.\n In 1861 the same parties entered into another treaty \n\n[253 U.S. 442, 445]\n\u00a0\n which stipulated (articles 1 and 2) that land within the reservation designated by the treaty of 1846 should be allotted thereafter in severalty to tribal members who had acquired customs of the whites, and desired separate tracts; that the United States' agent should take an accurate census showing those desiring to hold in severalty and those desiring to hold in common, and 'thereupon there shall be assigned, under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,' specified amounts of land 'to include, in every case, as far as practicable, to each family their improvements and a reasonable portion of timber, to be selected according to the legal subdivision of survey.' 'When such assignments shall have been completed, certificates shall be issued by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for the tracts assigned in severalty, specifying the names of the individuals to whom they have been assigned, respectively, and that said tracts are set apart for the perpetual and exclusive use and benefit of such assignees and their heirs.'\n Article 5, treaty of 1861, offered certain privileges to the railroad company which were never accepted; the road was not constructed as provided by the treaty, but under the act of Congress.\n Subsequent to July 1, 1862, a census was duly taken; commissioners, appointed January 16, 1863, made allotments, and in November, 1863, submitted their report. Te Secretary of the Interior, December 12, 1864, approved allotments for the lands now involved to tribal members having improvements thereon before the treaty of 1861, and who had continued to live there. Patents thereto issued at different dates, the earliest being June 14, 1867, without expressly reserving a right of way for the railroad. Plaintiffs in error claim through mesne conveyances from those who received such allotments and patents.\n It seems plain that, at least, until actually allotted in \n\n[253 U.S. 442, 446]\n\u00a0\n severalty (1864) the lands were but part of the domain held by the tribe under the ordinary Indian claim-the right of possession and occupancy-with fee in the United States. Beecher v. Wetherby, \n95 U.S. 517\n, 525. The power of Congress, as guardian for the Indians, to legislate in respect of such lands is settled. Cherokee Nation v. Southern Kansas Railway Co., \n135 \nU.S. 641, 653\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 965; United States v. Rowell et al., \n243 \nU.S. 464, 468\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 425; United States v. Chase, \n245 U.S. 89\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 24.\n The grant of the right of way in 1862, was present and absolute and upon identification of the route, took effect as of the date of the act. All who thereafter acquired public lands took subject to such granted right. Railroad Co. v. Baldwin, \n103 U.S. 426\n, 430. Although parties to the treaty of 1861 contemplated future allotments, it made none. No individual title to any portion of the land arose until allotted, and none was allotted until after 1862\n\n\n Any claim by plaintiffs in error based upon adverse occupancy or possession is precluded by Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Smith, \n171 U.S. 260\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 794; Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Townsend, \n190 U.S. 267\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 671; Northern Pacific Railroad Co. v. Ely, \n197 U.S. 1\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 302; Kindred v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., supra, 597 of 225 U. S., 32 Sup.

CO. v. BOARD OF RAILROAD COM'N OF CAL(1920)\nNo. 401\nArgued: December 12, 1919Decided: January 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 366, 367]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Milton T. U'Ren, of San Francisco, Cal., and D. L. Beard, of Napa, Cal., for appellant.\n Mr. Douglas Brookman, of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appeal from decree of the District Court dismissing bill of appellant, herein called the Electric Company, upon motion of appellees, herein called the Commission.\n The ground of the motion and the decree sustaining it was that it appeared from the averments of the bill that the controversy it stated was res judicata. The bill is long, but the grounds of it can be stated with fair brevity. The Electric Company is a California corporation and has been engaged for more than 10 years in supplying electricity (called in the bill electric energy) for domestic use in the town of St. Helena and vicinity, and the Calistoga Electric Company, also a California corporation, has been for 7 years a distributing agency of the Electric Company and the latter is not as to the Calistoga Company a public utility. By virtue of certain circumstances the Electric Company entered into a contract with one E. L. Armstrong by which it agreed not to extend its lines into Calistoga territory, and Armstrong agreed to buy from it all of the electricity to be sold by him for 18 years. At that time the Electric Company under the \n\n[251 U.S. 366, 368]\n\u00a0\n laws of California had a right to extend its lines and become a competitor of other companies or individuals.\n September 14, 1911, the Calistoga Company became the successor in interest of Armstrong and to his rights and obligations under the contract with the Electric Company, and the Calistoga Company acknowledged the fact of such succession and continued to buy its electricity from the Electric Company at the rates set forth in the contract, until November 18, 1913, when it petitioned the Commission to set aside the contract and compel the Electric Company to accept other rates than those mentioned in the contract.\n The Electric Company answered the petition, set up the contract and alleged that any change in its rates would be a violation of section 10, article 1, of the Constitution of the United States and the Fourteenth Amendment thereto.\n January 24, 1914, the Commission instituted an investigation on its own motion which with the petition of the Calistoga Company was consolidated. The petitions were heard together upon evidence and submitted.\n The Commission subsequently made an order fixing rates much less than those of the contract.\n June 20, 1914, the Electric Company filed a petition for rehearing, setting up its rights under the Constitution of the United States. A rehearing was denied.\n May 1, 1914, the Electric Company and the Calistoga Company entered into an agreement fixing rates subject to the approval of the Commission which the Calistoga Company agreed to secure. It did secure an informal approval of them and paid them until June 27, 1916\n\n\n The rates fixed by the Commission never became effective and therefore the Electric Company did not petition for a review of them by the Supreme Court of the state nor commence proceedings in any court of the United States to enjoin the order establishing them or to have it set aside as null and void. \n\n[251 U.S. 366, 369]\n\u00a0\n June 27, 1916, the Calistoga Company again petitioned the Commission to establish other rates than those fixed in the agreement of that company with the Electric Company. The latter company filed a counter petition to have established the rates fixed in the contract of May 1, 1914 (reduced to writing September 15, 1914), and the petition and that of the Calistoga Company came on to be heard and after evidence adduced the Commission, November 15, 1916, reduced the rates fixed in the written contract of September 15, 1914, and made the reduced rates effective December 20, 1916.\n A rehearing was denied May 24, 1917, and on June 20, 1917, the Electric Company duly filed a petition in the Supreme Court of the state of California praying that a writ of review issue commanding the Commission on a day named to certify to the court a full and complete record of the proceedings before it, the Commission, and that upon a return of the writ the orders and decisions of the Commission be reversed, vacated and annulled upon the ground that they violated the company's rights under the Constitution of the United States, particularly under section 10, article 1, and under section 1 of article 14 of the Amendments thereto. The Supreme Court of California denied the 'petition for writ of review and refused to issue a writ of review, as prayed for in said petition.'\n On or about January 27, 1918, the California Light & Telephone Company became a party to the contracts between the Electric Company and the Calistoga Company by reason of conveyances from the latter company.\n In the present bill it is alleged that the orders and decisions of the Commission were illegal, were in excess of its jurisdiction and that the Electric Company has no adequate remedy at law and prays a decree declaring the orders and decisions null and void, that they be enjoined of enforcement or made the basis of suits against the company to enforce them. \n\n[251 U.S. 366, 370]\n\u00a0\n The Commission and other defendants moved to dismiss on the ground that it appeared from the allegations of the bill that 'the subject-matter thereof was res judicata' and that there was no ground stated entitling the company to the relief prayed. The motion was granted and to the decree adjudging a dismissal of the bill this writ of error is directed.\n The District Court (Judge Van Fleet) based its ruling upon the allegations of the bill that the Electric Company filed in the Supreme Court a petition for a review of the decision and order of the Commission and for their annulment, and that the Supreme Court denied the petition.\n The Electric Company to the ruling of the court opposes the contention that the Supreme Court denied the company's 'petition for a preliminary writ and refused to even cause the record in the case, certified by the Commission to be brought up,' and therefore 'simply refused to entertain jurisdiction of the controversy.' And it is the further contention that the court could neither affirm nor set aside the orders of the Commission until the record was certified to it and the parties were before it and after formal hearing in the matter.\n The contention is based on section 67 of the Public Utilities Act of the state. St. 1911 (Ex. Sess.) p. 18. The section is too long to quote. It is part of the procedure provided by the state for the execution of its policy in regard to the public utilities of the state, and offords a review of the action of the Commission regulating them. It is quite circumstantial and explicit. It provides for a review of the action of the Commission by writ of certiorari or review from the Supreme Court of the state which 'shall direct the commission to certify its record in the case to the court,' the cause to 'be heard on the record of the commission as certified by it.' No other evidence is to be received and the review is confined to an inquiry 'whether the commission has regularly pursued its authority' or \n\n[251 U.S. 366, 371]\n\u00a0\n whether its order or decision 'violates any right of the petitioner under the Constitution of the United States or of the state of California.' The findings and conclusions of the Commission on questions of fact are to be final. The Commission and the parties have the right of appearance and upon the hearing the court 'shall enter judgment either affirming or setting aside the order or decision of the commission.' The Civil Code of the state is made applicable so far as it is not inconsistent with the prescribed proceedings and no court of the state except the Supreme Court to the extent specified shall have jurisdiction over any order or decision of the Commission except 'that the writ of mandamus shall lie from the Supreme Court to the Commission in all proper cases.'\n These provisions counsel insist were not observed and that therefore there was not and could not have been 'an adjudication of the controversy' by the Supreme Court. There was nothing, it is insisted, but the Electric Company's petition before the court, and that none of the essential requirements of section 67 were observed. No writ of review was issued- none certified by the Commission or returned, no return day fixed or hearing had on a certified record, no appearance of the parties, no order of the court affirming or setting aside of the Commission's order. In other words the substance of the contention is that the court instead of hearing refused to hear, instead of adjudicating refused to adjudicate, and that from this negation of action or decision there cannot be an assertion of action or decision with the estopping force of res judicata assigned to it by the District Court.\n Counsel to sustain the position that he has assumed and contends for insists upon a literal reading of the statute and a discussion of the elements of res judicata. We need not follow counsel into the latter. They are \n\n[251 U.S. 366, 372]\n\u00a0\n familiar and necessarily cannot be put out of mind, and the insistence upon the literalism of the statute meets in resistance the common and, at times, necessary practice, of courts to determine upon the face of a pleading what action should be taken upon it. The petition is not in the record. We may presume it was circumstantial in its exposition of the proceedings before the Commission and of the latter's decisions and orders, and exhibited and submitted to the court the questions it was authorized to entertain-whether the Commission 'pursued its authority, including a determination of whether the order or decision' violated 'any right' of the company 'under the Constitution of the United States or of the state of California.'\n Whether upon such an exhibition of the proceedings and questions the court was required to pursue the details of the section or decide upon the petition was a matter of the construction of the section and the procedure under it. And the Supreme Court has so decided. L. Ghriest, Petitioner, v. R. R. Com'n, 170 Cal. 63, 148 Pac. 195; Mt. Konocti Light & Power Co. v. Max Thelen et al., 170 Cal. 468, 150 Pac. 359; E. Clemens Horst Co. v. R. R. Commission, 175 Cal. 660, 166 Pac. 804; Hooper & Co. v. R. R. Comm., 175 Cal. 811, 165 Pac. 689. In those cases the applications for writs of certiorari were denied, which was tantamount to a decision of the court that the orders and decisions of the Commission did not exceed its authority or violate any right of the several petitioners under the Constitution of the United States or of the state of California. And so with the denial of the petition of the Electric Company-it had like effect and was the exercise of the judicial powers of the court. And we repeat, to enable the invocation of such powers was the purpose of section 67, and they could be exercised upon the display in the petition of the proceedings before the Commission and of the grounds upon which they were assailed. And \n\n[251 U.S. 366, 373]\n\u00a0\n we agree with the District Court that 'the denial of the petition was necessarily a final judicial determination, ... based on the identical rights' asserted in that court and repeated here. Williams v. Bruffy, \n102 U.S. 248\n, 255. And further, to quote the District Court:\n'Such a determination is as effectual as an estoppel as would have been a formal judgment upon issues of fact. Calaf v. Calaf, \n232 U.S. 371\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 411; Hart Steel Co. et al. v. Railroad Supply Co., \n244 \nU.S. 294, 299\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 506.'\n\n The court held, and we concur, that absence of an opinion by the Supreme Court did not affect the quality of its decision or detract from its efficacy as a judgment upon the questions presented, and its subsequent conclusive effect upon the rights of the Electric Company. Therefore the decree of the District Court is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","102":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LEAD CO. v. U S(1920)\nNo. 123\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Alexander Britton and Evans Browne, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 140, 142]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States. \n\n[252 U.S. 140, 143]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the difference between the amount of drawback allowed by the government to the appellant, a corporation, as an exporter of linseed oil cake, and the amount to which it claims to be entitled under section 22 of the Act of Congress effective August 27, 1894 ( 28 Stat. 509, 551), which reads as follows:\n'That where imported materials on which duties have been paid are used in the manufacture of articles manufactured or produced in the United States, there shall be allowed on the exportation of such articles a drawback equal in amount to the duties paid on the materials used, less one per centum of such duties. ...'\n\n It is further provided in the section that the drawback due thereon shall be paid to the manufacturer, producer or exporter 'under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe.'\n The appellant imported large quantities of linseed upon which it paid a specific duty of 20 cents per bushel of 56 pounds. This seed, when treated by a simple process, yielded about 20 pounds of linseed oil and about 36 pounds of linseed oil cake, to the bushel. The oil was much more valuable than the oil cake; the latter being composed of the solid substance of the seed and a small amount of oil not recovered, which made it valuable as a feed for stock. It is a by-product, and, except for the small amount of oil in it, would be mere waste.\n Appellant exported large quantities of oil cake, derived from seed which it had imported, and made demand in proper form for the drawback provided for by the act of Congress.\n The law providing for such drawbacks has differed in form of expression from time to time but, since the Act of August 5, 1861 (12 Stat. c. 45, p. 253), it has not differed in \n\n[252 U.S. 140, 144]\n\u00a0\n substance from the Act of 1894, as we have quoted it. The number of articles to which the law is applicable is very great, among them, notably, 'refined sugar and syrup which come from imported raw sugar and refined sugar and syrup which come from imported molasses.'\n The Court of Claims found that:\n'From August 5, 1861, to the present time the practice of the Treasury Department, where several articles are manufactured from the same imported material, has been to calculate and to pay the drawback by distributing the duty paid on the imported material between such articles in proportion to the value and not in proportion to their weight, as well where the imported material paid a specific as well as where it paid an ad valorem duty. Such calculation and payment had been made under Treasury Department regulations.'\n\n The claim of the appellant is that the correct construction of the section, relied upon, requires that the drawback should be computed on the basis of the weights of the oil and oil cake derived by the process of manufacture from the seed, instead of on the basis of the values of the two products, as it was computed by the government, and the question for decision is, whether the department regulation is a valid interpretation of the statute.\n The act quoted provides that where imported materials are used in this country in the manufacture of articles which are exported, a drawback shall be allowed 'equal in amount to the duties paid on the material used,' less 1 per centum. What was the amount of duty paid on the small amount of oil and on the large amount of solid substance, the hull and the fiber, which made up the exported oil cake? Was it substantially two-thirds of the total, determined by weight-on 36 of 56 pounds-or was it about one- fourth of the total as determined by the relative values of the oil and of the oil cake derived from the seed? \n\n[252 U.S. 140, 145]\n\u00a0\n The terms of the provision show that the contingency of having one kind of dutiable material, from which two or more kinds of manufactured products might be derived, is not specifically provided for. Obviously only a part, the least valuable part, of the materials or ingredients of the linseed were used in the making of oil cake, and therefor the problem of determining the 'drawback equal in amount to the duty paid' on the part so used-the solid parts of the seed and the small amount of oil in the oil cake-was not a simple or an easy one.\n The statute, thus indefinite if not ambiguous, called for construction by the department and the regulation adapted to cases such as we have here, commends itself strongly to our judgment.\n It does not seem possible that Congress could have intended that two- thirds of the duty should be returned when one-quarter in value of the manufactured product should be exported; or that the exporter should retain 20 pounds of oil, estimated in the findings as worth about 7 1\/2 cents a pound, derived from each bushel of seed, and recover two-thirds of the duty paid when he exported 36 pounds of seed cake, worth slightly more than 1 cent a pound, derived from the same bushel of seed. Such results- they must follow the acceptance of the appellant's contention-should be allowed only under compulsion of imperative language such as is not to be found in the section we are considering.\n We prefer the reasonable interpretation of the department, which results in a refund of one-quarter of the duty when one-quarter of the value of the product is exported.\n From Edwards v. Darby, 12 Wheat. 206, to Jacobs v. Prichard, Trustee, \n223 U.S. 200\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 289, it has been the settled law that, when uncertainty or ambiguity, such as we have here, is found in a statute, great weight will be given to the contemporaneous construction by department officials, who were called upon to act under the law and to carry its pro \n\n[252 U.S. 140, 146]\n\u00a0\n visions into effect, especially where such construction has been long continued, as it was in this case for almost 40 years before the petition was filed. United States v. Hill, \n120 U.S. 169\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 510.\n To this we must add that the department's interpretation of the statute has had such implied approval by Congress that it should not be disturbed, particularly as applied to linseed and its products.\n The drawback provision, under which the construction complained of originated, continued unchanged from 1861 until the revision of the statute in 1870, and the Court of Claims finds that the rule for determining the drawback on oil cake was applied during the whole of that period of almost ten years. The Tariff Act approved July 14, 1870 (16 Stat. 256, 265, c. 255), expressly provided, in the flaxseed or linseed paragraph, 'that no drawback shall be allowed on oil cake made from imported seed,' and this provision was continued in the Tariff Act of March 3, 1883 (22 Stat. 488, 513), and in the Act of October 1, 1890 (26 Stat. 567, 586). But in the Act of 1894 (28 Stat. 509, 523), the prohibition was eliminated, thus restoring the law on this subject as applied to this material to what it was in substance from 1861 to 1870. United States v. Philbrick, \n120 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 413. During all the intervening 24 years this rule of the department with respect to drawbacks had been widely applied to many articles of much greater importance than linseed or its derivatives, and the practice was continued, linseed included after 1894, until the petition in this case was filed. The re-enacting of the drawback provision four times, without substantial change, while this method of determining what should be paid under it was being constantly employed, amounts to an implied legislative recognition and approval of the executive construction of the statute ( United States v. Philbrick, supra; United States v. G. Falk & Brother, \n204 \nU.S. 143, 152\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 191; United States v. Cerecedo \n\n[252 U.S. 140, 147]\n\u00a0\n Hermanos y Compania, \n209 U.S. 337\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 532), for Congress is presumed to have legislated with knowledge of such an established usage of an executive department of the government (United States v. Bailey, 9 Pet. 238, 256).\n This case would not deserve even the limited discussion which we thus have given it, were it not for the extensive and long-continued application of the regulation of the department to imported and exported materials other than such as are here involved. This specific case is sufficiently ruled by the clear and satisfactory decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, rendered 22 years ago, in United States v. Dean Linseed Oil Co., 87 Fed. 453, 31 C. C. A. 51, in which the Court of Claims found authority for dismissing the plaintiff's petition. The judgment of the Court of Claims is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","103":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK CENT R. CO. v. MOHNEY(1920)\nNo. 196\nArgued: January 27, 1920Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Howard Lewis, John H. Doyle, and Frederick W. Gaines, all of Toledo, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Albert H. Miller, of Toledo, Ohio, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent, whom we shall refer to as the plaintiff, brought suit against the petitioner, defendant, to recover damages for severe injuries which he sustained in a rearend collision on defendant's railroad, which he averred was caused by the gross negligence of the engineer of the \n\n[252 U.S. 152, 153]\n\u00a0\n train following that on which he was a passenger, in failing to look for and heed danger signals, which indicated that the track ahead was occupied. The plaintiff was employed by the defendant as an engineer, with a run between Air Line Junction, at Toledo, and Collingwood, a suburb of Cleveland, wholly within the state of Ohio. As an incident to his employment he was given an annual pass, good between Air Line Junction and Collingwood, which contained the release following:\n'In consideration of receiving this free pass, each of the persons named thereon, using the same, voluntarily assumes all risk of accidents, and expressly agrees that the company shall not be liable under any circumstances, whether of negligence of itself, its agents, or otherwise, for any injury to his or her person, or for any loss or injury to his or her property, and that as for him or her, in the use of this pass, he or she will not consider the company as a common carrier, and liable to him or her as such.\n\n'And, as a condition precedent to the issuing and use thereof, each of the persons named on the face of this pass states that he or she is not prohibited by law from receiving free transportation, and that the pass will be lawfully used.'\n\n Having been informed that his mother had died at her home near Pittsburgh, Pa., the plaintiff, desiring to attend her funeral, applied to the defendant for, and obtained, a pass for himself and wife from Toledo to Youngstown, Ohio, via Ashtabula, and was promised that another pass for himself and wife would be left with the agent of the company at Youngstown, good for the remainder, the interstate part, of the journey to Pittsburgh. But the line of the defendant via Ashtabula to Youngstown was much longer and required a number of hours more for the journey than it did to go via Cleveland, using the Erie Railroad from that city to Youngstown, and for this reason, the record shows, the plaintiff Mohney, \n\n[252 U.S. 152, 154]\n\u00a0\n before leaving home, decided that his wife should not accompany him and that he would make the journey by a train of the defendant, which used its own rails to Cleveland, and from Cleveland to Youngstown used the tracks of the Erie Railroad Company, and at Youngstown returned to the road of the defendant, over which it ran to Pittsburgh. The transportation which he had received via Ashtabula could not be used over the shorter route and therefore the plaintiff presentd his annual pass for transportation from Toledo to Cleveland, intending to pay his fare from Cleveland to Youngstown over the Erie Railroad, leave the train at the Erie station at Youngstown, inquire by telephone as to the time and place of the burial of his mother, and then go to the New York Central station, a half mile away, obtain the pass which was to be left there for him, and go forward to Pittsburgh on the next convenient train.\n The train on which Mohney was a passenger was wrecked between Toledo and Cleveland. It had come to a stop at a station and the second section of the train ran past two block signals, indicating danger ahead, and collided with the rear car of the first section, in which Mohney was riding, causing him serious injury.\n The case was tried on stipulated facts and the testimony of the plaintiff. The trial court concluded that Mohney, at the time he was injured, was on an intrastate journey using an intrastate pass, and that by the law of Ohio the release upon it was void as against public policy. Thereupon, a jury being waived, the court entered judgment in plaintiff's favor.\n The state Court of Appeals, differing with the trial court, concluded that Mohney was an interstate passenger when injured and that the release on the pass was valid, under the ruling in Charleston Western Carolina Railway Co. v. Thompson, \n234 U.S. 576\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 964. But the court went further and affirmed the judgment on two grounds; by a divided \n\n[252 U.S. 152, 155]\n\u00a0\n court, on the ground that the pass was issued to Mohney as part consideration of his employment, and, all judges concurring for the reason that 'we are clearly of the opinion that the negligence in this case, under the evidence, was willful and wanton.' For these reasons it was held that the release on the pass did not constitute a defense to the action.\n The Supreme Court of the state denied a motion for an order requiring the Court of Appeals to certify the record to it for review and the case is here on writ of certiorari.\n The propriety of the use of the annual pass by Mohney for such a personal journey and that the release on it was not valid under Ohio law, were not questioned, and the sole defense urged by the railroad company was, and now is, that his purpose to continue his journey to a destination in Pennsylvania rendered him an interstate passenger, subject to federal law from the time he entered the train at Toledo and that the release on the pass was valid, under \n234 U.S. 576\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 964, supra.\n The three freight cases on which the defendant relies for its contention that the plaintiff was an interstate passenger when injured, all proceed upon the principle that the essential character of the transportation and not the purpose, or mental state, of the shipper determines whether state or national law applies to the transaction involved.\n Thus, in Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 475, the owner's state of mind in relation to the logs, his intent to export them, and even his partial preparation to do so, did not exempt them from state taxation, because they did not pass within the domain of the federal law until they had 'been shipped, or entered with a common carrier for transportation to another state, or had been started upon such transportation in a continuous route or journey.'\n In Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission and Young, \n219 \nU.S. 498, 527\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 279, 288 (55 L. Ed. 310), the cotton seed \n\n[252 U.S. 152, 156]\n\u00a0\n cake and meal, although billed to Galveston, were 'all destined for export and by their delivery to the Galveston, Harrisburg & San Antonio Railway they must be considered as having been delivered to a carrier for transportation to their foreign destination. ... The case, therefore, comes under Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n [6 Sup. Ct. 475].' The mental purpose of Young, and his attempted practice by intrastate billing, was to keep within the domain of the state law, but his contracts, express andi mplied, brought the discrimination complained of in the case within the scope of the Interstate Commerce Act.\n In Ohio Railroad Commission v. Worthington, Receiver, \n225 U.S. 101\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 653, the commission attempted to regulate the rate on 'lake cargo coal,' because it was often billed from the mines to Huron, or other ports within the state; but this court found that the established 'lake cargo coal' rate was intended to apply, and in practice did apply, only 'to such coal as was in fact placed on vessels for carriage beyond the state,' and obviously 'by every fair test, transportation of this coal from the mines to upper lake ports is an interstate carriage.' For this reason the enforcement of the order of the State Commission was enjoined as an attempt to regulate and control interstate commerce. Here again it was the committing of a designated kind of coal to a carrier for transportation in interstate commerce that rendered the federal law applicable.\n To what extent the analogy between the shipments of property and the transportation of passengers may profitably be pressed, we need not inquire, for in this case the only contract between the carrier defendant and the plaintiff was the annual pass issued to the latter. This written contract, with its release, is the sole reliance of the defendant. But that contract in terms was good only between Air Line Junction and Collingwood, over a line of track wholly within Ohio, and the company was charged \n\n[252 U.S. 152, 157]\n\u00a0\n with notice when it issued the pass that the public policy of that state rendered the release upon it valueless. The purpose of the plaintiff to continue his journey into Pennsylvania would have been of no avail in securing him transportation over the Erie Line to Youngstown, for that he must pay the published fare and very surely the release on the pass to Collingwood would not have attached to the ticket to Youngstown. Whether there was a similar release on the pass to Pittsburgh, which Mohney expected to get at Youngstown, the record does not disclose and it is of no consequence whether there was or not. The contract which the defendant had with its passenger was in writing and was for an intrastate journey, and it cannot be modified by the purpose of Mohney to continue his journey into another state, under a contract of carriage with another carrier, for which he would have been obliged to pay the published rate, or by an intended second contract with the defendant in terms which are not disclosed. The mental purpose of one of the parties to a written contract cannot change its terms. Southern Pacific Co. v. State of Arizona, \n249 U.S. 472\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 313. For these reasons the judgment of the trial court was right and should have been affirmed.\n But the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment on two grounds, one of which was that all of the judges were 'clearly of the opinion that the negligence in the case, under the evidence, was willful and wanton.' This court does not weigh the evidence in such cases as we have here, but it has been looked into sufficiently to satisfy us that the argument that there is no evidence whatever in the record to support such a finding cannot be sustained.\n A carrier by rail is liable to a trespasser or to a mere licensee willfully or wantonly injured by its servants in charge of its train ( Commentaries on the Law of Negligence, Thompson,  3307, 3308, and 3309, and the same sections in White's Supplement thereto), and a sound public policy forbids that a less onerous rule should be applied to a \n\n[252 U.S. 152, 158]\n\u00a0\n passenger injured by like negligence when lawfully upon one of its trains. This much of protection was due the plaintiff as a human being who had intrusted his safety to defendants's keeping. Southern Pacific Co. v. Schuyler, \n227 \nU.S. 601, 603\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 277, 43 L. R. A. ( N. S.) 901; Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. v. Maucher, \n248 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 108, 63, L. Ed. 294.\n The evidence in the e cord as to the terms and conditions upon which the pass was issued to the plaintiff is so meager that, since it is not necessary to a decision of the case, we need not and do not consider the extent to which the case of Railroad Co. v. Thompson, \n234 U.S. 576\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 964, is applicable to an employe using a pass furnished to him seemingly as a necessary incident to his employment.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER concur in the result, being of opinion that Mohney was using the annual pass in an interstate journey, and that to such a use of the pass the Ohio law was inapplicable, but that the releasing clause on the pass did not cover or embrace his injury, because the latter resulted from willful or wanton negligence, as to which such a clause is of no force or effect. \n\n\n\n","104":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK SCAFFOLDING CO. v.

The bill contains the usual allegations, and prays for an accounting, for damages, and injunctions, preliminary and final.\n A copy of the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in the suit of the Scaffold Company against Egbert Whitney, expressing the judgment of the court sustaining the validity of the patent and adjudging Whitney to be an infringer of it, is attached to the bill.\n The answer denied invention and sets forth a number of patents as anticipations, among others, a patent to William Murray. A dismissal of the suit was prayed.\n A trial was had upon the issues thus made, which resulted in an interlocutory decree awarding an injunction, adjudging infringement, and an accounting.\n The injunction decreed is as follows:\n'That an injunction be issued under the seal of this court unto the said Chain Belt Company, and the said Egbert Whitney, \n\n[254 U.S. 32, 34]\n\u00a0\n enjoining them, and each of them, their several agents, officers, employes, and all persons in privity with them, and each of them, from making or selling, or causing to be made or sold, the machine known as 'Whitney Scaffold Hoist Machines' and 'Little Wonder' machines, to be used in the combinations of claims 1 and 3 of said U. S. patent No. 959,008, or from using or causing said machines to be used in the combinations of said claims, or from infringing upon said claims in any manner whatsoever.'\n\n The Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that the Henderson patent exhibited invention, expressing the view, however, that, while its advance was slight, it was 'not so wholly wanting in invention or novelty as to justify a finding contrary to the presumptive validity of the grant to him.' The court fortified its views by the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit in New York Scaffolding Co. v. Whitney, 224 Fed. 452, 140 C. C. A. 138, citing, however, to the contrary, the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit, in New York Scaffolding Co. v. Liebel-Binney Construction Co., 243 Fed. 577, 156 C. C. A. 275, the decision we have just affirmed. \n254 U.S. 32\n, 41 Sup. Ct. 21, 65 L. Ed. --.\n The court, however, decided that the decree was 'erroneous in finding infringement in the manufacture or sale or in any use of the Little Wonder machine.' The decree of the District Court was reversed, with directions to enter a decree in accordance with the views expressed.\n The Henderson patent was made the basis of recovery in New York Scaffolding Co. v. Liebel-Binney Construction Co., No. 22, just decided, and there we estimated its inventive quality as tested by the prior art, and as representative of that we took the patent of William Murray, accepting it as an advance upon the prior art.\n We need only add to what was there said that our conclusion is confirmed by Henderson's testimony, which \n\n[254 U.S. 32, 35]\n\u00a0\n we insert in the margin somewhat fully, as it cannot be adequately represented in condensation or by paraphrase. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[254 U.S. 32, 36]\n\u00a0\n From his testimony it is certain that his scaffold did not cause him sleepless nights or laborious days. He was not experienced in the art of which it is an example. It may be that the conceptions of invention cannot be tested by such, or by moments of time, and that originality \n\n[254 U.S. 32, 37]\n\u00a0\n does not need the aid or delay of drudgery; but one is forced to think that, where a change is readily made in any composite instrumentality, the change is not the prompting or product of invention. Indeed, it is a common experience in patent cases that mere mechanical facility can alter or change the form in which originality and merit expressed themselves, and assert for it the claim of invention. This case is an example of such pretension. We may repeat counsel's question, and ask: What did Henderson do that Murray did not do? He made the U-frame which supported the hoising device of continuous metal, instead, as Murray did, of several pieces riveted together, and in the stirrup which it formed he rested the putlogs or beams, loosely making a hinged joint connection between the stirrup and the hoisting machines, with a resulting flexibility. This consequence and its advantage, if it have such,2 it is admitted he did not discern, and naturally. His purpose was evasion. To evasion he was prompted. Beyond what was necessary to that he exerted no vision or conception. He had had no experience in the art, and what knowledge of the Murray scaffolding he had was obtained by a 30 minutes' observation of it in operation. We yield to the assertion of counsel that he cannot be deprived of an advantage because he did not discern it, but the same concession must be given to Murray. He was entitled to all of the benefit that he claimed for his device, or that can be given to it by formal changes.\n It will be observed that the Circuit Court of Appeals and the District Court disagreed in their views of the relation \n\n[254 U.S. 32, 38]\n\u00a0\n of the Little Wonder machine to the Henderson device- the latter considering it an infringement; the former determining otherwise, and to that extent reversing the decree of the District Court. Both courts, however, concurred in ascribing invention to the Henderson device. In this both courts erred, and the decree of the District Court is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to that court, with directions to dismiss the bill of complaint, on the ground that the Henderson patent is invalid; it exhibiting no invention.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] After stating the schools and colleges he had attended, and that he was admitted to the bar in 1910, he testified as follows:\n'Q. 3. Will you state when you first acquired any knowledge of the scaffolding business and how it came about?\n\n'A. The first time I had any occasion to consider scaffolding on buildings was about in February, 1910-February, 1909. I was having dinner with Mr. Merrill, then president of the Noel Construction Company, and I explained to Mr. Merrill a certain gas engine I was designing, attempting to get a patent at that time, and Mr. Merrill, whom I had known while I was at the Academy at Annapolis, put up to me a proposition of scaffolding on the city hall, which the Noel Construction Company was then building in Chicago, and explained to me the great expense of building up a scaffold from the ground, and stated that it was much more convenient and cheaper to scaffold by swinging the scaffold from an overhead outrigger. He said there was such a scaffold in use and being put up by a New York concern, but that the rental charged by the New York concern was prohibitory of its use on the city hall, and said with my mechanical training I ought to be able to devise a means of swinging a scaffold, and instructed me to go ahead and see what I could do.\n\n ...\n'A. This was in February, 1909.'\n\n He further testified that Mr. Merrill called his attention to devices that were then in use in Chicago at the Blackstone Hotel and that shortly after he went down to the hotel.\n He further testified:\n'A. On the north side of the building there was a scaffold suspended by overhead outriggers, cables led down to a drum, the cable passed over a little pulley wheel on the top cross member of the scaffold down to a drum, and the drums were in pairs opposite at right angles to the building. These drums were supported above a U-frame which was held in place, bolted, with two angle irons, the bolts passed through the U-frame, and then the planking were laid along the scaffold on top of the angle irons which was bolted to the U-frames and the drums were operated by means of the ratchet lever, to which the men put a pipe, making an extension, and pumped it up and down.\n\n'Q. 13. Just how were the putlogs supported relative to the U-frame concerning which you have testified? 'A. The putlogs were bolted alongside of the U-frame and the bolts passed through the U-frame.\n\n'Q. 14. Did you see the machines operate? 'A. Yes; the men were laying brick along the scaffold; a couple of laborers hoisted one end of the scaffold.\n\n'Q. 15. So you saw it raised during the time you were there? 'A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. 16. At that time had you done any work on what later developed into your patent in suit? 'A. I had not.'\n\n And further: \n'A. I didn't do anything further until about the middle of May. Mr. Merrill called me up and asked me to come down to the office. I went down, and he asked me if I had a scaffold ready for him, or had any ideas. I told him, 'No; that I had not.' He said, 'I have been depending upon you to design something, and I have got to have something. So he called in Mr. Peterson, the superintendent, took me over to the city hall, and showed me the wall he wanted to scaffold in the court there, and I then went over to Carpenter & Co. and inspected some winches he had there, to see if it was practicable to bolt the winches to wooden putlogs. And, owing to the fact that Carpenter & Co. wanted more money than Merrill could pay, for scaffold, didn't make a deal with him. Then I went home and made up the design for the scaffold that I subsequently applied for a patent on, and took it down to Brown & Williams' attorneys, and asked them if I could get a patent on it. They thought I could. Mr. Merrill said he would have Parker & Carter investigate if there would be no infringement on the winch, and instead of bolting the widlass to the putlog, I found I could utilize pieces of 2x10 around the building for putlogs and place them in the U- frame, and would make the scaffolds easier to put into the building and much simpler to dismantle-to take off.\n\n'Q.--. Where did you get your knowledge of the U-frame being used in this line of work? 'A. I saw U-frames on the Blackstone Hotel. It was just an ordinary stirrup.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] There is a denial of advantage, and it was admitted at the argument that rigidity of the putlog and frame was sometimes resorted to. Counsel tried to minimize the necessity or practice by saying that it was accomplished by a tenpenny nail. Manifestly it was the effect and its necessity or advantage which were important, not the means of their accomplishment, and the necessity or advantage cannot be estimated by the size of the nail. \n\n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNEW YORK SCAFFOLDING CO. v. LIEBEL-BINNEY CONST CO.(1920)\nNo. 22\nArgued: Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Frederick P. Fish, of Boston, Mass., and Frank Chase Somes and C. P. Goepel, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Robert H. Parkinson, and Wallace R. Lane, both of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit for infringement by the Construction Company of a patent dated May 10, 1910, and numbered 959,008, for new and useful improvements in 'scaffold-supporting \n\n[254 U.S. 24, 25]\n\u00a0\n means,' granted to Elias H. Henderson. Petitioner is assignee of the patent.\n An injunction was prayed, accounting of profits, and damages.\n The patent is in the usual form, but a special manner of use of the invention is alleged. It is alleged that, since the acquisition of the patent, petitioner has been largely engaged in different cities of the United States in putting the invention into practice, and the manner thereof has been to construct and lease for use to builders and others, at a specified royalty or price per week, the scaffolds embodying the invention-petitioner retaining the ownership of and title to the scaffolds; they being returned to petitioner upon the completion by the lessees of the work for which the scaffolds had been required.\n The answer of the Construction Company directly put in issue certain of the allegations of the petition. It admitted, however, the use of scaffolds which it purchased from the Eclipse Scaffolding Company of Omaha, Neb., but alleged that such scaffolds did not contain or embody the invention protected by patent No. 959,008, in any way or manner.\n It is also alleged that petitioner, some time prior to February 21, 1914, brought suit in equity in the United States District Court for the District of Nebraska, against one Egbert Whitney, predecessor in title of the Eclipse Scaffolding Company, to the scaffolds sold by the latter company to the Construction Company, in which suit infringement of patent No. 959,008 was alleged.\n In that suit a patent of one William J. Murray was pleaded, but the Scaffolding Company withdrew its case as to that patent, and relied on claims 1 and 3 of the patent to Henderson, and the court decreed that the claims were void for want of invention, and it is alleged that the Construction Company 'is entitled to the protection of said decree.' \n\n[254 U.S. 24, 26]\n\u00a0\n On the issues thus made by bill and answer proofs were taken, and the court decreed against the patent, saying in its opinion that--\n'The Henderson patent has not supplanted others, nor has the influence of its owner been exerted to that end. It barely represents a step in the art. It does not disclose invention.'\n\n And further:\n'In View of the conclusion reached by this court that claims 1 and 3 of the patent in suit are invalid, it is unnecessary to do more than touch upon the matter of infringement. The evidence of infringement is meager, and yet, if the claims of patent in suit were to be held valid, with a range of equivalents, infringement would be found.' 243 Fed. 577, 156 C. C. A. 275.\n\n The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 243 Fed. 577, 156 C. C. A. 275.\n The Construction Company pleaded in defense, as we have said, the decree of the District Court of Nebraska in the suit of petitioner against Egbert Whitney; but that decree was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 224 Fed. 452, 140 C. C. A. 138. The reversal and the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals thereon are much relied on in this suit, and we may say constituted the inducement to issue certiorari. It is seemingly antithetical to the opinion and judgment under review, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit felt and expressed the embarrassment of 'disturbing the force of a decision of a court of co- ordinate jurisdiction,' 'formed upon precisely the same issue and upon substantially the same facts.' The court, however, felt constrained to an 'opposite judgment,' and decided that Henderson made but 'formal changes' in the prior art, which involved no invention, and affirmed the decree of the District Court.\n Necessarily for an estimate of Henderson's patent we must consider the prior art. It is detailed by witnesses, explained by counsel, and illustrated. Specific descriptions are not necessary. We may refer to our own observation of the first forms of scaffolding. To quote \n\n[254 U.S. 24, 27]\n\u00a0\n District Judge Orr:\n'Originally, scaffolding was made to rest upon the ground and was increased in height as the building of the structure demanded.'\n\n The first forms of scaffolding which constituted the prior art are described by a witness as--\n'the thrust-out scaffold, the pull scaffold, the timber scaffold; that they were built right up to the front of the building.'\n\n In 1900, he testified:\n'A new device came on the market, or a new structure, and in place of building up from the ground, they hung a rigid iron frame from the upper stories of the building; that could be used on three or four stories sometimes. It was heavy, inconvenient to handle, and did not meet with very great success, although it did seem an improvement over the old poles. Then there came another form of scaffolding, which was a suspended wire platform scaffold, suspending the wires from the top of the building. ... Then there came the Cavanagh overhead scaffolding machine. ... That machine became fairly well used, after being introduced, and was apparently a great improvement over any other. Then Murray came in the market with his platform machine; a machine operated from the platform, the fastening of the wire that supported the platform being from above, the wire being secured to the outriggers from the upper part of the building. Then the Henderson machine, supported by cables from the upper part of the building, and similar in a great many respects, except that the machines were placed in the opposite position, enabling you to make a scaffold any width, which would seem to be the latest.'\n\n The Murray patent, therefore, is the step in the prior art preceding that made by Henderson, and a comparison of the latter's patent with it, the Murray patent, is imediately indicated.\n Murray describes his invention to be of 'new and useful improvements in adjustable scaffolds.' The object of it, he said, was to provide such a scaffold as would \n\n[254 U.S. 24, 28]\n\u00a0\n 'permit of adjustment at any height during the construction of a building or the repair thereof.' And he claimed:\n'The combination, with two bars having means for detachably securing them to a building, of a platform, frames on said platform carrying means operable from the platform, and having connections adapted to be connected to one of said bars for raising the platform, and supporting means on said frames extending above the said bar, when the platform has been fully raised and adapted to detachably engage said bar and rigidly support the platform therefrom, whereby the platform may be connected to one bar by the raising means and raised to a level to engage the supporting means with said bar, and may then remain supported by said bar, while the other bar is placed at a higher level and the raising means secured to the latter; the bars thus becoming alternately points of raising support and of rigid support for the platforms.'\n\n The following is the illustrative diagram of the claim:\n (This cut appears on page 29 of U.S. Reports)\n Henderson describes his invention as 'certain new and improved scaffold-supporting means,' and further says it relates 'to an improved means for supporting scaffolds used in connection with the construction of buildings and their repair.' In other words, the patent is, as the Murray patent is, for improvement of scaffold-supporting means. And the details given by Murray, or necessarily implied by him, and the inevitable adjuncts 'of crossbeam and floor piece' are made elements in the combinations claimed in three claims. There is a change from the Murray hoisting device, and it is described to consist--\n'of a continuous U-shaped metal bar extending around the under side of and upward from the associated beam. ...'\n\n The continuity of metal is the novel element asserted. Counsel emphasize it, not so much for itself as for what it permits. It permits, according to counsel, a 'hinged or loose jointed connection between the putlog (called in the claims 'crossbeams') and the \n\n[254 U.S. 24, 29]\n\u00a0\n frames that support the putlog and the hoisting mechanism,' and counsel say that this is a 'separate and distinct entity from the elements of the Murray patent, differing in structure, function, and result produced.' And of this it is insisted there was no suggestion in the Murray patent; it containing but a single claim and a \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsingle idea, 'the idea of supporting the scaffold to outriggers by means of auxiliary bars or rods,' so that the platform or scaffold by the lengthening of the cables can be raised to a greater height than before. In other words, the assertion is that Murray invented nothing and saw nothing in his device but means of raising the scaffold, and, to use counsel's word, all other 'functions' were \n\n[254 U.S. 24, 30]\n\u00a0\n beyond his vision. Or again, and to bring out clearly counsel's contention:\n'Henderson did not do what Murray did. Murray provided means for supporting a platform temporarily on one set of outriggers while the cables were being adjusted to a higher set of outriggers. That is all Murray did, and that was embodied in the one claim of the patent, and that is what Henderson did not do. Murray, on the other hand, never suggested the idea of making a hinge or flexible connection between the putlogs and their supporting frames.'\n\n The utility of this construction is the final assertion, and that the continuity of metal of the stirrup adds strength, and the loose jointed connection of the putlogs with it gives 'flexibility longitudinally and transversely of the platform' and 'enables the operator to raise the scaffold machines one at a time, allowing the putlogs to tip or hinge over the support of the U-frame, leaving the machine to stand erect at all times.' The advantage of this is emphasized in various ways, and the construction, it is insisted, quoting the patent 'secures the greatest possible amount of security.'\n Claims 1 and 3 are inserted in the margin. \n1\n The following is an illustration of them taken from brief of counsel:\n (This cut appears on page 31 of 254 U.S. Reports)\n It is further contended that the arrangement of the hoisting device parallel to a building, instead of at right angles \n\n[254 U.S. 24, 31]\n\u00a0\n to it, as in the Murray patent, gives more room to the working masons and mechanics, and therefore contributes to their security. This advantage was asserted in the patent; the others were not, nor displayed or counted on. They, however, may be conceded. The fact of nondisplay in the patent while it does not militate against his claims for the advantages, causes surprise at least, considering the emphasis that is now put upon them, and the assertion that they distinguish and make superior his mechanisms \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n to all that preceded them. However we may concede to counsel, for the sake of the argument, all of the uses and excellencies of the patent, even though not discerned by Henderson; but his pretensions, whether at first hand or second, his or those of his counsel, must be subjected to the test and estimate of the prior art, and, so subjecting them, we can discern no exercise of invention. The changes were simply mechanical, easy to discern and as easy to make, incidental entirely to the main idea of Murray which was as was declared by him to provide a scaffold that would 'permit of adjustment at any height during the construction of a building or the repairing thereof'-a scaffold which might 'be readily moved from one \n\n[254 U.S. 24, 32]\n\u00a0\n position to another by the workmen thereon without interfering materially with the work being performed,' and one 'in which different supports are employed,' and 'in which the shifting from one set of supports to another set' might 'be accomplished without interfering in any degree with the workmen thereon, or their work.' A glance at the diagram which we have given will show that he accomplished his purpose and the way he accomplished it; a glance at the diagram we have given of the Henderson device will show that it is a substantial imitation of Murray's scaffold, the variations being only mechanical. The chief difficulty we have found in the case is the plausibility of the arguments of counsel, and that it secured the assent of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and other courts, and strength from such assent.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] '1.

In reliance upon section 4 of the above act, Mrs. Erskine refused to pay or assent to the payment to the attorneys of an amount greater than 20 per cent. of the appropriation; and the treasury officials were proposing to issue a warrant for 20 per cent. thereof to \n\n[253 U.S. 182, 184]\n\u00a0\n the attorneys and another for the balance to her. Moyers & Consaul insisted that the provision of the act limiting fees of attorneys to 20 per cent. was invalid; and they brought this suit in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia against Mrs. Erskine, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Treasurer of the United States to recover the full 50 per cent. As in McGowan v. Parish, \n237 U.S. 285\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 543, the plaintiffs prayed that they be declared entitled to recover from Mrs. Erskine the amount claimed; that the issuance to and the collection by her of any amount from the government be enjoined; and that either the whole amount be paid into the registry of the court, or that a receiver be appointed who should collect from the government the whole amount and pay therefrom to plaintiffs an amount equal to 50 per cent. of the collection. Mrs. Erskine died soon after the filing of the bill, whereupon Sue Erskine Newman, the administratrix of her estate, was made defendant.\n The Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer moved to dismiss the bill of complaint, among other reasons, on the ground that collection of more than 20 per cent. was prohibited by section 4, and that the limitation thereby imposed was a valid exercise of congressional power. Sue Erskine Newman, as administratrix, moved to dismiss on the same ground, among others. The motions were overruled; and the court entered a decree directing payment of the money into court, ordering that plaintiff recover from the administratrix an amount equal to 50 per cent. of the collection from the government, and directing that this sum be paid out of the funds to be so paid into court. From the decree for plaintiffs entered by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, all the defendants appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia; and when the latter affirmed the decree of the lower court, all the defendants joined in the appeal to this court. The Honorable \n\n[253 U.S. 182, 185]\n\u00a0\n Carter Glass, upon becoming Secretary of the Treasury, was substituted for the Honorable William G. McAdoo; and the further substitution of the Honorable David F. Houston was made when he became Secretary of the Treasury. The appellees now move to dismiss the appeals of the Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States on the ground that neither they nor the government have any pecuniary or other interest in the suit. They also move to dismiss the appeal of the administratrix on the ground that she did not formally enter her appearance in this court nor take any part in the proceedings here.\n The merits of the former motion we have no occasion to consider, for the following reason: Section 4 of the act limited the compensation which the attorneys may collect or receive to 20 per cent. The act is valid. Capital Trust Co. v. Calhoun, \n250 U.S. 208\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 486; Calhoun v. Massie, supra. The plaintiffs were seeking the aid of the courts to recover moneys which an act of Congress prohibited them from collecting or receiving. If the bill had not alleged that this act was invalid, it would have been the duty of the lower court to dismiss the bill even if none of the defendants had raised any objection to the maintenance of the u it. Oscanyan v. Arms Co., \n103 U.S. 261\n, 267; Lee v. Johnson, \n116 \nU.S. 48, 52\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 249; Coppell v. Hall, 7 Wall. 542, 558. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Treasurer of the United States did make such objection. The overruling of it in the courts below was error. The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill as to them.\n The fact that the administratrix did not persist in her appeal should not result in affirmance of the judgment as to her. In Montalet v. Murray, 3 Cranch, 249, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall 'stated the practice of the court to be that, where there is no appearance for the plaintiff in error, the defendant may have the plaintiff called, and \n\n[253 U.S. 182, 186]\n\u00a0\n dismiss the writ of error, or may open the record, and pray for an affirmance.' This practice is still in force under rules 9 and 16 of this court (32 Sup. Ct. vii, ix). Todd v. Daniel, 16 Pet. 521; Hurley v. Jones, \n97 U.S. 318\n; The S. S. Osborne, \n105 \nU.S. 447, 450\n, 451 S.. It is applicable to one of several joint appellants who fails to perfect his appeal. Yates v. Jones National Bank, \n206 \nU.S. 158, 166\n, 181 S., 27 Sup. Ct. 638\n\n\n If the appellee had asked for an affirmance it is clear that it must have been denied because of the illegal purpose of the suit. But the court might go further. Since of its own motion it might dismiss this appeal ( Hilton v. Dickinson, \n108 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 424), and since on dismissing it a mandate to the lower court might issue ( United States v. Gomez, 23 How. 326, 330), this court might also of its own motion entertain the alternative to dismissal spoken of by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall-i. e., open the record. If it did so and perceived that the court was being used to attain an illegal result, there would be power to reverse the decree and remand the cause, with instructions to dismiss the bill. But in the present case such a course is not necessary. The appellees have asked, not for an affirmance, but for a dismissal, of the appeal of the administratrix. A dismissal for want of prosecution will remit the case to the lower court in the same condition as before the appeal was taken; and the lower court will then be free to take appropriate action to prevent itself from being used as an instrument in illegality. United States v. Pacheco, 20 How. 261; United States v. Gomez, 23 How. 326, 339-340.\n Decree reversed as to appellants Houston and Burke, and cause remanded, with directions to dismiss the bill as to them.\n Appeal of Newman, administratrix, dismissed for want of prosecution, and case remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNICCHIA v. PEOPLE OF STATE OF NEW YORK(1920)\nNo. 74\nArgued: November 17, 1920Decided: December 6, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Joseph Nicchia and George P. Foulk, both of New York City, for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Harry G. Anderson, of Brooklyn, N. Y., for the People of State of New York.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error owned two dogs which she harbored within New York City without having obtained the license required by chapter 115, Laws of New York of 1894, as amended by chapter 412, Laws 1895, and chapter 495, Laws 1902. She was charged with violating the statute on November 11, 1916, \n\n[254 U.S. 228, 229]\n\u00a0\n found guilty in the City Magistrates' Court, Brooklyn, and required to pay a fine. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment without opinion.\n Chapter 115 as amended provides:\n'Section 1. Every person who owns or harbors one or more dogs within the corporate limits of any city having a population of over eight hundred thousand shall procure a yearly license and pay the sum of two dollars for each dog. ...\n\n'Sec. 8. The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is hereby empowered and authorized to carry out the provisions of this act, and the said society is further authorized to issue the licenses and renewals, and to collect the fees therefor, as herein prescribed; and the fees so collected shall be applied by said society in defraying the cost of carrying out the provisions of this act and maintaining a shelter for lost, strayed or homeless animals; and any fees so collected and not required in carrying out the provisions of this act shall be retained by the said society as compensation for enforcing the provisions of title sixteen of the penal code and such other statutes of the state as relate to the humane work in which the said society is engaged.\n\n'Sec. 9. Any person or persons, who shall hinder or molest or interfere with any officer or agent of said society in the performance of any duty enjoined by this act, or who shall use a license tag on a dog for which it was not issued, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person who owns or harbors a dog, without complying with the provisions of this act shall be deemed guilty of disorderly conduct, and upon conviction thereof before any magistrate shall be fined for such offense any sum not exceeding ten dollars, and in default of payment of such fine may be committed to prison by such magistrate until the same be paid, but such imprisonment shall not exceed ten days.' \n\n[254 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n The validity of the act was questioned upon the ground that it violates the Fourteenth Amendment, section 1, by 'depriving a citizen of his liberty without due process of law, to wit, the liberty of owning and harboring a dog without procuring a license from and paying a fee therefor to the Society, a private corporation.' In Fox v. Mohawk & H. R. Humane Society (1901) 165 N. Y. 517, 59 N. E. 353, 51 L. R. A. 681, 80 Am. St. Rep. 767, the Court of Appeals declared a statute essentially the same as chapter 115 before the amendment of 1902 invalid under the state Constitution because it appropriated public funds for the use of a private corporation and also because it conferred an exclusive privilege. But the court repudiated the suggestion that the statute deprived dog owners of property without due process or delegated governmental power to a private corporation. Thereafter (1902) the Legislature amended chapter 115 with the evident purpose of meeting objections pointed out in the Fox Case. Thus amended the law has been upheld. Our only concern is with the suggested federal question.\n\n The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals was incorporated by chapter 469, Laws of New York 1866. 'The purpose of the corporation was to enforce the laws enacted to prevent cruelty to animals.' Divis v. American Society, 75 N. Y. 362, 366. It has long been recognized by the Legislature as a valuable and efficient aid toward the enforcement of those laws. New York Penal Law (Consol. Laws, c. 40) art. 16,  196. The payment of public funds to a similar corporation for assistance in enforcing penal statutes has been declared unobjectionable. People ex rel. State Board of Charities v.

Its power to require those who wish to keep dogs to secure licenses from and pay fees to a public officer is also clear. And when the state in the reasonable conduct of its own affairs chooses to entrust the work incident to such licenses and collection of fees to a corporation created by it for the express purpose of aiding in law enforcement, and in good faith appropriates the funds so collected for payment of expenses fairly incurred and just compensation for the valuable services rendered, there is no infringement of any right guaranteed to the individual by the federal Constitution. Such action does not amount to the taking of one man's property and giving it to another, nor does it deprive dog owners of liberty without due process of law.\n The judgment below must be\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","108":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNILES-BEMENT-POND CO. v. IRON MOULDERS' UNION(1920)\nNo. 69\nArgued: October 22, 1920Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Lawrence Maxwell and Murray Seasongood, both of Cincinnati, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Messrs. W. B. Rubin, of Milwaukee, Wis., and Robert J. Shank, of Hamilton, Ohio, for respondent. \n\n[254 U.S. 77, 78]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy involved in this suit originated in a strike by employes of the defendant the Niles Tool Works Company, hereinafter designated the Tool Company, and the sole question presented for decision is one of jurisdiction.\n The petitioner, a corporation of New Jersey, filed its bill in the District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, making the Tool Company, an Ohio corporation, several local labor unions, and many of the striking employes of the Tool Company (in the bill and hereinafter designated 'former employes') parties defendant; it being averred that all of the defendants were citizens of Ohio and residents of the Southern district. The jurisdiction of the court was thus invoked on the ground of diverse citizenship.\n The relief prayed for was an injunction, restraining the striking former employes of the Tool Company from molesting workmen employed by that company to take their places, upon the ground that petitioner had contracts with the Tool Company the performance of which was being delayed by such interference. No case was stated, or relier asked for, against the Tool Company.\n The District Court overruled a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, and granted a preliminary injunction as prayed for, but, on appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals found that the Tool Company was so essentially a subsidiary of the petitioner, and its interest in the controversy was so certainly on the same side, that it should be treated as a plaintiff; that any decision of the case must necessarily so involve rights of the Tool Company as to render it an indispensable party to the case; and that, giving that company its proper classification as a plaintiff resulted in the disappearance of the jurisdictional diversity of citizenship and required the dismissal of the bill, which was \n\n[254 U.S. 77, 79]\n\u00a0\n ordered. The case was brought here for review by writ of certiorari.\n The facts essential to be considered, which were stipulated or sufficiently proved on the hearing of the application for an injunction, may be epitomized as follows:\n The petitioner was a corporation of New Jersey, the defendant Tool Company a corporation of Ohio, the petitioner owned a controlling interest in the capital stock of the Tool Company, and the same men were president and vice president, respectively, of both companies. The president was invested with authority to fix prices for the two companies, three of the five directors of the Tool Company were directors of the petitioner, and more than 95 per cent. of the business of that company was obtained through the petitioner, acting as its general sales agent. The customary mode of transacting business between the two companies was for the petitioner to make contracts for machinery, which it passed to the Tool Company for manufacture and delivery.\n Before the filing of the bill the petitioner had entered into many contracts with the United States government to furnish it, as quickly as possible, with machinery, tools, and equipment for arsenals and for navy and ship yards, all of which contracts were necessary for the successful prosecution of the war, and were to be given priority over other work. These contracts had been passed to the Tool Company for manufacture; the petitioner remaining liable for their performance. It was averred, and sufficiently proved, that the defendants other than the Tool Company had conspired together, for the purpose of hindering, delaying, and preventing the petitioner from performing, through the Tool Company, the contracts thus obtained by it from the government, and for the purpose of intimidating workmen in the employ of the Tool Company by threats, violence, and coercion, when going to and from their places of work and when at their homes. \n\n[254 U.S. 77, 80]\n\u00a0\n Such defendants, assembled about the plant of the Tool Company, had at times by threats and violence prevented employes from entering its factory to work, and had threatened to prevent, and unless restrained would have prevented, that company from freely carrying forward its business, and thereby the petitioner from fulfilling its contracts with the government and with others.\n On this record the questions presented for decision are: Was the Tool Company an indispensable party to the suit? and, properly classified, should it be treated as a plaintiff? If these questions are both answered in the affirmative, the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be affirmed; otherwise, it must be reversed.\n There is no prescribed formula for determining in every case whether a person or corporation is an indispensable party or not; but a rule early announced and often applied by this court is sharply applicable to the case at bar. In Shields v. Barrow, 17 How. 130, 139, this language-quoted with approval in Barney v. Baltimore City, 6 Wall. 280, 284, and again in Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank, &c. Co., \n215 \nU.S. 33, 48\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 10-was used to describe parties so indispensable that a court of equity will not proceed to final decision without them, viz.:\n'Persons who not only have an interest in the controversy, but an interest of such a nature that a final decree cannot be made without either affecting that interest, or leaving the controversy in such a condition that its final termination may be wholly inconsistent with equity and good conscience.'\n\n The case we are considering is essentially one on the part of the petitioner to protect from interference by striking former employes of the Tool Company the contract which that company had with the men employed by it to take their places. Petitioner's claim of right, the validity of which we are not called upon to determine, is rested wholly upon the contract of the Tool Company with its \n\n[254 U.S. 77, 81]\n\u00a0\n employes, and the character and construction of that contract of employment must inevitably be passed upon in any decision of the case, and obviously, if the petitioner should fail in such a suit as this, with the Tool Company not a party, any decree rendered would not prevent a relitigating of the same questions in the same or in any other proper court, and it would settle nothing.\n Thus, if the Tool Company be considered as having any corporate existence whatever separate from that of the petitioner, it must have an interest in the controversy, involved in such a case as we have here, of a nature such that a final decree could not be made without affecting that interest, and perhaps not without leaving the controversy in a condition wholly inconsistent with that equity which seeks to put an end to litigation by doing complete and final justice, and therefore it must be concluded that it was an indispensable party, within the quoted longestablished rule.\n Plainly the appellant was not mistaken when it made the Tool Company a party to the suit. But making it a party defendant could not give to the District Court jurisdiction against the objection of another party, or over the court's own scrutiny of the record, unless there existed a genuine controversy between it and the plaintiff, the petitioner. Judicial Code,  24 (Comp. St.  991). That there was not and could not be any substantial controversy, and 'collision of interest,' between the petitioner and the Tool Company, is of course obvious from the potential control which the ownership of stock by the former gave it over the latter company, and from the actual control effected by the membership of the boards of directors and by the selection of executive officers of the two companies, which have been described.\n Looking, as the court must, beyond the pleadings, and arranging the parties according to their real interest in the dispute involved in the case, Dawson v. Columbia, &c., Trust \n\n[254 U.S. 77, 82]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n197 \nU.S. 178, 180\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 420, Steele v. Culver, \n211 \nU.S. 26, 29\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 9, it is clear that the identity of interest of the Tool Company with the petitioner required that the two be aligned as plaintiffs, and that, with them so classified, the case did not present a controversy wholly between citizens of different states, within the jurisdiction of the District Court. Coal Co. v. Blatchford, 11 Wall. 172; Hooe v. Jamieson, \n166 U.S. 395\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 596\n\n\n The allegations of the bill that the contracts which the petitioner had with the United States government were of a character which must be given priority under section 120 of the National Defense Act, approved June 3, 1916 (39 Stat. pp. 166, 213 [Comp. St.  3115g, 3115f, 3115h]), and that they involved interstate commerce, are much too casual and meager to give serious color to the claim now made that the cause of action asserted is one arising under the laws of the United States. The contention is an afterthought, and plainly was not in the mind of the writer of the bill of complaint.\n It results that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be affirmed.\n Appeal dismissed, petition for writ of certiorari granted, and decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","109":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHERN PAC R.

King, of Atlanta, Ga., and Mr. La Rue Brown, of Boston, Mass., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the following opinion, concurred in by the CHIEF JUSTICE and Justices BRANDEIS and CLARKE.\n These are claims for compensation for carrying the mails above the amounts allowed and paid by the Postmaster General. The four cases are independent of one another, \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 329]\n\u00a0\n but as the claims all depend for their validity upon a denial of the Postmaster General's power to pass a certain order they may be considered together. They were rejected by the Court of Claims. The question shortly stated is this: The pay for carrying the mails is determined by the average weight carried. To ascertain this average the mails are weighed for a certain number of consecutive days, and for some time before 1907 the total weight was divided by the number of working days-if the number of days was thirty-five it was divided by thirty, if one hundred and five by ninety. But on June 7, 1907, the Postmaster General issued an order, No. 412, 'that when the weight of mail is taken on railroad routes the whole number of days included in the weighing period shall be used as a divisor for obtaining the average weight per day.' This of course diminishes the average weight and therefore the pay of the railroads. They deny the authority of the Postmaster General to make the change and sue for the additional sum that under the old practice they would have received.\n The texts to be discussed begin with an Act of 1873, but it should be observed as furnishing a background for that and the following statutes that from the beginning of the Government the Postmaster General, as the head of a great business enterprise always has been entrusted, as he must be, with a wide discretion concerning what contracts he should make, with whom and upon what terms. It is needless to go into the early statutes or to do more than to refer to Rev. Stat.  3999 (Comp. St.  7478), which authorizes him to make other arrangements if he cannot contract for the carriage of the mail upon a railway route at a compensation not exceeding the maximum rates then established, or for what he deems reasonable and fair. The limitations upon the power were in the interest of the business, the principal one being that the pay per mile per annum should not exceed certain rates. Act of June 8, 1872, c. 335,  221, \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 330]\n\u00a0\n 17 Stat. 283, 309, Rev. St.  3998, and section 4002 (Comp. St.  7483). The language plainly showed and the decisions have established that the Postmaster General if it seemed to him reasonable, could refuse to pay the maximum and insist upon some lesser rate as a condition of dealing with a road. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Railway Co. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 640, 649\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 702\n\n\n The Act of March 3, 1873, c. 231, 17 Stat. 556, 558, appropriates five hundred thousand dollars, or so much thereof as may be necessary, 'for increase of compensation for the transportation of mails on railroad routes upon the conditions and at the rates hereinafter mentioned.' Then, after providing for due frequency and speed and suitable accommodations for route agents-matters on which obviously the Postmaster General is the person to be satisfied-it enacts that 'the pay per mile per annum shall not exceed the following rates, namely: On routes carrying their whole length an average weight of mails per day of two hundred pounds, fifty dollars; five hundred pounds, seventy-five dollars,' &c., &c. So far it will be seen that although the object is to permit an increase of compensation still the discretion of the Postmaster General under the earlier acts remains and that he could decline to pay the maximum rates however ascertained, or any sum greater that he should deem reasonable. It is argued, to be sure, that the rates were fixed at the maximum, and the Act of July 12, 1876, c. 179, 19 Stat. 78, 79, reducing the compensation 'ten per centum per annum from the rates fixed and allowed' is thought to help the conclusion. But no argument can obscure the meaning of the words 'shall not exceed.' The rates were fixed and reduced in their maxima but that was all that was done with regard to them. United States v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 451, 454\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 325. The question is whether for any reason the control over the compensation thus undeniably given to him \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 331]\n\u00a0\n without imposing any downward limit as to the money rates, is wholly withdrawn from his judgment in the preliminary stage of determining the basis to which the money rates are to be applied.\n The next words of the statute are: 'The average weight to be ascertained in every case by the actual weighing of the mails for such a number of successive working days, not less than thirty, at such times,' & c., 'and the result to be stated and verified in such form and manner as the Postmaster General may direct.' The pay it will be remembered was to be per mile per annum, and as it was not practicable to weigh all the mails throughout the year and so to find out the total actual weight of the mails and the exact number of miles that they were carried in the year, the result had to be arrived at approximately by finding the average weight carried on days assumed to resemble the other days of the 365. The average to be reached was not an average for the thirty days but an average weight per day for the year. This interpretation is shown to be the understanding of Congress by the Act of July 12, 1876, c. 179, 19 Stat. 78, 79, which reduces the compensation ten per centum per annum from the rates fixed and allowed by the Act of 1873 'for the transportation of mails on the basis of the average weight.' This must mean the average weight for the year concerned. Again by the Act of March 3, 1905, c. 1480, 33 Stat. 1082, 1088, 'the average weight (i. e., of course, the average weight for the year) shall be ascertained by the actual weighing of the mails for such a number of successive working days not less than ninety,' & c., the increase in the number of days manifestly being for the purpose of more nearly hitting the average for the whole time. The statutes do not mention the divisor to be used in order to get the average desired. In 1873 mails were not carried on Sundays except over a comparatively small proportion of routes and therefore six was the fairest single divisor. \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 332]\n\u00a0\n Now, on the other hand, it is said that the mileage of the seven-day routes is much greater than that of the six days. Therefore now to weigh for Sundays as well as other days and to divide by seven, is the fairest single rule that can be found.\n But it is said that when an average is directed to be reached by weighing for say thirty working days it is implied that you are to get the average by using the number of working days on which the mails were weighed as a divisor, that working days mean week days, and that if in fact Sundays are used as working days, the divisor is not affected because the statute only contemplated six for a week. But the supposed implication of the statute disappears when it is remembered that the average wanted is not the average for the weighing days only but the average for the year. It is plain too that, whether 'working days' be read to mean week days or the days on which work was done in fact, the statute contemplates the working days and the weighing days as identical and therefore affords no ground for demanding the advantage of a dividend of seven and a divisor of six, which is what the railroads want.\n Various make-weights are thrown in to help the construction desired by the roads but they seem to us insufficient to change the result that is reached by reading the words. It is said that down to 1907 the Post Office Department construed the acts of 1873 and after as entitling the railroads to the maximum rates for full service as defined and to the minimum divisors and that this construction must be taken to have been adopted in silence, by the later statutes. But the exercise of power in the way deemed just while the conditions stated to have existed in and after 1873 continued was not a construction but the exercise of discretion in determining the amount of pay-a discretion which, as we have seen, undeniably was given in the form of a right to regulate \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 333]\n\u00a0\n rates, and which therefore there could be no reason for withholding, beyond the express words of the act, at the other end. It is true that in 1884 an Assistant Attorney General gave an opinion that any departure from the practice would defeat the intention of the law and cause no little embarrassment and that thereafter an order made by a previous Postmaster for taking the number of weighing days as the divisor was revoked. But the letter of the Postmaster General thus answered merely stated what had been the practice as to the divisor and asked whether it was in violation of law. It did not state that the Post Office considered itself bound to follow that way. The order that was revoked only purported to affect seven- day routes and is of little or no importance to the question before us now.\n It is said that the rate was fixed by the Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2513, 34 Stat. 1205, 1212, if not before, by a reduction to 'five per centum less than the present rates' on certain routes. But as we have stated we understand this to mean a reduction of the rates fixed by statute, that is the maximum rates. We do not understand it to refer to rates specifically allowed. It is not likely that Congress considered the latter in detail.\n Finally much is made of the fact that before the passage of the Act of March 3, 1905, and again before the passage of the Act of March 2, 1907, provisos were stricken out that in effect required the divisor to be the number of the weighing days. A similar thing happened before the passage of the act making appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1909. We do not go into the particulars of these matters because whatever may have been said by individuals the provisos might as well have been rejected for the purpose of leaving the choice between the two divisors to the judgment of the Postmaster General as for any other reason. On the other hand we are not disposed to lay much stress on the fact \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 334]\n\u00a0\n that the appropriations by Congress accepted the Postmaster General's estimates even when it had been notified that the Railroads were dissatisfied with Order No. 412. The Act of March 3, 1875, c. 128, 18 Stat. 340, 341, ordered the Postmaster General to have the weighing done thereafter by the employes of the Post Office Department, and to 'have the weights stated and verified to him by said employes under such instructions as he may consider just to the Post Office Department and the railroad companies.' Possibly this might be construed to recognize the power now in dispute but this suggestion also we are content to leave on one side. We also leave unconsidered the great difficulties that the Railroads encounter in the effort to show that their conduct did not amount to an acceptance of the Postmaster General's terms within the decision in New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States, Dec. 8, 1919, \n251 U.S. 123\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 67, 64 L. Ed. --. The construction of the statutes disposes of all the cases without the need of going into further details.\n Judgments affirmed.\n Mr. Justice DAY and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER dissent. Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the decision of the cases.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY, with whom concurred Mr. Justice McKENNA.\n I concur in the affirmance of the judgments of the Court of Claims in these cases, but upon grounds somewhat different from those expressed in the opinion of Mr. Justice HOLMES.\n All the claims arose under the law as it stood after the Act of March 2, 1907 (chapter 2513, 34 Stat. 1205, 1212), and before that of July 28, 1916 (chapter 261, 39 Stat. 412, 429), by which the carriage of mail matter by the railways was made compulsory. The Act about which the prin cipal \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 335]\n\u00a0\n controversy turns is that of March 3, 1873 (chapter 231, 17 Stat. 556, 558 ), the disputed portion of which was carried into section 4002, Rev. Stat. U. S. By it the Postmaster General was 'authorized and directed to readjust the compensation hereafter to be paid for the transportation of mails on railroad routes upon the conditions and at the rates hereinafter mentioned: ... Second. That the pay per mile per annum shall not exceed the following rates, namely: On routes carrying their whole length an average weight of mails per day of two hundred pounds, fifty dollars; ... five thousand pounds, two hundred dollars, and twenty-five dollars additional for every additional two thousand pounds, the average weight to be ascertained, in every case, by the actual weighing of the mails for such a number of successive working days, not less than thirty, at such times, ... and not less frequently than once in every four years, and the result to be stated and verified in such form and manner as the Postmaster General may direct.'\n In my opinion, the rates of pay per mile per annum were maximum rates, and the Postmaster General had a discretion to contract at less if the railroads agreed; but under section 210 of the Act of June 8, 1872 ( chapter 335, 17 Stat. 283, 309; Rev. Stat. U. S.  3997), he was under a duty to arrange the routes into classes according to the size of the mail, and the speed, frequency, and importance of the service, 'so that each railway company shall receive, as far as practicable, a proportionate and just rate of compensation, according to the service performed.'\n But I think that in the clause 'the average weight to be ascertained, in every case, by the actual weighing of the mails for such a number of successive working days, not less than thirty,' etc., the words 'successive working days,' by proper interpretation mean successive week days; and since the aggregate weight for the weighing period must be subjected to division in order to ascertain the \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 336]\n\u00a0\n average weight per day, it naturally follows that the divisor should be the same number of 'working days' (that is, week days) that are included in the period. The previous history of the mail service shows abundant reason for this, and for more than thirty years thereafter the provision was uniformly so construed by the Department. Upon a large number of the railway routes, mails were carried six days each week, none being carried on Sunday; while on other routes they were carried on every day in the week. The aggregate weight of mails carried was not affected by the frequency of the service, since the six-day routes carried the Sunday accumulations on Mondays. This explains why a certain number of 'working days' (week days) was made the measure of the weighing period, and at the same time shows that the week-day divisor was necessary in order to deal equitably with both the six-day and the seven-day routes. From the passage of the act of 1873 down to the promulgation of Order No. 412 in the year 1907, the practice of the Department was in accord with the above interpretation. It was explained in a communication from the Postmaster General to the Senate January 21, 1885 (Senate Ex. Doc. No. 40, 48th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 68):\n'The present rule is, on those roads carrying the mails six times a week, to weigh the mails on thirty consecutive days on which the mails are carried, which would cover a period of thirty-five days; dividing the aggregate thirty weighings by thirty will give the daily average. On those roads carrying the mails seven times per week the weighing is done for thirty-five consecutive days (including Sundays) and the aggregate divided by thirty for a basis of pay. It is evident that the period during which the weighing is continued covers, in both cases, all the mails carried for thirty-five days. If, in the second case, we should take our basis from an average obtained by dividing the aggregate weight by thirty-five we should commit the absurdity of putting a \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 337]\n\u00a0\n premium upon inefficiency, for evidently if the Sunday train were cut off we should virtually have the same mails less frequently carried, and therefore with a higher daily average, and therefore a higher pay basis than in the case where the seventh train was run and the greater accommodation rendered. The present method gives no additional pay for the additional seventh train, but the other method would cause a reduction on account of better service, and practically would operate as a fine on all those roads carrying the mails daily, including Sunday.'\n\n The Act of March 3, 1905 (chapter 1480, 33 Stat. 1082, 1088), changed the minimum weighing period so as to require the inclusion of at least ninety, instead of thirty, successive working days, but made no other change. Under this act 105 calendar days necessarily were included in the weighing period in order to take in 90 successive working days. In my opinion, this act, like that of 1873, by fair construction required that the week-day divisor be employed. And so it was officially construed until 1907.\n But, while I regard this method of determining the average weight to have been prescribed, and not left to the discretion of the Postmaster General, still I think the statute in this respect was only directory, and not mandatory. Considering the provision in its relation to the context and subjectmatter, it will be seen to be but an aid to the making of fair contracts within the maximum rates allowed, and an aid to the Postmaster General in fixing the rate of compensation upon land grant routes, and in so arranging routes that each railway company shall receive a proportionate and just rate of compensation according to the service performed. Hence it seems to me that a failure strictly to comply with the prescribed method of ascertaining the average weight did not of itself render the action of the Postmaster General ultra vires and void. \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 338]\n\u00a0\n The principal controversy in the present cases is over his Order No. 412 (June 7, 1907), which provided:\n'That when the weight of mail is taken on railroad routes the whole number of days included in the weighing period shall be used as a divisor for obtaining the average weight per day.'\n\n While I regard it as embodying an erroneous view of the statute, this is not sufficient, in my opinion, to vitiate a contract voluntarily made by a railway mail carrier based upon a calculation of average weight made and known to have been made in conformity with the order. All the present claims originated after the promulgation of the order, and arose out of the carriage of mails under arrangements made with the Postmaster General after express notice of its provisions.\n It is contended that, although the act of 1873 (Rev. Stat. U. S.  4002 [Comp. St.  7483]), in providing that the pay per mile per annum should 'not exceed' the specified rates, conferred upon the Postmaster General a discretion to pay less rates, this was modified by the language of the Act of July 12, 1876 (chapter 179, 19 Stat. 78, 79), which reduced the compensation 10 per centum from 'the rates fixed and allowed ... [by the act of 1873] for the transportation of mails on the basis of the average weight'; by that of the Act of June 17, 1878 (chapter 259, 20 Stat. 140, 142), where, however, the expression is, 'by reducing the compensation to all railroad companies for the transportation of mails five per centum per annum from the rates for the transportation of mails, on the basis of the average weight fixed and allowed,' etc.; or by the provision of the Act of March 2, 1907 (chapter 2513, 34 Stat. 1205, 1212), readjusting compensation on railroad routes carrying an average weight per day exceeding 5,000 pounds, 'by making the following changes in the present rates per mile per annum for the transportation of mail on such routes, and hereafter the rates on such routes shall be as follows,' etc. I am not convinced that these amendments, or any of them, had \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 339]\n\u00a0\n the effect of impliedly repealing that part of the act of 1873 (Rev. Stat. U. S.  4002) 'shall not exceed,' etc., from which alone, in my view, the Postmaster General derived any serviceable discretion about readjusting the compensation.\n Therefore he still had liberty of action within the maximum rates prescribed. And the railroad companies, other than such as had been aided by grants of lands or otherwise, were free to carry the mails at rates offered, or refuse them, as they chose. Eastern R. R. Co. v. United States, \n129 \nU.S. 391, 396\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 320; Atchison, T. & S. F. Ry. v. United States, \n225 \nU.S. 640, 650\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 702; Delaware, L. & W. R. R. Co. v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 385, 388\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 348; New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. United States (December 8, 1919) \n251 U.S. 123\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 67, 64 L. Ed. --.\n Furthermore, by section 212 of the Act of June 8, 1872 (chapter 335, 17 Stat. 283, 309; Rev. Stat. U. S.  3999), if, because of the refusal of the railway companies, the Postmaster General was unable to make contracts at a compensation 'not exceeding the maximum rates,' or for what he deemed a reasonable and fair compensation, he was at liberty to use other means of carriage.\n From the findings of the Court of Claims it appears that in all of these cases there were express contracts; and I concur in the view of that court (53 Ct. Cl. 258, 308, 315, 318, 319) that the contracts arose, not out of the Distance Circular, in which the Postmaster General specially called notice to Order No. 412, and to which some of the claimants responded with protests, more or less explicit, that they would not be bound by that order, but arose out of what subsequently happened. The Postmaster General in every case informed the protesting carriers that he would not enter into contract with any railroad company excepting it from the operation of any postal law or regulation. The mails were weighed and the average weight ascertained in accordance with Order No. \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 340]\n\u00a0\n 412, as all the claimants had been notified would be done; thereafter the Postmaster General, upon the basis of the weight thus ascertained, caused the maximum statutory rate to be calculated, issued orders naming certain amounts thus arrived at as the compensation for the service, and gave notice in proper form to the carriers specifying in terms the readjusted pay that would be allowed, 'subject to future orders and to fines and deductions.' Thereafter the carriers received and transported the mails as offered, periodically accepted compensation in accordance with the readjustment notices, and proceeded thus without further objection or protest until the end of the respective quadrennial periods. In short, although in some cases they declared they would not consent to the ascertainment of average weights on the basis of Order No. 412, they did not insist upon their objection in the face of the Postmaster General's declaration that he would not accede to it. Had they refused to carry the mails on the terms proposed, he might have exercised his discretion as to the rate of pay per mile, so that, instead of agreeing to give them, as he did, the maximum pay based on the average weight ascertained under Order No. 412, he might have acceded to their contention by employing the week- day divisor, but have carried into effect his own view as to the amount that ought to be allowed by reducing the rate of pay per mile Or, as already shown, he might have refused to make the contracts and have proceeded under section 3999.\n I deem it clear, therefore, that the claimants in fact accepted the Postmaster General's offers as contained in the readjustment notices, by proceeding to perform the prescribed service in accordance therewith and accepting the compensation due to them therefor. And so the Court of Claims held (53 Ct. Cl. 258, 308, 313, 315, 318, 319).\n Some of the routes of the Seaboard Air Line and of the Northern Pacific Railway Company were over lines that had been aided by government land grants, and hence \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 341]\n\u00a0\n were subject to provisions of law summed up in section 214 of the Act of June 8, 1872 (Rev. Stat. U. S.  4001 [Comp. St.  7482]), by which they were obliged to 'carry the mail at such prices as Congress may by law provide; and, until such price is fixed by law, the Postmaster General may fix the rate of compensation.' The Seaboard Air Line makes no point of this; but in behalf of the Northern Pacific it is contended that claimant, not being in the position of a free agent, ought not to be regarded as having voluntarily accepted the terms proposed by the Postmaster General. But the effect of the findings is that it did so accept; and this result cannot be overturned by raising an argument about the circumstances that went to make up the evidence upon which the findings were based, and the present contention amounts to no more than this.\n Were it otherwise, nevertheless it appears that Congress had not provided the compensation for the land grant routes, except that it had authorized and directed the Postmaster General to readjust all railway mail pay in the manner set forth in section 4002 and within the maxima prescribed therein and in the amendatory acts of 1876, 1878, and 1907, above mentioned, and had provided by section 13 of the Act of July 12, 1876 (chapter 179, 19 Stat. 78, 82 [Comp. St.  7485]), 'That railroad companies whose railroad was constructed in whole or in part by a land grant made by Congress on the condition that the mails should be transported over their road at such price as Congress should by law direct shall receive only eighty per centum of the compensation authorized by this Act,' besides other legislation concerning the land grant routes that may be referred to, but need not be recited. Acts of March 2, 1907 ( chapter 2513, 34 Stat. 1205, 1212); May 12, 1910 (chapter 230, 36 Stat. 355, 362); July 28, 1916 (chapter 261, 39 Stat. 412, 426). Assuming, therefore, that there was no contract affecting the land grant lines of the Northern Pacific, their compensation must be at the rate fixed by the Postmaster General in the exercise \n\n[251 U.S. 326, 342]\n\u00a0\n of the power and discretion conferred upon him by this legislation; and so long as he exercised this power and discretion reasonably, not fixing a noncompensatory rate or otherwise acting arbitrarily, the carrier was concluded by his action. There is no finding that he acted arbitrarily; on the contrary, he had in support of Order 412 a considered opinion of the Attorney General under date September 27, 1907 (26 Ops. Atty. Gen. 390); and, so far as appears, he treated the land grant routes like others, not reducing them below the 80 per centum contemplated by section 13 of the act of 1876, or otherwise violating the statutes. There is no finding nor any contention that the amounts allowed them were not compensatory; and, upon the whole, it seems to me that, although he erred in failing to apply the week-day divisor to the weighings, this did not render the readjustment based thereon wholly void, or permit the carrier, after transporting the mails and accepting the stated compensation without further objection, afterwards to treat the readjustment orders as nullities.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA concurs in this opinion. \n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTHWESTERN MUT LIFE INS CO. v. JOHNSON(1920)\nNo. 70\nArgued: Decided: November 15, 1920\n\n\n\n [In No. 70:\n Mr. George Lines, of Milwaukee, Wis., for Northwestern Mut. Life Ins. co.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 96, 99]\n\u00a0\n Mr. S. F. Prouty, of Des Moines, Iowa, for Johnson.\n In No. 71:\n Mr. George B. Young, of Montpelier, Vt., for National Life Ins. Co.\n Mr. S. F. Prouty, of Des Moines, Iowa, for Miller.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are suits upon policies issued to George P. Johnson upon his life, payable in the first case to his wife, in the second to his executors or administrators. The wife and the administrator respectively recovered in the District Court and the cases having gone to the Circuit Court of Appeals the latter has certified certain questions to this court. The policy payable to the wife contained a provision that--\n'if within two years from the date hereof, the said insured shall ... die in consequence of a \n\n[254 U.S. 96, 100]\n\u00a0\n duel, or shall, while sane or insane, die by his own hand, then, and in every such case, this policy shall be void.'\n\n Johnson, the insured, died by his own hand more than two years after the date of the policy. The first question put in the wife's suit is whether the above provision, there being no other in the policy as to suicide, makes the insurance company liable in the event that happened. The second is in substance whether the contract if construed to make the company liable is against public policy and void.\n The policy payable to the administrator had no provision as to suicide but did agree that--\n'This contract shall be incontestable after one year from the date of its issue, provided the required premiums are duly paid.'\n\n Johnson's suicide was more than a year after the date of the policy. The first question propounded is whether the above provision prevents the insurer from denying liability in this case, it not appearing that Johnson was insane when he killed himself. The second is whether such a contract which makes no exception for death resulting from suicide is against public policy, and therefore void. There is a third as to a possible distinction between insurance payable to the wife and that payable to the estate of the insured which will not need to be discussed.\n The public policy with regard to such contracts is a matter for the states to decide. Whitfield v. AEtna Life Insurance Co., \n205 \nU.S. 489, 495\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 578. This case qualifies the statement in Ritter v. Mutual Life Ins. Co., \n169 \nU.S. 139, 154\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 300, to the effect that insurance on a man's own life payable to his estate and expressly covering suicide committed by him when sane would be against public policy. The point decided was only that when the contract was silent there was an implied exception of such a death. There was evidence that the insurance was taken out with intent to commit suicide, and it plainly appeared \n\n[254 U.S. 96, 101]\n\u00a0\n that the act was done by the insured for the purpose of enabling his estate to pay his debts. The application, although excluded below, warranted against suicide within two years, within which time the death took place. So that all the circumstances gave moral support to the construction of the policy adopted by the court in accordance with the view that has prevailed in some jurisdictions as to the general rule. In Burt v. Central Life Ins. Co., \n187 U.S. 362\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 139, it was held that there was a similar tacit exclusion from the risk assumed of the death of the insured by execution for murder, and the same decision was reached in Northwestern Mutual Life Ins. Co. v. McCue, \n223 U.S. 234\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 220, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 57. But the question here does not concern implied exceptions, it concerns the effect of express undertakings which as we have said depends upon the policy of the state.\n The certificates do not disclose in what states these contracts were made but it is not necessary to postpone our answer on that account. It appears from Whitfield v. AEtna Life Insurance Co., supra, that some legislatures have thought it best to insist that life insurance should cover suicide unless taken out in contemplation of the deed. But the case is much stronger when a considerable time is to elapse before the fact that the death was by the insured's own hand ceases to be a defense. The danger is less sinister and probably a good deal smaller than the danger of murder when the insurance is held by a third person having no interest in the continuance of the life insured, yet insurance on the life of a third person does not become void by assignment to one who has no interest in the life. Grigsby v. Russell, \n222 U.S. 149\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 58, 36 L. R. A. (N. S.) 642, Ann. Cas. 1913B, 863. When a clause makes a policy indisputable after one or two years, the mere evocation of a possible motive for self-slaughter is at least not more objectionable than the creation of a possible motive for murder. The object of the clause is plain and laudable-to create an absolute assurance of the benefit, \n\n[254 U.S. 96, 102]\n\u00a0\n as free as may be from any dispute of fact except the fact of death, and as soon as it reasonably can be done. It is said that the insurance companies now generally issue policies with such a clause. The state decisions, so far as we know, have upheld it. Unless it appears that the state concerned adopts a different attitude we should uphold it here. Simpson v. Life Ins. Co. of Virginia, 115 N. C. 393, 20 S. E. 517; Mareck v. Mutual Reserve Fund Life Association, 62 Minn. 39, 64 N. W. 68, 54 Am. St. Rep. 613; Goodwin v. Providence Savings Life Assurance Association, 97 Iowa, 226, 66 N. W. 157, 32 L. R. A. 473, 59 Am. St. Rep. 411; Patterson v. Natural Premium Mut. Life Ins. Co., 100 Wis. 118, 75 N. W. 980, 42 L. R. A. 253, 69 Am. St. Rep. 899.\n We are of opinion that the provision in the first mentioned document avoiding the policy if the insured should die by his own hand within two years from the date is an inverted expression of the same general intent as that of the clause in the second making the policy incontestable after one year, and that both equally mean that suicide of the insured, insane or sane, after the specified time shall not be a defense. If seems to us that that would be the natural interpretation of the words by the people to whom they are addressed, and that the language of each policy makes the company issuing it liable in the event that happened. We answer the first question in each certificate, yes. The other questions are disposed of by our answer to the first.\n Answer to question 1 in No. 70, Yes.\n Answer to question 1 in No. 71, Yes.\n Mr. Justice DAY took no part in the decision of these cases. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nO'CONNELL v.

West and Daniel O'Connell, both of San Francisco, Cal., and Joseph L. Tepper, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error were tried under an indictment with two counts. The first charges a conspiracy to violate the Espionage Act-section 3, Act June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 217, 219 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  10212c)-by obstructing the recruiting and enlistment service; the second a conspiracy to violate the Selective Service Law-section 6, Act May 18, 1917, c. 15, 40 Stat. 76, 80 (Comp St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2044f).\n A demurrer, challenging the constitutionality of both acts and the sufficiency of each count, was overruled.\n The trial continued from September 12 to 25, 1917, and resulted in the following verdict:\n'We, the jury, find Daniel O'Connell, David J. Smith, Herman B. Smith, Carl J. F. Wacher, Thomas Carey and E. R. Hoffman, the defendants at the bar, guilty on the _____ count of the indictment, and _____ on the _____ count of the indictment.\n\n'Thomas H. Haskins, Foreman.'\n\n No objection was made to this verdict when returned, nor at any time prior to May 31, 1919, long after the record came here, when permission was asked to amend the assignments of error.\n Motions for new trial and in arrest of judgment were overruled. The former attacked the verdict as contrary to law and the evidence but said nothing concerning its form. The latter recited:\n'And now after verdict against the said defendants and before sentence, come the said defendants in their own proper persons and by Daniel O'Connell their attorney and move the court here to arrest judgment herein and not pronounce the same'\n\n - \n\n[253 U.S. 142, 145]\n\u00a0\n and specified the following grounds: (1) The indictment fails to set forth facts sufficient to constitute an offense. (2) The first count is repugnant to itself for reasons set forth in the demurrer. (3) The second count is based on the Act of May 18, 1917, inapplicable to the defendants because they were not engaged in carrying out its terms. (4) The first count does not adequately inform defendants concerning nature of charge against them. (5) Both the Acts of May 18 and June 15, 1917, are in conflict with the Constitution and are invalid.\n September 29 O'Connell was sentenced to the penitentiary for five years on the first count and for two years on the second, the terms to run consecutively. The other plaintiffs in error were sentenced to varying concurrent terms under both counts, none being in excess of three years. On the same day a writ of error from this court was allowed.\n The record contains a bill of exceptions, with an elaborate explanatory certificate signed by the District Judge.\n The trial took place during July term, 1917; the next term as appointed by statute began November 15. On September 29, 30 days were granted for preparation and presentation of a bill of exceptions. October 23 an order undertook to extend the time to November 15; on November 12 a like order specified November 27; on November 26 an order specified December 15; on December 14 a further order undertook to extend it to December 24, when a still further extension was ordered to December 31. On the latter date a proposed bill was presented. January 9, 1918, the United States attorney procured an order granting time in which to prepare amendments to the proposed bill which were thereafter presented.\n Rule 9 of the District Court provided:\n'For the purpose of making and filing bills of exceptions and of making any and all motions necessary to be made within the term at which any judgment or decree is entered, each \n\n[253 U.S. 142, 146]\n\u00a0\n term of this court shall be and hereby is extended so as to comprise a period of three calendar months beginning on the first Tuesday of the month in which verdict is rendered or judgment or decree entered.'\n\n Rule 61 provided:\n When an act to be done in any pending suit relates to the preparation of bills of exceptions or amendments thereto, 'the time allowed by these rules may, unless otherwise specially provided, be extended by the court or judge by order made before the expiration of such time, but no such extension or extensions shall exceed thirty days in all without the consent of the adverse party.'\n After expiration of the three months specified by rule 9, plaintiffs in error having in open court requested further extension, the United States attorney announced that he would not consent but would ask the court to refuse to settle any bill thereafter proposed. In April, 1918, he moved that settlement of the proposed bill be refused and that it be stricken from the files. The court expressed the opinion that the bill was too late unless the United States attorney had waived objection thereto, and on that point said:\n'I am very strongly of the view that owing to the attitude of the United States attorney, distinctly stated theretofore, which was all that could be done under the circumstances this was not such a waiver.'\n\n But, in order that the matter might bebrought here for final determination, the facts were set out and the certificate signed.\n Under the statute the trial term expired November 15; but, for the purpose of filing the bill of exceptions, a general rule extended it to December 4-three months from the first Tuesday in September. The last order of court within the extended term designated December 14 as the final day for action.\n'By the uniform course of decision, no exceptions to relings at a trial can be considered by this court, unless they were taken at the trial, and were also embodied in a \n\n[253 U.S. 142, 147]\n\u00a0\n formal bill of exceptions presented to the judge at the same or within a further time allowed by order entered at that term, or by standing rule of court, or by consent of parties. ... After the term has expired, without the court's control over the case being reserved by standing rule or special order, and especially after a writ of error has been entered in this court, all authority of the court below to allow a bill of exceptions then first presented, or to alter or amend a bill of exceptions already allowed and filed, is at an end.' Michigan Insurance Bank v. Eldred, \n143 \nU.S. 293, 298\n, 12 S. Sup.C t. 450, 452 (36 L. Ed. 162).\n\n We think the power of the trial court over the cause expired not later than the 14th of December, 1917, and any proceedings concerning settlement of a bill thereafter were coram non judice. We may not, therefore, consider the bill copied in the record. Hunnicutt v. Peyton, \n102 U.S. 333\n; Davis v. Patrick, \n122 U.S. 138\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 1102; Waldron v. Waldron, \n156 U.S. 361\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 383; Jennings v. Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington Ry. Co., \n218 \nU.S. 255, 257\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 1. And the same is true of certain notes of proceedings taken during trial which we directed to be brought here, without prejudice, by order of June 9, 1919\n\n\n The motion to amend original assignments of error is granted. Having regard to the record properly before us only four of the assignments require special notice: (1) Unconstitutionality of the Selective Service and the Espionage Acts. (2) That the first count is bad because it only charges a conspiracy to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service by inducement and persuasion. (3) The verdict was fatally defective and the judgment invalid. (4) The second count is bad. It charges a conspiracy to make false certificates concerning liability for military service and to aid in evading the act without alleging that the conspirators were officers or persons charged with the duty of carrying it into effect.\n The constitutionality of the two acts is settled by opinions \n\n[253 U.S. 142, 148]\n\u00a0\n of this court announced since the writ of error was sued out. Goldman et al. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 474\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 166; Schenck v. United States, \n249 U.S. 47\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 247; Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 U.S. 204\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 249. Also the criminality of a conspiracy to obstruct recruiting and enlistment by persuasion has been determined. Schenck v. United States, supra.\n Apparently a printed form was used in preparing the jury's verdict, defendants' names and the word 'guilty' being inserted. When presented no objection was made to its form or wording, neither the motion for new trial nor in arrest of judgment indicated any such objection, and plaintiffs in error mentioned none when called upon to show cause why sentence should not be imposed. We think the intention to find a general verdict of guilty upon both counts is sufficiently plain. Evidently all parties so understood at the time. See Statler v. United States, \n157 \nU.S. 277, 279\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 616; Ballew v. United States, \n160 \nU.S. 187, 197\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 263.\n The second count charges a conspiracy to violate section 6 of the Selective Service Act. Its provisions include:\n'Any person who shall make or be a party to the making of any false statement or certificate as to the fitness or liability of himself or any other person for service under the provisions of this act, or regulations made by the President thereunder, or otherwise evades or aids another to evade the requirements of this act or of said regulations.'\n\n Other words of the section relate to officers and persons charged with the duty of carrying the act into effect, but the quoted ones are broad enough to include nonofficial persons and, when considered in connection with the general purpose in view, there can be no reasonable doubt that plaintiffs in error were within their meaning. See Fraina et al. v. United States, 255 Fed. 28, 33, 166 C. C. A. 356.\n We find no adequate cause for interfering with the judgment of the court below and it is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","112":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOHIO VALLEY WATER CO. v. BOROUGH OF BEN AVON(1920)\nNo. 128\nArgued: October 15, 1919Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. William Watson Smith, John G. Buchanan, and George B. Gordon, all of Pittsburgh, Pa., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Berne H. Evans, of Harrisburg, Pa., and Leonard K. Guiler, David L. Starr, and Albert G. Liddell, all of Pittsburgh, Pa., for defendants in error. \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 288]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the court.\n Acting upon a complaint charging plaintiff in error, a water company, with demanding unreasonable rates, the Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania instituted an investigation and took evidence. It found the fair value of the company's property to be $924,744 and ordered establishment of a new and lower schedule which would yield 7 per centum thereon over and above operating expenses and depreciation.\n Claiming the commission's valuation was much too low and that the order would deprive it of a reasonable return and thereby confiscate its property, the company appealed to the Superior Court. The latter reviewed the certified record, appraised the property at $1,324,621.80, reversed the order, and remanded the proceeding, with directions to authorize rates sufficient to yield 7 per centum of such sum.\n The Supreme Court of the state reversed the decree and reinstated the order, saying:\n'The appeal [to the Superior Court] presented for determination the question whether the order appealed from was reasonable and in conformity with law, and in this inquiry was involved the question of the fair value, for ratemaking purposes, of the property of appellant, and the amount of revenue which appellant was entitled to collect. In its decision upon the appeal, the Superior Court differed from the commission as to the proper valuation to be placed upon several items going to make up the fair value of the property of the water company for rate-making purposes.'\n\n It considered those items and held that as there was competent evidence tending to sustain the commission's conclusion and no abuse of discretion appeared, the Superior Court should not have interfered therewith.\n'A careful examination of the voluminous record in this case has led us to the \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 289]\n\u00a0\n conclusion that in the items wherein the Superior Court differed from the commission upon the question of values there was merely the substitution of its judgment for that of the commission in determining that the order of the latter was unreasonable.'\n\n Looking at the entire opinion we are compelled to conclude that the Supreme Court interpreted the statute as withholding from the courts power to determine the question of confiscation according to their own independent judgment when the action of the commission comes to be considered on appeal.\n The order here involved prescribed a complete schedule of maximum future rates and was legislative in character. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 U.S. 210\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 67; Lake Erie & Western R. R. Co. v. State Public Utility Commission, \n249 \nU.S. 422, 424\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 345. In all such cases, if the owner claims confiscation of his property will result, the state must provide a fair opportunity for submitting that issue to a judicial tribunal for determination upon its own independent judgment as to both law and facts; otherwise the order is void because in conflict with the due process clause, Fourteenth Amendment. Missouri Pac. R. R. v. Tucker, \n230 \nU.S. 340, 347\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 961; Wadley Southern Ry. Co. v Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651, 660\n, 661 S., 35 Sup. Ct. 214; Missouri v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R ., \n241 \nU.S. 533, 538\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 715; Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love (March 22, 1920), \n252 U.S. 331\n, 40 Sup, Ct. 338.\n Here the insistence is that the Public Service Company Law as construed and applied by the Supreme Court has deprived plaintiff in error of the right to be so heard; and this is true if the appeal therein specifically provided is the only clearly authorized proceeding where the commission's order may be challenged because confiscatory. Thus far plaintiff in error has not succeeded in obtaining the review for which the Fourteenth Amendment requires the state to provide. \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 290]\n\u00a0\n Article 6, Public Service Company Law of Pennsylvania (P. L. 1913, p. 1429):\n'Sec. 31. No injunction shall issue modifying, suspending, staying, or annulling any order of the commission, or of a commissioner, except upon notice to the commission and after cause shown upon a hearing. The court of common pleas of Dauphin county is hereby clothed with exclusive jurisdiction throughout the commonwealth of all proceedings for such injunctions, subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court as aforesaid. Whenever the commission shall make any rule, regulation, finding, determination, or order under the provisions of this act the same shall be and remain conclusive upon all parties affected thereby, unless set aside, annulled, or modified in an appeal or proceeding taken as provided in this act.'\n\n It is argued that this section makes adequate provision for testing judicially any order by the commission when alleged to be confiscatory, and that plaintiff in error has failed to take advantage of the opportunity so provided.\n The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania has not ruled upon effect of meaning of section 31, or expressed any view concerning it. So far as counsel have been able to discover, no relief against an order alleged to be confiscatory has been sought under this section, although much litigation has arisen under the act. It is part of the article entitled 'Practice and Procedure Before the Commission and upon Appeal.' Certain opinions by the Supreme Court seem to indicate that all objections to the commission's orders must be determined upon appeal-St. Clair Borough v. Tamaqua & Pottsville Electric Ry. Co., 259 Pa. 462, 103 Atl. 287; Pittsburgh Railways Co. v. Pittsburgh, 260 Pa. 424, 103 Atl. 959-but they do not definitely decide the point.\n Taking into consideration the whole act, statements by \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n the state Supreme Court concerning the general plan of regulation, and admitted local practice, we are unable to say that section 31 offered an opportunity to test the order so clear and definite that plaintiff in error was obliged to proceed thereunder or suffer loss of rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution. On the contrary, after specifying that within 30 days an appeal may be taken to the Superior Court (section 17), the act provides (section 22):\n'At the hearing of the appeal the said court shall, upon the record certified to it by the commission, determine whether or not the order appealed from is reasonable and in conformity with law.'\n\n But for the opinion of the Supreme Court in the present cause, this would seem to empower the Superior Court judicially to hear and determine all objections to an order on appeal and to make its jurisdiction in respect thereto exclusive. Of this the latter court apparently entertained no doubt; and certainly counsel did not fatally err by adopting that view, whatever meaning finally may be attributed to section 31.\n Without doubt the duties of the courts upon appeals under the act are judicial in character-not legislative, as in Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, supra. This is not disputed; but their jurisdiction, as ruled by the Supreme Court, stopped short of what must be plainly intrusted to some court in order that there may be due process of law.\n Plaintiff in error has not had proper op ortunity for an adequate judicial hearing as to confiscation; and unless such an opportunity is now available, and can be definitely indicated by the court below in the exercise of its power finally to construe laws of the state (including of course section 31), the challenged order is invalid.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania must be reversed, and the cause remanded there, with instructions to take further action not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, dissenting.\n The Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania, acting upon complaint of Ben Avon borough and others, found, after due notice and hearing, that increased rates adopted by the Ohio Valley Water Company were unreasonable, and it prescribed a schedule of lower rates which it estimated would yield 7 per cent. net upon the value of the property used and useful in the service. The company appealed to the Superior Court, contending that the property had been undervalued and that the rates were, therefore, confiscatory in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. That court, passing upon the weight of the evidence introduced before the commission, found that larger amounts should have been allowed for several items which entered into the valuation, reversed the order on that ground, and directed the commission to reform its valuation accordingly and upon such revised valuation to fix a schedule of rates which would yield the net return which it had found to be fair. From the decision of the Superior Court the commission appealed to the Supreme Court of the state, contending that the Superior Court had in passing upon the weight of the evidence exceeded its jurisdiction. The Supreme Court sustained this contention, and, holding, upon a careful review of the evidence and of the opinions below, that the commission had been justified in its findings by 'ample testimony' or 'competent evidence,' and that they were not unreasonable, reversed the decree of the Superior Court and reinstated the order of the commission. Borough of Ben Avon v. Ohio Valley Water Co., 260 Pa. 289, 103 Atl. 744. The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code, as amended (Comp. St.  1214), the company claiming that its rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment have been violated: (1) because the Public Service Company Law, as construed by the Supreme Court of the State, denies the opportunity of a judicial review of the commission's \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n order; and (2) that the order, which was reinstated by the Supreme Court, confiscates its property.\n First. The commission's order, although entered in a proceeding commenced upon due notice, conducted according to judicial practice and participated in throughout by the company, was a legislative order; and, being such, the company was entitled to a judicial review. Prentis v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n211 \nU.S. 210, 228\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 67. The method of review invoked by the company under specific provisions of the statute was this: A stenographic report is made of all the evidence introduced before the commission. On a record consisting of such evidence, the opinion and the orders, the case is appealed to the Superior Court, which is given power, if it finds that the order appealed from 'is unreasonable or based upon incompetent evidence materially affecting the determination of the commission or is otherwise not in conformity with law' either to reverse the order or to remand the record to the commission with direction to reconsider the matter and make such order as shall be reasonable and in conformity with law. No additional evidence may be introduced in the Superior Court; but it may remand the case to the commission with directions to hear newly discovered evidence and upon the record thus supplemented to enter such order as may be reasonable and in conformity with law. From such new order a like appeal lies to that court. Act July 26, 1913, No. 854,  21-25 (P. L. 1913, pp. 1427, 1428); Act June 3, 1915, No. 345 (P. . 1915, p. 779). The Supreme Court construed this act as denying to the Superior Court the power to pass upon the weight of evidence; and the company contends that for this reason the review had does not satisfy the constitutional requirements of a judicial review. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[253 U.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n Whether the appeal to the Superior Court fails, for the reason assigned or for some other reason, to satisfy the constitutional requirements of a judicial review, we need not determine, because the statute left open to the company, besides this limited review, the right to resort in the state courts, as well as in the federal court, to another and unrestricted remedy, the one commonly pursued when challenging the validity of a legislative order of this nature, namely, a suit in equity to enjoin its enforcement. See Louisville & Nashville Ry. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 311\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 48; Wadley Southern Ry. v. Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651, 661\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 214. For section 31 (P. L. 1913, p. 1429) provides:\n'No injunction shall issue modifying, suspending, staying, or annulling any order of the commission, or of a commissioner, except upon notice to the commission and after cause shown upon a hearing. The court of common pleas of Dauphin county is hereby clothed with exclusive jurisdiction throughout the commonwealth of all proceedings for such injunctions, subject to an appeal to the Supreme Court as aforesaid. Whenever the commission shall make any rule, regulation, finding, determination, or order under the provisions of this act the same shall be and remain conclusive upon all parties affected thereby, unless set aside, annulled, or modified in an appeal or proceeding taken as provided in this act.'\n\n Resort to suit for injunction is made easy in rate controversies like the present by section 41, p. 1432, in which it is provided that the penalties for failure to obey the commission's orders imposed by sections 35, 39, and 59, pp. 1430, 1431, shall not apply to an order declaring a rate unreasonable, if the tariff of rates actually charged is filed \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 295]\n\u00a0\n with the commission. The appeal provided for in sections 22-25 was under the original act also to the court of common pleas, but was changed to the Superior Court by the act of July 3, 1915.\n No decisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania construing section 31 of this act have been brought to our attention. The company contends, however, that the construction here suggested has been inferentially made untenable by dicta in St. Clair Borough v. Tamaqua & Pottsville Elec. Ry. Co., 259 Pa. 462, 103 Atl. 287; Pittsburgh Rys. Co. v. Pittsburgh, 260 Pa. 424, 103 Atl. 959; Klein-Logan Co. v. Duquesne Light Co., 261 Pa. 526, 104 Atl. 763. But the language relied upon was in each instance used by the court in making the point, not that the sole method of review was by appeal, as distinguished from a bill in equity, but that the function of the courts was to review only after the commission had in the first instance passed upon the case.\n Where a state offers a litigant the choice of two methods of judicial review, of which one is both appropriate and unrestricted, the mere fact that the other which the litigant elects is limited, does not amount to a denial of the constitutional right to a judicial review. The alternative or additional remedy in the present case was in effect an appeal on the law applicable to facts found below. It is in substantial accord with the practice u rsued in other appellate courts and approved in New York & Queens Gas Co. v. McCall, \n245 U.S. 345\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 122. It is true, however, that an additional or alternative remedy may deny the constitutional right to due process of law because of its nature or the course of the proceeding. See Iowa Central Railroad Co. v. Iowa, \n160 U.S. 389\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 344. And it is the contention of the plaintiff that because the Supreme Court did not weigh the evidence, but reinstated the order of the commission on account of there being substantial evidence to support it, the procedure was not a judicial review and denied it due process of law. The defendants, on the other hand, \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 296]\n\u00a0\n insist that the action of the Supreme Court, in reinstating the order, found not merely that there was substantial evidence, but, upon a full review, that there was ample evidence to support the findings, and that the order was reasonable. They contend that the course pursued by the Supreme Court in making such review was that customarily followed in Pennsylvania, both by appellate courts on appeals from chancellors and by trial courts on exceptions to reports of auditors, masters or referees ( Barnes' Estate, 221 Pa. 399, 70 Atl. 790); and they point out that the same method was pursued on appeal to the Supreme Court prior to the enactment of the Public Service Company Law, at a time when proceedings by consumers to secure reduction of water rates alleged to be unreasonably high were brought in the court of common pleas, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court (Turtle Creek Borough v. Penna. Water Co., 243 Pa. 401, 90 Atl. 194).\n The contention of neither party is in my opinion wholly correct. Both overlook the nature of the question of law which was under review by the Supreme Court. It is true that there was no statutory limitation upon the scope of its review; but it does not follow either that the Supreme Court weighed the evidence and found that the preponderance supported the findings, or that because it failed to weigh the evidence there was either a denial of due process or even a mistake of law. The questions of law before the Supreme Court were, first, whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to weigh the evidence; second, whether in rendering its decision it weighed the evidence; and, third, whether the valuation of the plaintiff's property was so low that a rate based upon it would operate to deprive the plaintiff of property without due process of law, would confiscate its property. On each of these questions the Supreme Court found against the contentions of the plaintiff. It held that the Superior Court did not have revisory legislative powers, but only the power to \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 297]\n\u00a0\n review questions of law-in the present case, whether there was evidence on which the valuation adopted could reasonably have been found-and in so holding it acted upon the established principle applied in reviewing the findings of administrative boards, that 'courts will not examine the facts further than to determine whether there was substantial evidence to sustain the order.' Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 548 S., 32 Sup. Ct. 108, 111 (56 L. Ed. 308). It, therefore, reinstated the order of the commission. But it did not do so as an appellate court reviewing on the weight of the evidence findings of fact made by the Superior Court. It did so solely because the only question before it was whether there was substantial evidence to support the finding of value; for if the valuation was legally arrived at, the order was confessedly reasonable. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., supra; San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 441\n, 442 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 571. The presumption created by section 23, P. L. p. 1427, by which an order of the commission is made prima facie evidence of its reasonableness is in no sense a limitation upon the scope of the review. It is in effect the presumption which this court has declared to exist i rate cases, independently of statute, in favor of the conclusion of an experienced administrative body reached after a full hearing. Darnell v. Edwards, \n244 \nU.S. 564, 569\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 701.\n Second. As the company had the opportunity for a full judicial review through a suit in equity for an injunction, as it was not denied due process by disregard in the proceedings actually taken of the essentials of judicial process, and since it is clear that the findings of the commission were supported by substantial evidence, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania must be affirmed, unless, as contended, the claim of confiscation compels this court to decide, upon the weight of the evidence, whether or not its property has been undervalued, or unless some error in law is shown. \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 298]\n\u00a0\n The case is here on writ of error to a state court. It is settled that in such cases we accept the facts as there found, not only in actions at law (Dower v. Richards, \n151 U.S. 658\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 452), but also where, as in chancery, the record contains all the evidence and it was open for consideration by and actually passed upon by the highest court of the state (Egan v. Hart, \n165 U.S. 188\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 300; Waters-Pierce Oil Co. v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 86, 107\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 220). And this is true, although the existence of a federal question depends upon the determination of the issue of fact, and although the finding of fact will determine whether or not there has been a taking of property in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Minneapolis & St. Louis Railroad Co. v. Minnesota, \n193 \nU.S. 53, 65\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 396. This court may, of course, upon writ of error to a state court 'examine the entire record, including the evidence, to determine whehter what purports to be a finding' upon questions of fact is 'so involved with and dependent upon questions of federal law as to be really a decision' of the latter. Kansas City Southern Co. v. Albers Commission Co., \n223 U.S. 573\n, 591-593, 32 Sup. Ct. 316, 320 (56 L. Ed. 556); Cedar Rapids Gaslight Co. v. Cedar Rapids, \n223 \nU.S. 655, 658\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 389; Graham v. Gill, \n223 \nU.S. 643, 645\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 396. But in order that such examination may be required or be permissible, its purpose must not be to pass upon the relative weight of conflicting evidence ( Oregon Railroad & Navigation Co. v. Fairchild, \n224 \nU.S. 510, 528\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 535) and to substitute the judgment therein of this court for that of the lower court, but to ascertain whether a finding was unsupported by evidence, or whether evidence was properly admitted or excluded, or whether in some other way a ruling was involved which is within the appellate jurisdiction of this court (Northern Pacific Railway v. North Dakota, \n236 \nU.S. 585, 593\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 429, L. R. A. 1917F, 1148, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 1; Norfolk & Western Railway v. West Virginia, \n236 U.S. 605\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 437).\n Here, it is clear, there was substantial evidence to support the findings of the commission; and no adequate reason is shown for declining to accept as conclusive the \n\n[253 U.S. 287, 299]\n\u00a0\n facts found by the state tribunals. See Portland Railway Light & Power Co. v. Oregon Railroad Commission, \n229 U.S. 397\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 820; Miedreich v. Lauenstein, \n232 U.S. 236\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 309. The rates are predicated on the company's earning 7 per cent. net on the value of its property used and useful in the service, after deducting from the income all expenses and charges for depreciation. It is conceded that 7 per cent. is a fair return upon the investment, and it is not contended that any erroneous rule has been applied in ascertaining the expenses of operation or the depreciation charges. The claim that the rates are confiscatory rested wholly on the contention that the property was undervalued; and on that question the contention is that the court failed to give due wi ght to the evidence adduced by the company and that the processes by which the commission arrived at the value it fixed differed from that often pursued by courts and administrative bodies. To this the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said:\n'The ascertainment of the fair value of the property, for rate-making purposes, is not a matter of formulas, but it is a matter which calls for the exercise of a sound and reasonable judgment upon a proper consideration of all relevant facts.'\n\n The objections to the valuation made by the company raise no question of law but concern pure matters of fact; and the finding of the commission, affirmed by the highest court of the state, is conclusive upon this court.

STATE OF OKL.(1920)\nNo. 32\nArgued: Decided: March 22, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. C. B. Ames, of Oklahoma City, Okl. for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. S. P. Freeling and Paul A. Walker, both of Oklahoma City, Okl ., for the State of Oklahoma.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Corporation Commission of Oklahoma having found under section 8235 of the Revised Laws of 1910 that the Oklahoma Gin Company and four other concerns in the town of Chandler had combined and raised the charges for ginning cotton, and on October 17, 1913, fixed a schedule of rates lower than those then in force. The company thereafter charged rates in excess of those so fixed, and three separate complaints against it alleging violation of the order were filed with the Commission. Being summoned \n\n[252 U.S. 339, 340]\n\u00a0\n to show cause why it should not be punished for contempt the company admitted violation of the order, but alleged that it was void, among other reasons, because section 8235 was in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment. After a full hearing, at which new evidence was introduced, the Commission affirmed, on October 10, 1914, the rates fixed, made a finding that the violation of the order was willful, imposed on the company a fine of $500 and costs under each of the three separate complaints, directed refund of all amounts collected in excess of prescribed rates, and declared also:\n'A fine will be imposed for each day the order has been violated, and the matter as to the number of days and the amounts of fines to be imposed upon defendant, other than those mentioned in the information, will be left open for adjustment upon taking of evidence as to the number of days violated.'\n\n An appeal was taken by the company to the Supreme Court of the state, which affirmed the order, and thereafter denied two petitions for rehearing. The case comes here on writ of error under section 237 of the Judicial Code as amended (Comp. St.  1214).\n This case was argued and submitted with Oklahoma Operating Co. v. Love et al., \n252 U.S. 331\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 338, 64 L. Ed. --, decided this day. For the reasons set forth in the opinion in that case, the provision concerning penalties for disobedience to an order of the Commission was void, because it deprived the company of the opportunity of a judicial review. The judgment must therefore be reversed. It is unnecessary to consider other contentions of plaintiff in error.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","114":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nOKLAHOMA OPERATING CO. v. LOVE(1920)\nNo. 129\nArgued: Decided: March 22, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 331, 332]\n\u00a0\n Mr. C. B. Ames, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellant.\n Mr. S. P. Freeling, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Oklahoma by the Oklahoma Operating Company against the Corporation Commission of that state to enjoin it from entertaining complaints against the company for the violation of orders limiting the rates for laundry work in Oklahoma City \n\n[252 U.S. 331, 333]\n\u00a0\n theretofore entered by the Commission, under section 82351 of the Revised Laws of Oklahoma (1910); and from doing any other acts or things to enforce said orders. The case comes here under section 266 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1243) by direct appeal from an order denying a motion for a preliminary injunction heard before three judges. The appellant presents to this court the question whether section 8235 is void under the Fourteenth Amendment, contending that under the laws of the state there was no opportunity of reviewing judicially a legislative rate fixed pursuant to that section except by way of defense to proceedings for contempt which might be instituted for violating the order, and that the possible penalties for such violation were so heavy as to prohibit resort to that remedy.\n The bill as amended makes the following allegations: In 1913 the Commission entered an order declaring the Oklahoma Operating Company a monopoly and its business a public one, and directed it not to increase the rates then being charged except upon application to and permission of the Commission. Since that time operating costs have risen greatly and rates for laundry work prevailing \n\n[252 U.S. 331, 334]\n\u00a0\n in 1913 have become noncompensatory. Accordingly in January, 1918, the company moved the Commission to set aside its order of 1913 on the ground that the laundry business was not within the purview of section 8235, that the company was not a monopoly within the meaning of that section, and that the section was void. The Commission denied this motion, and thereafter the company established rates higher than those prevailing in 1913. On account of this it is now threatened with proceedings for contempt. Since the establishment of these higher rates the company has been summoned before the Commission to give information as to the cost of performing laundry service in Oklahoma City and information in general to determine what may be reasonable rates for laundry service in that city. Upon these allegations a preliminary injunction was sought below to restrain the Commission from entertaining complaints for violation of its order fixing rates and to enjoin it from proceeding with the investigation regarding the cost of the service.\n The scope of section 8235 and the prescribed course of proceedings thereunder, as construed by the Supreme Court of the state (Harriss-Irby Cotton Co. v. State, 31 Okl. 603, 122 Pac. 163; Shawnee Gas & Electric Co. v. State, 31 Okl. 505, 122 Pac. 222; Oklahoma Gin Co. v. State [Okl.] 158 Pac. 629), in connection with other legislation (sections 1192 to 1207 of the Revised Code of 1910) and provisions of the state Constitution ( article 9, sections 18 to 23), are, so far as here material, these: Whenever any business, by reason of its nature, extent, or the exercise of a virtual monopoly therein, is such that the public must use the same or its services, it is deemed a public business, and as such is subject to the duty to render its services upon reasonable terms without discrimination. If any public business violates such duty the Corporation Commission has power to regulate its rates and practices. Disobedience to an order establishing rates may be punished as a contempt and the Commission has power, \n\n[252 U.S. 331, 335]\n\u00a0\n sitting as a court, to impose a penalty therefor not exceeding $500 a day. Each day's continuance of failure or refusal to obey the order constitutes a separate offense. The original order may not be made nor any penalty imposed except upon due notice and hearing. No court of the state, except the Supreme Court by was of appeal, may review, correct o annul any action of the Commission within the scope of its authority or suspend the execution thereof; and the Supreme Court may not review an order fixing rates by direct appeal from such order. But in the proceedings for contempt the validity of the original order may be assailed; and for that purpose, among others, new evidence may be introduced. When a penalty for failure to obey an order has been imposed an appeal lies to the Supreme Court. On this appeal the validity of the original order may be reviewed; the appeal is allowed as of right upon filing a bond with sureties in double the amount of the fine imposed; the filing of the bond suspends the find; and the period of suspension may not be computed against a concern in fixing the amount of liability for fines.\n The order of the Commission prohibiting the company from charging, without its permission, rates higher than those prevailing in 1913, in effect prescribed maximum rates for the service. It was, therefore, a legislative order; and under the Fourteenth Amendment plaintiff was entitled to an opportunity for a review in the courts of its contention that the rates were not compensatory. Chicago, etc., Railway Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 U.S. 418\n, 456-458, 10 Sup. Ct. 462; Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 165\n, 166 S., 28 Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764. The Constitution of the state prohibited any of its courts from reviewing any action of the Commission within its authority except by way of appeal to the Supreme Court (article 9, section 20); and the Supreme Court had construed the Constitution and applicable provisions of the statutes as not permitting a direct appeal from \n\n[252 U.S. 331, 336]\n\u00a0\n orders fixing rates. Harriss-Irby Cotton Co. v. State, supra. On behalf of the Commission it was urged at the oral argument that a judicial review of the order fixing rates might have been had also by writ of mandamus or of prohibition issuing out of the Supreme Court of the state. But, in view of the provision of the state Constitution just referred to, it must be assumed, in the absence of a decision of a state court to the contrary, that neither remedy, even if otherwise available, could be used to review an order alleged to be void because confiscatory. The proviso 'that the writs of mandamus and prohibition shall lie from the Supreme Court to the Commission in all cases where such writs, respectively, would lie to any inferior court or officer,' appears to have no application here. The challenge of a prescribed rate as being confiscatory raises a question, not as to the scope of the Commission's authority, but of the correctness of the exercise of its judgment. Compare Hirsh v. Twyford, 40 Okl. 220, 230, 139 Pac. 313.\n So it appears that the only judicial review of an order fixing rates possible under the laws of the state was that arising in proceedings to punish for contempt. The Constitution endows the Commission with the powers of a court to enforce its orders by such proceedings. Article 9, sections 18, 19. By boldly violating an order a party against whom it was directed may provoke a complaint; and if the complaint results in a citation to show cause why he should not be punished for contempt, he may justify before the Commission by showing that the order violated was invalid, unjust or unreasonable. If he fails to satisfy the Commission that it erred in this respect, a judicial review is opened to him by way of appeal on the whole record to the Supreme Court. But the penalties, which may possibly be imposed, if he pursues this course without success, are such as might well deter even the boldest and most confident. The penalty for refusal to \n\n[252 U.S. 331, 337]\n\u00a0\n obey an order may be $500; and each day's continuance of the refusal after service of the order it is declared 'shall be a separate offense.' The penalty may apparently be imposed for each instance of violation of the order. In Oklahoma Gin Co. v. State, \n252 U.S. 339\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 341, 64 L. Ed. --, decided this day, ita ppears that the full penalty of $500, with the provision for the like penalty for each subsequent day's violation of the order, was imposed in each of three complaints there involved, although they were merely different instances of charges in excess of a single prescribed rate. Obviously a judicial review beset by such deterrents does not satisfy the constitutional requirements, even if otherwise adequate, and therefore the provisions of the acts relating to the enforcement of the rates by penalties are unconstitutional without regard to the question of the insufficiency of those rates. Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 147\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Tucker, \n230 \nU.S. 340, 349\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 961; Wadley Southern Railway v. Georgia, \n235 \nU.S. 651, 662\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 214.\n The plaintiff is entitled to a temporary injunction restraining the Corporation Commission from enforcing the penalties. Since this suit was commenced, the Legislature has provided by chapter 52, section 3, of the Laws of 1919 (Sess. Laws Oklahoma 1919, p. 87) that in actions arising before the Commission under section 8235 there shall be the same right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court of the state as had theretofore existed in the case of transportation and transmission companies under article 9, section 20, of the Constitution. But as plaintiff was obliged to resort to a federal court of equity for relief it ought to retain jurisdiction of the cause in order to make that relief as full and complete as the circumstances of the case and the nature of the proofs may require. The suit should, therefore, proceed for the purpose of determining whether the maximum rates fixed by the Commission are, under present conditions, confiscatory. If they are found to be so, a permanent injunction should issue to restrain their \n\n[252 U.S. 331, 338]\n\u00a0\n enforcement either by means of penalties or otherwise, as through an assertion by customers of alleged rights arising out of the Commission's orders. Missouri v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R., \n241 \nU.S. 533, 538\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 715. If upon final hearing the maximum rates fixed should be found not to be confiscatory, a permanent injunction should, nevertheless, issue to restrain enforcement of penalties accrued pendente lite, provided that it also be found that the plaintiff had reasonable ground to contest them as being confiscatory.\n It does not follow that the Commission need be restrained from proceeding with an investigation of plaintiff's rates and practices, so long as its findings and conclusions are subjected to the review of the District Court herein. Indeed, such investigation and the results of it might with appropriateness be made a part of the final proofs in the cause. \n 2\n\u00a0\n\n These conclusions require that the decree of the District Court be reversed and that the case be remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8235. Public Business Defined. Whenever any business by reason of its nature, extent, or the existence of a virtual monopoly therein, is such that the public must use the same, or its services, or the consideration by it given or taken or offered, or the commodities bought or sold therein are offered or taken by purchase or sale in such a manner as to make it of public consequence or to affect the community at large as to supply, demand ... or rate thereof, or said business is conducted in violation of the first section of this article, said business is a public business, and subject to be controlled by the state, by the corporation commission or by an action in any district court of the state, as to all of its practices, prices, rates and charges. And it is hereby declared to be the duty of any person, firm or corporation engaged in any public business to render its services and offer its commodities, or either, upon reasonable terms without discrimination and adequately to the needs of the pul ic, considering the facilities of said business. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 133\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. (N. S.) 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764, the District Court appears to have considered whether the rates were reasonable although the penal features of the act were declared void. Missouri Pac. Ry. Co. v. Tucker, \n230 U.S. 340\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 961, was an action for the penalty; and the question here raised was not involved. That it is the penalty provision and not the rate provision which is void appears from the cases in which the validity of statutes was sustained because the objectionable penalty provisions were severable and there was no attempt to enforce the penalties.

BECKWITH'S, INC., ESTATE OF v. COMMISSIONER OF PATENTS(1920)\nNo. 178\nArgued: Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 538, 539]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry C. Howard, of Kalamazoo, Mich., for petitioner.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, a corporation, filed an application in the Patent Office for the registration of a trade-mark, which is described as follows:\n'A design like a seal, comprising the head of an Indian chief surmounting a scroll bearing his name, 'Doe-Wah-Jack' and surrounded by a circle, outside of which appeared the words 'Round Oak' and 'Moistair Heating System' in a circle, and the whole being surrounded by a wreath of oak leaves.'\n\n It will be useful to reproduce the drawing filed with this application:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n It was averred that the petitioner had used the mark for more than 18 months before the application \n\n[252 U.S. 538, 540]\n\u00a0\n was made by applying it to 'hot-air and combined hot-air and hot-water heaters and furnaces by having the same cast into the metals of which the systems were constructed.'\n The Commissioner found tha the mark did not conflict with any other that was registered, and that the petitioner was entitled to the exclusive use of it excepting the words 'Moistair Heating System.' It was ordered that the mark might be registered if the excepted words, objectionable because descriptive, were 'erased' or 'removed' from it, but that the filing of a disclaimer would not suffice to secure registration.\n Not satisfied with this result, the petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and its judgment affirming the decision of the Commissioner of Patents is before us for review.\n The ground of both decisions is that the words 'Moistair Heating System' are merely descriptive of a claimed merit of the petitioner's system-that in the process of heating moisture is added to the air-and that one person may not lawfully monopolize the use of words in general use which might be used with equal truthfulness to describe another system of heating. For this reason it was held that the case falls within the proviso of the Registration Act of 1905, declaring that no mark consisting merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used or of the character or quality of such goods shall be registered under the terms of the act. Act Feb. 20, 1905,  5, 33 Stat. 725, amended by Act Jan. 8, 1913, 37 Stat. 649 (Comp. St.  9490).\n No question of patent right, or of unfair competition, or that the design of the trade-mark is so simple as to be a mere device or contrivance to evade the law and secure the registration of non- registrable words, is involved. Nairn Linoleum Co. v. Ringwalt Linoleum Works, 46 App. D. C. 64, 69. \n\n[252 U.S. 538, 541]\n\u00a0\n This statement makes it apparent that the question presented for decision is: Whether the applicant may lawfully register the words 'Moistair Heating System,' when combined with the words 'Round Oak,' as a part of its purely fanciful and arbitrary trade-mark design, as shown in the drawing filed, and when claim to exclusive use of the words apart from the mark shown in the drawing is disclaimed on the record.\n An account of the process of decision, in the Patent Office and in the Court of Appeals, by which the result in this case was arrived at, as it appears in the brief of the Commissioner of Patents, is suggestive and useful. From this we learn that, when a mark has been presented for registration consisting merely (only) of descriptive words or devices, registration has been uniformly refused. When 'composite' marks-such as contain both registrable and nonregistrable matter-have been presented for registry with features in them which conflicted with earlier marks, registered by other than the applicant, the complete rejection, 'eradication,' of the conflicting portions has been uniformly required before registry was allowed. But where there was no such conflict, and the only objection was that descriptive words were used, the practice of the Patent Office prior to the decision, in 1909, of Johnson v. Brandau, 32 App. D. C. 348, was to permit the registration of marks containing such words, where they were associated with registrable words or were a part of an arbitrary or fanciful design or device; it being considered not necessary to delete the descriptive matter, even when it was an essential part of the composite trade-mark as it had been used by the applicant, provided it was clearly not susceptible of exclusive appropriation under the general rules of law. After the decision of Johnson v. Brandau, 32 App. D. C. 348, a practice grew up in the Patent Office, not provided for in the statute, of allowing an applicant to disclaim objectionable descriptive \n\n[252 U.S. 538, 542]\n\u00a0\n words in cases where to require their actual removal would result in so changing the mark that it would not readily be recognized as that shown in the drawing or specimen filed with the application. The customary form of such disclaimer was a statement filed that no claim was made to the designated words, as, for example, 'Moistair Heating System,' apart from th mark shown in the drawing-this was interpreted as meaning that only when taken in connection with the remaining features of the mark did the applicant make claim to their exclusive use. Ex parte Illinois Seed Co., 219 O. G. 931.\n Such disclaimer became a part of the applicant's statement in the record and necessarily formed a part of the certificate of registration as it would appear in the copies of it furnished to the applicant and the public, pursuant to section 11 of the act (Comp. St.  9496).\n Then came the decisions in Fishbeck Soap Co. v. Kleeno Manufacturing Co., 44 App. D. C. 6, and Nairn Linoleum Co. v. Ringwalt Linoleum Works, 46 App. D. C. 64, which, says the Commissioner of Patents, were understood as disapproving the practice of disclaimer, and since they were rendered, registration of merely descriptive matter has not been allowed in any form, but its actual deletion from the trade-mark drawing has been required, with, however, an apparent exception in the Case of Rinsburger, 8 T. M. Repts. 567, 128 MS. Dec. 141. The judgment we are considering, requiring, as it does, the 'elimination' of the descriptive words, shows that the Commissioner correctly interpreted these two decisions of the Court of Appeals.\n It is apparent from this rehearsal that the Commissioner of Patents has promptly and cordially accepted for his guidance the decisions of the Court of Appeals, and, although he avoids a controversial attitude in his brief and gives a colorless history of the practice of his office, \n\n[252 U.S. 538, 543]\n\u00a0\n still it is manifest that, in this case and in others, the court has very radically changed that practice with respect to permitting registry of composite trade-marks, and that its decisions have turned upon the construction of the second proviso, referred to, in the fifth section of the Registration Act, which is made the basis of the judgment we are reviewing.\n The Registration Act of 1905 (33 Stat. 724), amended in 1906 (34 Stat. 168) and in 1909 (35 Stat. 627) and in 1913 (37 Stat. 649 [Comp. St.  9485 et seq.]), without changing the substantive law of trade-marks, provided, in the manner prescribed, for the registration of marks (subject to special exceptions) which, without the statute, would be entitled to legal and equitable protection, and the case before us calls chiefly for the construction of the provisions of section 5 of that act (Comp. St.  9490), which, so far as here involved, are as follows:\n'No mark by which the goods of the owner of the mark may be distinguished from other goods of the same class shall be refused registration as a trade-mark on account of the nature of such mark unless,' etc.\n\n'Provided, that no mark which consists ... merely in words or devices which are descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character or quality of such goods, ... shall be registered under the the terms of this act.'\n\n It was settled long prior to the Trade-Mark Registration Act that the law would not secure to any person the exclusive use of a trade-mark consisting merely of words descriptive of the qualities, ingredients, or characteristics of an article of trade; this for the reason that the function of a trade-mark is to point distinctively, either by its own meaning or by association, to the origin or ownership of the wares to which it is applied, and words merely descriptive of qualities, ingredients, or characteristics, when used alone, do not do this. Other like goods, equal to them in all respects, may be manufactured or \n\n[252 U.S. 538, 544]\n\u00a0\n dealt in by others, who, with equal truth, may use, and must be left free to use, the same language of description in placing their goods before the public. Canal Co. v. Clark, 13 Wall. 311, 322, 323, 324; Manufacturing Co. v. Trainer, \n101 U.S. 51\n, 54; Manhattan Medicine Co. v. Wood, \n108 \nU.S. 218, 222\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 436; Goodyear India Rubber Glove Mfg. Co. v. Goodyear Rubber Co., \n128 U.S. 598\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 166 Lawrence Manufacturing Co. v. Tennessee Manufacturing Co., \n138 \nU.S. 537, 547\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 396; Brown Chemical Co. v. Meyer, \n139 U.S. 540\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 625; Elgin National Watch Co. v. Illinois Watch Case Co., \n179 U.S. 665\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 270; Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Mfg. Co., \n220 U.S. 446\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 456.\n Thus the proviso quoted, being simply an expression in statutory form of the prior general rule of law that words merely descriptive are not a proper subject for exclusive trade-mark appropriation, if the application in this case had been to register only the words 'Moistair Heating System,' plainly it would have fallen within the terms of the prohibition, for they are merely descriptive of a claimed property or quality of the petitioner's heating system-that by it moisture is imparted to the air in the process of heating. But the application was not to register these descriptive words 'merely,' alone and apart from the mark shown in the drawing, but in a described manner of association with other words, 'Round Oak,' which are not descriptive of any quality of applicant's heating system, and as a definitely positioned part of an entirely fanciful and arbitrary design or seal, to which the Commissioner found the applicant had the exclusive right.\n Since the proviso prohibits the registration not of merely descriptive words but of a 'trade-mark which consists ... merely' (only) of such words-the distinction is substantial and plain-we think it sufficiently clear that such a composite mark as we have here does not fall within its terms. In this connection it must be noted that the requirement of the statute that \n\n[252 U.S. 538, 545]\n\u00a0\n no trade-mark shall be refused registration, except in designated cases, is just as imperative as the prohibition of the proviso against registration in cases specified.\n While there is no specific provision for disclaimers in the trade- mark statute, the practice of using them is commended to our judgment by the statement of the Commissioner of Patents that, so far as known, no harm came to the public from the practice of distinguishing, without deleting, nonregistrable matter in the drawing of the mark as registered, when a statement, forming a part of the record, was required that the applicant was not making claim to an exclusive appropriation of such matter except in the precise relation and association in which it appeared in the drawing and description.\n It seems obvious that no one could be deceived as to the scope of such a mark, and that the registrant would be precluded by his disclaimer from setting up in the future any exclusive right to the disclaimed part of it. It seems obvious, also, that to require the deletion of descriptive words must result often in so changing the trade-mark sought to be registered from the form in which it had been used in actual trade that it would not be recognized as the same mark as that shown in the drawing which the statute requires to be filed with the application, or in the specimens produced as actually used, and therefore registration would lose much, if not all, of its value. The required omission might so change the mark that in an infringement suit it could be successfully urged that the registered mark had not been used,-and user is the foundation of registry. Section 2 (Comp. St.  9487). Of this last the case before us furnishes an excellent example. To strike out 'Moistair Heating System' from the applicant's trade-mark would so change its appearance that its value must be largely lost as designating to prior purchasers or users the origin of the heating system to which it was applied.\n The commercial impression of a trade-mark is derived \n\n[252 U.S. 538, 546]\n\u00a0\n from it as a whole, not from its elements separated and considered in detail. For this reason it should be considered in its entirety (Johnson v. Brandau, supra), and to strike out any considerable part of it, certainly any conspicuous part of it, would be to greatlya ffect its value. Of course, refusal to register a mark does not prevent a former user from continuing its use; but it deprives him of the benefits of the statute, and this should not be done if it can be avoided by fair, even liberal, construction of the act, designed as it is to promote the domestic and foreign trade of our country.\n Thus the case comes to this: That the Commissioner found that the trade-mark presented for registration did not conflict with any theretofore registered, and there is no suggestion of unfair practice in the past or contemplated in the future; that it had been used for 18 months in the form proposed for registry; that the words ordered to be stricken out from the drawing are descriptive, but the mark does not consist 'merely' in such words, but is a composite of them with others, and with an arbitrary design which, without these words, both the Commissioner and the court found to be registrable; that the language of the statute, that no mark not within its prohibitions or provisos shall be denied registration, is just as imperative as the prohibitory words of the proviso; and, very certainly, that a disclaimer on the part of applicant that no claim is made to the use of the words 'Moistair Heating System' apart from the mark as shown in the drawing and as described, would preserve to all others the right to use these words in the future to truthfully describe a like property or result of another system, provided only that they be not used in a trade-mark which so nearly resembles that of the petitioner 'as to be likely to cause confusion in the mind of the public or to deceive purchasers' when applied 'to merchandise of the same descriptive properties.' Section 5. \n\n[252 U.S. 538, 547]\n\u00a0\n Such being the ultimate facts of this controversy, we cannot doubt that the Court of Appeals fell into error in ruling that the words 'Moistair Heating System' must be 'eliminated' from the trade-mark of the applicant as it had been theretofore used, and that the requirement of the act of Congress for the registration of trade-marks would be fully complied with if registration of it were permitted with an appropriate declaration on the part of the applicant that no claim is made to the right to the exclusive use of the descriptive words, except in the setting and relation in which they appear in the drawing, description, and samples of the trade-mark filed with the application.\n It results that the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\n\n\n","119":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPANAMA R. CO. v. TOPPIN(1920)\nNo. 147\nArgued: Decided: March 15, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 308, 309]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Frank Feuille and Walter F. Van Dame, both of Ancon, C. Z., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Wm. C. MacIntyre, of Cristobal, C. Z., and Felix E. Porter, of Ancon, C. Z., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Toppin was struck by a locomotive of the Panama Railroad Company while riding a horse in the city of Colon. He sued the company for damages in the District Court of the Canal Zone, alleging negligence, and recovered a verdict. The judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (250 Fed. 989, 163 C. C. A. 239), and the case is here on writ of error.\n The main contentions of the company are here, as in Panama Railroad Co. v. Bosse, \n249 U.S. 41\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 211, that the trial court erred in holding applicable the rule of respondeat superior and the rule permitting recovery for physical pain suffered. The important difference in the two cases is this: There the accident occurred in the Canal Zone; here in the republic of Panama. The company insists that the Bosse Case is not controlling, because the questions affecting liability must here be determined by the law of that republic, the place where the accident occurred. Slater v. Mexican National Railroad Co., \n194 U.S. 120\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 581; Cuba Railroad Co. v. Crosby, \n222 U.S. 473\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 132, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 40. The law \n\n[252 U.S. 308, 310]\n\u00a0\n of Panama is pleaded by both parties and evidence thereon was introduced by both; but we are not limited to this evidence, as they agree that we may take judicial notice of the law of Panama existing February 26, 1904, when the Canal Treaty was proclaimed, and that, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the law then prevailing there will be presumed to have continued i force.\n First. The company contends that the jury should have been instructed that under the law of Panama the company was not liable if the accident resulted from a criminal act of its employes; there being evidence that it was due to running the locomotive at a rate of speed prohibited under penalty by the Police Code of Panama. That Code, known as Ordinance No. 87 of the year 1896, provides (articles 488, 489):\n'When a tramway crosses a town, as well as when it passes by a gate or viaduct, it shall not travel at a greater speed than that of a wagon drawn by horses at a moderate trot; in case of an infraction the conductor or the administrator of the company subsidiarily shall pay a fine of 10 to 100 pesos, without prejudice to the responsibility, civil or penal, to which he may be subject by reason of the damage fault or tort. ...'\n\n'This article ... shall be applied to railroads when they enter cities or towns.'\n\n The Panama Law No. 62 of 1887 had provided in article 5:\n'Railroad companies are responsible for the wrongs and injuries which are caused to persons and properties by reason of the service of said railroads and which are imputable to want of care, neglect or violation of the respective police regulations which shall be issued by the government as soon as the law is promulgated.'\n\n And article 2341 of the Civil Code provides:\n'He who shall have been guilty of an offense or fault, which has caused another damage, is obliged to repair it, \n\n[252 U.S. 308, 311]\n\u00a0\n without prejudice to the principal penalty which the law imposes for the fault or offense committed.'\n\n It would seem clear from a reading of these provisions that the company would not be relieved from liability in damages for injuries resulting from the negligence of its employe, merely because the negligent act was also punishable as a crime. And the Colombian authorities to which our attention has been called tend to confirm this construction. \n1\n There seems to have been a rule of Practice under the Colombian Judicial Code ( article 1501)2 by which, if the civil action and the criminal action arising out of the same acts are not brought at the same time, the civil action cannot be prosecuted until the conclusion of the criminal action with the condemnation of the delinquent. But such rule obviously can have no application here; among other reasons because it refers to the case where the same person is liable both civilly and criminally. Here it is the engineer who is liable criminally under the Police Code and the company against whom civil liability is being enforced.\n Second. The company contends that by the law of Panama it cannot be held liable for the injury caused by the negligence of its engineer if it was careful in selecting him, because the law of Panama does not recognize liability without fault. This contention was made and rejected by the Supreme Court of Colombia in a case similar to the case at bar. \n3\n There suit was brought against the empresario of a railway to recover for the loss of a house by fire due to the negligent operation of locomotive. \n\n[252 U.S. 308, 312]\n\u00a0\n The court rested the liability upon section 2347 of the Civil Code,4 declaring that all doubt as to the existence of the necessary dependency was removed by article 5 of Law 62 of 1887, which 'without in any way mentioning the dependents, employes, or workmen of railway enterprises, makes their empresarios responsible for the damages and injuries which they may cause to persons or to property by reason of the service of the said roads.' The court continues: 'And there is not in the record any proof whatever that any care or precaution, either on the part of the empresario or the engineer, had been taken to prevent the fire, the proof that the empresario on his part had exercised much care in the selection of his employes not being sufficient in the opinion of the court, because the diligence and care here treated of, is that which ought to have been exercised in order to prevent an injury that coud have been easily foreseen.' \n5\n This case seems to overrule in effect the principal authority to which the plaintiff in error has referred us6-in fact, it is not unlikely that such was the object of article 5 of Law 62 of 1887\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 308, 313]\n\u00a0\n Third. The contention that the lower courts erred in allowing recovery for physical pain was made and overruled in Panama Railroad Co. v. Bosse, supra, \n249 U.S. 47\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 211. As the decision there rested upon article 2341 of the Civil Code of Panama, it is applicable whether the lex loci or the lex fori should be held controlling as to such damages. Exception was also taken to the ruling that 'if the plaintiff has developed tuberculosis of the spine as a result of the injuries received' the tuberculosis may be considered as an element of damages. The instruction was given with such explanations as to have been clearly unobjectionable.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cecilia Jaramillo de Cancino v.

LEDERER(1920)\nNo. 499\nArgued: Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. George Wharton Pepper, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company, a purely mutual legal reserve company which issues level premium \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 524]\n\u00a0\n insurance, brought this action in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to recover $6,865.03 which was assessed and collected as an income tax of 1 per cent. upon the sum of $ 686,503, alleged to have been wrongly included as a part of its gross income, and hence also of its net income, for the period from March 1, 1913 to December 31, 1913. The latter sum equals the aggregate of the amounts paid during that period by the company to its policy holders in cash dividends which were not used by them during that period in payment of premiums. The several amounts making up this aggregate represent mainly a part of the so-called redundancy in premiums paid by the respective policy holders in some previous year or years. They are, in a sense, a repayment of that part of the premium previously paid which experience has proved was in excess of the amount which had been assumed would be required to meet the policy obligations (ordinarily termed losses) or the legal reserve and the expense of conducting the business. \n1\n The District Court allowed recovery of the full amount with interest. 247 Fed. 559. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, holding that nothing was recoverable except a single small item, reversed the judgment and awarded a new trial. 258 Fed. 81, 169 C. C. A. 167. A writ of certiorari from this court was then allowed. \n250 U.S. 656\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 14\n\n\n Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover depends wholly upon the construction to be given certain provisions in section II, G(b), of the Revenue Act of October 3, 1913, c. 16, 38 Stat. 114, 172, 173. The act enumerates among \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 525]\n\u00a0\n the corporations upon which the income tax is imposed 'every insurance company' other than 'fraternal beneficiary societies, orders, or associations operating under the lodge system or for the exclusive benefit of the members of a fraternity itself operating under the lodge system.' It provides-G(b), pp. 172-174-how the net income of insurance companies shall be ascertained for purposes of taxation, prescribing what shall be included to determine the gross income of any year, and also specifically what deductions from the ascertained gross income shall be made in order to determine the net income upon which the tax is assessed. Premium receipts are a part of the gross income to be accounted for.\n In applying to insurance companies the system of income taxation in which the assessable net income is to be ascertained by making enumerated deductions from the gross income (including premium receipts) Congress naturally provided how, in making the computation2, repayment of the redundancy in the premium should be dealt with. In a mutual company, whatever the field of its operation, the premium exacted is necessarily greater than the expected cost of the insurance, as the redundancy in the premium furnishes the guaranty fund out of which extraordinary losses may be met, while in a stock company they may be met from the capital stock subscribed. It is of the essence of mutual insurance that the excess in the premium over the actual cost as later ascertained shall be returned to the policy holder. Some payment to the \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 526]\n\u00a0\n policy holder representing such excess is ordinarily made by every mutual company every year; but the so-called repayment or dividend is rarely made within the calendar year in which the premium (of which it is supposed to be the unused surplus) was paid. Congress treated the so-called repayments or dividends in this way (page 173):\n\n\n (a)\n Mutual fire companies 'shall not return as income any portion of the premium deposits returned to their policy holders.'\n\n\n (b)\n Mutual marine companies 'shall be entitled to include in deductions from gross incoe amounts repaid to policy holders on account of premiums previously paid by them and interest paid upon such amounts between the ascertainment thereof and the payment thereof.'\n\n\n (c)\n Life insurance companies (that is both stock and strictly mutual) 'shall not include as income in any year such portion of any actual premium received from any individual policy holder as shall have been paid back or credited to such individual policy holder, or treated as an abatement of premium of such individual policy holder, within such year.'\n\n\n (d)\n For all insurance companies, whatever their field of operation, and whether stock or mutual, the act provides that there be deducted from gross income 'the net addition, if any, required by law to be made within the year to reserve funds and the sums other than dividends paid within the year on policy and anunity contracts.'\n The government contends, in substance, for the rule that in figuring the gross income of life insurance companies, there shall be taken the aggregate of the year's net premium receipts made up separately for each policy holder. \n3\n The Penn Mutual Company contends for the \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 527]\n\u00a0\n rule that in figuring the gross income there shall be taken the aggregate full premiums received by the company less the aggregate of all dividends paid by it to any policy holder by credit upon a premium or by abatement of a premium and also of all dividends whatsoever paid to any policy holder in cash, whether applied in payment of a premium or not. The noninclusion clause (c), above, excludes from gross income those premium receipts which were actually or in effect paid by applying dividends. The company seeks to graft upon the clause so restricted a provision for what it calls nonincluding, but which in fact is deducting, all cash dividends not so applied. In support of this contention the company relies mainly, not upon the words of the statute, but upon arguments which it bases upon the nature of mutual insurance, upon the supposed analogy of the rules prescribed in the statute for mutual fire and marine companies and upon the alleged requirements of consistency.\n First. The reason for the particular provision made by Congress seems to be clear: Dividends may be made, and by many of the companies have been made largely, by way of abating or reducing the amount of the renewal premium. \n4\n Where the dividend is so made the actual premium receipt of the year is obviously only the reduced amount. But, as a matter of bookkeeping, the premium is \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 528]\n\u00a0\n entered at the full rate and the abatement (that is, the amount by which it was reduced) is entered as a credit. The financial result both to the company and to the policy holders is, however, exactly the same whether the renewal premium is reduced by a dividend or whether the renewal premium remains unchanged, but is paid in part either by a credit or by cash received as a dividend. And the entries in bookkeeping would be substantially the same. Because the several ways of paying a dividend are, as between the company and the policy holder, financial equivalents, Congress, doubtless, concluded to make the incidents the same, also, as respects income taxation. Where the dividend was used to abate or reduce the full or gross premium, the direction to eliminate from the apparent premium receipts is aptly expressed by the phrase 'shall not include,' used in clause (c) above. Where the premium was left unchanged, but was paid in part by a credit or cash derived from the dividend, the instruction would be more properly expressed by a direction to deduct those credits. Congress doubtless used the words 'shall not include' as applied also to these credits because it eliminated them from the aggregate of taxable premiums as being the equivalent of abatement of premiums.\n That such was the intention of Congress is confirmed by the history of the noninclusion clause (c), above. The provision in the Revenue Act of 1913, for taxing the income of insurance companies is in large part identical i th the provision for the special excise tax upon them imposed by the Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 112. By the latter act the net income of insurance companies was also to be ascertained by deducting from gross income 'sums other than dividends, paid within the year on policy and renewal contracts'; but there was in that act no noninclusion clause whatsoever. The question arose whether the provision in the act of 1913 identical with (c) \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 529]\n\u00a0\n above prevented using in the computation the reduced renewal premiums instead of the full premiums, where the reduction in the premium had been effected by means of dividends. In Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. v. Herold, 198 Fed. 199, decided July 29, 1912, it was held that the renewal premium as reduced by such dividends should be used in computing the gross premium; and it was said (page 212) that dividends so applied in reduction of renewal premiums 'should not be confused with dividends declared in the case of a full-paid participating policy, wherein the policy holder has no further premium payments to make. Such payments having been duly met, the policy has become at once a contract of insurance and of investment. The holder participates in the profits and income of the invested funds of the company.' On writ of error sued out by the government the judgment entered in the District Court was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on January 27, 1913 (201 Fed. 918, 120 C. C. A. 256), but that court stated that it refrained from expressing any opinion concerning dividends on full paid policies, saying that it did so 'not because we wish to suggest disapproval, but merely because no opinion about these matters is called for now, as they do not seem to be directly involved.' The noninclusion clause in the Revenue Act of 1913 (c) above, was doubtless framed to define what amounts involved in dividends should be 'nonincluded,' or deducted, and thus to prevent any controversy arising over the questions which had been raised under the act of 1909.5 The petition for writ of certiorari applied for by the government was not denied by this court until December 15, 1913 (\n231 U.S. 755\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 323); that is, after the passage of the act. \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 530]\n\u00a0\n Second. It is argued that the nature of life insurance dividends is the same, whatever the disposition made of them, and that Congress could not have intended to relieve the companies from taxation to the extent that dividends are applied in payment of premiums and to tax them to the extent that dividends are not so applied. If Congress is to be assumed to have intended, in obedience to the demands of consistency, that all dividends declared under life insurance policies should be treated alike in connection with income taxation regardless of their disposition, the rule of consistency would require deductions more far-reaching than those mow claimed by the company. Why allow so-called noninclusion of amounts equal to the dividends paid in cash but not applied in reduction of renewal premium and disallow so-called noninclusion of amounts equal to the dividends paid by a credit representing amounts retained by the company for accumulation or to be otherwise used for the policy holders' benefit? The fact is, that Congress has acted with entire consistency in laying down the rule by which in computing gross earnings certain amounts only are excluded; but the company has failed to recognize what the principle is which Congress has consistently applied. The principle applied is that of basing the taxation on receipts of net premiums, instead of on gross premiums. The amount equal to the aggregate of certain dividends is excluded, although they are dividends because by reason of their application the net premium receipts of the tax year are to that extent less. There is a striking difference between an aggregate of individual premiums, each reduced by means of dividends, and an aggregate of full premiums, from which it is sought to deduct amounts paid out by the company which hv e no relation whatever to premiums received within the tax year, but which relate to some other premiums which may have been received many years earlier. The difference between the two \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 531]\n\u00a0\n cases is such as may well have seemed to Congress sufficient to justify the application of different rules of taxation.\n There is also a further significant difference. All life insurance has in it the element of protection. That afforded by fraternal beneficiary societies, as originally devised, had in it only the element of protection. There the premiums paid by the member were supposed to be sufficient, and only sufficient, to pay the losses which will fall during the current year, just as premiums in fire, marine, or casualty insurance are supposed to cover only the losses of the year or other term for which the insurance is written. Fraternal life insurance has been exempted from all income taxation; Congress having differentiated these societies, in this respect as it had in others, from ordinary life insurance companies. Compare Royal Arcanum Supreme Council v. Behrend, \n247 U.S. 394\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 522, 1 A. L. R. 966. But in level premium life insurance, while the motive for taking it may be mainly protection, the business is largely that of savings investment. The premium is in the nature of a savings deposit. Except where there are stockholders, the savings bank pays back to the depositor his deposit with the interest earned less the necessary expense of management. The insurance company does the same; the difference being merely that the savings bank undertakes to repay to each individual depositor the whole of his deposit with interest; while the life insurance company undertakes to pay to each member of a class the average amount (regarding the chances of life and death); so that those who do not reach the average age get more than they have deposited, that is, paid in premiums (including interest) and those who exceed the average age less than they deposited (including interest). The dividend of a life insurance company may be regarded as paying back part of these deposits called premiums. The dividend is made possible because the amounts paid in as premium have earned \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 532]\n\u00a0\n more than it was assumed they would when the policy contract was made, or because the expense of conducting the business was less than it was then assumed it would be or because the mortality-that is, the deaths-in the class to which the policy holder belongs proved to be less than had then been assumed in fixing the premium rate. When for any or all of these reasons the net cost of the investment (that is, the right to receive at death or at the endowment date the agreed sum) has proved to be less than that for which provision was made, the difference may be regarded either as profit on the investment or as a saving in the expense of the protection. When the dividend is applied in reduction of the renewal premium, Congress might well regard the element of protection as predominant and treat the reduction of the premium paid by means of a dividend as merely a lessening of the expense of protection. But after the policy is paid up the element of investment predominates and Congress might reasonably regard the dividend substantially as profit on the investment.\n The dividends, aggregating $686,503, which the Penn Mutual Company insists should have been 'nonincluded,' or more properly deducted, from the gross income, were, in part, dividends on the ordinary limited payment life policies which had been paid up. There are others which arose under policy contracts in which the investment feature is more striking; for instance, the Accelerative Endowment Policy or such special form of contract as the 25-year '6% Investment Bond' matured and paid March, 1913, on which the policy holder received besides dividends, interest, and a 'share of forfeitures.' In the latter, as in 'Deferred Dividend' and other semi-tontine policies, the dividend represents in part what clearly could not b regarded as a repayment of excess premium of the policy holder receiving the dividend. For the 'share of the forfeiture' which he receives is the share of the redundancy in premium of other policy holders who \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 533]\n\u00a0\n did not persist in premium payments to the end of the contract period.\n Third. The noninclusion clause here in question, (c) above, is found in section II G(b) in juxtaposition to the provisions concerning mutual fire and mutual marine companies, clauses (a) and (b) above. The fact that in three separate clauses three different rules are prescribed by Congress for the treatment of redundant premiums in the three classes of insurance would seem to be conclusive evidence that Congress acted with deliberation and intended to differentiate between them in respect to income taxation. But the company, ignoring the differences in the provisions concerning fire and marine companies respectively, insists that mutual life insurance rests upon the same principles as mutual fire and marine, and that as the clauses concerning fire and marine companies provide specifically for noninclusion in or deduction from gross income of all portions of premiums returned, Congress must have intended to apply the same rule to all. Neither premise nor conclusion is sound.\n Mutual fire, mutual marine, and mutual life insurance companies are analogous in that each performs the service called insuring wholly for the benefit of their policy holders, and not like stock insurance companies in part for the benefit of persons who as stockholders have provided working capital on which they expect to receive dividends representing profits from their investment. In other words, these mutual companies are alike in that they are co-operative enterprises. But in respect to the service performed fire and marine companies differ fundamentally, as above pointed out, from legal reserve life companies. The thing for which a fire or marine insurance premium is paid is protection which ceases at the end of the term. If after the end of the term a part of the premium is returned to the policy holder, it is not returned as something purchased with the premium, but as a part of the premium \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 534]\n\u00a0\n which was not required to pay for the protection; that is, the expense was less than estimated. On the other hand, the service performed in level premium life insurance is both protection and investment. Premiums paid- not in the tax year, but perhaps a generation earlier-have earned so much for the cooperators that the company is able to pay to each not only the agreed amount, but also additional sums called dividends, and have earned these additional sums, in part at least, by transactions, not among the members, but with others, as by lending the money of the co-operators to third persons who pay a larger rate of interest than it was assumed would be received on investments. The fact that the investment resulting in accumulation or dividend is made by a cooperative as distinguished from a capitalistic concern does not prevent the amount thereof being properly deemed a profit on the investment. Nor does the fact that the profit was earned by a co-operative concern afford basis for the argument that Congress did not intend to tax the profit. Congress exempted certain co- operative enterprises from all income taxation, among others, mutual savings banks; but, with the exception of fraternal beneficiary societies, it imposed in express terms such taxation upon 'every insurance company.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The purpose of Congress to differentiate between mutual fire and marine insurance companies, on the one hand, and life insurance companies, on the other, is further manifested by this: The provision concerning return premiums in computation of the gross income of fire and marine insurance companies is limited in terms to mutual companies, whereas the noninclusion clause (c), above, relating to life \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 535]\n\u00a0\n insurance companies, applies whether the company be a stock or a mutual one. There is good reason tob elieve that the failure to differentiate between stock and mutual life insurance companies was not inadvertent. For while there is a radical difference between stock fire and marine companies and mutual fire and marine companies, both in respect to the conduct of the business and in the results to policy holders, the participating policy commonly issued by the stock life insurance company is, both in rights conferred and in financial results, substantially the same as the policy issued by a purely mutual life insurance company. The real difference between the two classes of life companies as now conducted lies in the legal right of electing directors and officers. In the stock company stockholders have that right; in the mutual companies the policy holders who are the members of the corporation.\n The Penn Mutual Company, seeking to draw support for its argument from legislation subsequent to the Revenne Act of 1913, points also to the fact that by the Act of September 8, 1916, c. 463,  12, subsec. second, subd. c. 39 Stat. 756, 768 (Comp. St.  6336l), the rule for computing gross income there provided for mutual fire insurance companies was made applicable to mutual employers' liability, mutual workmen's compensation, and mutual casualty insurance companies. It asserts that thereby Congress has manifested a settled policy to treat the taxable income of mutual concerns as not including premium refunds, and that, if mutual life insurance companies are not permitted to 'exclude' them, these companies will be the only mutual concerns which are thus discriminated against. Casualty insurance, in its various forms, like fire and marine insurance, provide only protection, and the premium is wholly an expense. If such later legislation could be considered in construing the act of 1913, the conclusion to be drawn from it would be clearly the opposite of that urged. The later act would tend to show that Congress \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 536]\n\u00a0\n persists in its determination to differentiate between life and other forms of insurance.\n Fourth. It is urged that in order to sustain the interpretation given to the noninclusion clause by the Circuit Court of Appeals (which was, in effect, the interpretation set forth above) it is necessary to interpolate in the clause the words 'within such year,' as shown in italics in brackets, thus:\n'And life insurance companies shall not include as income in any year such portion of any actual premiums received from any individual policy holder [within such year] as shall have been paid back or credited to such individual policy holder, or treated as an abatement of premium of such individual policy holder, within such year.'\n\n What has been said above shows that no such interpolation is necessary to sustain the construction given by the Circuit Court of Appeals. That court did not hold that the permitted noninclusion from the year's gross income is limited to that portion of the premium received within the year which, by reason of a dividend, is paid back within the same year. What the court held was that the noninclusion is limited to that portion of the premium which, although entered on the books as received, was not actually received within the year, because the full premium was, by means of the dividend, either reduced or otherwise wiped out to that extent. Nor does the government contend that any portion of a premium not received within the tax year shall be included in computing the year's gross income. On the other hand, what the company is seeking is not to have 'nonincluded' a part of the premiums which were actually received within the year, or which appear as matter of bookkeeping to have been received, but actually were not. It is seeking to have the aggregate of premiums actually received within the year reduced by an amount which the company paid out within \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 537]\n\u00a0\n the year, and which it paid out mainly on account of premiums received long before the tax year. What it seeks is not a noninclusion of amounts paid in, but a deduction of amount paid out.\n If the terms of the noninclusion clause (c), above, standing alone, permitted of an doubt as to its proper construction, the doubt would disappear when it is read in connection with the deduction clause (d), above. The deduction there prescribed is of 'the sums other than dividends paid within the year on policy and annuity contracts.' This is tantamount to a direction that dividends shall not be deducted. It was argued that the dividends there referred to are 'commercial' dividends like those upon capital stock, and that those here involved are dividends of a different character. But the dividends which the deduction clause says, in effect, shall not be deducted, are the very dividends here in question; that is, dividends 'on policy and annuity contracts.' None such may be deducted by any insurance company except as expressly provided for in the act, in clauses quoted above (a), (b), and (c); that is, clauses (a), (b), and (c) are, in effect, exceptions to the general exclusion of dividends from the permissible deductions as prescribed in clause (d) above.\n In support of the company's contention that the interpolation of the words 'within the year' is necessary in order to support the construction given to the act by the Circuit Court of Appeals we are asked to consider the legislative history of the Revenue Act of 1918 (enacted February 24, 1919, [40 Stat. 1057, c. 18]), and specifically to the fact that in the bill as introduced in and passed by the House the corresponding section- 233 (a); Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  6336 1\/8 p contained the words 'within the taxable year,' and that these words were stricken out by the Conference Committee (Report No. 1037, Sixty-Fifth Congress, Third Session ). The legislative history of an act may, where the meaning of the words used is doubt \n\n[252 U.S. 523, 538]\n\u00a0\n ful, be resorted to as an aid to construction. Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 490\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 192, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168. But no aid could possibly be derived from the legislative history of another act passed nearly six years after the one in question. Further answer to the argument based on the legislative history of the later act would, therefore, be inappropriate.\n We find no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n It is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The manner in which mutual level premium life insurance companies conduct their business, and the nature and application of dividends are fully set forth in Mutual Benefit Life Ins.

Where the margin between the probable losses and those reasonably possible is very large, the return premiums rise often to 90 per cent. or more of the premium paid. This is true of the manufacturers' mutual fire insurance companies of New England. See Report Massachusetts Insurance Commissioner (1913) vol.

The dividend provision in some of the participating policies involved in the Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. Case, supra, 218 Fed. 188, 192, was: 'Reduction of premiums as determined by the company will be made annually beginning at the second year, or the insured may pay te full premium and instruct the company to apply the amount of reduction apportioned to him in any one of the following plans: [ Then follow four plans.]' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Substantially the same questions were involved, also, in Connecticut General Life Ins.

The Court of \n\n[252 U.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n Appeals of New York (225 N. Y. 397, 122 N. E. 260) held that the Commission had such authority.\n The statute of the state of New York, section 65 Public Service Commission Law (Laws 1910, c. 480), provides:\n'Every gas corporation, every electrical corporation and every municipality shall furnish and provide such service, instrumentalities and facilities as shall be safe and adequate and in all respects just and reasonable. All charges made or demanded by any such gas corporation, electrical corporation or municipality for gas, electricity or any service rendered or to be rendered, shall be just and reasonable and not more than allowed by law or by order of the commission having jurisdiction. Every unjust or unreasonable charge made or demanded for gas, electricity or any such service, or in connection therewith, or in excess of that allowed by law or by the order of the commission is prohibited.'\n\n Consumers of gas, furnished by the plaintiff in error in the city of Jamestown, New York, filed a complaint demanding a reduction of gas rates in that city. The Public Service Commission asserted its jurisdiction which, as we have said,w as sustained by the Court of Appeals of New York.\n The federal question presented for our consideration involves the correctness of the contention of the plaintiff in error that the authority undertaken to be exercised by the commission, and sustained by the court, was an attempt under state authority to regulate interstate commerce, and violative of the constitutional power granted to Congress over commerce among the states. The facts are undisputed. The plaintiff in error, the Pennsylvania Gas Company, is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Pennsylvania and engaged in transmitting and selling natural gas in the state of New York and Pennsylvania. It transports the gas by pipe lines about fifty miles in length from the source \n\n[252 U.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n of supply in the state of Pennsylvania into the state of New York. It sells and delivers gas to consumers in the city of Jamestown, in the town of Ellicott, and in the village of Falconer, all in Chatauqua county, New York. It also sells and delivers natural gas to consumers in the cities of Warren, Corry and Erie in Pennsylvania.\n We think that the transmission and sale of natural gas produced in one state, transported by means of pipe lines and directly furnished to consumers in another state is interstate commerce within the principles of the cases already determined by this court. West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n221 U.S. 229\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 564, 35 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1193; Haskell v. Kansas Natural Gas Co., \n224 U.S. 217\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 442; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Foster, \n247 U.S. 105\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 438, 1 A. L. R. 1278\n\n\n This case differs from Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, \n249 U.S. 236\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 268, wherein we dealt with the piping of natural gas from one state to another, and its sale to independent local gas companies in the receiving state, and held that the retailing of gas by the local companies to their consumers was intrastate commerce and not a continuation of interstate commerce, although the mains of the local companies receiving and distributing the gas to local consumers were connected permanently with those of the transmitting company. Under the circumstances set forth in that case we held that the interstate movement ended when the gas passed into the local mains; that the rates to be charged by the local companies had but an indirect effect upon interstate commerce and, therefore, the matter was subject to local regulation.\n In the instant case the gas is transmitted directly from the source of supply in Pennsylvania to the consumers in the cities and towns of New York and Pennsylvania, above mentioned. Its transmission is direct, and without intervention of any sort between the seller and the buyer. The transmission is continuous and single and is in our opinion, a transmission in interstate commerce, and there fore \n\n[252 U.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n subject to applicable constitutional limitations which govern the states in dealing with matters of the character of the one now before us.\n The general principle is well established and often asserted in the decisions of this court that the state may not directly regulate or burden interstate commerce. That subject, so far as legislative regulation is concerned, has been committed by the Constitution to the control of the federal Congress. But while admitting this general principle, it, like others of a general nature, is subject to qualifications not inconsistent with the general rule, which now are as well established as the principle itself.\n In dealing with interstate commerce it is not in some instances regarded as an infringement upon the authority delegated to Congress, to permit the states to pass laws indirectly affecting such commerce, when needed to protect or regulate matters of local interest. Such laws are operative until Congress acts under its superior authority by regulating the subject-matter for itself. In varying forms this subject has frequently been before this court. h e previous cases were fully reviewed and deductions made therefrom in the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18. The paramount authority of Congress over the regulation of interstate commerce was again asserted in those cases. It was nevertheless recognized that there existed in the states a permissible exercise of authority, which they might use until Congress had taken possession of the field of regulation. After stating the limitations upon state authority, of this subject, we said (\n230 U.S. 402\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 741, 48 L. R. A. [N. S.] 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18):\n'But within these limitations there necessarily remains to the states, until Congress acts, a wide range for the permissible exercise of power appropriate to their territorial jurisdiction although interstate commerce may be affected. It extends to those matters of a local nature as to which it is impossible to derive from the constitutional grant an intention that they should go uncontrolled \n\n[252 U.S. 23, 30]\n\u00a0\n pending federal intervention. Thus, there are certain subjects having the most obvious and direct relation to interstate commerce, which nevertheless, with the acquiescence of Congress, have been controlled by state Legislature from the foundation of the government because of the necessity that they should not remain unregulated and that their regulation should be adapted to varying local exigencies; hence, the absence of regulation by Congress in such matters has not imported that there should be no restriction but rather that the states should continue to supply the needed rules until Congress should decide to supersede them. ... Our system of government is a practical adjustment by which the national authority as conferred by the Constitution is maintained in its full scope without unnecessary loss of local efficiency. Where the subject is peculiarly one of local concern, and from its nature belongs to the class with which the state appropriately deals in making reasonable provision for local needs, it cannot be regarded as left to the unrestrained will of individuals because Congress has not acted, although it may have such a relation to interstate commerce as to be within the reach of the federal power. In such case, Congress must be the judge of the necessity of federal action. Its paramount authority always enables it to intervene at its discretion for the complete and effective government of that which has been committed to its care, and, for this purpose and to this extent, in response to a conviction of national need, to displace local laws by substituting laws of its own. The successful working of our constitutional system has thus been made possible.'\n\n The rates of gas companies transmitting gas in interstate commerce are not only not regulated by Congress, but the Interstate Commerce Act expressly withholds the subject from federal control. Chapter 309,  7, 36 Stat. 539, 544 (Comp. St.  8563).\n The thing which the state commission has undertaken to regulate, while part of an interstate transmission, \n\n[252 U.S. 23, 31]\n\u00a0\n is local in its nature, and pertains to the furnishing of natural gas to local consumers within the city of Jamestown in the state of New York. The pipes which reach the customers served are supplied with gas directly from the main of the company which brings it into the state, nevertheless the service rendered is essentially local, and the sale of gas is by the company to local consumers who are reached by the use of the streets of the city in which the pipes are laid, and through which the gas is conducted to factories and residences as it is required for use. The service is similar to that of a local plant furnishing gas to consumers in a city.\n This local service is not of that character which requires general and uniform regulation of rates by congressional action, and which has always been held beyond the power of the states although Congress has not legislated upon the subject. While the manner in which th business is conducted is part of interstate commerce, its regulation in the distribution of gas to the local consumers is required in the public interest and has not been attempted under the superior authority of Congress.\n It may be conceded that the local rates may affect the interstate business of the company. But this fact does not prevent the state from making local regulations of a reasonable character. Such regulations are always subject to the exercise of authority by Congress enabling it to exert its superior power under the commerce clause of the Constitution.\n The principles announced, often reiterated in the decisions of this court were applied in the judgment affirmed by the Court of Appeals of New York, and we agree with that court that until the subject-matter is regulated by congressional action, the exercise of authority conferred by the state upon the Public Service Commission is not violative of the commerce clause of the federal Constitution.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","122":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPENNSYLVANIA R.

The judgment there entered was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state, and a petition by the railroad for a writ of certiorari was granted, \n249 U.S. 595\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 260.\n Before receipt of any of the cars the Kittaning Company had entered into an average agreement with the railroad as provided in rule 9.1 The aggregate number of days detention of these cars after they reached the company's interchange tracks (in excess of the free time under the average agreement), was 1209; and the demurrage \n\n[253 U.S. 319, 322]\n\u00a0\n charge fixed by rule 7 was $1 for each day, or fraction thereof, that a car is detained after the expiration of the free time. The ore in these cars was frozen in transit; and the company insisted that this detention of the cars beyond the 'free time' had resulted from this fact and claimed exemption from demurrage charges under rule 8, section A, subdivision 2, which declares that none shall be collected--\n'when shipments are frozen while in transit so as to prevent unloading during the prescribed free time. This exemption shall not include shipments which are tendered to consignee in condition to unload. Under this rule consignees will be required to make diligent efforts to unload such shipments.'\n\n The Kittaning Company had at its plant a device for thawing cars of frozen ore through 'steaming.' By this means it was able to unload as much as 5 cars of frozen ore a day. The daily average number of cars of frozen ore received during the three months was far less than 5 cars; but the number received on single days varied greatly. On many days none were received; on some only 1 or 2; and on soe , as many as 35. The railroad contended that the standard to be applied for determining, under the rule here in question, whether unloading within the prescribed free time was prevented by the shipments being frozen, was, as in other cases under the Code, the conditions applied to the car treated as a unit. It insisted, therefore, that the determination in any case whether a detention was due to the fact that the contents of a car was frozen could not be affected by the circumstances that a large number of such cars happened to have been 'bunched,' and that, as each car considered separately could have been unloaded within the free time, the consignee must bear whatever hardship might result from many having arrived on the same day, unless relief were available to him either under the 'bunching \n\n[253 U.S. 319, 323]\n\u00a0\n rule'2 or under the 'average agreement.' The question presented is that of construing and applying the frozen shipments clause. But in order to determine the meaning or effect of that clause, it is necessary that it be read in connection with others.\n The purpose of demurrage charges is to promote car efficiency by penalizing undue detention of cars. The duty of loading and of unloading carload shipments rests upon the shipper or consignee. To this end he is entitled to detain the car a reasonable time without any payment in addition to the published freight rate. The aim of the Code was to prescribe rules, to be applied uniformly throughout the country, by which it might be determined what detention is to be deemed reasonable. In fixing the free time the framers of the Code adopted an external standard; that is, they refused to allow the circumstances of the particular shipper to be considered.\n When they prescribed 48 hours as the free time they fixed the period which, in their opinion, was reasonably required by the average shipper to avail himself of the carrier's service under ordinary circumstances. The framers of the Code made no attempt to equalize conditions among shippers. It was obvious that the period fixed was more than would be required by many shippers most of the time, at least for certain classes of traffic; and that it was less than would be required by some shippers, most of the time, for any kind of traffic. Among the reasons urged for rejecting consideration of the needs or \n\n[253 U.S. 319, 324]\n\u00a0\n merits of the individual shipper, was the fear that, under the guise of exempting shippers from demurrage charges because of conditions peculiar to them, unjust discrimination and rebates to favored shippers might result.\n In applying the allowance of free time and the charges for demurrage the single car was treated throughout as the unit, just as it is in the making of carload freight rates. Compare Darling & Co. v. Pittsburgh, etc., Ry. Co., 37 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 401. The effect on the charges of there being several cars involved was, however, provided for by two rules: (1) The bunching rule, under which the shipper is relieved from charges, if by reason of the carrier's fault, the cars are accumulated and detention results. (2) The average agreement rule, under which a monthly debit and credit account is kept of detention and the shipper is relieved of charges for detaining cars more than 48 hours by credit for other cars released within twenty-four hours.\n It was urged that the use in this rule of the word 'shipment' and not 'car,' implies that the whole consignment is to be considered in determining whether the delay was caused by the ore being frozen. Obviously the word 'shipment' was used because it is not the car, but that shipped in it, which is frozen. Furthermore the agreed facts do not state whether the cars, which by their number prevented unloading within the 48 hours, came in one consignment or in many.\n Excessive receipts of cars is a frequent cause of detention beyond the free time even where shipments are not frozen. From the resulting hardship either the bunching rule or the average agreement ordinarily furnish relief. If the compan had not elected to enter into the average agreement, the bunching rule might have afforded relief under the circumstances which attended the deliveries here in question. Since any 1 of the 227 cars on which demurrage was assessed might have been unloaded within \n\n[253 U.S. 319, 325]\n\u00a0\n the 48 hours free time, the undue detention was not the necessary result of the ore therein being frozen, but was the result of there being an accumulation of cars so great as to exceed the unloading capacity. Compare Riverside Mills v. Charleston and Western Carolina Ry. Co., 20 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 153, 155; Central Penn. Lumber Co. v. Director General, 53 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 523. It does not seem probable that those who framed and adopted the frozen shipment rule and the Interstate Commerce Commission, which approved it, intended therein to depart from the established policy of treating the single car as the unit in applying demurrage charges as well as in applying carload freight rates. Such was the conclusion reached in the informal ruling of the commission to which counsel called attention.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania is\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rule 9. Average Agreement.-When a shipper or receiver enters into the following agreement, the charge for detention to cars, provided for by rule 7, on all cars held for loading or unloading by such shipper or receiver shall be computed on the basis of the average time of detention to all such cars released during each calendar month, such average detention to be computed as follows:\n Section A. A credit of one day will be allowed for each car released within the first twenty-four hours of free time. A debit of one day will be charged for each twenty-four hours or fraction thereof that a car is detained beyond the first forty-eight hours of free time. In no case shall more than one day's credit be allowed on any one car, and in no case shall more than five (5) days' credit be applied in cancellation of debits accruing on any car, making a maximum of seven (7) days that any car may be held free; this to include Sundays and holidays.\n Section B. At the end of the calendar month the total number of days credited will be deducted from the total number of days debited, and $1.00 per day charged for the remainder. If the credits equal or exceed the debits, no charge will be made for the detention of the cars, and no payment will be made to shippers or receivers on account of such excess, nor shall the credits in excess of the debits of any one calendar month be considered in computing the average detention for another month.\n Section C. A shipper or receiver who elects to take advantage of this average agreement shall not be entitled to cancellation or refund of demurrage charges under section A, paragraphs 1 and 3, or section B, of rule 8. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rule 8. Section B. Bunching.-2. When, as the result of the act or neglect of any carrier, cars destined for one consignee, at one point, are bunched at originating point, in transit, or at destination, and delivered by the railroad company in accumulated numbers in excess of daily shipments, the consignee shall be allowed such free time as he would have been entitled to had the cars been delivered in accordance with the daily rate of shipment.

MEALY(1920)\nNo. 63\nArgued: Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. William L. Visscher and Lewis E. Carr, both of Albany, N. Y., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. George B. Wellington, of Troy, N. Y., for defendants in error. \n\n[254 U.S. 47, 48]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a proceeding in the Supreme Court of New York seeking by certiorari to review and set aside an assessment of city taxes upon the relator's property at a valuation of one million dollars; the relator contending that it had a contract by virtue of which the City to Troy and the State were limited to a valuation of $30,000 for the purposes of the tax. A referee, a single judge, the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals successively have decided against the relator's claim, but it brings the case here on the ground that an attempt to repeal the statute upon which it bases its immunity impairs the obligation of contracts and is void. 88 Misc. Rep. 649, 152 N. Y. Supp. 435; 179 App. Div. 951, 165 N. Y. Supp. 1109; 224 N. Y. 187, 120 N. E. 155.\n The case is this. In 1851 it was desired to establish a common terminal station and common tracks passing through a portion of the City for four railroads then having termini in Troy. An act of that year, c. 255, authorized the City and the four roads to subscribe for the stock of a new corporation to be formed for that purpose, and the City to issue bonds when secured by a mortgage of the new road to be built and by contract of the four subscribing roads. In July, 1851, the contemplated corporation was formed with a stock of $30,000; it is the relator in this suit. Then on December 3, 1852, an agreement was made by the City of Troy, the Troy Union Railroad Company, and the four other railroads, providing for carrying out the plan, and therein the City covenanted to join in an application to the Legislature of New York that the new road should be exempt from taxation upon an amount exceeding the present amount of its capital stock, and, if such law should not be passed, to refund the amount of the city taxes for any valuation exceeding said present stock. The above mentioned mortgage was executed, the four roads gave the City their covenant of indemnity and \n\n[254 U.S. 47, 49]\n\u00a0\n thereafter on June 24, 1853, the desired act of the Legislature was passed. Laws of 1853, c. 462. It provided that--\n'for the purposes of taxation in the City of Troy, and in the County of Rensselaer, the property of the Troy Union Railroad Company shall be estimated and assessed (as the common council of said City of Troy, by its contract with said Company, ... agreed that the same should be) at the amount of the capital stock of said Company, and no more.'\n\n The above mentioned covenant of the City and this provision of the statute are the grounds upon which the relator founds its claim.\n After 1853 there was a default in the payment of the interest on the bonds that had been issued by the City under the agreement and the City began an action to foreclose the mortgage given by the road to secure it. Thereupon in 1858 a new contract was made between the parties concerned in which they 'for the purpose of reforming the contract [made in 1852] adopt this instead and in place of the said contract, which is hereby annulled.' The City of Troy agreed that if the Act of 1853 should be repealed at any time it would join in an application to the Legislature, as in the former contract, and covenanted again that if the desired law should not be passed it would refund as before. The other arrangements do not need mention here.\n In 1886 and 1887 the Assessors of Troy assessed the Troy Union Railroad Company for $783,984 instead of the agreed $30,000, but it was held that the Company's property above $30,000 was exempt. People ex rel. Troy Union R. R. Co. v. Carter, 52 Hun, 458, 5 N. Y. Supp. 507; 117 N. Y. 625, 22 N. E. 1128. In 1909, however, the Act of 1853 was repealed. Acts of 1909, c. 201. The assessment complained of in this case was made since this repeal.\n The Court of Appeals held that the concession in the Act of 1853 was spontaneous and belonged to the class of privilegia favorabilia, as it is put in Christ Church v. \n\n[254 U.S. 47, 50]\n\u00a0\n Philadelphia County, 24 How. 300, and therefore was subject to repeal. This is a question upon which we should be slow to differ with a decision of the New York courts with regard to a New York corporation. It may be that too mach stress was laid upon the absence of a consideration for the exemption (Wisconsin & Michigan Ry. Co. v. Powers, \n191 U.S. 379\n, 385-387, 24 Sup. Ct. 107), and that a fairly strong argument could be made for interpreting the grant of 1853 as purporting to be coextensive with the contract recited in that grant, whether correctly recited or not. It may be, if it were material, that the contract of 1858 should be construed as a continuance of that of 1852 as reformed notwithstanding the habitually inaccurately used word 'annulled.' United States v. McMullen, \n222 \nU.S. 460, 471\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 128. But taking into consideration the general attitude of the Courts toward claims of exemption, adverted to by the Court of Appeals, the fact that the agreement of 1858 shows that the parties concerned did not suppose that they had an irrevocable grant, and especially the fact that the Consitution of New York in force in 1853, provided in Article VIII,  1, that all general laws and special acts passed pursuant to that section might be altered or repealed, we are not prepared to say that the decision below was wrong. We are dealing, of course, only with the contract supposed to be embodied in the Act of 1853. The liability of the City on its covenant to refund taxes upon an assessment exceeding $30,000 was not passed upon below and is not before us in this case.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","124":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPHILADELPHIA & R R.

Ed. --.\n The essential facts are not in controversy; the nature of the employment, therefore, is a question of law.\n The duties of the deceased never took him out of Pennsylvania; they related solely to transporting coal from the mines. When injured he belonged to a crew operating a train of loaded cars from Locust Gap colliery to Locust Summit yard, two miles away. The ultimate destination of some of these cars was outside of Pennsylvania. This appeared from instruction cards or memoranda delivered to the conductor by the shipping clerk at the mine. Each of these referred to a particular car by number and contained certain code letters indicating that such car with its load would move beyond the state.\n Pursuing the ordinary course these cars were hauled to \n\n[253 U.S. 284, 286]\n\u00a0\n Locust Summit yard and placed upon appropriate tracks; there the duties of the first crew in respect of them terminated. Later, having gathered them into a train, another crew moved them some 10 miles to Shamokin scales, where they were inspected, weighed, and billed to specifically designated consignees in another state. In due time they passed to their final destinations over proper lines. Freight charges at through rates were assessed and paid for the entire distance beginning at the mine.\n Respondent maintains that the coal in cars ticketed for transportation as above described did not become part of interstate commerce until such cars reached Shamokin scales and were there weighed and billed. But we think former opinions of this court require the contrary conclusion. The coal was in the course of transportation to another state when the cars left the mine. There was no interruption of the movement; it always continued towards points as originally intended. The determining circumstance is that the shipment was but a step in the transportation of the coal to real and ultimate destinations in another state. Coe v. Errol, \n116 U.S. 517\n, 6 Sup.

Brua Campbell, all of New York City, for petitioner.\n Messrs. Philip L. Miller, and Royall Victor, both of New York City, for respondent.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Atlantic Phosphate & Oil Corporation owned a fleet of nineteen fishing steamers. It owned also factories at Promised Land, Long Island, and Tiverton, Rhode Island, to which the fish caught were delivered and at which its vessels coaled. When the fishing season of 1914 opened the company was financially embarrassed. Its steamers and factories had been mortgaged to secure an issue of bonds. Bills for supplies theretofore furnished remained unpaid. The company had neither money nor credit. It could not enter upon the season's operations unless some arrangement should be made to supply its vessels and factories with coal. After some negotiations, the Piedmont & George's Creek Coal Company, then a creditor for coal delivered during the year 1913, agreed to furnish the Oil Corporation such coal as it would require during the season of 1914-the understanding of the parties being that the coal to be delivered would be used by the factories as well as by the vessels, that the greater part would be used by the vessels, that the law would afford a lien on the vessels for the purchase price of the coal and that the Coal Company would thus have security. Shipments of coal were made under this agreement from time to time during the spring and summer as ordered by the Oil Corporation. In the autumn receivers for the corporation were appointed by the District Court of the United States for the District of Rhode Island, and later a suit was brought to foreclose the mortgage upon the vessels and factories. At the time the receivers were appointed five cargoes of coal shipped under the above agreement had not been paid for. The Coal Company libeled twelve of the steamers asserting maritime liens for the price and value of either all the coal or of such parts as had been used by the libeled vessels respectively. \n\n[254 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n Meanwhile, the vessels were sold under the decree of foreclosure. The Seaboard Fisheries Company became the purchaser and, intervening as claimant in the lien proceedings, denied liability. The District Court held that the Coal Company had a maritime lien on each vessel for the coal received by it. The William B. Murray (D. C.) 240 Fed. 147. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed these decrees with cost and directed that the libels be dismissed. The Walter Adams, 253 Fed. 20, 165 C. C. A. 40. Then this Court granted the Coal Company's petition for a writ of certiorari. \n248 U.S. 556\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 12.\n As to the facts proved there is no disagreement between the two lower courts. The substantial question presented is whether these facts constitute a furnishing of supplies by the Coal Company to the vessels upon order of the owner within the provisions of the Act of June 23, 1910, c. 373,  1, 36 Stat. 604 (Comp. St.  7783).1\n That coal was furnished to the vessels to the extent to which they severally received it on board, is clear. The precise question, therefore, is: Was the coal furnished by the libelant, the Coal Company, or was it furnished by the Oil Corporation, the owner of the fleet? In determining this question additional facts must be considered:\n No coal was delivered by the Coal Company directly to any vessel; and it had no dealings of any kind concerning the coal directly with the officers of any vessel. All the coal was billed by the Coal Company to the Oil Corporation and there was no reference on any invoice, or on its books, either to the fleet or to any vessel. There \n\n[254 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n was no understanding between the companies when the agreement to supply the coal was made or when the coal was delivered that any part of it was specifically for any one of the several vessels libeled, or that it was for any particular vessel of the fleet, or even for the vessels then composing the fleet. Indeed, the first shipment was stated on the invoice to be 'coal for factory.' The negotiations of the Oil Corporation with the Coal Company did not relate to coal required at that time by the particular vessels subsequently libeled as distinguished from other vessels of the fleet.\n The coal was sold f. o. b. at the Coal Company's piers which were at St. George, Staten Island, and Port Reading, New Jersey. At these piers it was loaded on barges which were towed either to the Oil Corporation's plant at Promised Land or to that at Tiverton. Some of these barges were supplied by the Oil Corporation, some by the Coal Company. If supplied by the latter, trimming and towing charges were added to the agreed price of the coal. Upon arrival of the coal at the factories it was placed in the Oil Corporation's bins. At Promised Land-which received four of the five shipments-the bins already contained other coal (1,068 tons) which had been theretofore purchased by the Oil Corporation and had been paid for. With this coal on hand that delivered by libelant was commingled. At each plant both the vessels and the factory were from time to time supplied with coal from the same bins; but the greater part of the coal supplied from each plant was used by the vessels. Weeks, and in some instances months, elapsed between placing the coal in the bins and the delivery of it by the corporation to the several vessels. When it made such deliveries it furnished coal to the vessels, as it did to the factories, not under direction of the Coal Company but in its discretion as owner of the coal and of the business.\n The quantity of coal delivered to each vessel was \n\n[254 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n proved; but to what extent the coal supplied to the several vessels which bunkered at Promised Land came from the 1,068 tons previously purchased, and to what extent it came from the lots purchased from the Coal Company it was impossible to determine. In making the computations which formed the basis of the decrees in the District Court it was assumed, that of the coal supplied to the several vessels which bunkered at Promised Land, a proportionate part of that received by each had come from the coal purchased from libelant.\n The Coal Company contends on these facts that it furnished necessary supplies to the several vessels within the meaning of section 1 of the Act of June 23, 1910. But the facts show that no coal was furnished by that company to any vessel 'upon order of the owner.' The title to the coal had passed to the Oil Corporation when it was loaded on board the barges at the Coal Company's piers. It was delivered to Promised Land and Tiverton as the Oil Corporation's coal and placed in its bins. As its coal the later distribution was made in its discretion to vessels and factories. A large part of the coal so acquired by the Oil Corporation for use in its business was subsequently appropriated by it specifically to the use of the several vessels of the fleet and this use of the coal by vessels of the fleet was a use which had been contemplated by the parties when it was purchased. But the fact that such a use had been contemplated does not render the subsequent appropriation by the owner a furnishing by the coal dealer to the several vessels.\n To hold that a lien for the unpaid purchase price of supplies arises in favor of the seller merely because the purchaser, who is the owner of a vessel, subsequently appropriates the supplies to her use would involve abandonment of the principle upon which mar itime liens rest and the substitution therefor of the very different principle \n\n[254 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n which underlies mechanics' and materialmen's liens on houses and other structures. The former had its origin in desire to protect the ship; the latter mainly in desire to protect those who furnish work and materials. The maritime lien developed as a necessary incident of the operation of vessels. The ship's function is to move from place to place. She is peculiarly subject to vicissitudes which would compel abandonment of vessel or voyage, unless repairs and supplies were promptly furnished. Since she is usually absent from the home port, remote from the residence of her owners and without any large amount of money, it is essential that she should be self-reliant-that she should be able to obtain upon her own account needed repairs and supplies. The recognition by the law of such inherent power did not involve any new legal conception, since the ship had been treated in other connections as an entity capable of entering into relations with others, of acting independently and of becoming responsible for her acts. Because the ship's need was the source of the maritime lien it could arise only if the repairs of supplies were necessary; if the pledge of her credit was necessary to the obtaining of them; if they were actually obtained; and if they were furnished upon her credit. The mechanic's and materialman's lien, on the other hand, attaches ordinarily although the labor and material cannot be said to have been necessary; although at the time they were furnished there was no thought of obtaining security upon the building; and although the credit of the owner or of others had in fact been relied upon. The principle upon which the mechanic's lien rests is, in a sense, that of unjust enrichment. Ordinarily, it is the equity arising from assumed enhancement in value resulting from work or materials expended upon the property without payment therefor which is laid hold of to protect workmen and others who, it is assumed, are especially deserving, would ordinarily fail \n\n[254 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n to provide by agreement for their own protection and would often be unable to do so.2\n The fact found by the lower courts that the parties understood the law would afford a lien on the vessels for the coal is, in this controversy, without legal significance. If the coal had been furnished to the several vessels by the libelant, maritime liens would have arisen and could have been established under the statute without proof that credit was given to the vessels. Since the libelant did not furnish any coal to the vessels, the erroneous belief of the parties that the law would afford a lien either for all the coal furnished to the Oil Corporation or for that delivered by it to the several vessels could not create a lien under the statute. Clearly no maritime lien could arise therefrom valid as against the claimant which had acquired title to the vessels under a mortgage antedating the purchase. Astor Trust Co. v. E. V. White & Co., 241 Fed. 57, 154 C. C. A. 57, L. R. A. 1917E, 526.\n The difficulty which confronts the Coal Company does not lie in the fact that the contract for the coal was made with the Oil Corporation. A vessel may be made liable in rem for supplies, although the owner can be made liable therefor in personam, since the dealer may rely upon the credit of both. The Bronx, 246 Fed. 809, 159 C. C. A. 111. Likewise, the fact that the coal which was supplied to the several vessels had been purchased under a single contract presents no difficulty. For while one vessel of a fleet cannot be made liable under the statute for supplies furnished to the others, even if the supplies are furnished to all upon orders of the owner under a single contract (The Columbus [D. C.] 65 Fed. 430; Id., 67 Fed. 553, 14 C. C. A. 522; The \n\n[254 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n Newport, 114 Fed. 713, 52 C. C. A. 415; The Alligator, 161 Fed. 37, 88 C. C. A. 201; Astor Trust Co. v. E. V. White & Co., 241 Fed. 57, 61, 154 C. C. A. 57, L. R. A. 1917E, 526), each vessel so receiving supplies may be made liable for the supplies furnished to it (The Murphy Tugs [D. C.] 28 Fed. 429). The difficulty which under the general maritime law would have blocked recovery by the Coal Company is solely that it did not furnish coal to the vessels upon which it asserts a maritime lien; and there is nothing in the Act of June 23, 1910 (Comp. St.  7783-7787), which removes that obstacle.\n It is urged by the Coal Company that it was the intention of Congress in passing the act to broaden the scope of the maritime lien and that the construction of the act adopted by the Circuit Court of Appeals renders the statute inoperative in an important class of cases which it was intended to reach. The language of the statute affords no basis for the latter assertion, and the Reports of the Committees of Congress (Senate Report, No. 831, Sixty-First Congress, Second Session) show that it is unfounded. Those reports state that the purpose of the act was this: First, to do away with the artificial distinction by which a maritime lien was given for supplies furnished to a vessel in a port of a foreign country or state, but denied where the supplies were furnished in the home port or state. The General Smith, 4 Wheat. 438. Second, to do away with the doctrine that when the owner of a vessel contracts in person for necessaries or is present in the port when they are ordered, it is presumed that the materialman did not intend to rely upon the credit of the vessel, and that hence no lien arises. The St. Jago de Cuba, 9 Wheat. 409. Third, to substitute a single federal statute for the state statutes in so far as they confer liens for repairs, supplies and other necessaries. Peyroux v. Howard, 7 Pet. 324. The reports expressly declare that the bill makes 'no change in the general principles of the law of maritime liens, but merely substitutes a single \n\n[254 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n statute for the conflicting state statutes.' The act relieves the libelant of the burden of proving that credit was given to the ship when necessaries are furnished to her upon order of the owner, but it in no ways lessens the materialman's burden of proving that the supplies in question were furnished to her by him upon order of the owner or of some one acting by his authority. The maritime lien is a secret one. It may operate to the prejudice of prior mortgagees or of purchasers without notice. It is therefore stricti juris and will not be extended by construction, analogy or inference. The Yankee Blade (Vandewater v. Mills) 19 How. 82, 89; The Cora P. White (D. C.) 243 Fed. 246, 248.\n The Coal Company relies strongly upon The Kiersage, Fed. Cas. No. 7, 762, 2 Curtis, 421, Berwind-White Coal Mining Co. v. Metropolitan Steamship Co. (C. C.) 166 Fed. 782, and American Trust Co. W. & A. Fletcher, 173 Fed. 471, 97 C. C. A. 477. The language of the state statutes there under consideration differs from that of the federal act. Furthermore, the state legislation creating liens for work and materials furnished in the repair and supply, as well as in the construction of vessels, are largely extensions of the local mechanic's lien laws applicable to attention The Yankee, 233 Fed. 919, 925, 927,\n The Coal Company also urges upon our attention, the Yankee, 233 Fed. 919, 925, 927, 147 C. C. A. 593. There the court in sustaining a maritime lien declared that the supplies were delivered not to the charterer but to the vessel, holding that--\n'A materialman may make actual delivery of supplies to a vessel in the maritime sense, by causing them to be transported by rail and buildings. \n3\n point of origin to the vessel side, when the attention The Yankee, 233 Fed. 919, 925, 927, that the supplies are for the vessel and are to be delivered to her, and is completed by an actual delivery to the vessel \n\n[254 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n consistent with the instructions of the order and intentions of the parties giving and accepting it.'\n\n And in respect to the coal supplied the court there found specifically that--\n'The quantity to be supplied to and daily consumed by the Yankee, was mentioned and considered by the parties. ...'\n\n In the case at bar there was no understanding when the contract was made, or when the coal was delivered by the libelant, that any part of it was for any particular vessel or even for the vessels then composing the fleet. And it was clearly understood that the purchasing corporation would apply part of the coal to a nonmaritime use. The difficulty here (unlike that presented in Vigilancia [D. C.] 58 Fed. 698; The Cimbria [D. C.] 156 Fed. 378, 382; and The Curtin [D. C.] 165 Fed. 271) is not in failure to show that the coal was furnished to the vessels but in failure to prove that it was furnished by the libelant.\n It was also argued that the parties made an express agreement that the Coal Company should have a lien; that is, that they created by agreement a nonstatutory lien.

The cases involve the same facts differently stated by different complainants. The asserted warrant for the appeals in that action taken by the officials of the town of Graham, North Carolina, if allowed to become effective, would result in violation of appellants' contract with that town and in depriving them of their property without due process of law, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n Since the bill in No. 684 contains all of the elements of strength which the bill in No. 685 contains and lacks some of its elements of weakness, the disposition of the former will rule the latter.\n In No. 684 the appellant, a corporation, averring that it is the owner of a franchise to use the streets of the town of Graham for the distribution of electric current, prays that the officals of the town be restrained from certifying as lawfully passed an ordinance granting a like franchise to the defendant the Mutual Power & Light Company, and that the company be enjoined from using the streets for such purpose.\n The grant to the appellant is set out in full in the bill and plainly it is not one of exclusive rights in the streets. The attempt to derive an exclusive grant from the declaration, in the paragraph of the ordinance relating to the trimming of trees, that 'said town of Graham hereby warrants that it will, by its proper authorities, provide for the full and free use of its streets, lanes,' etc., is fatuous and futile.

The grant to appellant not being an exclusive one, the contention that competition in business, likely to result from a similar grant to another company, would be a violation of appellant's contract, or a taking of its property in violation of the Constitution of the United States is so plainly frivolous that the motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, filed in each case, must be sustained.

Mohr, of Auburn, N. Y., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiffs in error were jointly indicted October 2, 1917, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, upon six counts, of which the fourth and fifth were struck out by agreement at the trial and the first is now abandoned by the government.\n The second count charged that throughout the period from \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 241]\n\u00a0\n April 6, 1917, to the date of the presentation of the indictment, the United States being at war with the Imperial German government, defendants at the city of Albany, in the Northern district of New York and within the jurisdiction, etc., unlawfully and feloniously conspired together and with other persons to the grand jurors unknown to commit an offense against the United States, to wit:\n'The offense of unlawfully, feloniously and willfully attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces of the United States when the United States was at war and to the injury of the United States in, through, and by personal solicitations, public speeches and distributing and publicly circulating throughout the United States certain articles printed in pamphlets called 'The Price We Pay,' which said pamphlets were to be distributed publicly throughout the Northern district of New York, and which said solicitations, speeches, articles and pamphlets would and should persistently urge insubordination, disloyalty and refusal of duty in the said military and naval forces of the United States to the injury of the United States and its military and naval service and failure and refusal on the part of available persons to enlist therein and should and would through and by means above mentioned obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States when the United States was at war to the injury of that service and of the United States.'\n\n For overt acts it was alleged that certain of the defendants, in the city of Albany, at times specified, made personal solicitations and public speeches, and especially that they published and distributed to certain persons named and other persons to the grand jurors unknown certain pamphlets headed 'The Price We pay,' a copy of which was annexed to the indictment and made a part of it.\n The third count charged that during the same period and on August 26, 1917, the United States being at war, etc., \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 242]\n\u00a0\n defendants at the city of Albany, etc., willfully and feloniously made, distributed, and conveyed to certain persons named and others to the grand jurors unknown certain false reports and false statements in certain pamphlets attached to and made a part of the indictment and headed 'The Price We Pay,' which false statements were in part as shown by certain extracts quoted from the pamphlet, with intent to interfere with the operation and success of the military and naval forces of the United States.\n The sixth count charged that at the same place, during the same period and on August 27, 1917, while the United States was at war, etc., defendants willfully and feloniously attempted to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, and refusal of duty in the military and naval service of the United States by means of the publication, circulation, and distribution of 'The Price We Pay' to certain persons named and others to the grand jurors unknown.\n A general demurrer was overruled, whereupon defendants pleaded not guilty and were put on trial together, with the result that Pierce, Creo, and Zeilman were found guilty upon the first, second, third, and sixth counts, and Nelson upon the third count only. Each defendant was separately sentenced to a term of imprisonment upon each count on which he had been found guilty; the several sentences of Pierce, Creo, and Zeilman, however, to run concurrently.\n The present direct writ of error was sued out under section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215), because of contentions that the Selective Draft Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  2044a- 2044k) and the Espionage Act (40 Stat. 217) were unconstitutional. These have since been set at rest. Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 U.S. 366\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 159, L. R. A. 1918C, 361, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 856; Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 51\n, 39 S. Sup.

But our jurisdiction continues for the purpose of disposing of other questions raised in the record. Brolan v. United States, \n236 U.S. 216\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 285. \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 243]\n\u00a0\n It is insisted that there was error in refusing to sustain the demurrer, and this on the ground that (1) the facts and circumstances upon which the allegation of conspiracy rested were not stated; (2) there was a failure to set forth facts or circumstances showing unlawful motive or intent; (3) there was a failure to show a clear and present danger that the distribution of the pamphlet would bring about the evils that Congress sought to prevent by the enactment of the Espionage Act; and (4) that the statements contained in the pamphlet were not such as would naturally produce the forbidden consequences.\n What we have recited of the second count shows a sufficiently definite averment of a conspiracy and overt acts under the provisions of title 1 of the Espionage Act. \n1\n The fourth section makes criminal a conspiracy 'to violate the provisions of sections two or three of this title,' provided one or more of the conspirators do any act to \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 244]\n\u00a0\n effect the object of the conspiracy. Such a conspiracy, thus attempted to be carried into effect, is none the less punishable because the conspirators fail to agree in advance upon the precise method in which the law shall be violated. It is true the averment of the conspiracy cannot be aided by the allegations respecting the overt acts. United States v. Britton, \n108 \nU.S. 199, 205\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 531; Joplin Mercantile Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 531, 563\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 291. On the other hand, while under section 4 of the Espionage Act, as under section 37 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10201), a mere conspiracy, without overt act done in pursuance of it, is not punishable criminally, yet the overt act need not be in and of itself a criminal act; still less need it constitute the very crime that is the object of the conspiracy. United States v. Rabinowich, \n238 \nU.S. 78, 86\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 682; Goldman v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 474, 477\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 166.\n As to the second point: Averments that defendants unlawfully, willfully, or feloniously committed the forbidden acts fairly import an unlawful motive; the third count specifically avers such a motive; the conspiracy charged in the second and the willful attempt charged in the sixth necessarily involve unlawful motives.\n The third and fourth objections point to no infirmity in the averments of the indictment. Whether the statements contained in the pamphlet had a natural tendency to produce the forbidden consequences, as alleged, was a question to be determined, not upon demurrer, but by the jury at the trial. There was no error in overruling the demurrer.\n Upon the trial, defendants' counsel moved that the jury be directed to acquit the defendants, upon the ground that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain a conviction. Under the exceptions taken to the refusal of this motion it is urged that there was no proof (a) of conspiracy; (b) of criminal purpose or intent; (c) of the falsity of the statements contained in the pamphlet circulate; \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 245]\n\u00a0\n (d) of knowledge on defendants' part of such falsity; or (e) of circumstances creating a danger that its circulation would produce the evils which Congress sought to prevent; and further (f) that the pamphlet itself could not legitimately be construed as tending to produce the prohibited consequences.\n The pamphlet-'The Price We Pay'-was a highly colored and sensational document, issued by the national office of the Socialist party at Chicago, Ill., and fairly to be construed as a protest against the further prosecution of the war by the United States. It contained much in the way of denunciation of war in general, the pending war in particular; something in the way of assertion that under Socialism things would be better; little or nothing in the way of fact or argument to support the assertion. It is too long to be quoted in full. The following extracts will suffice; those indicated by italics being the same that were set forth in the body of the third count:\n'Conscription is upon us; the draft law is a fact!\n\n'Into your homes the recruiting officers are coming. They will take your sons of military age and impress them into the army;\n\n'Stand them up in long rows, break them into squads and platoons, teach them to deploy and wheel;\n\n'Guns will be put into their hands; they will be taught not to think, only to obey without questioning.\n\n'Then they will be shipped thru the submarine zone by the hundreds of thousands to the bloody quagmire of Europe.\n\n'Into that seething, heaving swamp of torn flesh and floating entrails they will be plunged, in regiments, divisions and armies, screaming as they go.\n\n'Agonies of torture will rend their flesh from their sinews, will crack their bones and disslove their lungs; every pang will be multiplied in its passage to you. \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 246]\n\u00a0\n 'Black death will be a guest at every American fireside. Mothers and fathers and sisters, wives and sweethearts will know the weight of that awful vacancy left by the bullet which finds its mark.\n\n'And still the recruiting officers will come; seizing age after age, mounting up to the elder ones and taking the younger ones as they grow to soldier size;\n\n'And still the toll of death will grow.\n\n ...\n'The manhood of America gazes at that seething, heaving swamp of bloody carrion in Europe, and say 'Must we-be that!'\n\n'You cannot avoid it; you are being dragged, whipped, lashed, hurled into it; Your flesh and brains and entrails must be crushed out of you and poured into that mass of festering decay;\n\n'It is the price you pay for your stupidity-you who have rejected Socialism.\n\n ...\n'Food prices go up like skyrockets; and show no sign of bursting and coming down.\n\n ...\n'The Attorney General of the United States is so busy sending to prison men who do not stand up when the Star Spangled Banner is played, that he has no time to protect the food supply from gamblers.\n\n ...\n'This war began over commercial routes and ports and rights; and underneath all the talk about democracy versus autocracy, you hear a continual note, and undercurrent, a subdued refrain;\n\n\"Get ready for the commercial war that will follow this war.'\n\n'Commercial war preceded this war; it gave rise to this war; it now gives point and meaning to this war;\n\n ...\n\n\n[252 U.S. 239, 247]\n\u00a0\n 'This, you say, is a war for the rights of small nations and the first land sighted when you sail across the Atlantic is the nation of Ireland, which has suffered from England for three centuries more than what Germany has inflicted upon Belgium for three years.\n'But go to it! Believe everything you are told-you always have, and doubtless always will, believe them.\n\n ...\n'For this war-as every one who thinks or knows anything will say, whenever truth-telling becomes safe and possible again,-This war is to determine the question, whether the chambers of commerce of the Allied Nations or of the Central Empires have the superior right to exploit undeveloped countries.\n\n'It is to determine whether interest, dividends and profits shall be paid to investors speaking German or those speaking English and French.\n\n'Our entry into it was determined by the certainty that if the Allies do not win, J. P. Morgan's loans to the Allies will be repudiated, and those American investors who bit on his promises would be hooked.'\n\n These expressions were interspersed with suggestions that the war was the result of the rejection of Socialism, and that Socialism was the 'salvation of the human race.'\n It was in evidence that defendants were members of the Socialist party-a party 'organized in locals throughout the country'-and affiliated with a local branch in the city of Albany. There was evidence that at a meeting of that branch, held July 11, 1917, at which Pierce was present, the question of distributing 'The Price We Pay' was brought up, sample copies obtained from the national organization at Chicago having been produced for examination and consideration; that the pamphlet was discussed, as well as the question of ordering a large number of copies from the national organization for distribution; it was stated that criminal proceedings \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 248]\n\u00a0\n were pending in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland against parties indicted for distributing the same pamphlet; some of the members present, one of them an attorney, advised against its distribution, and a motion was adopted not to distribute it until it was known to be legal. However, some action appears to have been taken towards procuring copies for distribution, for on July 17th a large bundle of them, said to have been 5,000 copies, was delivered at Pierce's house by the literature agent of the Albany local. At a meeting held July 25 the subject was again brought up, it having become known that in the criminal proceedings before mentioned the court had directed a verdict of acquittal; thereupon the resolution of July 11 was rescinded and distributors were called for. On July 29, defendants Pierce, Creo, and Zeilman met at Pierce's house about half past 5 o'clock in the morning, and immediately began distributing the pamphlets in large numbers throughout the city of Albany. Each of them took about 500 copies, and having agreed among themselves about the division of the territory, they went from house to house, leaving a copy upon each doorstep. They repeated this on successive Sundays until August 26, when they were arrested. Nelson acted with them as a distributor on the latter date, and perhaps on one previous occasion.\n There was evidence that in some instances a leaflet entitled 'Protect Your Rights,' and bearing the Chicago address of the National office of the Socialist party, was folded between the pages of the pamphlet. The leaflet was a fervid appeal to the reader to join the Socialist party, upon the ground that it was the only organization that was opposing the war. It declared among other things:\n'This organization has opposed war and conscription. It is still opposed to war and conscription. ... Do you want to help in this struggle? ... The party needs you now as it never needed you before. You \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 249]\n\u00a0\n need the party now as you never needed it before. Men are going to give up their lives for a cause which you are convinced is neither great or noble, will you then begrudge your best efforts to the cause that you feel certain is both great and noble and in which lives the only hope and promise of the future?'\n\n And there was evidence of declarations made by Pierce on the 16th and 17th of August, amounting to an acknowledgment of a treasonable purpose in opposing the draft, which he sought to excuse on the ground that he had 'no use for England.'\n It was shown without dispute that defendants distributed the pamphlet- 'The Price We Pay'-with full understanding of its contents; and this of itself furnished a ground for attributing to them an intent to bring about, and for finding that they attempted to bring about, any and all such consequences as reasonably might be anticipated from its distribution. If its probable effect was at all disputable, at least the jury fairly might believe that, under the circumstances existing, it would have a tendency to cause insubordination, disloyalty, and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces of the United States; that it amounted to an obstruction of the recruiting and enlistment service; and that it was intended to interfere with the success of our military and naval forces in the war in which the United States was then engaged. Evidently it was intended, as the jury found, to interfere with the conscription and recruitment services; to cause men eligible for the service to evade the draft; to bring home to them, and especially to their parents, sisters, wives, and sweethearts, a sense of impending personal loss, calculated to discourage the young men from entering the service; to arouse suspicion as to whether the chief law officer of the government was not more concerned in enforcing the strictness of military discipline than in protecting the people against improper speculation in their food supply; and to produce a belief that our \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 250]\n\u00a0\n participation in the war was the product of sordid and sinister motives, rather than a design to protect the interests and maintain the honor of the United States.\n What interpretation ought to be placed upon the pamphlet, what would be the probable effect of distributing it in the mode adopted, and what were defendants' motives in doing this, were questions for the jury, not the court, to decide. Defendants took the witness stand and severally testified, in effect, that their sole purpose was to gain converts for Socialism, not to interfere with the operation or success of the naval or military forces of the United States. But their evidence was far from conclusive, and the jury very reasonably might find-as evidently they did- that the protestations of innocence were insincere, and that the real purpose of defendants-indeed, the real object of the pamphlet-was to hamper the government in the prosecution of the war.\n Whether the printed words would in fact produce as a proximate result a material interference with the recruiting or enlistment service, or the operation or success of the forces of the United States, was a question for the jury to decide in view of all the circumstances of the time and considering the place and manner of distribution. Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 247; Frohwerk v. United States, 249, U. S. 204, 208, 39 Sup. Ct. 249; Debs v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 211, 215\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 252.\n Concert of action on the part of Pierce, Creo, and Zeilman clearly appeared, and, taken in connection with the nature of the pamphlet and their knowledge of its contents, furnished abundant evidence of a conspiracy and overt acts to sustain their conviction upon the second count.\n The validity of the conviction upon the third count (the only one that includes Nelson) depends upon whether there was lawful evidence of the falsity of the statements contained in the pamphlet and tending to show that, \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 251]\n\u00a0\n knowing they were false, or disregarding their probable falsity, defendants willfully circulated it, with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States. The criticism of the evidence admitted to show the untruth of the statements about the Attorney General and about J. P. Morgan's loans to the Allies is not well founded; the evidence was admissible; but we hardly see that it was needed to convince a reasonable jury of the falsity of these and other statements contained in the pamphlet. Common knowledge ( not to mention the President's address to Congress of April 2, 1917, and the Joint Resolution of April 6 declaring war [40 Stat. 1], which were introduced in evidence) would have sufficed to show at least that the statements as to the causes that led to the entry of the United States into the war against Germany were grossly false, and such common knowledge went to prove also that defendants knew they were untrue. That they were false if taken in a literal sense hardly is disputed. It is argued that they ought not to be taken literally. But when it is remembered that the pamphlet was intended to be circulated, and so far as defendants acted in the matter was circulated, among readers of all classes and conditions, it cannot be said as matter of law that no considerable number of them would understand the statements in a literal sense and take them seriously. The jury was warranted in finding the statements false in fact, and known to be so by the defendants, or else distributed recklessly, without effort to ascertain the truth (see Cooper v. Schlesinger, \n111 \nU.S. 148, 155\n, 4 S. Sup. Ct. 360), and circulated willfully in order to interfere with the success of the forces of the United States. This is sufficient to sustain the conviction of all of the defendants upon the third count.\n There being substantial evidence in support of the charges, the court would have erred if it had peremptorily directed an acquittal upon any of the counts. The \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 252]\n\u00a0\n question whether the effect of the evidence was such as to overcome any reasonable doubt of guilt was for the jury, not the court, to decide.\n It is suggested that the clause of section 3-'Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States, or to promote the success of its enemies'-cannot be construed to cover statements that on their face, to the common understanding, do not purport to convey anything new, but only to interpret or comment on matters pretended to be facts of public knowledge; and that however false the statements and with whatever evil purpose circulated, they are not punishable if accompanied with a pretense of commenting upon them as matters of public concern. We cannot accept such a construction; it unduly restricts the natural meaning of the clause, leaves little for it to operate upon, and disregards the context and the circumstances under which the statute was passed. In effect, it would allow the professed advocate of disloyalty to escape responsibility for statements however audaciously false, so long as he did but reiterate what had been said before; while his ignorant dupes, believing his statements and thereby persuaded to obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service, would be punishable by fine or imprisonment under the same section.\n Other assignments of error pointing to rulings upon evidence and instructions given or refused to be given to the jury are sufficiently disposed of by what we have said.\n The conceded insufficiency of the first count of the indictment does not warrant a reversal, since the sentences imposed upon Pierce, Creo, and Zeilman did not exceed that which lawfully might have been imposed under the second, third, or sixth counts, so that the concurrent sentence under the first count adds nothing to their punishment. \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 253]\n\u00a0\n Claassen v. United States, \n142 \nU.S. 140, 146\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 169; Evans v. United States (two cases) \n153 \nU.S. 584, 595\n, 608 S., 14 Sup. Ct. 934, 939, 839; Putnam v. United States, \n162 \nU.S. 687, 714\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 923; Abrams v. United States, \n250 \nU.S. 616, 619\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 17\n\n\n Judgments affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the following opinion in which Mr. Justice HOLMES concurs:\n What is called 'distributing literature' is a means commonly used by the Socialist party to increase its membership and otherwise to advance the cause it advocates. To this end the national organization with headquarters at Chicago publishes such 'literature' from time to time and sends sample copies to the local organizations. These, when they approve, purchase copies and call upon members to volunteer for service in making the distribution locally. Some time before July 11, 1917, a local of the Socialist party at Albany, New York, received from the national organization sample copies of a four-page leaflet entitled 'The Price We Pay,' written by Irwin St. John Tucker, an Episcopal clergyman and a man of sufficient prominence to have been included in the 1916-1917 edition of 'Who's Who in America.' The proposal to distribute this leaflet came up for action at a meeting of the Albany local held on July 11, 1917. A member who was a lawyer called attention to the fact that the question whether it was legal to distribute this leaflet was involved in a case pending in Baltimore in the District Court of the United States; and it was voted 'not to distribute 'The Price We Pay' until we know if it is legal.' The case referred to was an indictment under the Selective Draft Act for conspiracy to obstruct recruiting by means of distributing the leaflet. Shortly after the July 11th meeting it became known that District Judge Rose had directed an acquittal in that case; and at the next meeting \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 254]\n\u00a0\n of the local, held July 25th, it was voted to rescind the motion 'against distributing 'The Price We Pay' and call for distributors.' Four members of the local, two of them native Americans, one a naturalized citizen, and the fourth a foreigner who had filed his first naturalization papers, volunteered as distributors. They distributed about 5,000 copies by hand in Albany.\n District Judge Rose in directing an acquittal had said of the leaflet in the Baltimore case:\n'I do not think there is anything to go to the jury in this case.\n\n'You may have your own opinions about that circular; I have very strong individual opinions about it, and as to the wisdom and fairness of what is said there; but so far as I can see it is principally a circular intended to induce people to subscribe to Socialist newspapers and to get recruits for the Socialist party. I do not think that we ought to attempt to prosecute people for that kind of thing. It may be very unwise in its effect, and it may be unpatriotic at that particular time and place, but it would be going very far indeed, further, I think than any law that I know of would justify, to hold that there has been made out any case here even tending to show that there was an attempt to persuade men not to obey the law.'\n\n In New York a different view was taken, and an indictment in six counts was found against the four distributors. Two of the counts were eliminated at the trial. On the other four there were convictions, and on each a sentence of fine and imprisonment. But one of the four counts was abandoned by the government in this court. There remain for consideration count 3, which charges a violation of section 3 of the Espionage Act by making false reports and false statements, with the intent 'to interfere with the operation and success of the military and naval forces,' and counts 2 and 6, also involving section 3 of the Espionage Act, the one for conspiring, the other for at tempting, \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 255]\n\u00a0\n 'to cause insubordination, disloyalty and refusal of duty in the military and naval forces.' Demurrers to the several counts and motions that a verdict be directed for the several defendants were overruled.\n In considering the several counts it is important to note that three classes of offenses are included in section 3 of the Espionage Act and that the essentials of liability under them differ materially. The first class, under which count 3 is drawn, is the offense of making or conveying false statements or reports with intent to interfere with the operations or success of the military and naval forces. The second, involved in counts 2 and 6 is that of attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty. With the third, that of obstructing the recruiting and enlistment service, we have, since the abandonment of the first count, no concern here. Although the uttering or publishing of the words charged be admitted, there necessarily arises in every case-whether the offense charged be of the first class or of the second-the question whether the words were used 'in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent' (Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 247, 249 [63 L. Ed. 470]), and also the question whether the act of uttering or publishing was done willfully, that is, with the intent to produce the result which the Congress sought to prevent. But in cases of the first class three additional elements of the crime must be established, namely:\n\n\n (1)\n The statement or report must be of something capable of being proved false in fact. The expression of an opinion, for instance, whether sound or unsound, might conceivably afford a sufficient basis for the charge of attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty or refusal of duty, or for the charge of obstructing recruiting; but, because an opinion is not capable of being proved \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 256]\n\u00a0\n false in fact, a statement of it cannot be made the basis of a prosecution of the first class.\n\n\n (2)\n The statement or report must be proved to be false.\n\n\n (3)\n The statement or report must be known by the defendant to be false when made or conveyed.\n In the case at bar the alleged offense consists wholly in distributing leaflets which had been written and published by others. The fact of distribution is admitted. But every other element of the two classes of crime charged must be established in order to justify conviction. With unimportant exceptions to be discussed later, the only evidence introduced to establish the several elements of both of the crimes charged is the leaflet itself; and the leaflet is unaffected by extraneous evidence which might give to words used therein special meaning or effect. In order to determine whether the leaflet furnishes any evidence to establish any of the above enumerated elements of the offenses charged the whole leaflet must necessarily be read. It is as follows:\n THE PRICE WE PAY.\n By Irwin St. John Tucker.\n\n\n I.\n\n Conscription is upon us; the draft law is a fact!\n Into your homes the recruiting officers are coming. They will take your sons of military age and impress them into the army;\n Stand them up in long rows, break them into squads and platoons, teach them to deploy and wheel;\n Guns will be put into their hands; they will be taught not to think, only to obey without questioning.\n Then they will be shipped thru the submarine zone by the hundreds of thousands to the bloody quagmire of Europe.\n Into that seething, heaving swamp of torn flesh and \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 257]\n\u00a0\n floating entrails they will be plunged, in regiments, divisions and armies, screaming as they go.\n Agonies of torture will rend their flesh from their sinews, will crack their bones and dissolve their lungs; every pang will be multiplied in its passage to you.\n Black death will be a guest at every American fireside. Mothers and fathers and sisters, wives and sweethearts will know the weight of that awful vacancy left by the bullet which finds its mark.\n And still the recruiting officers will come; seizing age after age, mounting up to the elder ones and taking the younger ones as they grow to soldier size;\n And still the toll of death will grow.\n Let them come! Let death and desolation make barren every Home! Let the agony of war creck every parent heart! Let the horrors and miseries of the world-downfall swamp the happiness of every hearthstone!\n Then perhaps you will believe what we have been telling you! For war is the price of your stupidity, you who have rejected Socialism!\n\n\n II.\n\n Yesterday I saw moving pictures of the Battle of the Somme. A company of Highlanders was shown, young and handsome in their kilts and brass helmets and bright plaids.\n They laughed and joked as they stood on the screen in their ranks at ease, waiting the command to advance.\n The camera shows rank after rank, standing strong and erect, smoking and chaffing with one another;\n Then it shows a sign: 'Less than 20 per cent. of these soldiers were alive at the close of the day.'\n Only one in five remained of all those laddies, when sunset came, the rest were crumpled masses of carrion under their torn plaids.\n Many a highland home will wail and croon for many a \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 258]\n\u00a0\n year, because of these crumpled masses of carrion, wrapped in their plaids, upon a far French hillside.\n I saw a regiment of Germans charging downhill against machine gunfire. They melted away like snowflakes falling into hot water.\n The hospital camps were shown, with hundreds and thousands of wounded men in all stages of pain and suffering, herded like animals, milling around like cattle in the slaughter pens.\n All the horror and agony of war were exhibited; and at the end a flag was thrown on the screen and a proclamation said: 'Enlist for your Country!' The applause was very thin and scattering; and as we went out, most of the men shook their heads and said:\n'That's a hell of a poor recruiting scheme!'\n\n For the men of this land have been fed full with horror during the past three years; and tho the call for volunteers has become wild, frantic, desperate; tho the posters scream from every billboard, and tho parades and red fire inflame the atmosphere in every town;\n The manhood of America gazes at that seething, heaving swamp of bloody carrion in Europe, and say 'Must we-be that!'\n You cannot avoid it; you are being dragged, whipped, lashed, hurled into it; Your flesh and brains and entrails must be crushed out of you and poured into that mass of festering decay;\n It is the price you pay for your stupidity-you who have rejected Socialism.\n\n\n III.\n\n Food prices go up like skyrockets; and show no sign of bursting and coming down.\n Wheat, corn, potatoes, are far above the Civil War mark; eggs, butter, meat-all these things are almost beyond a poor family's reach. \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 259]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General of the United States is so busy sending to prison men who do not stand up when the Star Spangled Banner is played, that he has no time to protect the food supply from gamblers.\n Starvation begins to stare us in the face-and we, people of the richest and most productive land on earth are told to starve ourselves yet further because our allies must be fed.\n Submarines are steadily sending to the fishes millions of tons of food stuffs; and still we build more ships, and send more food, and more and more is sunk;\n Frantically we grub in the earth and sow and tend and reap; and then as frantically load the food in ships, and then as frantically sink with them--\n We, the 'civilized nations' of the world!\n While the children of the poor clamor for their bread and the well to do shake their heads and wonder what on earth the poor folks are doing;\n The poor folks are growling and muttering with savage sidelong glances, and are rolling up their sleeves.\n For the price they pay for their stupidity is getting beyond their power to pay!\n\n\n IV.\n\n Frightful reports are being made of the ravages of venereal diseases in the army training camps, and in the barracks where the girl munition workers live.\n One of the great nations lost more men thru loathsome immoral diseases than on the firing line, during the first 18 months of the war.\n Back from the Mexican border our boys come, spreading the curse of the great Black Plague among hundreds of thousands of homes; blasting the lives of innocent women and unborn babes,\n Over in Europe ten millions of women are deprived of their husbands, and fifty millions of babies can never be;\n\n\n[252 U.S. 239, 260]\n\u00a0\n Of those women who will have their mates given back to them, there are twenty millions who will have ruined wrecks of men; mentally deranged, physically broken, morally rotten;\n Future generations of families are made impossible; blackness and desolation instead of happiness and love will reign where the homes of the future should be;\n And all because you believed the silly lie, that 'Socialism would destroy the home!'\n Pound on, guns of the embattled host; wreck yet more homes, kill yet more husbands and fathers, rob yet more maidens of their sweethearts, yet more babies of their fathers;\n That is the price the world pays for believing the monstrous, damnable outrageous lie that Socialism would destroy the home!\n Now the homes of the world are being destroyed; every one of them would have been saved by Socialism. But you would not believe. Now pay the price!\n\n\n V.\n\n This war, you say, is all caused by the Kaiser; and we are fighting for democracy against autocracy. Once dethrone the Kaiser and there will be permanent peace.\n That is what they said about Napoleon. And in the century since Napoleon was overthrown there has been more and greater wars than the world ever saw before.\n There were wars before Germany ever existed; before Rome ruled; before Egypt dominated the ages.\n War has been universal; and the cause of war is always the same. Somebody wanted something somebody else possessed and they fought over the ownership of it.\n This war began over commercial routes and ports and rights; and underneath all the talk about democracy versus autocracy, you hear a continual note, and undercurrent, a subdued refrain; \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 261]\n\u00a0\n 'Get ready for the commercial war that will follow this war.'\n Commercial war preceded this war; it gave rise to this war; it now gives point and meaning to this war;\n And as soon as the guns are stilled and the dead are buried, commercial forces will prepare for the next bloody struggle over routes and ports and rights, coal mines and railroads;\n For these are the essence of this, as of all other wars!\n This, you say, is a war for the rights of small nations and the first land sighted when you sail across the Atlantic is the nation of Ireland, which has suffered from England for three centuries more than what Germany has inflicted upon Belgium for three years.\n But go to it! Believe everything you are told-you always have and doubtless always will, believe them.\n Only do retain this much reason; when you have paid the price, the last and uttermost price; and have not received what you were told you were fighting for-namely Democracy--\n Then remember that the price you paid was not the purchase price for justice, but the penalty price for your stupidity!\n\n\n VI.\n\n We are beholding the spectacle of whole nations working as one person for the accomplishment of a single end-namely killing.\n Every man, every woman, every child, must 'do his bit' in the service of destruction.\n We have been telling you for, lo, these many years that the whole nation could be mobilized and every man, woman and child induced to do his bit for the service of humanity but you have laughed at us.\n Now you call every person traitor, slacker, proenemy who will not go crazy on the subject of killing; and you \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 262]\n\u00a0\n have turned the whole energy of the nations of the world into the service of their kings for the purpose of killing-killing-killing.\n Why would you not believe us when we told you that it was possible to cooperate for the saving of life?\n Why were you not interested when we begged you to work all together to build, instead to destroy? To preserve, instead of to murder?\n Why did you ridicule us and call us impractical dreamers when we prophesied a worldstate of fellowworkers, each man creating for the benefit of all the world, and the whole world creating for the benefit of each man?\n Those idle taunts, those thoughtless jeers, that refusal to listen, to be fair-minded-you are paying for them now.\n -Lo, the price you pay! Lo, the price your children will pay. Lo, the agony, the death, the blood, the unforgettable sorrow,--\n The price of your stupidity!\n For this war-as every one who thinks or knows anything will say, whenever truth-telling becomes safe and possible again,-This war is to determine the question, whether the chambers of commerce of the Allied Nations or of the Central Empires have the superior right to exploit undeveloped countries.\n It is to determine whether interest, dividends and profits shall be paid to investors speaking German or those speaking English and French.\n Our entry into it was determined by the certainty that if the Allies do not win, J. P. Morgan's loans to the Allies will be repudiated, and those American investors who bit on his promises would be hooked.\n Socialism would have settled that question; it would determine that to every producer shall be given all the value of what he produces; so that nothing would be left over for exploiters or investors. \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 263]\n\u00a0\n With that great question settled there would be no cause for war.\n Until the question of surplus profits is settled that way, wars will continue; each war being the prelude to a still vaster and greater outburst of hell; Until the world becomes weary of paying the stupendous price for its own folly; Until those who are sent out to maim and murder one another for the profit of bankers and investors determine to have and to hold what they have fought for;\n Until money is no more sacred than human blood;\n Until human life refuses to sacrifice itself for private gain;\n Until by the explosion of millions of tons of dynamite the stupidity of the human race is blown away, and Socialism is known for what it is, the salvation of the human race;\n Until then-you will keep on paying the price!\n IF THIS INTERESTS YOU.

From this leaflet, which is divided into six \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 264]\n\u00a0\n chapters, there are set forth, in count 3, five sentences as constituting the false statements or reports willfully conveyed by defendants with the intent to interfere with the operation and success of the military and naval forces of the United States.\n\n\n (a)\n Two sentences are culled from the first chapter. They follow immediately after the words, 'Conscription is upon us; the draft law is a fact,' and a third sentence culled follows a little later. They are:\n'Into your homes the recruiting officers are coming. They will take your sons of military age and impress them into the army. ... And still the recruiting officers will come; seizing age after age, mounting up to the elder ones and taking the younger ones as they grow to soldier size.'\n\n To prove the alleged falsity of these statements the government gravely called as a witness a major in the regular army with 28 years' experience, who has been assigned since July 5, 1917, to recruiting work. He testified that 'recruiting' has to do with the volunteer service and has nothing to do with the drafting system and that the word 'impress' has no place in the recruiting service. The subject of his testimony was a matter, not of fact, but of law, and as a statement of law it was erroneous. That 'recruiting is gaining fresh supplies for the forces, as well by draft as otherwise,' had been assumed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for that circuit in Masses Publishing Co. v. Patten, 246 Fed. 24, 158 C. C. A. 250, L. R. A. 1918C, 79, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 999 (decided 11 days before this testimony was given), and was later expressly held by this court in Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 53\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 247. The third of the sentences charged as false was obviously neither a statement nor a report, but a prediction; and it was later verified. \n2\n That the prediction \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 265]\n\u00a0\n made in the leaflet was later verified is, of course, immaterial; but the fact shows the danger of extending beyond its appropriate sphere the scope of a charge of falsity.\n\n\n (b)\n The fourth sentence set forth in the third count as a false statement was culled from the third chapter of the leaflet and is this:\n'The Attorney General of the United States is so busy sending to prison men who do not stand up when the Star Spangled Banner is played, that he has not time to protect the food supply from gamblers.'\n\n To prove the falsity of this statement the government called the United States attorney for that district, who testified that no federal law makes it a crime not to stand up when the 'Star Spangled Banner' is played and that he has no knowledge of any one being prosecuted for failure to do so. The presiding judge supplemented this testimony by a ruling that the Attorney General, like every officer of the government, is presumed to do his duty, and not to violate his duty, and that this presumption should obtain unless evidence to the contrary was adduced. The Regulations of the Army (No. 378, Edition of 1913, p. 88) provide that if the National Anthem is played in any place those present, whether in uniform or in civilian clothes, shall stand until the last note of the anthem. The regulation is expressly limited in its operation to those belonging to the military service, although the practice was commonly observed by civilians throughout the war. \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 266]\n\u00a0\n There was no federal law imposing such action upon them. The Attorney General, who does not enforce Army Regulations, was therefore not engaged in sending men to prison for that offense. But, when the passage in question is read in connection with the rest of the chapter, it seems clear that it was intended, not as a statement of fact, but as a criticism of the Department of Justice for devoting its efforts to prosecutions for acts or omissions indicating lack of sympathy with the war, rather than to protecting the community from profiteering by prosecuting violators of the Food Control Act. Act August 10, 1917, c. 53, 40 Stat. 276 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  3115 1\/8 e-3115 1\/8 r). Such criticism of governmental operations, though grossly unfair as an interpretation of facts or even wholly unfounded in fact, are not 'false reports and false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces.'\n\n\n (c)\n The remaining sentence, set forth in count 3 as a false statement, was culled from the sixth chapter of the leaflet and is this:\n'Our entry into it was determined by the certainty that if the Allies do not win, J. P. Morgan's loans to the Allies will be repudiated, and those American investors who bit on his promises would be hooked.'\n\n To prove the falsity of this statement the government introduced the address made by the President to Congress on April 2, 1917, which preceded the adoption of the Joint Resolution of April 6, 1917, declaring that a state of war exists between the United States and the Imperial German government. 40 Stat. 1, c. 1. This so-called statement of fact-which is alleged to be false-is merely a conclusion or a deduction from facts. True, it is the kind of conclusion which courts call a conclusion of fact, as distinguished from a conclusion of law, and which is sometimes spoken of as a finding of ultimate fact, as distinguished from an evidentiary fact. But in its essence it is the expression of a judgment-like the \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 267]\n\u00a0\n statements of many so-called historical facts. To such conclusions and deductions the declaration of this court in American School of Magnetic Healing v. McAnnulty, \n187 \nU.S. 94, 104\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 33, 37 (47 L. Ed. 90), is applicable:\n'There is no exact standard of absolute truth by which to prove the assertion false and a fraud. We mean by that to say that the claim of complainants cannot be the subject of proof as of an ordinary fact; it cannot be proved as a fact to be a fraud or false pretence or promise, nor can it properly be said that those who assume to heal bodily ills or infirmities by a resort to this method of cure are guilty of obtaining money under false pretenses, such as are intended in the statutes, which evidently do not assume to deal with mere matters of opinion upon subjects which are not capable of proof as to their falsity.'\n\n The cause of a war-as of most human action-is not single. War is ordinarily the result of many co-operating causes, many different conditions, acts and motives. Historians rarely agree in their judgment as to what was the determining factor in a particular war, even when they write under circumstances where detachment and the availability of evidence from all sources minimizes both prejudice and other sources of error; for individuals, and classes of individuals, attach significance to those things which are significant to them, and, as the contributing causes cannot be subjected, like a chemical combination in a test tube, to qualitative and quantitative analysis, so as to weigh and value the various elements, the historians differ necessarily in their judgments. One finds the determining cause of war in a great man; another in an idea, a belief, an economic necessity, a trade advantage, a sinister machination, or an accident. It is for this reason largely that men seek to interpret anew in each age, and often with each new generation, the important events in the world's history.\n That all who voted for the Joint Resolution of April 6, \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 268]\n\u00a0\n 1917, did not do so for the reasons assigned by the President in his address to Congress on April 2, is demonstrated by the discussions in the House and in the Senate. \n3\n That debate discloses, also, that both in the Senate and in the House the loans to the Allies and the desire to insure their repayment in full were declared to have been instrumental in bringing about in our country the sentiment in favor of the war. \n4\n However strongly we may believe \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 269]\n\u00a0\n that these loans were not the slightest makeweight, much less a determining factor, in the country's decision, the fact that some of our representatives in the Senate and the House declared otherwise on one of the most solemn occasions in the history of the nation should help us to understand that statements like that here charged to be false are in essence matters of opinion and judgment, not matters of fact to be determined by a jury upon or without evidence, and that even the President's address, which set forth high moral grounds justifying our entry into the war, may not be accepted as establishing beyond a reasonable doubt that a statement ascribing a base motive was criminally false. All the alleged false statements were an interpretation and discussion of public facts of public interest. If the proceeding had been for libel, the defense of privilege might have been interposed. Gandia v. Pettingill, \n222 U.S. 452\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 127. There is no reason to believe that Congress, in prohibiting a special class of false statements intended to interfere with what was obviously comment as distinguished from a statement.\n The presiding judge ruled that expressions of opinion were not punishable as false statements under the act; but he left it to the jury to determine whether the five sentences in question were statements of facts or expressions of opinion. As this determination was to be made from the reading of the leaflet unaffected by any extrinsic evidence the question was one for the court. To hold that a jury may make punishable statements of conclusions or of opinion, like those here involved, by declaring them to be statements of facts and to be false would practically deny members of small political parties freedom of criticism and of discussion in times when feelings run high and the questions involved are deemed fundamental. \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 270]\n\u00a0\n There is nothing in the act compelling or indeed justifying such a construction of it, and I cannot believe that Congress in passing, and the President in approving it, conceived that such a construction was possible.\n Second. But even if the passages from the leaflet set forth in the third count could be deemed false statements within the meaning of the act, the convictions thereon were unjustified because evidence was wholly lacking to prove any one of the other essential elements of the crime charged. Thus there was not a particle of evidence that the defendants knew that the statements were false. They were mere distributors of the leaflet. It had been prepared by a man of some prominence. It had been published by the national organization. Not one of the defendants was an officer even of the local organization. One of them, at least, was absent from the meetings at which the proposal to distribute the leaflet was discussed. There is no evidence that the truthfulness of the statements contained in the leaflet had ever been questioned before this indictment was found. The statement mainly relied upon to sustain the conviction-that concerning the effect of our large loans to the Allies-was merely a repetition of what had been declared with great solemnity and earnestness in the Senate and in the House while the Joint Resolution was under discussion. The fact that the President had set forth in his noble address worthy grounds for our entry into the war was not evidence that these defendants knew to be false the charge that base motives had also been operative. The assertion that the great financial interests exercise a potent, subtle, and sinister influence in the important decisions of our government had often been made by men high in authority. Mr. Wilson, himself a historian, said before he was President and repeated in the New Freedom that:\n'The masters of the government of the United States are the combined capitalists and manufacturers of the United \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 271]\n\u00a0\n States.'5\n\n We may be convinced that the decision to enter the great war was wholly free from such base influences, but we may not, because such is our belief, permit a jury to find, in the absence of evidence, that it was proved beyond a reasonable doubt that these defendants knew that a statement in this leaflet to the contrary was false.\n Nor was there a particle of evidence that these statements were made with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military and naval forces. So far as there is any evidence bearing on the matter of intent, it is directly to the contrary. The fact that the local refused to distribute the pamphlet until Judge Rose had directed a verdict of acquittal in the Baltimore case shows that its members desired to do only that which the law permitted. The tenor of the leaflet itself shows that the intent of the writer and of the publishers was to advance the cause of Socialism, and each defendant testified that this was his only purpose in distributing the pamphlet. Furthermore, the nature of the words used and the circumstances under which they were used showed affirmatively that they did not 'create a clear and present danger,' that thereby the operations or success of our military and naval forces would be interfered with.\n The gravamen of the third count is the charge of willfully conveying in time of war false statements with the intent to interfere with the operation and success of our military or naval forces. One who did that would be called a traitor to his country. The defendants, humble members of the Socialist party, performed as distributors of the leaflet what would ordinarily be deemed merely a menial service. To hold them guilty under the third \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 272]\n\u00a0\n count is to convict not them alone, but, in effect, their party, or at least its responsible leaders, of treason, as that word is commonly understood. I cannot believe that there is any basis in our law for such a condemnation on this record.\n Third. To sustain a conviction on the second or on the sixth count it is necessary to prove that by cooperating to distribute the leaflet the defendants conspired or attempted willfully to 'cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces.' No evidence of intent so to do was introduced unless it be found in the leaflet itself. What has been said in respect to the third count as to the total lack of evidence of evil intent is equally applicable here.\n A verdict should have been directed for the defendants on these counts also because the leaflet was not distributed under such circumstances, nor was it of such a nature, as to create a clear and present danger of causing either insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny or refusal of duty in the military or naval forces. The leaflet contains lurid and perhaps exaggerated pictures of the horrors of war. Its arguments as to the causes of this war may appear to us shallow and grossly unfair. The remedy proposed may seem to us worse than the evil which, it is argued, will be thereby removed. But the leaflet, far from counseling disobedience to law, points to the hopelessness of protest, under the existing system, pictures the irresistible power of the military arm of the government, and indicates that acquiescence is a necessity. Insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny and refusal of duty in the military or naval forces are very serious crimes. It is not conceivable that any man of ordinary intelligence and normal judgment would be induced by anything in the leaflet to commit them and thereby risk the severe punishment prescribed for such offenses. Certainly there was no clear and present danger that such would be the result. \n\n[252 U.S. 239, 273]\n\u00a0\n The leaflet was not even distributed among those in the military or the naval service. It was distributed among civilians; and since the conviction on the first count has been abandoned here by the government, we have no occasion to consider whether the leaflet might have discouraged voluntary enlistment or obedience to the provisions of the Selective Draft Act.\n The fundamental right of free men to strive for better conditions through new legislation and new institutions will not be preserved, if efforts to secure it by argument to fellow citizens may be construed as criminal incitement to disobey the existing law-merely because the argument presented seems to those exercising judicial power to be unfair in its portrayal of existing evils, mistaken in its assumptions, unsound in reasoning or intemperate in language. No objections more serious than these can, in my opinion, reasonably be made to the arguments presented in 'The Price We Pay.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Extract from Act June 15, 1917, c. 30, 40 Stat. 217, 219.\n Section 3: 'Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States, or to promote the success of its enemies, ... and whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully cause, or attempt to cause, ... insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or shall willfully obstruct ... the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States,' to the injury of the service or of the United States, 'shall be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.'\n Section 4: 'If two or more persons conspire to violate the provisions of sections two or three of this title, and one or more of such persons does any act to effect the object of the conspiracy, each of the parties to such conspiracy shall be punished as in said sections provided in the case of the doing of the act the accomplishment of which is the object of such conspiracy.

MOR(1920)\nNo. 728\nArgued: April 23, 1920Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Carroll G. Walter, of New York City, for Porto Roco Ry., Light & power co.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Mor, a subject of the King of Spain, domiciled in Porto Rico, brought in the United States District Court for \n\n[253 U.S. 345, 346]\n\u00a0\n Porto Rico this action at law for an amount exceeding $3,000, exclusive of interest and costs, against the Porto Rico Railway, Light & PowerC ompany, a Porto Rico corporation having its principal place of business there. Objection to the jurisdiction of the trial court was overruled and the plaintiff recovered judgment. The case came before the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit on writ of error and that court has presented to us by certificate the question whether the District Court had jurisdiction. The answer depends upon the construction to be given to the following provision contained in section 41 of the so-called Jones Act of March 2, 1917, c. 145, 39 Stat. 951, 965 (Comp. St. 1918,  3803qq), which provides a civil government for Porto Rico:\n'Said District Court shall have jurisdiction of all controversies where all of the parties on either side of the controversy are citizens or subjects of a foreign state or states, or citizens of a state, territory, or district of the United States not domiciled in Porto Rico, wherein the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest or cost, the sum or value of $3,000. ...'\n\n It is clear under this act that if Mor, instead of being a Spanish subject, had been a citizen of one of the United States, the court would not have had jurisdiction, since he was domiciled in Porto Rico. The precise question, therefore, is whether the restriction of jurisdiction to cases where all the parties on either side of the controversy are 'not domiciled in Porto Rico' applies to aliens as well as to American citizens.\n The judicial system of Porto Rico prior to annexation to the United States comprised a Supreme Court and district trial courts of general jurisdiction and municipal courts. The proceedings in all of these courts were conducted in the Spanish language and according to the forms of the civil law. By section 33 of the Foraker Act, April 12, 1900, c. 191, 31 Stat. 77, 84 (Comp. St.  3784), which established what was intended \n\n[253 U.S. 345, 347]\n\u00a0\n as a temporary civil government for the island, these insular courts were continued, with the proviso that the judges of the Supreme Court should be appointed by the President, and the judges of the inferior courts by the Governor. By section 40 of the Jones Act (Comp. St.  3803q) the jurisdiction of these courts and the forms of procedure in them were further continued.\n The 'District Court of the United States for Porto Rico' provided for by section 41 of the Jones Act was, in effect, a continuation of the District Court of the United States provided for by section 34 of the Foraker Act, as amended by the Act of March 2, 1901, c. 812, sec. 3, 31 Stat. 953 (Comp. St.  3786).1 Both acts conferred upon the court jurisdiction of all cases cognizable in Circuit or District Courts of the United States; the court is by both directed to proceed in the same manner as those courts; and in both there is an express provision that the pleadings and all proceedings shall be conducted in the English language. But the Jones Act greatly abridged the jurisdiction. The jurisdictional amount, which by the amendatory act of March 2, 1901, had been lowered to $ 1,000, was raised to $3,000. And, whereas by the amendment of 1901 the court had been given jurisdiction in case either party was a citizen of the United States, even if he was domiciled in Porto Rico, the Jones Act limited the jurisdiction dependent on American citizenship to the cases where the Americans were not domiciled in Porto Rico. Whether it likewise limited jurisdiction dependent on alienage is the question submitted to us. \n\n[253 U.S. 345, 348]\n\u00a0\n No reason appears why the clause 'not domiciled in Porto Rico' should not be read as applying to the entire phrase 'citizens or subjects of a foreign state or states, or citizens of a state, territory, or district of the United States.' When several words are followed by a clause which is applicable as much to the first and other words as to the last, the natural construction of the language demands that the clause be read as applicable to all. United States v. Standard Brewery, \n251 \nU.S. 210, 218\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 139, 64 L. Ed. --; Jh nson v. Southern Pacific Co., \n196 U.S. 1\n, 18-19, 25 Sup. Ct. 158, and cases cited. Furthermore, special reasons exist for so construing the clause in question. The act manifests a general purpose to greatly curtail the jurisdiction of the District Court. If the application of the clause were doubtful, we should so construe the provision as to effectuate the general purpose of Congress. American Security & Trust Co. v. District of Columbia, \n224 U.S. 491\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 553; Inter-Island Steam Navigation Co. v. Ward, \n242 U.S. 1\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 1. But it seems to us clear that it applies alike to aliens and to Amercan citizens.\n Suit may be brought in the District Court if either party has the jurisdictional qualifications; that is, the act confers upon such party not merely the right to sue but the liability to be sued. In the population of Porto Rico there are many aliens and these are largely Spaniards. \n2\n If the limitation 'not domiciled in Porto Rico' were \n\n[253 U.S. 345, 349]\n\u00a0\n inapplicable to aliens the result would work peculiar hardship and assuredly unintended discrimination against these Spaniards. A Spanish subject domiciled in Porto Rico might be sued by an American domiciled in Porto Rico or a Porto Rican in the District Court, where the proceedings are conducted in the English language and according to the forms of Anglo- American law; whereas an American domiciled in Porto Rico could be sued only in the insular courts where the proceedings are conducted in the Spanish language and according to the procedure and processes of the civil law. This might not only prove very inconvenient to Spanish residents, but would be inconsistent with the spirit of article 11 of the treaty of 1898 between Spain and the United States (30 Stat. 1754, 1760), under which Spaniards residing in Porto Rico were guaranteed 'the right to appear before such courts and to pursue the same course as citizens of the country to which the courts belong.'\n Congress could not have intended to give the District Court jurisdiction of any controversy to which a domiciled alien is a party while denying under similar circumstances jurisdiction where a domiciled American is a party.\n The question submitted is answered\n No. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 2, 1901, c. 812,  3: 'That the jurisdiction of the District Court of the United States for Porto Rico in civil cases shall, in addition to that conferred by the act of April twelfth, nineteen hundred, extend to and embrace controversies where the parties, or either of them, are citizens of the United States, or citizens or subjects of a foreign state or states, wherein the matter in dispute exceeds, exclusive of interest or costs the sum or value of one thousand dollars.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'It is somewhat surprising to find that 886,442 of the actual population are classed as Spaniards, and only 4,324 as foreigners.'

Toland, all of Los Angeles, Cal., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Douglas Brookman, of San Francisco, Cal., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We here are concerned with a statute of California and an order made thereunder by the state Railroad Commission, both of which are said to be repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and therefore invalid.\n The statute declares that every private corporation or individual operating 'any pipe line or any part of any pipe line ... for the transportation of crude oil, ... directly or indirectly, to or for the public, for hire, ... and which said pipe line ... is constructed or maintained upon, along, over or under any public highway, and in favor of whom the right of eminent domain exists,' shall be deemed a common carrier and subject to the provisions of a prior act investing the Railroad Commission with extensive powers over the rates and practices of those who operate public utilities. Stats. 1913, c. 327; Stats. 1911, Ex. Sess. c. 14.\n The order of the commission was made after notice and \n\n[251 U.S. 228, 230]\n\u00a0\n a full hearing; is based upon a finding that the Producers' Transportation Company, the plaintiff in error, has a pipe line from the San Joaquin oil fields to Port Harford, on the Pacific Coast, whereby it transports crude oil for pay in such circumstances that the statute requires that it be regarded and dealt with as a common carrier; and directs the filing with the commission of the company's schedule of rates or charges and the rules and regulations under which the transportation is conducted.\n In the state court the company contended that the evidence before the commission, all of which was before the court, conclusively established that the pipe line was constructed solely to carry crude oil for particular producers from their wells to the seacoast under strictly private contracts, and that there had been no carrying for others, nor any devotion of the pipe line to public use; and the company further contended that the statute, as applied to this pipe line, was repugnant to the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the contract clause of section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution, and that the order of the commission was void as offending against these clauses. The state court sustained both the statute and the order, 176 Cal. 499, 169 Pac. 59, and the company sued out this writ of error.\n The company was organized under the laws of California in 1909 and its pipe line was put in operation in 1910. The statute in question took effect August 10, 1913, and the order was made December 31, 1914\n\n\n It is, of course, true that if the pipe line was constructed solely to carry oil for particular producers under strictly private contracts and never was devoted by its owner to public use, that is, to carrying for the public, the state could not, by mere legislative fiat or by any regulating order of a commission, convert it into a public utility or make its owner a common carrier; for that would be taking private property for public use without just compensation, \n\n[251 U.S. 228, 231]\n\u00a0\n which no state can do consistently with the due process of law clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

On the other hand, if in the beginning or during its subsequent operation the pipe line was devoted by its owner to public use, and if the right thus extended to the public has not been withdrawn, there can be no doubt that the pipe line is a public utility and its owner a common carrier whose rates and practices are subject to public regulation. Munn v. Illinois, supra.\n The statute court, upon examining the evidence, concluded that the company voluntarily had devoted the pipe line to the use of the public in transporting oil, and it rested this conclusion upon the grounds, first, that one of the things which the company was authorized to do, if it so elected, as shown in its articles of incorporation, was 'to establish and carry on ... a general transportation business for the purpose of transporting ... any of the oils ... produced ... by this corporation or any other person, firm, partnership, association or corporation'; second, that in acquiring its right of way it resorted to an exercise of the power of eminent domain-admissible only if the condemnation was for a 'public use,' Code Civ. Proc.  1237, 1238; and was by 'an agent of the state,' Civ. Code,  1001-and in that proceeding asserted, and obtained a judgment reciting, that it was engaged in transporting oil by pipe line 'as a common carrier for hire,' and that the right of way was sought for 'a public use'; and, third, that looking \n\n[251 U.S. 228, 232]\n\u00a0\n through the maze of contracts, agency agreements and the like, under which the transportation was effected, subordinating form to substance, and having due regard to the agency's ready admission of new members and its exclusion of none, it was apparent that the company did in truth carry oil for all producers seeking its service, in other words, for the public. See Pipe Line Cases, 234, U. S. 548, 34 Sup. Ct. 956.\n While some criticism is made of this conclusion and the grounds upon which it is rested, we are of opinion that the grounds have adequate support in the evidence and that they sustain the conclusion. True, one witness stated that 'the pipe line was not laid upon the right of way which was obtained in the condemnation suit'; but, as his further testimony disclosed that he meant only that a part of the right of way so obtained was not used when the pipe line was laid, we think the state court rightly regarded the company as having acquired some of its actual right of way by exercising the power of eminent domain as a common carrier. If it was a common carrier at the time of the condemnation suit it is such now, for nothing has occurred in the meantime to change its status.\n That some of the contracts before mentioned were entered into before the statute was adopted or the order made is not material. A common carrier cannot by making contracts for future transportation or by mortgaging its property or pledging its income prevent or postpone the exertion by the state of the power to regulate the carrier's rates and practices. Nor does the contract clause of the Constitution interpose any obstacle to the exertion of that power. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co. v. Iowa, \n94 U.S. 155\n, 162; Louisville & Nashville R.

McKenney, of Washington, D. C., and James L. Minnis, of St. Louis, Mo., for petitioners.\n Mr. Roy W. Rucker, of Sedalia, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Action for personal injuries based on Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665). Negligence is charged against petitioners as receivers of the Wabash Railroad Company.\n Respondent Williams, plaintiff in the action, was engaged in tearing down on the line of the railroad, \n\n[254 U.S. 43, 44]\n\u00a0\n and a defect in a clawbar, which he was directed to use, caused the bar to slip while he was attempting to draw a bolt; in consequence he lost his balance and fell to the ground, a distance of 12 feet. The defect, it is alleged, Williams did not know.\n Negligence, however, was charged against him, and assumption of risk and contributory negligence.\n He recovered a verdict in the sum of $5,000. Motion for new trial and arrest of judgment were denied, and the case was appealed to the Kansas City Court of Appeals.\n The facts, as recited by the court, are that Williams was 21 years old, and had been reared on a farm. He entered the service of the railroad as a common laborer in August, 1915, and worked for it until injury in November of that year; his work being that of 'helping build steel bridges and taking down old ones.' He was ordered by the foreman in charge of the work to use a clawbar which was defective, in that the claws--\n'had become so rounded and dull by long usage that they could not be made to grab the shank securely, and slipped from their hold when plaintiff (Williams) pressed downward on the handle, causing him to lose his balance and fall from the cap to the ground.'\n\n The plaintiff stated that to discover the defect required an inspection of the underside of the tool, and that, in obeying the order of the foreman, he did not pause to make such inspection, but used the tool without any but casual inspection of its top surface, which did not reveal the defect.\n The railroad was engaged in interstate commerce and the cause of action, under the case as made, fell within the purview of the federal Employers' Liability Act (Comp. St.  8657-8665).\n The conclusion of the court was that--\n'The defect in the clawbar was so obvious that the most cursory and superficial inspection would have disclosed it to the plaintiff.'\n\n And further:\n'The risk was just as obvious as the \n\n[254 U.S. 43, 45]\n\u00a0\n defect. This was a simple tool, which, in the course of use, would be expected to fall into such defective condition, and plaintiff must be held to have appreciated the danger and to have voluntarily assumed it.'\n\n The court reversed the judgment. It denied a motion for rehearing, but considered and adjudged:\n'That on account of one of the judges deeming the decision to be in conflict with Fish v. Railway, 263 Mo. 106, 123, 172 S. W. 340, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 147, it is without jurisdiction, and therefore orders said cause certified to the Supreme Court for its determination.'\n\n The Supreme Court, upon considering Fish v. Railway and other cases, decided that--\n'It was the duty of the master to furnish the servant a reasonably safe clawbar with which to do the work. The failure to furnish that character of a clawbar was negligence upon the part of the master. If the defects were so glaring, and the clawbar so patently defective that an ordinarily prudent servant would not have used it, then its use under such circumstances was negligence upon the part of the servant, which negligence under the rule in Missouri would bar him from a recovery. But not so under the federal statute.'\n\n In other words, the court held that Williams' assumption of the risk did not have the consequence assigned to it by the Kansas City Court of Appeals, but, if it existed, amounted in legal effect only to contributory negligence, and that such negligence under the federal statute worked a reduction of damages, and not a defeat of the action, and, applying these elements of decision, adjudged that the 'case was well tried by the court nisi, and its judgment should be affirmed.' It was so ordered.\n In its view of the federal statute and the defense under it, the court erred. Seaboard Air Line Railway Co. v. Horton, \n233 U.S. 492\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 635, L. R. A. 1915C, 1, Ann.

Harris, \n247 U.S. 367\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 535\n\n\n Counsel for respondent, however, insists that the views of the Supreme Court upon the ruling of the assumption of risk is 'of purely academic interest and of no practical importance' in the consideration of the legality of the verdict and judgment in the trial court. That court, it is said, submitted the fact to the jury, and also submitted the relative contribution of Williams' negligence and the negligence of defendants to his injury. But this is an underestimate of the action of the trial court. The court was requested to instruct the jury that the effect of the assumption of risk by Williams incident to the use of the clawbar, and the circumstances under which it was used, was to relieve defendants from liability 'for the injury resulting therefrom.' The court refused the instruction as it was requested, and amended it by adding thereto:\n'And such fact [the assumption of risk] will be considered by you in determining the amount of plaintiff's recovery, if any, under all of the instructions.'\n\n The refusal and modification were assigned as error, and the Supreme Court considered and decided, as we have seen, that the fact was of no determining importance, and, if it existed, only constituted contributory negligence, and could operate only in reduction of the amount of recovery, not defeat recovery. This was error, as we have seen.\n Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","131":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREX v. U S(1920)\nNo. 126\nArgued: January 13, 1920Decided: January 26, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 382, 383]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry Peyton, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims dismissing the appellant's petition upon demurrer. The claim is for depredations committed on June 10, 1866, by a band of the Ute tribe of Indians, known as Blackhawk's band. The Act of March 3, 1891, c. 538,  1, 26 Stat. 851, gave jurisdiction to the Court of Claims over all claims for property of citizens taken or destroyed by Indians belonging to any band, tribe, or nation in amity with the United States. See Rev. Stat.  2156 (Comp. St.  4159). Act of June 30, 1834, c. 161,  17, 4 Stat. 729, 731. The appellant's intestate filed his claim but on June 13, 1898, the Court of Claims held that the Blackhawk band of Utes was not in amity with the United States and dismissed the petition. The present petition relies upon the Act of January 11, 1915, c. 7, 38 Stat. 791, amending the first section of the Act of 1891 so that in all claims for property of citizens or inhabitants of the United States taken or destroyed by Indians belonging to any tribe in amity with and subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, &c., the alienage of the claimant shall not be a defence to said claims, with provisos to be mentioned. The present petition, filed September 21, 1917, alleges that the tribe of Utes was in amity with the United States.\n The claimant contends that the amendment had two purposes-not merely to give inhabitants the same rights as citizens, but also to admit claims for damage done by hostile bands from a tribe that maintained its amity, subject to a proviso that suit had been brought upon them \n\n[251 U.S. 382, 384]\n\u00a0\n theretofore in the Court of Claims. It is said that claims of that nature that still were pending in the Court have been awarded judgment under the new jurisdiction. Another proviso in the Act is that claims that have been dismissed by the Court for want of proof of citizenship or alienage shall be reinstated, and the petition prays that the former claim be consolidated with this suit, and that judgment be awarded upon the evidence filed in the former case. It is pointed out as an anomaly that the case of a neighbor of the intestate who suffered damage from the same band on the same day was reinstated and passed to judgment, his claim having been dismissed at an earlier date because he was not a citizen at the time.\n But we are of opinion that the judgment of the Court of Claims was plainly right. The emphasis and primary intent, at least, of the Act of 1915 was to remove the defence of alienage. When it goes on by an express proviso to reinstate claims dismissed upon that ground and says nothing as to the other class it is impossible to extend the words. According to the claimant's necessary argument Congress had claims for damage by hostile bands before its eyes. On the face of the act it had before them also the matter of reinstatement. Yet it did not purport to reinstate claims of the present class. According to the claimant's account there was something for the act to operate on in the way of damage by hostile bands and the words cannot be carried further than they go. The Court of Claims rightly held that the old claim was not reinstated and that considered as a new claim the present suit was barred by the three years' limitation in the original act.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","132":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nROCK ISLAND, A. & L. R. CO. v. U S(1920)\nNo. 82\nArgued: Decided: November 22, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Thomas P. Littlepage and Sidney F. Taliaferro, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General Frierson, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a claim for a sum paid as an internal revenue tax under the Act of August 5, 1909, c. 6,  38, 36 Stat. 11, 112. It is alleged that the claimant was not engaged in or doing business in the year for which the tax was collected and that therefore it was not due. The Court of Claims dismissed the petition on the ground that the claimant had not complied with the conditions imposed by statute and the claimant appealed to this Court.\n The facts are simple. After the tax was assessed a claim for an abatement was sent to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue in July, 1913. On December 18 of the \n\n[254 U.S. 141, 142]\n\u00a0\n same year the Commissioner rejected the application, whereupon on December 26 the claimant paid the tax with interest and a penalty. So far as appears there was no protest at the time of payment and it is found that after in nothing was done to secure repayment of the tax. By Rev. Sts.  3226, amended by Act of February 27, 1877, c. 69,  1, 19 Stat. 248 (Comp. St.  5949), no suit shall be maintained in any Court for the recovery of any tax alleged to have been illegally assessed 'until appeal shall have been duly made to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, according to the provisions of law in that regard, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury established in pursuance thereof, and a decision of the Commissioner has been had therein, provided,' etc. Regulations of the Secretary established a procedure and a form to be used in applications for abatement of taxes and distinct ones for claims for refunding them. The claimant took the first step but not the last.\n By Rev. Sts.  3220 (Comp. St.  5944), the Commissioner of Internal Revenue is authorized 'on appeal to him made, to remit, refund, and pay back' taxes illegally assessed. It is urged that the 'appeal' to him to remit made a second appeal to him to refund an idle act and satisfied the requirement of  3226. Decisions to that effect in suits against a collector are cited, the latest being Loomis v. Wattles (C. C. A.) 266 Fed. 876. But the words 'on appeal to him made' mean, of course, on appeal in respect of the relief sought on appeal-to refund if refunding is what he is asked to do. The words of  3226 also must be taken to mean an appeal after payment, especially in view of  3228 (Comp. St.  5951) requiring claims of this sort to be presneted to the Commissioner within two years after the cause of action accrued. So that the question is of reading an implied exception into the rule as expressed, when substantially the same objection to the assessment has been urged at an earlier stage. \n\n[254 U.S. 141, 143]\n\u00a0\n Men must turn square corners when they deal with the Government. If it attaches even purely formal conditions to its consent to be sued those conditions must be complied with. Lex non praecipit inutilia (Co. Lit. 127b) expresses rather an ideal than an accomplished fact. But in this case we cannot pronounce the second appeal a mere form. On appeal a judge sometimes concurs in a reversal of his decision below. It is possible as suggested by the Court of Claims that the second appeal may be heard by a different person. At all events the words are there in the statute and the regulations, and the Court is of opinion that they mark the conditions of the claimant's right. See King's County Savings Institution v. Blair, \n116 U.S. 200\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 353. It is unnecessary to consider other objections that the claimant would have to meet before it could recover upon this claim.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","133":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSAMPLINER v. MOTION PICTURE PATENTS CO.(1920)\nNo. 89\nArgued: November 12, 1920Decided: December 6, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 233, 234]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John G. White, of Cleveland, Ohio, Gustavue A. Rogers and Saul E. Rogers, both of New York City, E. C. Brandenburg, of Washington, D. C., and Austin V. Cannon, of Cleveland, Ohio, for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. Samuel Seabury, William M. Seabury, and Charles F. Kingsley, all of New York City, and Robert H. McCarter, of Newark, N. J., for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The opinion below is reported in 255 Fed. 242, 168 C. C. A. 202.\n By an assignment executed in Ohio December 28, 1911, the Lake Shore Film & Supply Company, a corporation of that state, undertook to convey to plaintiff in error its claim and right of action against defendants for damages resulting from their violations of the Sherman Act (Comp. St.  8820 et seq.). Relying upon the assignment, he brought suit for $750,000 January 16, 1917, in the United States District Court, Southern District of New York. The defendants denied liability, and set up the following as a separate and distinct defense:\n'The plaintiff at the time of his alleged purchase of the claims in controversy, set up in the complaint herein, was an attorney and counselor at law of the state of Ohio, practicing as such before the courts of that state. ... That at the time of such alleged purchase it was, and is now, the law of the state of Ohio that an attorney who purchased a demand with full knowledge and notice that the same was contested and would be litigated, and with the intent and for the purpose of bringing an action thereon, was guilty of maintenance and champerty and got no title to such demand by such purchase \n\n[254 U.S. 233, 235]\n\u00a0\n which could be enforced either at law or in equity, and that the same was at said time, and still is, the law of the state of New York . ... That the plaintiff purchased the demand set forth in the complaint with full knowledge and notice that the same was contested and would be litigated and with the intent and for the purpose of bringing action thereon.'\n\n All parties agreeing, the court directed a separate trial before a jury upon the issues of fact and law arising under the special defense. Plaintiff in error testified in his own behalf and called two other witnesses-none were called by the defendants. The essential facts as well stated by the Circuit Court of Appeals follow:\n'The assignment states that 'for value received the Lake Shore ... Company ... hereby sells, assigns, and transfers to J. H. Sampliner all of its rights and interests in and to any and all damages which it has sustained and suffered by reason of injury to its business, because of the unlawful combination and monopoly in restraint of interstate commerce, and in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, brought about, engaged in and as a result of the unlawful agreement by and between the Motion Picture Patents Company; ... all of said parties having conspired together for the purpose of ruining and destroying the business of the Lake Shore ... Company, and contrary to and in violation of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. ...'\n\n'The testimony shows that the plaintiff had rendered legal services to the assignor as its general counsel in connection with the difficulties in which it found itself with the defendants, and that those services extended over a period from July, 1910, to December, 1911. The plaintiff regarded the reasonable value of his services as worth from $8,000 to $10,000. On December 10, 1911, he was asked by the president of the Lake Shore Company whether he would be willing to bring suit against the defendants, \n\n[254 U.S. 233, 236]\n\u00a0\n and that he replied that he would bring the suit, being satisfied that the company had a valid claim, and that it would cost from $8, 000 to $10,000. He was informed by the president of the company that it had been losing money very heavily, and it was absolutely impossible for it to undertake any litigation of that kind. He was asked what the company already owed him, and replied in the neighborhood of $9,000 or $10,000. He was told the company did not have the money and could not pay him, and thereupon he said, that if the company would pay him $5,000, in cash he would cancel the indebtedness. After some reflection the president, Mr. Mandelbaum, told him that the corporation would transfer to him all rights it had against the defendants, if he would be willing to accept it as a satisfaction of the company's indebtedness to him. The plaintiff told him that he would think it over and give him an answer. After a few days' reflection the plaintiff expressed a willingness to accept the assignment, and was told that the board of directors wanted to know whether, if they made an assignment, the plaintiff would as a part of the consideration defend the company and its officers in case any suit was brought against them in matters growing out of their difficulties with the defendants. He agreed to do this, and the assignment was executed.\n\n'It appears, therefore, that the assignment originated, not with the plaintiff, but with the Lake Shore Company, and that the consideration for the agreement involved the payment of a past indebtedness, as well as for future services of a professional character. It is also to be noted that the invalidity of the assignment is set up, not by the client, the assignor, who has at no time sought to repudiate it, but by third parties, between whom and the plaintiff no fiduciary relations have existed.'\n\n At the conclusion of the evidence the defendants asked a directed verdict 'on the ground that the plaintiff has \n\n[254 U.S. 233, 237]\n\u00a0\n not shown title to this cause of action and it now affirmatively appears from the evidence that the agreement under which the plaintiff assumes to bring this suit is champertous and void.' Thereupon the following occurred- Mr. Rogers representing the plaintiff:\n'Mr. Rogers: If your honor is going to grant the motion for a direction of a verdict I will take a formal objection to it, but my request is that if your honor is going to find for the defendant, that it be a nonsuit to the plaintiff's cause of action. I think that is as far as your honor can go.\n\n'The Court: You may be right, but the defendant has rested and moves for the direction of a verdict, and I am going to pass on that motion.\n\n'Mr. Rogers: But, your honor, I submit there aren't any questions of fact on which to go to the jury; I submit the matter is purely a matter of law for your honor to determine; and I think the question whether the agreement is or is not champertous is one of law for the court.\n\n'The Court: Well, Mr. Rogers, you may either rest on the motion of the defense and take an exception to such ruling as I make, if it should be adverse, or you can ask to go to the jury. That is entirely for you to determine.\n\n'Mr. Rogers: Well, if there are any questions of fact to be disposed of, your honor, I ask to go to the jury upon the questions of fact.\n\n'Mr. Seabury: I think he should specify, and not put a hypothetical motion.\n\n'The Colurt: I cannot have any 'ifs.' If you think, under section 973 of the Code, the court has no right to make a direction, and you are right about it, you will have a good exception; if, on the other hand, the court is right, your exception will be addressed, not to \n\n[254 U.S. 233, 238]\n\u00a0\n the question of practice, but to the substantive questions in the case.\n\n'Mr. Rogers: Then, your honor, may I state my position on the record?\n\n'The Court: Yes, certainly.\n\n'Mr. Rogers: The defendant having moved for a direction in order to preserve the plaintiff's rights, I beg leave to state my position on the record with the permission of the court.\n\n'Mr understanding is that the question is one of law to be passed upon by the court from the facts adduced. If, however, it is necessary in order to preserve the plaintiff's rights that I make a request to go to the jury, I ask to go to the jury upon the question as to whether or not the plaintiff took an assignment of the cause of action for the intent and purpose to begin an action thereon, and whether the assignment to him was bona fide for an antecedent indebtedness.\n\n'The Court: The court cannot take conditional offers. Counsel is at liberty, if so advised, to request to go to the jury and the court will rule.\n\n'Mr. Rogers: Then I move for a direction, your honor, for the plaintiff, upon the issue framed under your honor's order on the ground the defendant has failed to make out the defense set up in the answer, to wit, that the plaintiff purchased this cause of action- that is the defense that is set up-and I desire to call you honor's attention particularly to the form of the defense as pleaded. The defense that this plaintiff's title is void because he purchased this cause of action with the intent to sue thereon. It now appears uncontradicted, from the evidence, that instead of having purchased this cause of action, it was assigned to him under a bona fide assignment for an antecedent indebtedness owing to him for services which he had performed for the corporation.\n\n'The Court: Both sides having moved for a direction \n\n[254 U.S. 233, 239]\n\u00a0\n of a verdict, I find as a fact that the plaintiff purchased this cause of action with intent to sue thereon.\n\n'I find, as a fact, also, that the so-called assignment, Plaintiff's Exhibit No. 1, was executed by the Lake Shore Company, through its officers, pursuant to action at a special meeting of the board of directors.'\n\n A verdict for the defendants was directed and judgment entered thereon. The Circuit Court of Appeals declared itself concluded by the trial court's finding 'that the plaintiff purchased this cause of action with intent to sue thereon,' and held:\n'We must dispose of this case upon the theory that the plaintiff did not in fact take this assignment to extinguish a precedent debt but that he purchased it for the purpose of suing upon it; that he, an attorney at law, purchased from his client for $5,000 a cause of action which he values at $750,000. The question we must answer therefore is whether the law sanctions such a transaction between parties standing in the confidential relation of attorney and client. We are satisfied that the common law does not sanction it.'\n\n Among other things counsel for plaintiff in error now insist that--\n'If there were any questions of fact to be decided or divergent inferences of fact to be made the District Court erred in not submitting them to the jury.'\n\n The point is well taken.\n Statements by plaintiff's counsel made it sufficiently plain that while he sought an instructed verdict he also requested to go to the jury if the court held a contrary view concerning the evidence. In the circumstances disclosed we think the request was adequate and timely under former opinions of this court. Empire State Cattle Co. v. Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co., \n210 \nU.S. 1, 8\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 607, 15 Ann. Cas. 70; Sena v. American Turquois Co., \n220 \nU.S. 497, 501\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 488; Schmidt v. Bank of Commerce, \n234 \nU.S. 64, 66\n, 34 S.

Clearly some substantial evidence strongly \n\n[254 U.S. 233, 240]\n\u00a0\n tended to show that the assignment was taken in extinguishment of an existing indebtedness and not for mere speculation upon the outcome of intended litigation.\n The judgment below must be reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","134":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHAEFER v. U S(1920)\nNo. 270\nArgued: October 21, 1919Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 466, 467]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Wm. A. Gray and Henry John Nelson, both of Philadelphia, Pa., for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart, for the United States. \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 468]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Indictment in nine counts under the Espionage Act. Preliminary to indicating the special offenses we may say that the indictment charges that at the dates mentioned therein the Philadelphia Tageblatt and the Philadelphia Sonntagsblatt were newspapers printed and published in the German language in Philadelphia by the Philadelphia Tageblatt Association, a Pennsylvania corporation of which defendants were officers; Peter Schaefer being president, Vogel treasurer, Werner chief editor, Darkow managing editor, and Lemke business manager.\n That on the dates mentioned in the indictment the United States was at war with the Imperial German government and the defendants 'knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully' 'caused to be printed, published and circulated in and through' one or other of those newspapers false reports and statements of certain news items or dispatches purporting to be from foreign places, or otherwise violated the Espionage Act through editorials or other published matter.\n In count 1 the charge is that the intent was 'to promote the success of the enemies of the United States, to wit, the said Imperial German government.'\n In counts 2, 3, and 4 the charge is the obstruction of the 'recruiting and enlistment service of the United States, to the injury of the United States.'\n In count 5 the purpose of publication is charged to be the making of false reports and statements with intent to promote the success of the enemies of the United States.\n In counts 6, 7, and 8 there are charges of intent to like purpose.\n Count 9 charges a conspiracy entered into by defendants to be executed through the agency of the two \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 469]\n\u00a0\n newspapers for the purpose: (a) To make false reports and statements with intent to interfere with the military and naval operations and success of the United States and to promote the success of its enemies; (b) to cause insubordination, disloyalty, and mutiny in the military and naval forces of the United States; (c) to obstruct the recruiting and enlistment service of the United States. And there were specifications in support of the charges.\n Demurrers were opposed to the indictment which stated in detail the insufficiency of the indictment to constitute offenses. The demurrers were overruled; the court considering that the grounds of attack upon the indictment could be raised at the trial.\n The defendants were then arraigned and pleaded not guilty and when called for trial moved for a severance urging as the reason that the courts had ruled that defendants when tried jointly must join in 'their challenge to jurors.' Counsel in effect said they contested the ruling and considered the statute upon which it was based to be 'in derogation of the individual's rights, guaranteed to him by the Constitution.'\n Other grounds for severance were urged, but the court denied the motion, and to the ruling each of the defendants excepted. In fortification of the motion for severance, at the selection of the jury, counsel, in succession for each defendant, challenged particular jurors peremptorily, expressing at the same time the acceptance by the other defendants of the challenged jurors. After 10 such challenges had been made counsel interposed a peremptory challenge to other jurors in behalf of all of the defendants, stating as reasons that they 'collectively' were not 'bound by what their codefendants may have done with respect to any particular juror, and that, therefore, they are still within their rights.' The court denied the challenge, ruling that under the provisions of the act of Congress 'all the defendants will be deemed a single party, \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 470]\n\u00a0\n and 10 challenges having been exercised in the aggregate, the right of challenge is exhausted.'\n Defendants excepted and the tra l proceeded resulting in a verdict as follows: Schaefer and Vogel guilty on count 9 only; Werner on counts 1, 2, 4, and 9; Darkow on 1, 3, 5, 6, and 9; Lemke on count 9 only.\n Motions for arrest of judgment and for a new trial were made and overruled, and defendants were sentenced to various terms of imprisonment.\n The case is here upon writ of error directly to the District Court as involving constitutional questions.\n It is conceded that the constitutionality of the Espionage Act has been sustained (Sugarman v. United States, \n249 U.S. 182\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 191), but the constitutionality of the Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231,  287 (Comp. St.  1264), by which several defendants may be treated as one party for the purpose of peremptory challenges, is attacked. Its constitutionality is established by Stilson v. United States, \n250 U.S. 583\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 28, decided November 10, 1919\n\n\n The other assignments of error are: (1) The government failed to prove the charge of making false statements as the same was made in the indictment and that therefore the court erred in refusing to instruct the jury to acquit upon the counts charging the offense. (2) 'In passing upon the question of falsity of the dispatches as published by appellants and in passing upon any other questions which are a matter of public knowledge and general information' the court erred in instructing the jury that 'they had a right to call upon the fund of knowledge which was in their keeping.' (3) The court erred in refusing to instruct the jury to render a verdict of not guilty upon all of the counts in case of each of the defendants.\n Assignments 1 and 3 may be considered together. They both depend upon an appreciation of the evidence, \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 471]\n\u00a0\n although assignment 1 is more particular as to the offense charged. But neither can be discussed without a review of the evidence and a detailed estimation of its strength, direct and inferential. That, however, is impossible, as the evidence occupies over 300 pages of the record and counsel have not given us an analysis or compendium of it, but have thrust upon us a transcript of the stenographer's notes of the trial, which counsel for the government aptly says 'presents' of the case 'a picture of a certain sort, but it is a picture which is constantly out of focus, being either larger than the reality or smaller.' However, we have accepted the labor it imposed, and have considered the parts of the evidence in their proper proportions and relation, and brought them to an intelligible focus, and are of opinion that the court rightfully refused the requested instructions, except as to the defendants Schaefer and Vogel. As to them we do not think that there was substantial evidence to sustain the conviction. They were acquitted, we have seen, of all the individual and active offenses, and found guilty only on the ninth count-the charge of conspiracy.\n The second assignment of error is somewhat confusedly expressed. It, however, presents an exception to the charge of the court as to what the jurors were entitled to consider as matters of public knowledge and general information. Counsel apparently urge against the charge that it submitted all the accusations of the indictment to the proof of the public knowledge and general information that the jurors possessed. The charge is not open to the contention, and as discussion is precluded except through a consideration of the instructions in their entirety, we answer the contention by a simple declaration of dissent from it based, however, we may say, on a consideration of the instructions as a whole not in fragments detached and isolated from their explanations and qualifications. Counsel at the trial attempted \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 472]\n\u00a0\n to assign to the charge the generality they now assert and it was rejected.\n It is difficult to reach or consider the particulars of counsel's contention, the foundation of which seems to be that the indictment charged the falsification of the 'dispatches,' and that, therefore, the gv ernment must prove the falsification of them. What counsel mean by 'falsification,' is not easy to represent, they conceding there was proof that 'the articles which were published differ from the articles in the papers from which they were copied,' but contending that no evidence was offered of what was contained in the original dispatches of which the publications purported to be copies. And again counsel say:\n'The falsity, as it has been called, which was proven against the defendants was that the articles which were published differ from the articles in the papers from which they were copied.'\n\n The charge and proof, therefore, were of alterations-giving the 'dispatches' by a change or characterization a meaning that they did not originally bear-a meaning that weakened the spirit of recruiting and destroyed or lessened that zeal and animation necessary or helpful to raise and operate our armies in the then pending war. And there could be no more powerful or effective instruments of evil than two German newspapers organized and conducted as these papers were organized and conducted.\n Such being the situation, and the defendants having testified in their own behalf, and having opportunity of explanation of the changes they made of the articles which they copied, the court instructed the jury as follows:\n'In passing upon this question of falsity and in passing upon this question of intent and in passing upon, of course, the question of whether or not we are at war, you are permitted to use your general knowledge. I will withdraw the reference to the 'intent,' but in passing upon the question of the falsity of these publications, in passing upon the question \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 473]\n\u00a0\n whether we are at war, and in passing upon any other questions which are in like manner a matter of public knowledge and of general information you have the right to call upon the fund of general information which is in your keeping.'\n\n The criticism counsel make of the charge is that--\n'Without any proof whatsoever he [the judge] permitted them [the jury] to apply their general knowledge in determining whether the dispatches published by the defendants contained false statements.'\n\n Indeed, counsel go further, and insist that--\n'The charge gave to the jury an unlimited right to use any general information at their disposal in reaching their verdict.'\n\n The charge itself refutes such sweeping characterization. Nor is it justified. The court said:\n'The real offense with which these defendants are charged is in putting out these false statements. They received them from a source That source purported to be the report of a dispatch, and the evidence in this case would seem to direct your minds in at least some of these instances, perhaps in many of them, to just where the report of the dispatch appeared. They took that report as it came to them, and the charge is, in plain words, that they garbled it, sometimes by adding something to it, and sometimes by leaving things out, and sometimes by a change of words. But the substantial thing which you are to pass upon is: Was the report or statement that they put out false? Was it willfully and knowingly false? Was it put out thus falsified with the intent to promote the success of the enemies of the United States.'\n\n In other words, the minds of the jurors were directed to the gist of the case, which was dispatches received and then changed to express falsehood, to the detriment of the success of the United States, and the fact and effect of change the jurors might judge of from the testimony as presented and 'from the fund of information which was in' their 'keeping'; that is, from the fact of the source \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 474]\n\u00a0\n from which the dispatches were received, from the fact of war and what was necessary for its spirit and effective conduct, and how far a false cast to the dispatches received was depressing or detrimental to patriotic ardor. See Stilson v. United States, supra.\n This disposes of the case on the exceptions which are argued. Exceptions 1 and 2 are specific, and we have discussd them. Exception 3 is general, and involves, not only the points we have discussed and selected by counsel for discussion, but involves, besides, every other objection to the instructions and the sufficiency of the evidence, in all the aspects they can be viewed and estimated.\n And as being within its comprehension we are confronted with a contention that the indictment and conviction are violative of the freedom of speech and of the press protected by the Constitution of the United States. The contention is a serious one, and, in its justification, it is urged that the power of Congress to interfere with the freedom of speech and of the press must be judged by an exercise of reason on the circumstances. Therefore, in justice to the tribunal below, indeed to ourselves, we must give attention to the contention.\n It is not very susceptible of measurement. It is difficult to separate, in view of the contentions that are made, a judgment of the law from a judgment of conviction under the law, and keep free from confusing considerations. Free speech is not an absolute right, and when it or any right becomes wrong by excess is somewhat elusive of definition. However, some admissions may be made. That freedom of speech and of the press are elements of liberty all will acclaim. Indeed, they are so intimate to liberty in every one's convictions-we may say feelings-that there is an instinctive and instnat revolt from any limitation of them, either by law or a charge under the law, and judgment must be summoned against the impulse that might condemn \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 475]\n\u00a0\n a limitation without consideration of its propriety. But, notwithstanding this instant jealousy of any limitation of speech or of the press, there is adduced an instance of oppression by the government, and, it is said, to hold that publications such as those in this case--\n'can be suppressed as false reports, subjects to new perils the constitutional liberty of the press, already seriously curtailed in practice under powers assumed to have been conferred upon the postal authorities.'\n\n If there be such practice, this case is not concerned with it. The assertion of its existence, therefore, we are not called upon to consider, as there is nothing before us to justify it. Therefore, putting it aside, and keeping free from exaggerations and alarms prompted by an imagination of improbable conditions, we bring this case, as it should be brought, like other criminal cases, to no other scrutiny or submission than to the sedate and guiding principles of criminal justice. And this was the effort of the trial court, and was impressed on the jury.\n The court drew the attention of the jury to 'the features which gave importance' to the case, but admonished it that they brought a challenge to a sense of duty and a sense of justice, and that while the enforcement of any law made a 'strong call' upon court and jury, it could not--\n'override the obligation of the other call, which is to make sure that no man is found guilty of a crime, unless the evidence points to his guilt with the degree of certainty which the law requires.'\n\n Again, and we quote the words of the court:\n'No people is fit to be self-governed whose juries, chosen from among the great body of the people, cannot give due consideration to cases of this kind, and who cannot give to any defendant a fair and impartial trial, and render a just verdict. I know of no greater service an American citizen can perform for his country than to manifest by his attitude in cases of this kind that we are a people who \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 476]\n\u00a0\n are governed by law, and who follow unswervingly that sense of justice which we should follow. Calling up just that spirit of justice, and breathing its very atmosphere, let us go to a consideration of the real merits of this case.'\n\n Did the admonition fulfill the duty of the court, or should the court, as it is intimated, have taken the case from the jury? To do so is sometimes the duty of a court, but it is to be remembered a jury is a tribunal constituted by law, as the court  , its function has as definite sanction as that of the court, and it alone is charged with the consideration and decision of the facts of a case. And the duty is of such value as to have been considered worthy of constitutional provision and safeguard. See Traction Co. v. Hof, \n174 U.S. 1\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 580.\n If it be said this comment is but the expression of commonplaces, we reply that commonplaces are sometimes necessary to be brought forward, lest earnestness or interest disregard them, and urge too far the supervising power of the court, which, we repeat, is subordinate to that of the jury on questions of fact, and certainly 'a rule of reason' cannot be asserted for it upon a mere difference in judgment. All the principles and practices of the law are the other way. May such rule be urged in an appellate court against the concurrence of court and jury in the trial court, or if there be division in the appellate court, for which view may a satisfaction of the rule be asserted? Passing by presumptions that may be challenged, an answer in this case may be left to the facts. But first as to the law.\n The indictment is based on the Espionage Act, and that was addressed to the condition of war, and its restraints are not excessive nor ambiguous. \n1\n We need not enumerate \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 477]\n\u00a0\n them. There were directed against conduct-speech or writings-that was designed to obstruct the recruitment or enlistment service, or to weaken or debase the spirit of our armies, causing them, it might be, to operate to defeat and the immeasurable horror and calamity of it.\n But simple as the law is, perilous to the country as disobedience to it was, offenders developed, and when it was exerted against them challenged it to decision as a violation of the right of free speech assured by the Constitution of the United States. A curious spectacle was presented. That great ordinance of government and orderly liberty was invoked to justify the activities of anarchy or of the enemies of the United States, and by a strange perversion of its precepts it was adduced against itself. In other words and explicitly, though it empowered Congress to declare war, and war is waged with armies, their formation ( recruiting or enlisting) could be prevented or impeded, and the morale of the armies when formed could be weakened or debased by question or calumny of the motives of authority, and this could not be made a crime-that it was an impregnable attribute of free speech, upon which no curb could be put. Verdicts and judgments of conviction were the reply to the challenge, and when they were brought here our response to it was unhesitating and direct. We did more than reject the contention; we forestalled all shades or repetition of it, including that in the case at bar. Schenck v. United States, \n249 U.S. 47\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 247; Frohwerk v. United States, \n249 U.S. 204\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 249; Debs v. United States, \n249 U.S. 211\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 252; Abrams v. United States, \n250 U.S. 616\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 17, decided November 10, 1919. That, however, though in some respects retrospect, \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 478]\n\u00a0\n is a pertinent introduction to the facts of the pending case.\n The charges of the indictment were against certain articles or editorials in the newspapers published by defendants in German and intended to be circulated in families and read by persn  who understood that language. The articles were adapted to the situation, and, we may say, allusion and innuendo could be as effective as direct charge, and 'coarse or heavy humor,' when accompanied by sneering headlines and derision of America's efforts, could have evil influence. And such was the character of the article upon which count 3 of the indictment was based. It had the following headlines:\n'Yankee Bluff.'\n\n'Professor Jenny Does Not Take the American Preparations for War Seriously.'\n\n'Ambassador Page Assures England That We Will Send Ten Million Men.'\n\n The following, with some other comments, was in the body of the article:\n'The army of ten million and the hundred thousand airships, which were to annihilate Germany, have proved to be American boasts, which will not stand washing. It was worthy of note how much the Yankees can yell their throats out without spraining their mouths. This is in accord with their spiritual quality. They enjoy a capacity for lying, which is able to conceal to a remarkable degree a lack of thought behind a superfluity of words.'\n\n Coarse indeed, this was, and vulgar to us; but it was expected to produce, and it may be did produce, a different effect upon its readers. To them its derisive contempt may have been truly descriptive of American feebleness and inability to combat Germany's prowess, and thereby chill and check the ardency of patriotism and make it despair of success, and in hopelessness relax energy both in preparation and action. If it and the other articles, which we shall presently refer to, \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 479]\n\u00a0\n had not that purpose, what purpose had they? Were they the mere expression of peevish discontent, aimless, vapid, and innocuous? We cannot so conclude. We must take them at their word, as the jury did, and ascribe to them a more active and sinister purpose. They were the publications of a newspaper, deliberately prepared, systematic, always of the same trend, more specific in some instances, it may be, than in others. Their effect or the persons affected could not be shown, nor was it necessary. The tendency of the articles and their efficacy were enough for offense-their 'intent' and 'attempt,' for those are the words of the law-and to have required more would have made the law useless. It was passed in precaution. The incidence of its violation might not be immediately seen, evil appearing only in disaster, the result of the disloyalty engendered and the spirit of mutiny.\n The article was preceded by one July 4, 1917, headed 'For the Fourth of July,' in which it was declared that--\n'The Fourth of July celebration, which has long been an empty formality, will this year become a miserable farce.'\n\n England was represented as the enemy of the United States, carrying a hostility watchful of opportunity from the time of the Revolution through all crises, until the United States 'had become so strong that nothing could be undertaken against her.' And further:\n'The ruling classes of England have always despised and hated the United States, and today, while they flatter them, they still cherish the same feeling toward them.'\n\n The emphasis of a paragraph was given to the statement that--\n'Under Wilson's regime the United States' had 'sprung to the side of England as its savior in time of need. They provided it with means to carry on the war, and, when that wasn't enough, they sprang into the war themselves. History will some time pronounce its judgment upon this.'\n\n The aid so asserted to have been rendered to England by President Wilson was represented to have been in \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 480]\n\u00a0\n opposition to the wishes of the people, expressed--\n'by the unwillingness of their [the United States] young men to offer themselves as volunteers for the war. But it will not rest there. The call for peace will come from the masses, and will demand to be heard. And the sooner the better. No blood has been shed yet, no hate or bitterness has yet arisen against Germany, who has never done this country any harm, but has sent millions of her sons for itsu pbuilding. The sooner the American people come to their senses and demand peace, the better and more honorable it will be for this country.'\n\n The animus of the article and the effect expected of it need no comment to display. It was followed, supplemented, we may say, and reinforced by another article July 7, 1917. It (the latter) had for headlines the words 'Failure of Recruiting,' and recruiting failed, was its representation, notwithstanding an 'advertising campaign was worked at high pressure,' and 'all sorts of means were tried to stir up patriotism.' Its further declaration was that--\n'Germany was represented as a violator of all human rights and all international law, yet all in vain. Neither the resounding praises nor the obviously false accusations against Germany were of any avail. The recruits did not materialize.'\n\n The cause was represented to be:\n'That the American who was not a coward' did 'not care to allow himself to be shot to satisfy British lust for the mastery of the world,' and 'the people instinctively recognized and felt' that 'the pro-British policy of the government is an error, which can bring nothing but injury upon this country.'\n\n It was then added that 'the nation therefore' was doing the only thing it could still do, 'since its desires were not consulted at first.' It refused 'to take part.'\n The purpose is manifest, however the statements of the article may be estimated, whether as criminal means, violations of law, or the exercise of free speech and of the press, \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 481]\n\u00a0\n and its statements were deliberate and willfully false; the purpose being to represent that the war was not demanded by the people but was the result of the machinations of executive power, and thus to arouse resentment to it and what it would demand of ardor and effort. In final comment we may say that the article in effect justified the German aggressions.\n We do not deem it necessary to adduce the other charges of the indictment. We may, however, refer to the plausibility of the excuse of the alteration of Senator La Follette's speech, and remark that it disappears when the speech is considered in connection with the articles that preceded and followed it. The alterations were, it is true, of two words only, but words of different import than those the Senator used. The Senator urged that the burden of taxation made necessary by the war be imposed upon those who might profit by the war, in order to relieve those who might suffer by it and be brought to 'bread lines.' The article changed the words to 'bread riots'; that is, changed the expression of acceptance of what might come as a consequence of the war to turbulent resistance to it, and thus giving the article the character of the others, with a definite illustration of the opposition to the war by a Senator and his prophecy of a riotous protest by the people. It will be recalled that in other articles the antagonism of the people to the war was declared, and in one of them it was said that the war was commenced 'under Wilson's regime' and 'without their [the people's] consent.'\n In conclusion, we may add that there are in the record what are called 'intent' articles, which supplement and emphasize the charges of the indictment, and, it is to be remembered, that defendants were witnesses, and had the opportunity of explanation, and to preclude any misapprehension of the German originals or defect in their translation. And the jury could judge of the defendants by their presence. \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 482]\n\u00a0\n We have not deemed it necessary to consider the articles commented on with reference to the verdicts; the Abrams Case has made it unnecessary. On any count of which any defendant was convicted he could have been sentenced to 20 years' imprisonment. The highest sentence on any defendant was five years.\n Further comment is unnecessary, and our conclusion is that the judgment must be affirmed as to Werner, Darkow, and Lemke but reversed as to Schaefer and Vogel; as to them the case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with thiso pinion.\n So ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the following [dissenting] opinion, in which Mr. Justice HOLMES concurred:\n With the opinion and decision of this court, reversing the judgment against Schaefer and Vogel on the ground that there was no evidence legally connecting them with the publication, I concur fully. But I am of opinion that the judgments against the other three defendants should also be reversed, because either the demurrers to the several counts should have been sustained or a verdict should have been directed for each defendant on all of the counts.\n The extent to which Congress may, under the Constitution, interfere with free speech, was in Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 247, 249 (63 L. Ed. 470), declared by a unanimous court to be this:\n'The question in every case is whether the words ... are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent. It is a question of proximity and degree.'\n\n This is a rule of reason. Correctly applied, it will preserve the right of free speech both from suppression by tyrannous, well-meaning majorities, and from abuse by irresponsible, fanatical minorities. Like many other rules for human conduct, it can be applied correctly only by the \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 483]\n\u00a0\n exercise of good judgment; and to the exercise of good judgment calmness is, in times of deep feeling and on subjects which excite passion, as essential as fearlessness and honesty. The question whether in a particular instance the words spoken or written fall within the permissible curtailment of free speech is, under the rule enunciated by this court, one of degree; and because it is a question of degree the field in which the jury may exercise its judgment is necessarily a wide one. But its field is not unlimited. The trial provided for is one by judge and jury, and the judge may not abdicate his function. If the words were of such a nature and were used under such circumstances that men, judging in calmness, could not reasonably say that they created a clear and present danger that they would bring about the evil which Congress sought and had a right to prevent, then it is the duty of the trial judge to withdraw the case from the consideration of the jury; and, if he fails to do so, it is the duty of the appellate court to correct the error. In my opinion, no jury acting in calmness could reasonably say that any of the publications set forth in the indictment was of such a character or was made under such circumstances as to create a clear and present danger, either that they would obstruct recruiting or that they would promote the success of the enemies of the United States. That they could have interfered with the military or naval forces of the United States or have caused insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty in its military or naval services was not even suggested; and there was no evidence of conspiracy, except the co-operation of editors and business manager in issuing the publications complained of.\n The nature and possible effect of a writing cannot be properly determined by culling here and there a sentence and presenting it separated from the context. In making such determination, it should be read as a whole; at least, if it is short, like these news items and editorials. Sometimes \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 484]\n\u00a0\n it is necessary to consider, in connection with it, other evidence which may enlarge or otherwise control its meaning, or which may show that it was circulated under circumstances which gave it a peculiar significance or effect. But no such evidence was introduced by the government. The writing here in question must speak for themselves. Fifteen publications were set forth in the indictment; and others were introduced in evidence. To reproduce all of them would unduly prolong this opinion. Four are selected which will illustrate the several contentions of the government. That at least three of these four were de med by it of special importance is shown by the fact that each of the three was made the subject of a separate count.\n First. There were convictions on three counts of willfully obstructing the recruiting and enlistment service. The conviction of the news editor of so obstructing rested wholly upon his having inserted the following reprint from a Berlin paper in the Tageblatt:\n Yankee Bluff.\n'Professor Jenny Does Not Take the American Preparations for War Seriously.\n\n'Ambassador Paige Assures England That We Will Send Ten Million Men.\n\n'London, Aug. 5.-Ambassador Paige followed Lloyd George at Guild Hall in Plymouth, with a great speech. He declared there that the differences between England and the United States in former times were only of a superficial nature, and that both peoples are now united inseparably, to fight for freedom and against the Hydra of militarism. He assures his hearers that the United States is ready for all sacrifices in order to end the war victoriously, and that, if necessary, it will send 10,000,000 men to France.'\n\n'Berlin, Aug. 5.-In the 'Taglishe Rundschau,' Professor Jenny writes under the title 'Americanism' as \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 485]\n\u00a0\n follows: Americans think in exaggerations and talk in superlatives. Even Ambassador Andrew White in his Memoirs falls into superlatives in comparatively insignificant cases. He speaks of them as the most important events of his life, and maintains that certain people have made an indelible impression on him, whom others consider to be ordinary, average men.\n\n'The army of 10,000,000 men has dwindled to a voluntary army of 120, 000; while the new conscripted army of 565,000 will not even be ready to begin drilling for the front in six months. The 100,000 air ships were reduced to 20,000, and then to 3,000, which the Americans hope to have ready for next summer, if they find the right model for them. As for the thousands of ships that were to be sent across the ocean, America, six months after the declaration of war, has not yet decided whether they are to be wood or steel ships; so far not even the keel of one ship has been laid. It amounts to this: That now, when the Americans can scrape some tonnage together, the troops are not ready, and when they have the troops ready, the tonnage will not be available.\n\n'The army of 10,000,000 and the 100,000 airships which were to annihilate Germany have proved to be American boasts, which will not stand washing. It is worthy to note how much the Yankees can yell their throats out without spraining their mouths. This is in accord with their spiritual quality. They enjoy a capacity for lying, which is able to conceal to a remarkable degree a lack of thought behind a superfluity of words.\n\n'But some fine day, if they do not stop their boasting land bluffing, it might happen to them that they get the lockjaw, for which there is no better relief than a good box on the ear. Moreover, it is not to be assumed that the Americans are really in earnest with the war. No one would be surprised if they found a thousand and one excuse for taking no active part in the European War.' \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 486]\n\u00a0\n It is not apparent on a reading of this article-which is not unlike many reprints from the press of Germany to which our patriotic societies gave circulation in order to arouse the American fighting spirit-how it could rationally be held to tend even remotely or indirectly to obstruct recruiting. But as this court has declared, and as Professor Chafee has shown in his 'Freedom of Speech in War Time,' 32 Harvard Law Review, 932, 963, the test to be applied-as in the case of criminal attempts and incitements-is not the remote or possible effect. There must be the clear and present danger. Certainly men, judging in calmness and with this test presented to them, could not reasonably have said that this coarse and heavy humor immediately threatened the success of recruiting. Compare United States v. Hall, (D. C.) 248 Fed. 150; United States v. Schutte (D. C.) 252 Fed. 212; Von Bank v. United States, 253 Fed. 641,1 65 C. C. A. 267; Balbas v. United States, 257 Fed. 17, 168 C. C. A. 229; Sandberg v. United States, 257 Fed. 643, 168 C. C. A. 593; Kamman v. United States (C. C. A.) 259 Fed. 192; Wolf v. United States (C. C. A.) 259 Fed. 388, 391, 392.\n\n Second. There were convictions on three counts of willfully conveying false reports and statements with intent to promote the success of the enemies of the United States. The Tageblatt, like many of the smaller newspapers, was without a foreign or a pational news service of any kind, and did not purport to have any. It took such news usually from items appearing in some other paper theretofore published in the German or the English language. It did not in any way indicate the source of its news. The item, if taken from the English press, was of course translated. Sometimes it was copied in full, sometimes in part only, and sometimes it was rewritten, or editorial comment was added. The government did not attempt to prove that any statement made in any of the news items published in the Tageblatt was false in fact. Its evidence, \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 487]\n\u00a0\n under each count, was limited to showing that the item as published therein varied in some particular from the item as it appeared in the paper from which it had been copied; and no attempt was made to prove the original dispatch to the latter paper. The government contended that solely because of variation from the item copied it was a false report, although the item in the Tageblatt did not purport to reproduce an item from another paper, and in no way indicated the source of the news. Each of the three items following illustrates a different method by which the variation was effected:\n I. The publication for which the news editor was convicted on the fifth county by reason of an addition to the item copied:\n (The translation of the Tageblatt item as set forth in the indictment:)\n'Further Economies.\n\n'Amsterdam, September 2.-It has been reported here that permission to export the wheat and flour on the ships held in New York has been refused. Information to this effect is contained in an official proclamation of the latest cut in bread rations and of the need for economy which has reached the civil authorities: This document says: 'We know now with certainty that we cannot count upon the import of breadstuffs from America and that we must strive to make our own provisions suffice. In initiated circles it is said that under no conditions can the new American proposal be accepted, and that the foodstuffs may rot before the ships will be unloaded.\"\n\n (The original Tageblatt item as set forth in the indictment:)\n Weitere Einschrankungen.\n Amsterdam, 2. Sept.-Es wird hier gemeldet, dasz der Export von Welzen und Mehl auf den in New York zuruckgehaltenen Schiffen verweigert wurde. Eine diesbezugliche Mittheilung ist in einer amtlichen Erklarung der jungsten Brotrationen-Verringerung und der Aufforderung zur Einschrankung enthalten, welche den Gemeindebehorden zuging. In derselben heiszt es: 'Wir wissen nun bestimmt, dasz wir auf die Einfuhr von Brotgetreide aus Amerika nicht rechnen konnen, und dasz wir uns bemuhen mussen, mit den eigenen Vorrathen auszukommen.'-In eingeweihten Kreisen heiszt es, dasz man auf den neuen Vorschlag Amerikas unter keinen Umstanden eingehen und das Getreide eher verfaulen lassen wird, als die Schiffe auszuladen. \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 488]\n\u00a0\n The falsification charged is said to consist in having added to the dispatch which was copied from the Staatszeitung the words:\n'In initiated circles it is said that under no conditions can the new American proposal be accepted, and that the foodstuffs may rot before the ships will be unloaded.'\n\n But it is obvious, upon comparing the English translation with the German original, that the defendant did no such thing. What occurred was this: The sentence referred to was not made a part of the dispatch in the Tageblatt. It followed the dispatch; it was not within the quotation marks, and was separated from it by a dash-a usual method of ini cating that what follows is comment or an addition made by the editor. In the English translation, as set forth in the indictment, this sentence, through some inadvertence of the government's translator or draftsman, was included as part of the dispatch and brought with the quotation therein. Evidently both the jury and the trial judge failed to examine the German original.\n\n 2. \nOne of the publications for which the news editor was convicted on the first count because of an omission from the item copied:\n'Ready for the Fray?\n\n'St. Petersburg, September 7th.-The Russian Baltic Fleet will defend Kronstadt and Reval, and through them the Russian capital itself. The commanders of the two fortresses have made this report to the provisional government. A large part of the Baltic fleet was under control of the Maximalists, who hitherto have opposed Kerensky. The commanders of Sveaborg and Helsingfors have also telegraphed their assurance to the government that the Baltic fleet has expressed its willingness to offer desperate resistance, in case the Germans should make a naval attack upon the strongholds between Riga and the capital.\n\n'Investigation of the Fall of Riga.\n\n'The Russians devastated the land through which \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 489]\n\u00a0\n they retreated from Riga, in order to impede the German advance. Roads were broken up, bridges destroyed and provisions burned. A special commission has been set up by Premier Kerensky to investigate the fall of Riga. As far as reports have so far been permitted to appear, it is established that only two regiments gave up their positions without fighting, and the others offered the attacking Germans bold resistance. The retreat was carried out in an orderly manner, in spite of pursuit by the German armies. The first of these, advancing along the coast in the region of Dunaburg, is apparently endeavoring to reach Berna, on the Gulf of Riga. The second German army is pressing along the Pskoff road to execute a turning movement, while the third is energetically pushing in a northeasterly direction against Ostroff. The Germans are showing signs of nervousness in advancing through this marshy lake-strewn country, which are increased by the Russian resistance.'\n\n The falsification here is said to consist in the omission from the end of the first paragraph of the following sentence which appeared in the paper from which the item was taken:\n'From this it can be concluded that the fall of Riga has united the opposing political factions in Russia.'\n\n\n 3. \nThe publication for which the news editor was convicted on the sixth count, because of the change of a word in the item copied:\n'War of the Rich.\n\n'Senator La Follette Thinks They Ought Not to Make a Cent of Profit.\n\n'Hot Fight in the Senate Over Increased Taxation of War Profits.\n\n'Washington, August 21.-Taxation of riches in such a measure that the burdens of the cost of the war will be taken from the shoulders of the poor man was recommended today in the Senate by Senator La Follette in a long speech. He declared that the proposed two billion \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 490]\n\u00a0\n dollar bill as drawn up in the Senate's Committee on Financial Affairs is impractical because it covers less than seventeen per cent. of the war expenses of the first year and from this would result the necessity of issuing bonds for billions of dollars. Bonds, however, mean the same as an increased cost of living, and one of the consequences would be that next winter bread riots could be expected in the big cities. He recommended the acceptance of amendments by which further taxation of large incomes and big war profits would be effected, which would bring the total amount of the bill to about $3, 500,000,000.\n\n'Senator La Follette declared that wealth had never, in any war, offered itself on the altar of patriotism. He attacked the proposed issue of bonds and prophesied that the Liberty Bonds would eventually find their way into the hands of the rich, if they had not already done so. 'But,' he continued, 'this is not all, for war, and principally the sale ofb onds, leads inevitably to inflation. This raises prices and through that the cost of living for the great mass of people is raised. Reason and experience teach us that the policy of financing a war for the most part by borrowing the necessary money, is in itself one of the worst financial burdens that war imposes upon men. But wealth is always a powerful factor in the Government. It fattens on war loans and war contracts as well as on speculation, which is not wanting in time of war. Upon these grounds the rich are always in favor of war, and when they have succeeded in bringing on a war, they are often powerful enough with ministers of war and parliaments and congresses to force the maximum of loans and to reduce taxation to a minimum by every possible intrigue and argument.\n\n\"And that is the case with us in this war. Within thirty days after the declaration of war wealth had precipitated us into bond issues of unheard of size. Morgan came to the city, the press urged it, the administration \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 491]\n\u00a0\n commanded it, and Congress authorized the issue of five billions of untaxable Government bonds and two billions of interest bearing Treasury notes.'\n\n'Senator La Follette attacked the program of the administration under which a new tax measure will be introduced next winter. 'Of what use is the postponement?' he asked, 'Whose interest is served if taxes on incomes and war profits are kept down and the masses are delivered over to the money lenders as security for an enormous and wickedly disproportionate issue of bonds?' He insisted that the policy of financing the war should at once be decided upon.\n\n\"To-day the way is clear,' he explained, 'hesitation to provide now for heavy taxes would not be a mistake, it would be something worse.'\n\n'Senator La Follette reviewed the financial history of previous American wars. 'We must not repeat such mistakes,' he said, 'it would be blind madness if we did not learn from the mistakes that were made in previous wars. A mistake that we make now may be fatal. It would certainly cost us untold millions of dollars and thousands upon thousands of lives, and by it we would prolong the war unnecessarily.\n\n\"As long as one man can be found who makes war profits, I am in favor of taking away in taxes such part of those profits as the Government requires, and the Government needs the whole of such profits before adding a penny to the taxation of people who are already staggering under heavy burdens by reason of the higher prices occasioned by the war. This may be a new principle in war financing, but it is the least that one can do for the mass of the people, and it is considerably less than simple justice would demand for them.\n\n\"The great mass of the people bear the costs of war, although they may not be directly taxed one dollar. The great mass of the people payin higher prices and pro- \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 492]\n\u00a0\n longed hours of labor. They pay in service, not alone on the battle field, but whenever men and women work hard all day long. But more than all this, they pay the cost of war with their blood, and their lives, and what is the greatest sacrifice of all, with the blood and lives of their loved ones.\n\n\"If bread lines are a familiar sight in every city in the land, as they undoubtedly will be if the present prices of the most necessary supplies for living hold firm during the coming winter, if cold and hunger become daily guests with thousands of families, who, until now, have only known comfort, a condition which is certain to come about during the coming winter months, if no help against the present level of prices can be found, then it is my opinion that the members of this Congress will do little enough if they come to realize that they are adding to the privations and pains of the mass of the people if they hesitate to place even a fairly moderate portion of the financial burden upon the rich.\"\n\n Falsification is charged solely because the word 'Brot-riots' ( translated as 'breadriots') was used in the eleventh line of the article, instead o the word 'Brodreihen' (translated as 'bread-lines').\n The act punishes the willful making and conveying of 'false reports and false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies.' Congress sought thereby to protect the American people from being willfully misled to the detriment of their cause by one actuated by the intention to further the cause of the enemy. Willfully untrue statements which might mislead the people as to the financial condition of the government and thereby embarrass it; as to the adequacy of the preparations for war or the support of the forces; as to the sufficiency of the food supply; or willfully untrue statements or reports of military operations \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 493]\n\u00a0\n which might mislead public opinion as to the competency of the army and navy or its leader (see 'The Relation Between the Army and the Press in War Time,' War College Publication, 1916); or willfully untrue statements or reports which might mislead officials in the execution of the law, or military authorities in the disposition of the forces-such is the kind of false statement, and the only kind, which, under any rational construction, is made criminal by the act. Could the military and naval forces of the United States conceivably have been interfered with, or the success of the enemy conceivably have been promoted by, any of the three publications set forth above? Surely, neither the addition to the first nor the omission from the second constituted the making of a false statement or report. The mistranslation of 'breadlines' in one passage of the third, if it can be deemed a false report, obviously could not have promoted the success of our enemies. The other publications set out in the indictment were likewise impotent to produce the evil against which the statute aimed.\n Darkow, the news editor, and Werner, the editor, were each sentenced to five years in the penitentiary; Lemke, the business manager, to two years. The jury which found men guilty for publishing news items or editorials like those here in question must have supposed it to be within their province to condemn men, not merely for disloyal acts, but for a disloyal heart: provided only that the disloyal heart was evidenced by some utterance. To prosecute men for such publications reminds of the days when men were hanged for constructive treason. And, indeed, the jury may well have believed from the charge that the Espionage Act had in effect restored the crime of constructive treason. \n2\n To hold that such harmless additions \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 494]\n\u00a0\n to or omissions from news items, and such impotent expressions of editorial opinion, as were shown here, can afford the basis even of a prosecution, will doubtless discourage criticism of the policies of the government. To hold that such publications can be suppressed as false reports, subjects to new perils the constitutional liberty of the press, already seriously curtailed in practice under powers assumed to have been conferred upon the postal authorities. Nor will this grave danger end with the passing \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 495]\n\u00a0\n of the war. The constitutional right of free speech has been declared to be the same in peace and in war. In peace, too, men may differ widely as to what loyalty to our country demands; and an intolerant majority, swayed by passion or by fear, may be prone in the future, as it has often been in the past to stamp as disloyal opinions with which it disagrees. Convictions such as these, besides abridging freedom of speech, threaten freedom of thought and of belief.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE, dissenting.\n On a single indictment, containing nine counts, five men, Peter Schaefer, Paul Vogel, Louis Werner, Martin Darkow and Herman Lemke, were convicted and sentenced to the penitentiary for printing seventeen articles in a German language newspaper, published at Philadelphia, between, June 24 and September 17, 1917.\n Schaefer was president and Vogel was treasurer of the company which published the paper, but their entire time was given to the service of labor unions, which had loaned money to the company, and they were given these official positions for the purpose of enabling them to keep informed as to its business progress and the disposition of its earnings.\n All the members of the court agree that there was no substantial evidence that Schaefer or Vogel were in any respect responsible for the publications complained of and that as to them the judgment must be reversed.\n In this conclusion I cordially concur, but I go further and am clear that a similar reversal should be entered as to Herman Lemke, who was convicted, as Schaefer and Vogel were, on only one of the nine counts of the indictment.\n Lemke was given the sounding title of 'business manager,' but, as a matter of fact, he was a mere bookkeeper, \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 496]\n\u00a0\n of a small business, with very limited authority. The newspaper led a precarious financial existence and Lemke's duties were restricted to making out and collecting bills for advertising and circulation, to paying some bills and to turning over the remainder of the money, if any remained, to the treasurer, Vogel. Lemke himself and two or three other witnesses testified that he had nothing whatever to do with deciding what should be published in the newspaper, and that he never wrote for it excepting that when a reporter was ill he occasionally reported a concert. There was no evidence to the contrary.\n On such a record it is very clear that a man holding such a position as Lemke held, could not, and did not, have anything to do with determining what should be published in the paper. He had no more to do with the policy of the paper than a porter would have with determining the policy of a railroad company. In my judgment the failure of proofa  to Lemke was as complete as it was as to Schaefer and Vogel and I cannot share in permitting him to be imprisoned in the penitentiary for a year for publications which he was powerless either to authorize or prevent.\n A different case is made against Werner and Darkow. Werner was a writer of political editorials for the paper, and Darkow was the news editor. Werner was found guilty on four counts and not guilty on five. Darkow was found guilty on five counts and not guilty on four.\n Two of the articles written, or caused to be published, by Werner, and one, or perhaps two, of those caused to be published by Darkow, were of a character such that they might have been fairly convicted of violating the act under which they were indicted, but none of these articles was included in count 1, and only one of them was included in count 9, and with respect to this one article in count 9 Werner was found not guilty when charged with its publication in count 3. The charge of the court did \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 497]\n\u00a0\n not distinguish between these really offending publications and the many innocent ones the publication of which was charged to be criminal, with the result that it failed to give such direction to the deliberations of the jury as I think every person accused of crime is entitled to have given.\n The denial of separate motions to instruct the jury to render a verdict of not guilty as to Werner and Darkow on the first and ninth counts seems to me to constitute error so fundamental and pervasive as to render the entire trial unfair and unjust, to a degree which requires the granting of a new trial to each of them.\n I shall state my reasons for this conclusion as briefly as I may.\n The first count charges that the defendants--\n'knowingly, willfully and unlawfully made and conveyed false reports and statements, with intent to promote the success of the enemy of the United States, to wit, the Imperial German government.'\n\n The indictment and the record in general make it very plain that the district attorney, in framing the indictment, and during the trial, believed that the statute prohibiting the making and conveying of a false report and statement would be violated by the publication of any article which had been published elsewhere if, in the publication, it was changed, either by addition or omission, and this without any proof that the original publication was true and the second publication false, and seemingly without regard to whether or not the publication had any tendency to promote the success of the enemy. The trial court accepted this construction of the statute and submitted the first count to the jury on this theory of the law.\n I cannot doubt that this was gravely erroneous, for the real purpose of the statute is to punish, published, not suppressed, reports and statements, whether original or \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 498]\n\u00a0\n copies, made with the intent to promote the success, and which were of a nature reasonably likely to promote the success, of the enemy of the United States-by discouraging our own people or encouraging the enemy.\n The first of the 13 false reports, which it is charged in the first count were published, is typical of the others, and will sufficiently explain my position.\n It purported to be a dispatch from London and translated reads as follows:\n'The Crisis.\n\n'Is Advancing in Russia with Rapid Strides.\n\n The Coalition Government Will Probably Not Last Long.\n'Its Position in Foreign Affairs is Condemned.\n\n'London, June 23.-The Petrograd correspondent of the Chronicle telegraphs today that a great crisis is in progress in Russia. (By that he means apparently that the unstable and weak coalition government will soon be got rid of. It seems to obey unwillingly the instructions of the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council to request the allies to revise their war aims. The workmen will not stand for this much longer. It is highly significant too that not a word has been reported for four days about the great general congress of the Workmen's and Soldiers' delegates; apparently because its e havior does not please the allies.)\n\n'The correspondent of the Chronicle quotes an extract from Maxim Gorky's newspaper 'New Life,' which says that people all over the world are to understand that Russia rejects the aggressive war aims of the allies. The correspondent sees a sign in this that the socialists of Russia will not wait much longer.'\n\n Obviously there is nothing in this, as published, which could either discourage Americans or encourage the German enemy, and the indictment does not claim that there is. That which the indictment charges makes the publication criminally false is that there was omitted from it 'a \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 499]\n\u00a0\n proposal by Maxim Gorky that Russia wage a separate war against Germany.' Thus the charge is that the crime consisted not in publishing something which tended to encourage German enemies, but in omitting to publish something which it is conceived might have discouraged them. It is not charged that what was printed was harmful, but that something which was unfavorable to Germany was not published.\n This is characteristic of all but 2 of the 13 articles in the first count, and to these, additions were made so inconsequential as in my judgment not to deserve notice.\n It seems to me very clear that the statute could not be violated by publishing reports and statements harmless in themselves and which were not shown to be false, merely because they had been published in a different form in another paper-and this is the extent to which the proof in this case goes as to all of the publications complained of in the first count. Without more discussion, I am so clear that the requested instruction for the defendants Werner and Darkow as to the first count should have been granted, that I think the refusal of it entitles them to a new trial.\n The ninth count consists of a charge of conspiracy on the part of the entire five defendants to willfully make and convey false reports and false statements with intent to interfere with the operation and success of the military and naval forces of the United States, with willfully causing and attempting to cause insubordination, disloyalty and mutiny in the military and naval forces of the United States, and with willfully obstructing the recruiting and enlisting service of the United States by the publication of various articles referred to, but not quoted, in the indictment.\n With a single exception these articles are the same as those incorporated in the first count and this exception purported to be a dispatch from the Hague, giving the \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 500]\n\u00a0\n reasons for the unrest in Germany, from which it is charged there was omitted a statement that one of the reasons for such unrest was the failure of the submarine campaign carried on by the German government. Even in this ninth count it is not charged that the publications as actually made were harmful but it proceeds as does the first count, upon the implication that they might have been more discouraging than they were to the German enemy if the omitted statements had been incorporated into them, and that for this reason they violated the statute. In other words, it comes to this, that the ninth count charges as criminal, not a conspiracy to publish the articles complained of, which were innocent, but a conspiracy to suppress certain statements which were published in other newspapers in connection with or as a part of the published articles and which it is argued might have been harmful to the German cause if they had been published. It is impossible for me to think that the statute could be violated in any such manner.\n It was clearly proved that the newspaper was so poor financially that it was not able to have telegraphic service of any character and, morning paper that it was, it filled its news columns with clippings from the evening papers of the night before and from early editions of the morning papers when it could procure them before its hour for going to press. It did not print nearly as many columns as the newspapers from which it obtained its news and for this reason it a  necessarily obliged to cut and condense. both headlines and the body of the articles. In several of the instances complained of these exigencies of publication plainly caused the omissions complained of.\n Convinced as I am that the requested instructions to the jury that Werner and Darkow could not be found guilty on the first and ninth counts should have been given, and that the charge of the court was so utterly unadapted to the case as it would have been if they had been \n\n[251 U.S. 466, 501]\n\u00a0\n given, as to be valueless or worse as a direction to the jury, I think that the least that can be done, in the interest of the orderly administration of justice, is to grant a new trial and let a new jury, properly instructed, pass upon the case.\n I cannot see, as my Associates seem to see, that the disposition of this case involves a great peril either to the maintenance of law and order and governmental authority on the one hand, or to the freedom of the press on the other. To me it seems simply a case of flagrant mistrial, likely to result in disgrace and great injustice, probably in life imprisonment for two old men, because this court hesitates to exercise the power, which it undoubtedly possesses, to correct, in this calmer time, errors of law which would not have been committed, but for the stress and strain of feeling prevailing in the early months of the late deplorable war. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 3. Whoever, when the United States is at war, shall willfully make or convey false reports or false statements with intent to interfere with the operation or success of the military or naval forces of the United States or to promote the success of its enemies and whoever, when the United States is at war shall willfully cause or attempt to cause insubordination, disloyalty, mutiny, or refusal of duty, in the military or naval forces of the United States, or shall willfully obstruct the recruiting or enlistment service of the United States, to the injury of the service or of the United States, shall be punished. ...' 40 Stat. 219. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The presiding judge in charging the jury said of the act: '... Its general purpose is to protect our military strength and efficiency to protect ourselves against anything which would promote the success of our enemies by undermining our morale, lessening our will to win, or as it is generally expressed, our will to conquer, ... creating divisions among our people. ...\n'These acts which are prohibited are treasonable in the sense in which that word is used, in the common speech of the people. Indeed, they may constitute legal treason as defined in some jurisdictions, but they are not treason against the United States, for the simple reason that there is a provision in our Constitution (which of course, the acts of Congress follow), that treason against the United States-you will observe that it does not say 'treason generally,' but treason against the United States, shall consist only in making war upon them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort, and there is another provision to the effect that no person shall be convicted of the crime of treason unless there are two witnesses to the same overt act, making, as you will see, it perfectly clear that mere words, whether published or not, as long as they are mere words, do not constitute the crime of treason, but they must be words uttered and published under such circumstances as to become deeds or acts in themselves, as 'words' may be. \n\n So that words, unless there is something to which they may attach and unless the direct, natural, and reasonably to be expected consequences of them would be to aid the enemy, do not constitute the crime of treason. Every man will observe, however, that even mere words may be fraught with consequences which although too remote to constitute the crime of treason, may nevertheless be words which are fraught with most awful consequences , ... and that therefore it is properly within the province of the law to prohibit ... and make it a crime even to utter them. This is in substance what the law does. Congress could not call some mere words treason, because the Constitution prohibits it, but there is no constitutional limitation on the power of Congress to declare those things a crime against the law which Congress has done in this act. ...' \n\n\n\n\n","135":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHALL v. CAMORS(1920)\nNo. 84\nArgued: November 17, 1919Decided: January 5, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 239, 240]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. S. Rounds, of New York City, for petitioners.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 239, 246]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Monte M. Lemann, of New Orleans, La., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The transactions out of which this controversy arose took place in the years 1913 and 1914. At that time Le More and Carriere carried on business as partners in the cities of New Orleans, La., and Mobile, Ala. Afterwards, and in the month of May, 1914, upon an involuntary petition in bankruptcy, the firm and the individual members thereof were adjudged bankrupts in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana, New Orleans Division, and the present respondents were elected and qualified as trustees of both the partnership and the individual estates. The present \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 247]\n\u00a0\n petitioners, constituting the firm of Muller, Schall & Co., filed three proofs of claim, one against the partnership and one against each of the individual partners, all based upon the same transactions, which consisted of the purchase by claimants in the city of New York, through an agent of the bankrupt firm named Trippe, of certain bills of exchange and checks drawn by the firm upon Loudon, Paris, and Antwerp, aggregating about $70, 000, all of which were sold to petitioners for full value on the faith of certain fraudulent representations not necessary to be specified, and, at maturity, were presented for payment, dishonored and protested, and notice thereof given to the firm. At the time of these transactions Le More was in Europe and Carriere in New Orleans, and neither of them participated in the particular transactions, although both were congnizant of them and responsible for the false representations. The particular drafts and checks were not signed or indorsed by either partner, and neither profited from their sale except through his interest in the firm. The transactions occurred in the ordinary course of the firm's business, except that they were fraudulent, and the proceeds of the drafts and checks went to the credit of the firm and were used in the conduct of its business. Petitioners' claim against the partnership is based upon the drafts and checks as partnership obligations in contract, and also upon the damages sustained by reason of the fraudulent representations. The claims against the individual estates of the partners in terms demand only damages for the false representations, but are relied upon as showing also, by inference, an individual liability in quasi contact or equitable debt.\n The trustees petitioned the District Court that the latter claims should be expunged. After a hearing the referee in bankruptcy, for reasons expressed in an elaborate opinion, ordered that the claims against the individual \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 248]\n\u00a0\n estates should be 'expunged and disallowed,' and the rights of claimants to participate in dividends in such estates denied. Upon review, the District Court affirmed this order, and, upon appeal, its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 250 Fed. 6, 162 C. C. A. 178. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n No question is made as to whether the referee's order, in wholly expunging the claims against the individual estates and denying to petitioners all participation therein, went too far in view of the provision of section 5f of the Bankruptcy Act July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544, 548 (Comp. St.  9589), that--\n'Should any surplus remain of the property of any partner after paying his individual debts, such surplus shall be added to the partnership assets and be applied to the payment of the partnership debts.'\n\n If the decision be sustained, petitioners nevertheless will be entitled, upon establishing their claim against the partnership, to participate as partnership creditors in any surplus that may remain of individual assets after payment of individual debts. What was asserted and overruled was a right to double proof, establishing a separate and independent liability on the part of the individual partners that would give to the claimants, in addition to their participation in the partnership assets, a participation in the individual assets on equal terms with other individual creditors and in preference to other partnership creditors.\n The first and fundamental question is whether a claim for unliquidated damages, arising out of a pure tort which neither constitutes a breach of an express contract nor results in any unjust enrichment of the tortfeasor that may form the basis of an implied contract, is provable in bankruptcy. This question was passed upon by the referee and by the District Court; it has been most elaborately argued pro and con in this court; its general importance in the administration of the Bankruptcy Act warranted a review of the case by certiorari; and hence it is \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 249]\n\u00a0\n proper that we dispose of it, without regard to whether a like result might follow, upon the particular facts of the case, from a decision of any subordinate question.\n Considering, therefore, the question stated: Among other definitions included in section 1 of the Bankruptcy Act (Comp. St.  9585) is this:\n'(11) 'Debt' shall include any debt, demand, or claim provable in bankruptcy.'\n\n Sec. 63 (Comp. St.  9647) runs as follows:\n'Debts Which may be Proved.-a Debts of the bankrupt may be proved and allowed against his estate which are (1) a fixed liability, as evidenced by a judgment or an instrument in writing, absolutely owing at the time of the filing of the petition against him, whether then payable or not, with any interest thereon which would have been recoverable at that date or with a rebate of interest upon such as were not then payable and did not bear interest; ... (4) founded upon an open account, or upon a contract express or implied. ...\n\n'b Unliquidated claims against the bankrupt may, pursuant to application to the court, be liquidated in such manner as it shall direct, and may thereafter be proved and allowed against the estate.'\n\n In Dunbar v. Dunbar, \n190 \nU.S. 340, 350\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 757, 761 (47 L. Ed. 1084), it was said:\n'This paragraph b, however, adds nothing to the class of debts which might be proved under paragraph a of the same section. Its purpose is to permit an unliquidated claim coming within the provisions of section 63a to be liquidated as the court should direct.'\n\n But in Crawford v. Burke, \n195 \nU.S. 176, 187\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 9, the question whether the effect of paragraph b was to cause an unliquidated claim, susceptible of liquidation, but not literally embraced by paragraph a, to be provable in bankruptcy, was regarded as still open.\n That clause b provides the procedure for liquidating claims provable under clause a if not already liquidated, especially those founded upon an open account or a contract express or implied, is entirely clear, and has been \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 250]\n\u00a0\n recognized repeatedly in our decisions. F. L. Grant Shoe Co. v. Laird, \n212 \nU.S. 445, 447\n, 448 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 332; Central Trust Co. v. Chicago Auditorium, \n240 \nU.S. 581, 592\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 412, L. R. A. 1917B, 580. Has it the further effect of admitting all unliquidated claims, including those of tortious origin?\n Historically, bankruptcy laws, both in England and in this country, have dealt primarily and particularly with the concerns of traders. Our earlier bankruptcy acts invariably have been regarded as excluding from consideration unliquidated claims arising purely ex delicto. Act of April 4, 1800, c. 19, 2 Stat. 19; Dusar v. Murgatroyd, 1 Wash. C. C. 13, 8 Fed. Cas. 140, No. 4,199; Act of August 19, 1841, c. 9, 5 Stat. 440; Doggett v. Emerson, 1 Woodb. & M. 195, 7 Fed.

C.) 23 Fed. 880.\n Can it be supposed that the present act was intended to depart so widely from the precedents as to include mere tort claims among the provable debts? Its sixty-third section does not so declare in terms, and there is nothing in the history of the act to give ground for such an inference. It was the result of a long period of agitation, participated in by commercial conventions, boards of trade, chambers of commerce, and other commercial bodies. To say nothing of measures proposed in previous Congresses, a bill in substantially the present form was favorably reported by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives in the First Session of the Fifty-Fourth Congress. Having then failed of passage, it was submitted again in the Second Session of the Fifty-Fifth Congress as a substitute for a Senate bill; after disagreeing votes of the two houses, it went to conference and as the result of a conference \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 251]\n\u00a0\n report became law. It is significant that section 63, defining 'Debts Which may be Proved,' remained unchanged from first to last, except for a slight and insignificant variance in clause (5) in the final print; the word 'interests' having been substituted for 'interest.' House Rept. No. 1228, 54th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 39; House Rept. No. 65, 55th Cong., 2d Sess, p. 21; Senate Doc. No. 294, 55th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 22. Evidently the words of the section were carefully chosen; and the express mention of contractual obligations naturally excludes those arising from a mere tort. Since claims founded upon an open account or upon a contract, express or implied, often require to be liquidated, some provision for procedure evidently was called for. Clause b fulfills this function, and would have to receive a strained interpretation in order that it should include claims arising purely ex delicto. Such claims might easily have been mentioned if intended to be included. Upon every consideration we are clear that claims based upon a mere tort are not provable. Where the tortious act constitutes at the same time a breach of contract, a different question may be raised, with which we have no present concern; and where, by means of the tort, the tort-feasor obtains something of value for which an equivalent price ought to be paid, even if the tort as such be forgiven, there may be a provable claim quasi ex contractu. Crawford v. Burke, \n195 \nU.S. 176, 187\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 9; Tindle v. Birkett, \n205 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 493; Clarke v. Rogers, 183 Fed. 518, 521, 522, 106 C. C. A. 64, affirmed \n228 \nU.S. 534, 543\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 587.\n Of course, sections 63 and 17 are to be read together. The reference in the latter section to 'provable debts,' defined in the former would be sufficient to show this. See Crawford v. Burke, \n195 \nU.S. 176, 193\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 9; Tindle v. Birkett, \n205 \nU.S. 183, 186\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 493; Friend v. Talcott, \n228 \nU.S. 27, 39\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 505; Clarke v. Rogers, \n228 \nU.S. 534, 548\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 587. It is petitioners' contention that section 17, as amended in 1903 ( Act of February 5, 1903, c. 487,  5, 32 Stat. 797, 798 [Comp. St.  9601 ]), amounts to a legislative \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 252]\n\u00a0\n construction admitting tort claims to proof. The section as it stood before and the nature of the amendment, are set forth in the margin. \n1\n We are referred to the committee's report (House Rept. No. 1693, 57th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 3, 6) as indicating that by the law as it stood, in the opinion of the committee, claims created by fraud, but not reduced to judgment, were discharged; reference having been made to In re Rhutassel ( D. C.) 96 Fed. 597, and In re Lewensohn (D. C.) 99 Fed. 73, affirmed 104 Fed. 1006, 44 C. C. A. 309, as contradictory decisions upon the point. But neither the report of the committee nor the language of the amendment gives the least suggestlon of an intent to enlarge the description of provable claims as set forth in section 63. On the contrary, the purpose was to limit more \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 253]\n\u00a0\n narrowly the effect of a discharge by enlarging the class of provable debts that were to be excepted from it. By the terms of the section, both before and after amendment, the scope of the exception was qualified by the fact that the discharge released the bankrupt only from 'provable debts.' And if the excepting clause as amended might seem to extend to some claims not obterwise provable, its own force must be deemed to be limited by referring to section 63 for the definition of provability. It is not admissible to give to this amendment, confessedly designed to restrict the scope of a discharge in bankruptcy, the effect of enlarging the class of provable claims.\n Aside from section 17 or the amendment thereof, it has been held by the federal courts generally that section 63 does not authorize the liquidation and proof of claims arising ex delicto and unaffected by contract express or implied. In re Hirschman (D. C.) 104 Fed. 69, 70, 71; In re Yates (D. C.) 114 Fed. 365, 367; In re Crescent Lumber Co. (D. C.) 154 Fed. 724, 727; In re Southern Steel Co. (D. C.) 183 Fed. 498.\n And that the amendment of section 17 does not enlarge the class of provable claims enumerated in section 63 has been recognized in several well-considered decisions of the federal courts which have held, upon satisfactory grounds, that pure tort claims are not provable. In re United Button Co. (D. C.) 140 Fed. 495, 499, et seq., on appeal Brown v. United Button Co., 149 Fed. 48, 52, 53, 79 C. C. A. 70, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 961, 9 Ann. Cas. 445; In re New York Tunnel Co., 159 Fed. 688, 690, 86 C. C. A. 556. In Jackson v. Wauchula Mfg. Co., 230 Fed. 409, 411, 144 C. C. A. 551, and again in the present case (250 Fed. 7, 162 C. C. A. 178), the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit passed the question as unnecessary for the decision.\n There is an argument ab inconvenienti, based upon the supposed danger that if tort claims be held not provable they may be preferred by failing debtors without redress \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 254]\n\u00a0\n under section 60, a and b (30 Stat. 562), amended February 5, 1903 ( chapter 487,  13, 32 Stat. 797, 799), amended June 25, 1910 (chapter 412 ,  11, 36 Stat. 838, 842 [Comp. St.  9644]), held to apply only to provable claims. Richardson v. Shaw, \n209 \nU.S. 365, 381\n, 28 S. Sup. Ct. 512, 14 Ann. Cas. 981. See, also, Clarke v. Rogers, \n228 \nU.S. 534, 542\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 587. We are not much impressed. If there be danger of mischief here, other than such as may be reached under the provisions of section 67e or section 70e (Comp. St.  9651, 9654) respecting fraudulent conveyances and transfers (see Dean v. Davis, \n242 \nU.S. 438, 444\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 130), the Congress may be trusted to supply the remedy by an appropriate amendment.\n It is insisted by petitioners, further, that because the proofs of the individual claims establish the responsibility of each partner for the frauds, they are liable in solido not only as partners, but individually, and that, irrespective of whether the claims are provable in tort for the fraud, they are provable and were properly proved both against the individual partners and against the firm as claims in quasi contract or equitable debt. But as the basis of a liability of this character is the unjust enrichment of the debtor, and as the facts show that no benefit accrued to the individuals as a result of the frauds beyond that which accrued to the firm, the logical result of the argument is that out of one enrichment there may arise three separate and independent indebtednesses. Doubtless it would be conceded that a single satisfaction would discharge all of the claims; but we are dealing with a situation where by reason of insolvency it is not to be presumed that claims will be satisfied in full; and, as already pointed out, the effect of sustaining the right to double proof would be to give petitioners not only a right to share in the partnership assets on equal terms with other partnership creditors, but a participation in the individual assets on equal terms with other individual creditors and in preference to other partnership creditors. Section 5 of the Bankruptcy Act (30 Stat. 547, 548) establishes on a firm basis the respective \n\n[251 U.S. 239, 255]\n\u00a0\n equities of the individual and firm creditors. \n2\n Hence the distinction between individual and firm debts is a matter of substance, and must depend upon the essential character of the transactions out of which they arise. And since in this case the tort was done in the course of the partnership business, for the benefit of the firm and without benefit to the partners as individuals, no legal or equitable claim as against the individuals that might be deemed to arise out of it, by waiver of the tort or otherwise, can displace the equities of other creditors, recognized in the Bankruptcy Act, and put petitioners in a position of equality with others who actually were creditors of the individual partners, and of preference over other firm creditors. Reynolds v. New York Trust Co., 188 Fed. 611, 619, 620, 110 C. C. A. 409, 39 L. R. A. (N.

Debts Not Affected by a Discharge.-a A discharge in bankruptcy shall release a bankrupt from all of his provable debts, except such as (1) are due as a tax levied by the United States, the state, county, district, or municipality in which he resides; (2) are judgments in actions for frauds, or obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another; (3) have not been duly scheduled in time for proof and allowance, with the name of the creditor if known to the bankrupt, unless such creditor had notice or actual knowledge of the proceedings in bankruptcy; or (4) were created by his fraud, embezzlement, misappropriation, or defalcation while acting as an officer or in any fiduciary capacity.'\n\n Amendment of 1903 (32 Stat. 798) inserted in the place of clause 2 the following:\n'(2) Are liabilities for obtaining property by false pretenses or false representations, or for willful and malicious injuries to the person or property of another, or for alimony due or to become due, or for maintenance or support of wife or child, or for seduction of an unmarried female, or for criminal conversation.'\n\n NOTE.-By a further amendment (Act of March 2, 1917, ch. 153, 39 Stat. 999) there was inserted after the word 'female,' instead of 'or for criminal conversation,' the following: 'or for breach of promise of marriage accompanied by seduction, or for criminal conversation.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Sec. 5.

It was brought in the District Court of the United States for the District of North Dakota to enjoin the payment of public funds in the state treasury and the issuing of state bonds under the Constitution and laws of North Dakota. We have sufficiently stated the nature of this Constitution and the laws involved in the opinion in No. 811.\n The jurisdiction was invoked because of alleged violation of rights under the Fourteenth Amendment. The complainants were taxpayers of North Dakota, who alleged that suit was brought on behalf of themselves and all other taxpayers of the state. There was no diversity of citizenship and jurisdiction was rested solely upon the alleged violation of constitutional rights. The District Court rendered a decree dismissing the bill on the merits; the judge stating that he was of opinion that there was no jurisdiction, and directing the dismissal on the merits to prevent delay, and to permit the suit being brought here by a single appeal.\n There is no allegation that the loss or injury to any complainant amounts to the sum of $3,000.

CO. v. U S(1920)\nNo. 27\nArgued: Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 57, 58]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Claudian B. Northrop, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Frank W. Gwathmey and R. Walton Moore, both of Washington, D. C., for appellants.\n Mr. Blackburn Esterline, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. Charles W. Needham, of Washington, D. C., for Interst. Com. Com'n.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 57, 59]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case a petition was filed in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Virginia to enjoin an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission concerning the absorption of switching charges on the lines of the Seaboard Air Line Railway Company, the Seaboard Air Line Railway, Southern Railway Company, and Atlantic Coast Line Railway Company, within the switching limits of these roads as established at Richmond, Va.\n The Commission's order was made upon a petition of the Richmond Chamber of Commerce, averring that the practice of the railroads was discriminatory and unlawful, and violative of section 2 of the Act to Regulate Commerce. From the facts found by the Commission it appears that the appellant railroad companies bring freight from the South to Richmond, Va., where the same is delivered to industries in the switching limits of that city. If the freight is received at a point served by any two or more of the carriers, the switching charge is absorbed if the freight be delivered on the line of either; but if the delivery is to an industry served only by a noncompetitive carrier the switching charge is not absorbed. The Commission illustrated the point by an example:\n'Oxford, N. C., is a point reached both by the Southern and the Seaboard, but not by the Chesapeake & Ohio. Norlina, N. C., is a local point on the Seaboard. Assume that industries A. B, and C. [ referring to a diagram] on the Seaboard, the Southern, and the Chesapeake & Ohio, respectively, are similarly located with regard to the interchange tracks of the three carriers at Richmond. On traffic from Oxford to industry B on the Southern, the Seaboard will absorb the Southern's switching charges. But on traffic from Oxford to industry C, on the Chesapeake & Ohio, the Seaboard refuses to absorb the Chesapeake & Ohio's switching \n\n[254 U.S. 57, 60]\n\u00a0\n charges. On traffic from and to Norlina, a local point, however, the Seaboard refuses to absorb all switching charges whatsoever to any off-line industry.'\n\n The order complained of directed the three carriers to cease and desist, on or before August 1, 1917, and thereafter to abstain, from absorbing switching charges on certain interstate carload freight at Richmond, Va., while refusing to absorb such charges on like carload shipments for a like and contemporaneous service under substantially similar circumstances and conditions; such practices having been found in a supplemental report to be unjustly discriminatory and unlawful within section 2 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, and--\n'to establish, on or before August 1, 1917, ... and thereafter to maintain and apply uniform regulations and practices for the absorption of charges for the switching of interstate carload freight at Richmond, Va., and to collect no higher rates or charges from shippers and receivers of such carload freight at Richmond, Va., than they contemporaneously collect from any other shipper or receiver of such carload freight at Richmond, Va., for a like and contemporaneous service under substantially similar circumstances and conditions.' 44 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 455.\n\n The District Court denied the application for an injunction, and ordered that the petition be dismissed. 249 Fed. 368.\n The contention of the appellants is that the carriage is not a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions.\n Section 2 of the Act to Regulate Commerce provides:\n'That if any common carrier subject to the provisions of this act shall, directly or indirectly, by any special rate, rebate, drawback, or other device, charge, demand, collect, or receive from any person or persons a greater or less compensation for any service rendered, or to be rendered, \n\n[254 U.S. 57, 61]\n\u00a0\n in the transportation of passengers or property, subject to the provisions of this act, than it charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other person or persons for doing for him or them a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, such common carrier shall be deemed guilty of unjust discrimination, which is hereby prohibited and declared to be unlawful.' 24 Stat. 379 ( Comp. St.  8564).\n\n Upon this controversy the Commission in its report said:\n'Complainant insists that, when the line-haul carrier reaches the common point and competes for the traffic to or from Richmond proper, the absorption of the switching charges should not be confined to that traffic for which the switching line competes for the entire haul; that is, if the Seaboard absorbs the switching charges for the shipper on the terminal tracks of the Southern, it should also absorb the switching charges for the shipper on the terminal tracks of the Chesapeake & Ohio. Unless this is done, complaint contends that the two shippers are not upon an equality, since the Seaboard pays for a delivery service to shippers on the terminal tracks of the Southern, and declines to pay for a similar delivery service to shippers on the terminal tracks of the Chesapeake & Ohio. ...\n\n'Section 2 is primarily directed against discrimination between shippers located in the same community. It is aimed to put all shippers within a switching district upon a substantial equality. It provides that where a carrier receives from any person a greater compensation for any service rendered in the transportation of passengers or property than it receives from any other person for doing for him a 'like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, such common carrier shall be deemed guilty of unjust discrimination,' a discrimination which is prohibited and declared to be unlawful. \n\n[254 U.S. 57, 62]\n\u00a0\n Under this section it is settled that the competition of rival carriers as such does not constitute substantially dissimilar circumstances to justify a difference in treatment.'\n\n We are of opinion that the Commission was correct in regarding the service in question as a like and contemporary service rendered under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, and amply sustained as matter of law in Wight v. United States, \n167 U.S. 512\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 822, and Interstate Commerce Commission v. Alabama Midland Railway Co., \n168 U.S. 144\n, 18 Sup. Ct. 45. The principle established in these cases is that the statute aims to establish equality of rights among shippers for carriage under substantially similar circumstances and conditions, and that the exigencies of competition do not justify discrimination against shippers for substantially like services.\n Moreover, the determination of questions of fact is by law imposed upon the Commission, a body created by statute for the consideration of this and like matters. The findings of fact by the Commission upon such questions can be disturbed by judicial decree only in cases where their action is arbitrary or transcends the legitimate bounds of their authority. I. C. C. v. L. & N. R. R. Co., \n227 U.S. 88\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 185; Precooling Case, \n232 U.S. 199\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 291; Los Angeles Switching Case, \n234 \nU.S. 294, 311\n, 312 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 814, and cases cited; Penn. R. R. Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 351, 361\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 370.\n The Commission did not hold that switching charges must be always the same, but did hold that they must be alike where the service was rendered under substantially similar circumstances and conditions. The Commission's report says:\n'We do not consider that the carriers must absorb the switching charges indiscriminately to all industries withih the switching limits of Richmond, if they choose to absorb the switching charges to any one industry off their rails. \n\n[254 U.S. 57, 63]\n\u00a0\n The illegality herein found to exist is the receiving of a greater compensation for one service than for a like service under substantially similar circumstances and conditions. To take a concrete example and referring again to the diagram. Suppose industry C were five miles distant from the interchange tracks of the Seaboard, while industry B were only two miles distant. Suppose the Chesapeake & Ohio's switching charge amounted to $5, while that of the Southern was $2. If the Seaboard absorbed the Southern's $2 switching charge on traffic to industry B, we do not consider that it must absorb the entire $5 switching charge of the Chesapeake & Ohio on traffic to industry C but only to the extent to which the service is similar. In other words, it would probably be necessary for the Seaboard to absorb $2 of the $5 charge of the Chesapeake & Ohio.'\n\n The practice condemned by the Commission, as its report and order show, was that of absorbing switching charges only when the line-haul carrier competes with the switching line, and refusing to absorb such charges when the switching line does not compete with the line-haul carrier; this, the Commission held was discrimination within the meaning of section 2 of the Act to Regulate Commerce. We find no occasion to disturb this ruling as arbitrary in character or beyond the authority of the Commission.\n We find no merit in the contention that the order of the Commission was too vague and uncertain to be enforced.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSHAFFER v. CARTER(1920)\nNo. 531\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 37, 38]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Malcolm E. Rosser, of Muskogee, Okl., for appellant.[ Shaffer v. Carter \n252 U.S. 37\n (1920) ]\n\n\n[252 U.S. 37, 43]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These are two appeals, taken under circumstances that will be explained, from a single decree in a suit in equity brought by appellant to restrain the enforcement of a tax assessed against him for the year 1916 under the Income Tax Law of the state of Oklahoma (Laws 1915, c. 107) on the ground of the unconstitutionality of the statute.\n A previous suit having the same object was brought by him in the same court against the officials then in office, in which an application for an interlocutory injunction heard before three judges pursuant to section 266, Judicial Code, was denied; one Judge dissenting. Shaffer v. Howard (D. C.) 250 Fed. 873. An appeal was taken to this court, but, pending its determination, the terms of office of the defendants expired, and, there being no law of the- \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 44]\n\u00a0\n state authorizing a revival or continuance of the action against their successors, we reversed the decree and remanded the cause, with directions to dismiss the bill for want of proper parties. \n249 U.S. 200\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 255.\n After such dismissal the present defendant Carter, as state auditor, issued another tax warrant and delivered it to defendant Bruce, sheriff of Creek county, with instructions to levy upon and sell plaintiff's property in that county in order to collect the tax in question; and the sheriff having threatened to proceed, this suit was commenced. An application for an interlocutory injunction, heard before three judges, was denied upon the authority of the decision in 250 Fed. and of certain recent decisions of this court. The decree as entered not only disposed of the application but dismissed the action. Plaintiff, apparently unaware of this, appealed to this court under section 266, Judicial Code, from the refusal of the temporary injunction. Shortly afterwards he took an appeal under section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215) from the same decree as a final decree dismissing the action. The latter appeal is in accord with correct practice, since the denial of the interlocutory application was merged in the final decree. The first appeal (No. 531) will be dismissed.\n The Constitution of Oklahoma, besides providing for the annual taxation of all property in the state upon an ad valorem basis, authorizes ( article 10,  12) the employment of a variety of other means for raising revenue, among them income taxes.\n The act in question is chapter 164 of the Laws of 1915. Its first section reads as follows:\n'Each and every person in this state, shall be liable to an annual tax upon the entire net income of such person arising or accruing from all sources during the preceding calendar year, and a like tax shall be levied, assessed, collected and paid annually upon the entire net income from all property owned, and of every business, trade or profession carried on in this \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 45]\n\u00a0\n state by persons residing elsewhere.'\n\n Subsequent sections define what the term 'income' shall include; prescribe how net income shall be computed; provide for certain deductions; prescribe varying rates of tax for all taxable incomes in excess of $3,000, this amount being deducted (by way of exemption) from the income of each individual, and for one living with spouse an additional $1,000, with further deductions where there are children or dependents, exemptions being the same for residents and nonresidents; require (section 2) a return on or before March 1st from each person liable for an income tax under the provisions of the act for the preceding calendar year; provide ( section 9) that the state auditor shall revise returns and hear and determine complaints, with power to correct and adjust the assessment of income; that (section 10) taxes shall become delinquent if not paid on or before the 1st day of July, and the state auditor shall have power to issue to any sheriff of the state a warrant commanding him to levy the amount upon the personal property of the delinquent party; and (by section 11):\n'If any of the taxes herein levied become delinquent, they shall become a lien on all the property, personal and real, of the delinquent person, and shall be subject to the same penalties and provisions are are all ad valorem taxes.'\n\n Plaintiff, a nonresident of Oklahoma, being a citizen of Illinois and a resident of Chicago, in that state, was at the time of the commencement of the suit and for several years theretofore (including the years 1915 and 1916) engaged in the oil business in Oklahoma, having purchased, owned, developen and operated a number of oil and gas mining leases, and being the owner in fee of certain oil-producing land, in that state. From properties thus owned and operated during the year 1916 he received a net income exceeding $1,500,000, and of this he made, under protest, a return which showed that, \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 46]\n\u00a0\n at the rates fixed by the act, there was due to the state an income tax in excess of $76,000. The then state auditor overruled the protest and assessed a tax in accordance with the return; the present auditor has put it in due course of collection; and plaintiff resists its enforcement upon the ground that the act, in so far as it subjects the incomes of nonresidents to the payment of such a tax, takes their property without due process of law and denies to them the equal protection of the laws, in contravention of section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment, burdens interstate commerce, in contravention of the commerce clause of section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution, and discriminates against nonresidents in favor of residents, and thus deprives plaintiff and other nonresidents of the privileges and immunities of citizens and residents of the state of Oklahoma, in violation of section 2 of article 4. He also insists that the lien attempted to be imposed upon his property pursuant to section 11 for taxes assessed upon income not arising out of the same property would deprive him of property without due process of law.\n As ground for resorting to equity, the bill alleges that plaintiff is the owner of various oil and gas mining leases covering lands in Creek county, Okl., and that the lien asserted thereon by virtue of the levy and tax warrant creates a cloud upon his title. This entitles him to bring suit in equity (Union Pacific Ry. Co. v. Cheyenne, \n113 \nU.S. 516, 525\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 601; Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, \n142 \nU.S. 339, 348\n, 12 S. Sup.

Cas. 1917E, 88), unless the contention that he has a plain, adequate, and complete remedy at law be well founded.\n This contention is based, first, upon the provision of section 9 of chapter 164, giving to the state auditor the same power to correct and adjust an assessment of income that is given to the county board of equalization in cases of ad \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 47]\n\u00a0\n valorem assessments, taken in connection with chapter 107 of the Laws of 1915, which provides (article 1, subd. B,  2) for an appeal from that board to the district court of the county. In a recent decision (Berryhill v. Carter, 185 Pac. 93), the Supreme Court of the state held that an aggrieved income taxpayer may have an appeal under this section, and that thus 'all matters complained of may be reviewed and adjusted to the extent that justice may demand.' But the case related to 'correcting and adjusting an income tax reture,' and the decision merely established the appeal to the district court as the appropriate remedy, rather than an application to the Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari. It falls short of indicating-to say nothing of plainly showing-that this procedure would afford an adequate remedy to a party contending that the income tax law itself was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.\n Secondly, reference is made to section 7 of subdivision B, art. 1, c. 107, Laws Okl. 1915, wherein it is provided that where illegality of a tax is alleged to arise by reason of some action from which the laws provide no appeal, the aggrieved person on paying the tax may give notice to the officer collecting it, stating the grounds of complaint and that suit will be brought against him; whereupon it is made the duty of such officer to hold the tax until the final determination of such suit if brought within 30 days, and if it be determined that the tax was illegally collected, the officer is to repay the amount found to be in excess of the legal and correct amount. But this section is one of several that have particular reference to the procedure for collecting ad valorem taxes; and they are prefaced by this statement (page 176):\n'Subdivision B. To the existing provisions of law relating to the ad valorem or direct system of taxation the following provisions are added.'\n\n Upon this ground, in Gipsy \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 48]\n\u00a0\n Oil Co. v. Howard and companion suits brought by certain oil-producing companies to restrain enforcement of taxes authorized by the gross production tax law (Sess. Laws 1916, p. 102), upon the ground that they were an unlawful imposition upon federal instrumentalities, the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma held that the legal remedy provided in section 7 of chapter 107 applied only to ad valorem taxes, and did not constitute a bar to equitable relief against the production taxes. Defendants appealed to this court, and assigned this ruling for error, inter alia; but they did not press the point, and the decrees were affirmed upon the merits of the federal question. Howard v. Gipsy Oil Co., \n247 U.S. 503\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 426\n\n\n We deem it unnecessary to pursue further the question whether either of the statutory provisions referred to furnishes an adequate legal remedy against income taxes assessed under an unconstitutional law, since one of the grounds of complaint in the present case is that, even if the tax itself be valid, the procedure prescribed by section 11 of the Income Tax Law for enforcing such a tax by imposing a lien upon the taxpayer's entire property, as threatened to be put into effect against plaintiff's property for taxes not assessed against the property itself and not confined to the income that proceeded from the same property, is not 'due process of law,' within the requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. For removal of a cloud upon title caused by an invalid lien imposed for a tax valid in itself, there appears to be no legal remedy. Hence, on this ground at least, resort was properly had to equity for relief; and since a court of equity does not 'do justice by halves,' and will prevent, if possible, a multiplicity of suits, the jurisdiction extends to the disposition of all questions raised by the bill. Camp v. Boyd, \n229 \nU.S. 530, 551\n, 552 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 785; McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 296\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 543. \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 49]\n\u00a0\n This brings us to the merits.\n Under the 'due process of law' provision appellant makes two contentions: First, that the state is without jurisdiction to levy a tax upon the income of nonresidents; and, secondly, that the lien is invalid because imposed upon all his property real and personal, without regard to its relation to the production of his income.\n These are separate questions, and will be so treated. The tax might be valid, although the measures adopted for enforcing it were not. Governmental jurisdiction in matters of taxation, as in the exercise of the judicial function, depends upon the power to enforce the mandate of the state by action taken within its borders, either in personam or in rem according to the circumstances of the case, as by arrest of the person, seizure of goods or lands, garnishment of credits, sequestration of rents and profits, forfeiture of franchise, or the like; and the jurisdiction to act remains even though all permissible measures be not resorted to. Michigan Trust Co. v. Ferry, \n228 \nU.S. 346, 353\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 550; Ex parte Indiana Transportation Co., \n244 \nU.S. 456, 457\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 717.\n It will be convenient to postpone the question of the lien until all questions as to the validity of the tax have been disposed of.\n The contention that a state is without jurisdiction to impose a tax upon the income of nonresidents, while raised in the present case, was more emphasized in Travis, Comptroller, v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., \n252 U.S. 60\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 228, 64 L. Ed. --, decided this day, involving the Income Tax Law of the state of New York (Laws 1919, c. 627). There it was contended, in substance, that while a state may tax the property of a nonresident situate within its borders, or may tax the incomes of its own citizens and residents because of the privileges they enjoy under its Constitution and laws and the protection they receive from the state, yet a nonresident although conducting a business or carrying on an occupation there, cannot \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 50]\n\u00a0\n be required through income taxation to contribute to the governmental expenses of the state whence his income is derived; that an income tax, as against nonresidents, is not only not a property tax, but is not an excise or privilege tax, since no privilege is granted; the right of the noncitizen to carry on his business or occupation in the taxing state being derived, it is said, from the provisions of the federal Constitution.\n This radical contention is easily answered by reference to fundamental principles. In our system of government the states have general dominion, and, saving as restricted by particular provisions of the federal Constitution, complete dominion over all persons, property, and business transaction within their borders; they assume and perform the duty of preserving and protecting all such persons, property, and business, and, in consequence, have the power normally pertaining to governments to resort to all reasonable forms of taxation in order to defray the governmental expenses. Certainly they are not restricted to property taxation, nor to any particular form of excises. In well-ordered society property has value chiefly for what it is capable of producing, and the activities of mankind are devoted largely to making recurrent gains from the use and development of property, from tillage, mining, manufacture, from the employment of human skill and labor, or from a combination of some of these; gains capable of being devoted to their own support, and the surplus accumulated as an increase of capital. That the state, from whose laws property and business and industry derive the protection and security without which production and gainful occupation would be impossible, is debarred from exacting a share of those gains in the form of income taxes for the support of the government, is a proposition so wholly inconsistent with fundamental principles as to be refuted by its mere statement. That it may tax the land but not the crop, the tree but not the \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 51]\n\u00a0\n fruit, the mine or well but not the product, the business but not the profit derived from it, is wholly inadmissible.\n Income taxes are a recognized method of distributing the burdens of government, favored because requiring contributions from those who realize current pecuniary benefits under the protection of the government, and because the tax may be readily proportioned to their ability to pay. Taxes of this character were imposed by several of the states at or shortly after the adoption of the federal Constitution. Laws N. Y. 1778, c. 17; Report of Oliver Wolcott, Jr., Secretary of the Treasury, to 4th Cong. 2d Sess. (1796), concerning Direct Taxes; American State Papers, 1 Finance, 423, 427, 429, 437, 439.\n The rights of the several states to exercise the widest liberty with respect to the imposition of internal taxes always has been recognized in the decisions of this court. In McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, while denying their power to impose a tax upon any of the operations of the federal government, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall, speaking for the court, conceded (4 Wheat. 428, 429) that the states have full power to tax their own people and their own property, and also that the power is not confined to the people and property of a state, but may be exercised upon every object brought within its jurisdiction, saying:\n'It is obvious, that it is an incident of sovereignty, and is coextensive with that to which it is an incident. All subjects over which the sovereign power of a state extends, are objects of taxation,' etc.\n\n In Michigan Central Railroad v. Powers, \n201 \nU.S. 245, 292\n, 293 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 459, 462 (50 L. Ed. 744), the court, by Mr. Justice Brewer, said:\n'We have had frequent occasion to consider questions of state taxation in the light of the federal Constitution, and the scope and limits of national interference are well settled. There is no general supervision on the part of the nation over state taxation, and in respect to the latter the state has, speaking generally, the freedom of a sovereign both as to objects \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 52]\n\u00a0\n and methods.'\n\n That a state may tax callings and occupations as well as persons and property has long been recognized.\n'The power of taxation, however vast in its character and searching in its extent, is necessarily limited to subjects within the jurisdiction of the state. These subjects are persons, property, and business. ... It [taxation] may touch business in the almost infinite forms in which it is conducted, in professions, in commerce, in manufactures, and in transportation. Unless restrained by provisions of the federal Constitution, the power of the state as to the mode, form, and extent of taxation is unlimited, where the subjects to which it applies are within her jurisdiction.' State Tax on Foreign-Held Bonds, 15 Wall. 300, 319, (21 L. Ed. 179).\n\n See, also, Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, 278; Armour & Co. v. Virginia, \n246 \nU.S. 1, 6\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 267; American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459, 463\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 522.\n And we beem it clear, upon principle as well as authority, that just as a state may impose general income taxes upon its own citizens and residents whose persons are subject to its control, it may, as a necessary consequence, levy a duty of like character, and not more onerous in its effect, upon incomes accruing to nonresidents from their property or business within the state, or their occupations carried on therein, enforcing payment, so far as it can, by the exercise of a just control over persons and property within its borders. This is consonant with numerous decisions of this court sustaining state taxation of credits due to nonresidents (New Orleans v. Stempel, \n175 U.S. 309\n, 320, et seq., 20 Sup. Ct. 110; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133, 145\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 585; Liverpool, etc., Ins. Co. v. Orleans Assessors, \n221 \nU.S. 346, 354\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 550, L. R. A. 1915C, 903), and sustaining federal taxation of the income of an alien nonresident derived from securities held in this country (De Ganay v. Lederer, \n250 U.S. 376\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 524).\n That a state, consistently with the federal Constitution, may not prohibit the citizens of other states from carrying on legitimate business within its borders like its own \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 53]\n\u00a0\n citizens, of course is granted; but it does not follow that the business of nonresidents may not be required to make a ratable contribution in taxes for the support of the government. On the contrary, the very fact that a citizen of one state has the right to hold property or carry on an occupation or business in another is a very reasonable ground for subjecting such nonresident, although not personally, yet to the extent of his property held, or his occupation or business carried on therein, to a duty to pay taxes not more onerous in effect than those imposed under like circumstances upon citizens of the latter state. Section 2 of article 4 of the Constitution entitles him to the privilege and immunities of a citizen, but no more; not to an entire immunity from taxation, nor to any preferential treatment as compared with resident citizens. It protects him against discriminatory taxation, but gives him no right to be favored by discrimination or exemption. See Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430.\n Oklahoma has assumed no power to tax nonresidents with respect to income derived from property or business beyond the borders of the state. The first section of the act, while imposing a tax upon inhabitants with respect to their entire net income arising from all sources, confines the tax upon nonresidents to their net income from property owned and business, etc., carried on within the state. A similar distinction has been observed in our federal income tax laws from one of the earliest down to the present. \n1\n The acts of 1861 (12 Stat. 309) and 1864 (13 Stat. \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 54]\n\u00a0\n 281, 417) confined the tax to persons residing in the United States and citizens residing abroad. But in 1866 (14 Stat. 137, 138) there was inserted by amendment the following:\n'And a like tax shall be levied, collected, and paid annually upon the gains, profits, and income of every business, trade, or profession carried on in the United States by persons residing without the United States, not citizens thereof.'\n\n Similar provisions were embodied in the acts of 1870 (16 Stat. 257) and 1894 (28 Stat. 553); and in the act of 1913 (38 Stat. 166), after a clause imposing a tax upon the entire net income arising or accruing from all sources (with exceptions not material here) to every citizen of the United States, whether residing at home or abroad, and to every person residing in the United States though not a citizen thereof, the following appears:\n'And a like tax shall be assessed, levied, collected, and paid annually upon the entire net income from all property owned and of every business, trade, or profession carried on in the United States by persons residing elsewhere.'\n\n Evidently this furnished the model for section 1 of the Oklahoma statute.\n No doubt is suggested (the former requirement of apportionment having been removed by constitutional amendment) as to the power of Congress thus to impose taxes upon incomes produced within the borders of the United States or arising from sources located therein, even though the income accrues to a nonresident alien. And, so far as the question of jurisdiction is concerned, the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes no greater restriction in this regard upon the several states than the corresponding clause of the Fifth Amendment imposes upon the United States.\n It is insisted, however, both by appellant in this case and by the opponents of the New York law in Travis, Comptroller, v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., that an income tax is in its nature a personal tax, or a 'subjective tax imposing personal liability upon the recipient of the income,' and that as to a \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 55]\n\u00a0\n nonresident the state has no jurisdiction to impose such a liability. This argument, upon analysis, resolves itself into a mere question of definitions, and has no legitimate bearing upon any question raised under the federal Constitution. For, where the question is whether a state taxing law contravenes rights secured by that instrument, the decision must depend not upon any mere question of form, construction, or definition, but upon the practical operation and effect of the tax imposed. St. Louis S. W. Ry. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 362\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219, 237\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 126; American Mfg. Co. v. St. Louis, \n250 \nU.S. 459, 463\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 522. The practical burden of a tax imposed upon the net income derived by a nonresident from a business carried on within the state certainly is no greater than that of a tax upon the conduct of the business, and this the state has the lawful power to impose, as we have seen.\n The fact that it required the personal skill and management of appellant to bring his income from producing property in Oklahoma to fruition, and that his management was exerted from his place of business in another state, did not deprive Oklahoma of jurisdiction to tax the income which arose within its own borders. The personal element cannot, by any fiction, oust the jurisdiction of the state within which the income actually arises and whose authority over it operates in rem. At most, there might be a question whether the value of the service of management rendered from without the state ought not to be allowed as an expense incurred in producing the income; but no such question is raised in the present case, hence we express no opinion upon it.\n The contention that the act deprives appellant and others similarly circumstanced of the privileges and immunities enjoyed by residents and citizens of the state of Oklahoma, in violation of section 2 of article 4 of the Constitution, \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 56]\n\u00a0\n is based upon two grounds, which are relied upon as showing also a violation of the 'equal protection' clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n One of the rights intended to be secured by the former provision is that a citizen of one state may remove to and carry on business in another without being subjected in property or person to taxes more onerous than the citizens of the latter state are subjected to. Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180; Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 537\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 2. The judge who dissented in Shaffer v. Howard (D. C.) 250 Fed. 873, 883, concluded that the Oklahoma Income Tax Law offended in this regard, upon the ground (page 888) that since the tax is as to citizens of Oklahoma a purely personal tax measured by their incomes, while as applied to a nonresident it is 'essentially a tax upon his property and business within the state, to which the property and business of citizens and residents of the state are not subjected,' there was a discrimination against the nonresident. We are unable to accept this reasoning. It errs in paying too much regard to theoretical distinctions and too little to the practical effect and operation of the respective taxes as levied; in failing to observe that in effect citizens and residents of the state are subjected at least to the same burden as nonresidents, and perhaps to a greater, since the tax imposed upon the former includes all income derived from their property and business within the state and, in addition, any income they may derive from outside sources.\n Appellant contends that there is a denial to noncitizens of the privileges and immunities to which they are entitled, and also a denial of the equal protection of the laws, in that the act permits residents to deduct from their gross income not only losses incurred within the state of Oklahoma but also those sustained outside of that state, while nonresidents may deduct only those incurred within the \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 57]\n\u00a0\n state. The difference, however, is only such as arises naturally from the extent of the jurisdiction of the state in the two classes of cases, and cannot be regarded as an unfriendly or unreasonable discrimination. As to residents it may, and does, exert its taxing power over their income from all sources, whether within or without the state, and it accords to them a corresponding privilege of deducting their losses, wherever these accrue. As to nonresidents, the jurisdiction extends only to their property owned within the state and their business, trade, or profession carried on therein, and the tax is only on such income as is derived from those sources. Hence there is no obligation to accord to them a deduction by reason of losses elsewhere incurred. It may be remarked, in passing, that there is no showing that appellant has sustained such losses, and so he is not entitled to raise this question.\n It is urged that, regarding the tax as imposed upon the business conducted within the state, it amounts in the case of appellant's business to a burden upon interstate commerce, because the products of his oil operations are shipped out of the state. Assuming that it fairly appears that his method of business constitutes interstate commerce, it is sufficient to say that the tax is imposed not upon the gross receipts, as in Crew Levick Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n245 U.S. 292\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 126; but only upon the net proceeds, and is plainly sustainable, even if it includes net gains from interstate commerce. U. S. Glue C. v. Oak Creek, \n247 U.S. 321\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748. Compare Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 165\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 432.\n Reference is made to the gross production tax law of 1915 (chapter 107, art. 2, subd. A,  1, Sess. Laws 1915, p. 151), as amended by chapter 39 of Sess. Laws 1916 (page 106), under which every person or corporation engaged in producing oil or natural gas within the state is required to pay a tax equal to 3 per centum of the gross value of such product in lieu of all taxes imposed by the state, counties, or municipalities upon the land or the leases, mining rights, \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 58]\n\u00a0\n and privileges, and the machinery, appliances, and equipment, pertaining to such production. It is contended that payment of the gross production tax relieves the producer from the payment of the income tax. This is a question of state law, upon which no controlling decision by the Supreme Court of the state is cited. We overrule the contention, deeming it clear, as a matter of construction, that the gross production tax was intended as a substitute for the ad valorem property tax but not for the income tax, and that there is no such repugnance between it and the income tax as to produce a repeal by implication. Nor, even if the effect of this is akin to double taxation, can it be regarded as obnoxious to the federal Constitution for that reason, since it is settled that nothing in that instrument or in the Fourteenth Amendment prevents the states from imposing double taxation, or any other form of unequal taxation, so long as the inequality is not based up on arbitrary distinctions. St. Louis S. W. Railway v. Arkansas, \n235 U.S. 350\n, 367-368, 35 Sup. Ct. 99.\n The contention that there is a want of due process in the proceedings for enforcement of the tax, especially in the lien imposed by section 11 upon all of the delinquent's property, real and personal, reduces itself to this: that the state is without power to create a lien upon any property of a nonresident for income taxes except the very property from which the income proceeded; or, putting it in another way, that a lien for an income tax may not be imposed upon a nonresident's unproductive property, nor upon any particular productive property beyond the amount of the tax upon the income that has proceeded from it.\n But the facts of the case do not raise this question. It clearly appears from the averments of the bill that the whole of plaintiff's property in the state of Oklahoma consists of oil-producing land, oil and gas mining leaseholds, and other property used in the production of oil and gas; and that, beginning at least as early as the year 1915, \n\n[252 U.S. 37, 59]\n\u00a0\n when the act was passed, and continuing without interruption until the time of the commencement of the suit (April 16, 1919), he was engaged in the business of developing and operating these properties for the production of oil, his entire business in that and other states was managed as one business, and his entire net income in the state for the year 1916 was derived from that business. Laying aside the probability that from time to time there may have been changes arising from purchases, new leases, sales, and expirations (none of which, however, is set forth in the bill), it is evident that the lien will rest upon the same property interests which were the source of the income upon which the tax was imposed. The entire jurisdiction of the state over appellant's property and business and the income that he derived from them-the only jurisdiction that it has sought to assert-is a jurisdiction in rem; and we are clear that the state acted within its lawful power in treating his property interests and business as having both unity and continuity. Its purpose to impose income taxes was declared in its own Constitution, and the precise nature of the tax and the measures to be taken for enforcing it were plainly set forth in the act of 1915; and plaintiff having thereafter proceeded, with notice of this law, to manage the property and conduct the business out of which proceeded the income now taxed, the state did not exceed its power or authority in treating his property interests and his business as a single entity, and enforcing payment of the tax by the imposition of a lien, to be followed by execution or other appropriate process, upon all property employed in the business. \n No. 531\n: Appeal dismissed.\n No. 580: Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Acts of August 5, 1861 (chapter 45,  49, 12 Stat. 292, 309); June 30, 1864 (chapter 173,  116, 13 Stat. 223, 281); July 4, 1864 (Joint Res. 77, 13 Stat. 417); July 13, 1866 (chapter 184,  9, 14 Stat. 98, 137, 138); March 2, 1867 (chapter 169,  13, 14 Stat. 471, 477, 478); July 14, 1870 ( chapter 255,  6, 16 Stat. 256, 257); August 27, 1894 (chapter 349,  27, 28 Stat. 509, 553); October 3, 1913 (chapter 16,  II, A. subd. 1, 38 Stat. 114, 166); September 8, 1916 (chapter 463, title I, part.

Guthrie, of New York City, for plaintiffs in error.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Stewart, for the United States.[ Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. U S \n251 U.S. 385\n (1920) ]\n\n\n[251 U.S. 385, 390]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a writ of error brought to reverse a judgment of the District Court fining the Silverthorne Lumber Company two hundred and fifty dollars for contempt of court and ordering Frederick W. Silverthorne to be imprisoned until he should purge himself of a similar contempt. The contempt in question was a refusal to obey subpoenas and an order of Court to produce books and documents of the company before the grand jury to be used in regard to alleged violation of the statutes of the United States by the said Silverthorne and his father. One ground of the refusal was that the order of the Court infringed the rights of the parties under the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n The facts are simple. An indictment upon a single specific charge having been brought against the two Silverthornes mentioned, they both were arrested at their homes early in the morning of February 25, and were detained in custody a number of hours. While they were thus detained representatives of the Department of Justice and the United States marshal without a shadow of authority went to the office of their company and made a clean sweep of all the books, papers and documents found there. All the employes were taken or directed to go to the office of the District Attorney of the United States to which also the books, &c., were taken at once. An application was made as soon as might be to the District \n\n[251 U.S. 385, 391]\n\u00a0\n Court for a return of what thus had been taken unlawfully. It was opposed by the District Attorney so far as he had found evidence against the plaintiffs in error, and it was stated that the evidence so obtained was before the grand jury. Color had been given by the District Attorney to the approach of those concerned in the act by an invalid subpoena for certain documents relating to the charge in the indictment then on file. Thus the case is not that of knowledge acquired through the wrongful act of a stranger, but it must be assumed that the Government planned or at all events ratified the whole performance. Photographs and copies of material papers were made and a new indictment was framed based upon the knowledge thus obtained. The District Court ordered a return of the originals but impounded the photographs and copies. Subpoenas to produce the originals then were served and on the refusal of the plaintiffs in error to produce them the Court made an order that the subpoenas should be complied with, although it had found that all the papers had been seized in violation of the parties' constitutional rights. The refusal to obey this order is the contempt alleged. The Government now, while in form repudiating and condemning the illegal seizure, seeks to maintain its right to avail itself of the knowledge obtained by that means which otherwise it would not have had.\n The proposition could not be presented more nakedly. It is that although of course its seizure was an outrage which the Government now regrets, it may study the papers before it returns them, copy them, and then may use the knowledge that it has gained to call upon the owners in a more regular form to produce them; that the protection of the Constitution covers the physical possession but not any advantages that the Government can gain over the object of its pursuit by doing the forbidden act. Weeks v. United States, \n232 U.S. 383\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177, to be sure, had established that laying the papers directly before the grand jury was \n\n[251 U.S. 385, 392]\n\u00a0\n unwarranted, but it is taken to mean only that two steps are required instead of one. In our opinion such is not the law. It reduces the Fourth Amendment to a form of words. \n232 U.S. 393\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177. The essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the Court but that it shall not be used at all. Of course this does not mean that the facts thus obtained become sacred and inaccessible. If knowledge of them is gained from an independent source they may be proved like any others, but the knowledge gained by the Government's own wrong cannot be used by it in the way proposed. The numberous decisions, like Adams v. New York, \n192 U.S. 585\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 372, holding that a collateral inquiry into the mode in which evidence has been got will not be allowed when the question is raised for the first time at the trial, are no authority in the present proceeding, as is explained in Weeks v. United States, \n232 \nU.S. 383, 394\n, 395 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 341, L. R. A. 1915B, 834, Ann. Cas. 1915C, 1177. Whether some of those decisions have gone too far or have given wrong reasons it is unnecessary to inquire; the principle applicable to the present case seems to us plain. It is stated satisfactorily in Flagg v. United States, 233 Fed. 481, 483, 147 C. C. A. 367. In Linn v. United States, 251 Fed. 476, 480, 163 C. C. A. 470, it was thought that a different rule applied to a corporation, on the ground that it was not privileged from producing its books and papers. But the rights of a corporation against unlawful search and seizure are to be protected even if the same result might have been achieved in a lawful way.\n Judgment reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice PITNEY dissent. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSIMPSON v. U S(1920)\nNo. 213\nArgued: Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 547, 548]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas M. Day, of New York City, for appellants.\n Mr. Solicitor General King, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to recover the whole, or, failing that, a large part of a succession tax assessed under the Spanish War Revenue Act of June 13, 1898 (30 Stat. 448), and paid by the appellants, as executors of the will of Jh n G. Moore, deceased, a citizen of New York, who died in June, 1899. \n\n[252 U.S. 547, 549]\n\u00a0\n The assessment was made against the appellants as persons having in charge or trust, as executors, legacies arising from personal property, and the contention is that right to recovery may be derived either from the Act of Congress approved July 27, 1912 (37 Stat. 240), directing the Secretary of the Treasury to refund the amount of any claims which should be satisfactorily shown to have been 'erroneously or illegally' assessed under warrant of section 29 of the War Revenue Act, or from the Act approved June 27, 1902 (32 Stat. 406), which directs the Secretary of the Treasury to refund to executors so much of any tax as may have been collected under warrant of that act 'on contingent beneficial interests which shall not have been vested prior to July 1, 1902.'\n The decedent in his will directed his executors to convert a large residuary estate into money, to divide the same into three equal shares, and to transfer two of such shares to a trustee, to be selected by them, in trust to invest and reinvest and to pay to each of his two daughters the whole of the net income of one share so long as she should live.\n Pursuant to authority derived from section 31 of the War Revenue Act and R. S.  321 and 3182 (Comp. St.  492, 5904), the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, in order to provide for the determination of the amount of taxes to be assessed on legacies such as are here involved, on December 16, 1898, issued instructions to collectors of internal revenue throughout the country, which contained tables showing the present worth of life interests in personal property, with directions for computing the tax upon the same. These tables were based on 'Actuaries\" or 'Combined Experience Tables,' and were used in arriving at the amounts paid in this case.\n On June 30, 1899, letters testamentary were issued to appellants as executors, and on April 1, 1901, the United States Commissioner of Internal Revenue, pursuant to the provisions of section 26 of the Spanish War Revenue Act, assessed \n\n[252 U.S. 547, 550]\n\u00a0\n a tax of about $12,000 on the share of each daughter, which was paid on April 15, 1901\n\n\n On October 29, 1907, appellants presented to the government their claim, which was rejected, for the refund of $21,640.55 of the taxes so paid, 'or such greater amount thereof as the Commissioner might find refundable under the Refunding Act of June 27, 1902, or other remedial statutes.'\n The judgment of the Court of Claims, dismissing the amended petition as to the claims for refund of the tax paid on the legacies of the two daughters, and on three small legacies which will follow the disposition of these, and need no further notice, is before us for review.\n Of the two claims of error argued, the first is that the Court of Claims erred in refusing to hold that it was illegal to use mortuary tables and to assume 4 per cent. as the value of money in computing the tax that was paid, and that, therefore, the whole amount of it should be refunded.\n The objection is not to the particular table that was used but to the use of any such table at all-to the method. Such tables, indeed the precise table which was made the basis of the one used by the collector, had been resorted to for many years prior to 1889 by courts, Legislatures, and insurance companies for the purpose of determining the present value of future contingent interests in property, and we take judicial notice of the fact that at the time this tax was collected 4 per cent. was very generally assumed to be the fair value or earning power of money safely invested. Both the method and the rate adopted in this case have been assumed by this court, without discussion, as proper in computing the amount of taxes to be collected under this War Revenue Act in Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 44\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 747, United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., \n222 U.S. 158\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 59, Rand et al. v. United States, \n249 U.S. 503\n,5 06, 39 Sup. Ct. 359, and in Henry, Executor, v. United States, \n251 U.S. 393\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 185, 64 L. Ed. --, decided at this term. It is much too late to successfully assail a method so generally applied, \n\n[252 U.S. 547, 551]\n\u00a0\n and as to this claim of error the judgment of the Court of Claims is affirmed.\n The facts following are essential to the disposition of the remaining question. The appellant executors appointed a trust company trustee for the two daughters of decedent and prior to July 1, 1902, they paid to it, in trust for each of them the sum of $426,086.08. After making these payments the executors had in their custody in cash and securities in excess of $1,797,000, from which, prior to March 16, 1906, they made further payments, amounting approximately to $500,000 to the trust fund for each of the daughters, thereby making each of them exceed $926,000. The assessment of each was $665,000 in April, 1901.\n The contention is that the excess of the assessment above the amount which had been actually paid to the trustee prior to July 1, 1902, had not become vested prior to that date, within the meaning of the Act of June 27, 1902 (32 Stat. 406,  3), and that it should therefore be refunded.\n The law of New York, in force when the estate was in process of administration, provided (New York Code of Civil Procedure, 1899,  2721) that 'after the expiration of one year [from the time of granting letters testamentary] the executors ... must discharge all specific legacies bequeathed by the will and pay general legacies, if there be assets,' and section 2722 gave to legatees the right to pertition in an appropriate court to compel payment of their legacies after the expiration of such year.\n Letters testamentary were granted to the appellants on June 30, 1899, and we have seen that assets abundantly sufficient to have increased the trust fund legacies of the daughters much beyond the amount at which they were assessed for taxation were in the custody of the executors prior to July 1, 1902, and therefore under this law of New York it was their duty to have made such payments prior to that date unless cause was shown for not so doing. \n\n[252 U.S. 547, 552]\n\u00a0\n The state law also authorized (section 2718) the executors to publish a notice once in each week for six months, requiring all creditors to present their claims against the estate, and provided that in suits brought on any claim not presented within six months from the first publication of such notice, the executors should not be chargeable for any assets which they may have paid out in satisfaction of legacies.\n The appellants first published the notice to creditors on April 25, 1900, and therefore they might safely have made payment on the daughters' legacies after the 1st of November, 1900, one year and eight months prior to July 1, 1902, unless cause to the contrary was shown.\n The only excuse given in the record for not complying with this state law is that in March, 1902, a stockholders' suit was commenced against the partnership of Moore & Schley, of which the deceased was a member, in which an accounting was sought for a large amount of promotion profits in connection with the organization of the American Malt Company. As to this the Court of Claims finds that the evidence does not show the pleadings, issues or the character of the suit, or the amount or merit of the claim, or the result of the litigation. Obviously, such a showing of such a suit cannot be considered to have been a genuine obstacle to settlement of the estate, and the other claims against it were negligible in comparison with the available assets.\n It is thus apparent that for many months prior to July 1, 1902, there were abundant assets with which to make payments upon these two legacies, in an amount larger than was necessary to make them equal to, and greater than that for which they were assessed for taxation; that for many months before that date it was the legal duty of the executors to make such payment; and that for a like tie the legatees had a statutory right to institute suit to compel payment.\n It is obvious that legacies which it was thus the legal \n\n[252 U.S. 547, 553]\n\u00a0\n duty of the executors to pay before July 1, 1902, and for compelling payment of which statutory remedy was given to the legatees before that date, were vested in possession and enjoyment, within the meaning of the Act of June 27, 1902, as it was interpreted in United States v. Fidelity Trust Co., \n222 U.S. 158\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 59, McCoach v. Pratt, \n236 \nU.S. 562, 567\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 421, and in Henry, Ex'r, v. United States, decided February 2, 1920. The case would be one for an increased assessment, rather than for a refund, if the War Revenue Act had not been repealed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS did not participate in the discussion or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","141":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTH COAST S S CO. v.

Hasket Derby, of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel against the Steamer South Coast, belonging to the claimant, a California corporation, and registered in San Francisco, for necessary supplies furnished in San Pedro, California. The answer denies the authority of the master to bind the steamer. The bare vessel at the time was under charter to one Levick, the contract stipulating that Levick was to pay all charges and to save the owner harmless from all liens or expenses that it might be put to in consequence of such liens. There was also a provision that the owner might retake the vessel in case of failure of Levick to discharge within thirty days any debts which were liens upon it, and another for surrender of the vessel free of all liens upon Levick's failure to make certain payments. When the supplies were ordered representatives of the owner in San Pedro warned the libelant that the steamer was under charter and that he must not furnish the supplies on the credit of the vessel. He replied that he would not furnish them in any other way, but the reply does not affect the case because by the terms of the charter the master who ordered them, although appointed by the owner, was under the orders of Levick. It is agreed by both courts below that if the owner had power to prevent the attaching of a lien by its warning it had done so. Both courts however held that the charter gave the master power to create the lien. 233 Fed. 327; 247 Fed. 84, 159 C. C. A. 302. \n\n[251 U.S. 519, 523]\n\u00a0\n By the Act of June 23, 1910, c. 373,  1, 36 Stat. 604 (Comp. St.  7783), a maritime lien is given for such supplies and by section 3 (Comp. St.  7785) a presumption is declared that a master appointed by a charterer has authority from the owner to procure them. It is true that the act goes on that nothing in it shall be considered to give a lien where the furnisher knew, or by the exercise of reasonable diligence could have ascertained, that because of the terms of a charter party, or for any other reason, the person ordering the necessaries was without authority to bind the vessel. But the authority of the owner to prohibit or to speak was displaced, so far as the charter went, by that conferred upon the charterers, who became owners prohac vice, and therefore, unless the charter excluded the master's power, the owner could not forbid its use. The charter party recognizes that liens may be imposed by the charterers and allowed to stand for less than a month and there seems to be no sufficient reason for supposing the words not to refer to all the ordinary maritime liens recognized by the law. The statute had given a lien for supplies in a domestic port and therefore had made that one of these ordinary liens. Therefore the charterer was assumed to have power to authorize the master to impose a lien in a domestic port, and if the assumption expressed in words was not equivalent to a grant of power, at least it cannot be taken to have excluded it. There was nothing from which the furnisher could have ascertained that the master did not have power to bind the ship.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, Mr. Justice PITNEY, and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","142":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTH COVINGTON & C ST RY.

Stephens L. Blakely, of Covington, Ky., and Charles Harwood Morris, of Frankfort, Ky., for the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Railway Company was indicted for a violation of a statute of Kentucky which required companies or persons running or operating railroads in the state, to furnish separate coacher or cars for white and colored passengers.\n The statute (Ky. St.  795), as far as we are concerned with it, is as follows:\n All corporations, companies or persons 'engaged in running or operating railroads, of this state, either in part or whole, either in their own name or that of others, are hereby required to furnish separate coaches or cars for the travel or transportation of the white and colored passengers on their respective lines of railroad. Each compartment of a coach divided by a good and substantial wooden partition, with a door therein, shall be deemed a separate coach within the meaning of this act, and each separate coach or compartment shall bear in some conspicuous place appropriate words in plain letters indicating the race for which it is set apart.' \n\n[252 U.S. 399, 401]\n\u00a0\n It is also provided that there shall be no difference or discrimination in the quality of the coaches or cars. A violation of the act is made a misdemeanor.\n Interurban electric railroads are subject to the above provisions. We may say in passing that the railway company denies that it is interurban, but admits that the fact has been decided against it and accepts the ruling. It will be considered, therefore, as interurban and being so it was within the law and the charge of the indictment. The charge is that it ( the company) at the time designated--\n'then and there had authority and was authorized to operate a line of railroad ten miles in length between Covington and Erlanger, and beyond, through and by means of its control, ownership and lease of and from the Cincinnati, Covington & Erlanger Railway Company, a corporation organized under the laws of the commonwealth of Kentucky, an interurban railroad company authorized to construct and operate an electric railroad ten miles in lent h in this county between Covington and Erlanger and beyond, and incorporated under the general railroad laws of this commonwealth, said defendant then and there operating said line of railroad, the construction of which by the Cincinnati, Covington & Erlanger Railway Company had theretofore been authorized.'\n\n And having such authority and control of the line of railroad, the company violated the law of the state by not observing its requirement as to separate coaches.\n The defense to the action was, and the contention here is, not that the facts charged are not true, but that the statute so far as it is attempted to be made applicable to the company is an interference with interstate commerce, and that the defense was made in the trial court in a motion to dismiss and for a new trial and also in the Court of Appeals.\n In support of the contention it is stated that the company's principal business was interstate commerce, the \n\n[252 U.S. 399, 402]\n\u00a0\n carriage of passengers between Cincinnati and the Kentucky cities across the Ohio river; that the car in question was an ordinary single truck street car solely engaged in interstate trips from Cincinnati, Ohio, through Covington, Ky., and a suburb about five miles distant; and that 80 per cent. of the passengers carried were interstate.\n The reply made by the state, and expressed by the Court of Appeals, to the contention is that the railway company is a Kentucky corporation and by its charter was given authority 'to construct, operate and manage street railways in the City of Covington and vicinity,' 'and along such streets and public highways in the city as the council shall grant the right of way to,' 'and along such roads or streets out of the city as the companies or corporations owning the same may cede the right to the use of.' And further:\n'It may at any time, by agreement, purchase, lease, consolidate with, acquire, hold or operate any other street railway, or intersect therein, in Covington, Concinnati, Newport or vicinity,' etc.\n\n The Court of Appeals further declared that the railway company became in some way the owner of all of the stocks of the Cincinnati, Covington & Erlanger Railway Company, and that the corporations are operated under the same general management, and--\n'that the elder corporation operating in the name of the junior, actually constructed its road, and has been operating it from the beginning, being the owner of the cars which are operated upon the road. The motive power is electricity and is the property of the elder corporation, the cars upon the road are such as are ordinarily used upon street railroads, and such as the elder corporation uses upon the street railroads of its system. A fare of five cents is charged for passage from any point upon the road of the Cincinnati, Covington & Erlanger Company, to any point on the system of the South Covington & Cincinnati \n\n[252 U.S. 399, 403]\n\u00a0\n Street Railway Company, and from one point to another upon the entire system of the latter company, and transfers are given for all connecting lines. Many persons, who take passage upon the line of the Cincinnati, Covington & Erlanger Railway Company, at its terminus, near Erlanger, and at other places along its lines, are transported without change of cars, into Cincinnati, in the state of Ohio, as it connects with the lines of the South Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Company, at its terminus, in the city of Covington.'\n\n Separate coaches were not provided as required by the law.\n These being the facts, the Court of Appeals decided that there was no interference with or regulation of interstate commerce. 'Each of the termini,' the court said, 'as well as all the stations of the Cincinnati, Covington & Erlanger Railway Company's road, is within the state of Kentucky.' And it was concluded that 'the offense charged and for which the' railway was 'convicted was the operation of the railroad, in an unlawful manner, within the state, and in violation of one of the measures enacted under the police powers of the state.'\n In answer to, and in resistance to, the conclusion of the court, the railway company contends that it operates a railway between designated termini, one being in Kentucky and the other in Ohio; that the price of a fare may be the single one of five cents for the complete trip in the same coach taken at or terminating at, the respective termini; and that therefore the car and passenger are necessarily interstate. Thus viewed they undoubtedly are, but there are other considerations. There was a distinct operation in Kentucky, an operation authorized and required by the charters of the companies, and it is that operation the act in question regulates, and does no more, and therefore is not a regulation of interstate commerce. This is the effect of the ruling in South Covington Railway v. Covington, \n235 U.S. 537\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1915F, 792. The \n\n[252 U.S. 399, 404]\n\u00a0\n regulation of the act affects interstate business incidentally and does not subject it to unreasonable demands.\n The cited case points out the equal necessity, under our system of government, to preserve the power of the states within their sovereignties as to prevent the power from intrusive exercise within the national sovereignty, and an interurban railroad company deriving its powers from the state, and subject to obligations under the laws of the state, should not be permitted to exercise the powers given by the state, and escape its obligations to the state under the circumstances presented by this record, by running its coaches beyond the state lines. But we need not extend the discussion. The cited case expresses the principle of decision and marks the limitation upon the power of a state and when its legislation is or is not an interference with interstate commerce. And regarding its principle, we think, as we have said, the act in controversy does not transcend that limitation.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY (dissenting).\n If the statute of the state of Kentucky, here involved, as enforced by the decision under review imposes an unreasonable burden upon interstate commerce, the conviction should be reversed. To determine this question it is necessary to have in mind precisely what the charge was, and the nature of the traffic to which it was applied. The South Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Company was charged with the offense of unlawfully running and operating a coach or car by electricity on a railroad track within the state of Kentucky, without causing or having a separate coach for the transportation of white and colored passengers on its said line of railroad to bear in some conspicuous place appropriate words in plain letters indicating the race for which it was set apart, and without having its coach or car divided by a good and substantial \n\n[252 U.S. 399, 405]\n\u00a0\n wooden partition, or other partition, dividing the same into compartments with a door therein, and each separate compartment bearing in some conspicuous place appropriate words in plain letters indicating the race for which it was set apart.\n There is no conflict of testimony, and the record shows that the company was engaged in the operation of a street railway system whose principal business was interstate commerce, carrying passengers between Cincinnati and Kentucky cities across the Ohio river; that the car in question, described in the indictment, was an ordinary single truck street car seating 32 passengers, about 21 feet in length, inside measurement, solely engaged in interstate trips from Cincinnati, Ohio, through Covington, Ky., and well-populated territory adjacent thereto, to a point near Ft. Mitchell, a suburb, about 5 miles distant. Eighty per cent. of the passengers carried were interstate. Not to exceed 6 per cent. of the passengers carried at any time were colored, and on a large proportion of the trips no colored passengers were carried.\n The question for determination is: Whether under such circumstances the requirement of the statute of the state of Kentucky that railroad companies o ing business in that state shall be required to furnish separate coaches and cars for the travel or transportation of white and colored persons or cars with compartments, as described in the indictment, is constitutional? The nature of the traffic of the South Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Company was considered by this court in South Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Co. v. City of Covington, \n235 U.S. 537\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1915F, 792, and we held that the traffic between Kentucky and Ohio on the same cars, under the same management, and having a single fare constituted interstate commerce. See \n235 U.S. 545\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 158, L. R. A. 1915F, 792, and cases cited. In that case we held that an ordinance of the city of Covington, which undertook \n\n[252 U.S. 399, 406]\n\u00a0\n to determine the number of cars and passengers to be carried in interstate transportation was invalid as a burden upon interstate commerce, and that as to certain regulations affecting the safety and welfare of passengers, the ordinance was valid until Congress saw fit to regulate the interstate transportation involved.\n It is true that a portion of the transportation involved in the present case is over the track of a railroad company organized under the laws of Kentucky. But that road had no cars, conducted no railroad operations, and its stock was owned and it was operated by the South Covington & Cincinnati Street Railway Company. The car, for which the indictment was returned, and the conviction had, was operated only in interstate traffic, and whether over one road or the other, such operation was interstate commerce, and plainly within the authority of Congress. In the absence of congressional regulation the state had power to make reasonable rules, not burdening interstate commerce, which should be enforced until Congress otherwise enacted.\n The question in this case then is: Was the application of this statute a reasonable regulation? The traffic consists in running a single car, of the character already described, from Fountain Square, Cincinnati, a distance of about 6 miles, to Ft. Mitchell, a suburb of South Covington, Ky. How could this separate car or compartment statute be complied with? It is first suggested a separate car could be put on for the accommodation of colored passengers for the distance of the intrastate run on the Kentucky side of the river. In view of the nature of the transportation and the meager patronage compared with the expense of such an undertaking, this method would be impracticable without interrupting travel and entailing a great loss upon the company. Secondly, it is suggested, and this seems to be the weight of the argument, that cars could be constructed with a separate compartment for the few colored \n\n[252 U.S. 399, 407]\n\u00a0\n persons who ride in the car after it reaches or before it leaves Kentucky. It is admitted that this regulation would not apply to interstate passengers, and colored passengers going from Kentucky to Cincinnati, or going from Cincinnati to Kentucky on a through trip, would not be subject to the regulation. The few colored passengers traveling exclusively in the state of Kentucky in this car would thus be discriminated against by reason of the different privilege accorded to other colored passengers on the same car, a condition not likely to promote the peace or public welfare.\n As this transportation is also subject to regulation in the state of Ohio (see section 12940 Ohio Gen. Code), and as by the laws of that state no such separation of passengers is permitted, it follows that upon the same trip the traffic would be the subject of conflicting regulations, calculated to be destructive of the public policy which it is supposed to be the design of this statute to promote; a condition which we said in South Covington Street Railway Case, supra, would breed confusion, greatly to the detriment of interstate traffic.\n This case is quite different from Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. Kentucky, \n179 U.S. 388\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 101, n which the statute now under consideration was before the court, and wherein it was held that the law was valid when applied to a carrier operating an interstate road. The act was held to be separable, and capable of being complied with within the state by attaching a car for passengers traveling only within the state. That case presented quite a different situation from the operation of the single street car here involved.\n The present indictment is for running an ordinary street car upon an interstate journey of only about 6 miles, with 80 per cent. of its travel interstate, and not over 6 per cent. of the passengers colored, and on many trips no colored passengers at all. As we have indicated, the attachment of the additional car upon the Kentucky side on so short a \n\n[252 U.S. 399, 408]\n\u00a0\n journey would burden interstate commerce as to cost and in the practical operation of the traffic. The provision for a separate compartment for the use of only intrastate colored passengers would lead to confusion and discrimination. The same interstate transportation would be subject to conflicting regulation in the two states in which it is conducted.\n It seems to me that the statute in question as applied to the traffic here involved is an unreasonable regulation and burdensome to interstate commerce, and, therefore, beyond the power of the state. I think the judgment should be reversed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER and Mr. Justice PITNEY concur in this dissent. \n\n\n\n","143":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSOUTHERN PAC CO. v.

Pillsbury, both of San Francisco, Cal., for respondent.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 259, 262]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n William T. Bulter, husband of responent Mary E. Butler, was killed at Oakland, California, while employed by the Southern Pacific Company as an electric lineman. The Supreme Court of the State affirmed an award rendered by the California Industrial Commission against the company, and the cause is properly here by writ of certiorari.\n The fatal accident, which occurred June 21, 1917, arose out of and happened in the course of deceased's employment. He 'received an electric shock while wiping insulators, which caused him to fall from a steel power pole, producing injury which proximately caused his death.' At that time the company a common carrier by railroad, maintained a power house at Fruitvale, California, where it manufactured the electric current which moved its cars engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce. From the generators this current passed along main lines or cables, through a reduction and transforming station, to the trolley wires, and thence to the motors. When he received the electric shock, deceased was engaged in work on one of the main lines necessary to keep it in serviceable condition. If such work was part of interstate commerce, the Workmen's Compensation Act of the State (St. 1917, p. 831) is inapplicable and the judgment below must be reversed. Otherwise, it must be affirmed. Employers' Liability Act \n\n[251 U.S. 259, 263]\n\u00a0\n April 22, 1908, ch. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657-8665); New York Central R. R. Co. v. Winfield, \n244 U.S. 147\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 546, L. R. A. 1918C, 439, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 1139; New York Central R. R. Co. v. Porter, \n249 U.S. 168\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 188.\n Generally, when applicability of the federal Employers' Liability Act is uncertain, the character of the employment, in relation to commerce, may be adequately tested by inquiring whether, at the time of the injury, the employe was engaged in work so closely connected with interstate transportation as practically to be a part of it. Pedersen v. Delaware, L . & W. R. R. Co., \n229 \nU.S. 146, 151\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 648, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 153; Shanks v. Delaware, L. & W. R. R. Co., \n239 \nU.S. 556, 558\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 188, L. R. A. 1916C, 797; New York Central R. R. Co. v. Porter, supra; Kinzell v. Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co., \n250 \nU.S. 130, 133\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 412.\n Power is no less essential than tracks or bridges to the movement of cars. The accident under consideration occurred while deceased was wiping insulators actually supporting a wire which then carried electric power so intimately connected with the propulsion of cars that if it had been shortcircuited through his body, they would have stopped instantly. Applying the suggested test, we think these circumstances suffice to show that his work was directly and immediately connected with interstate transportation and an essential part of it.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissents. \n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPILLER v. ATCHISON, T. & S. F. RY. CO.(1920)\nNo. 137\nArgued: January 15, 1920Decided: May 17, 1920\n\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 117, 119]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Buckner F. Deatherage, of Kansas City, Mo., and S. H. Cowan, of Ft. Worth, Tex., for plaintiff in error.\n Messrs. T. J. Norton and Gardiner Lathrop, both of Chicago, Ill., for defendants in error. \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 120]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error commenced an action against defendants in error jointly in the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Missouri under section 16 of the act to regulate commerce as amended (Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 384; Act June 29, 1906, c. 3591,  5, 34 Stat. 584, 590; Act June 18, 1910, c. 309,  13, 36 Stat. 539, 554 [Comp. St.  8584]), to recover certain amounts awarded to him against them respectively in a reparation order made by the Interstate Commerce Commission January 12, 1914. His petition contained also a count setting up a conspiracy between defendants for the restraint of interstate commerce, and claiming treble damages under section 7 of the Sherman Anti- Trust Act f July 2, 1890 (chapter 647, 26 Stat. 209, 210 [Comp. St.  8829]); but this was abandoned at the trial. Defendants having filed separate answers, a jury was waived by stipulation, and a test case tried before the court-all defendants participating-with the result that a decision was rendered in favor of plaintiff, pursuant to which a combined judgment was entered, amounting in effect to as many judgments as there were defendants, each for the amount of the commission's award against the particular defendant with interest and attorneys' fees. Defendants sued out separate writs of error from the Circuit Court of Appeals, where, by stipulation, the cases were heard together upon a single record. That court reversed the judgments, ordered the cause remanded to the District Court with directions to grant a new trial (Atchison, T. & Santa Fe R. Co. v. Spiller, 246 Fed. 1, 158 C. C. A. 227), and refused an application for a rehearing (249 Fed. 677, 161 C. C. A. 587). Writs of error were prayed for and allowed for the review of the judgments of reversal in this court; and afterwards but in due season a petition for the allowance of a writ of certiorari was filed, the consideration of which was postponed to the hearing under the writs of error.\n The jurisdiction of the District Court having been in voked \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 121]\n\u00a0\n not because of diversity of citizenship but because the suit was one arising under laws of the United States other than those particularly mentioned in section 128, Judicial Code, as amended (Act Jan. 28, 1915, c. 22,  2, 38 Stat. 803 (Comp. St.  1120), it follows that the judgments were not made 'final' by the section referred to, and, if final in the sense of concluding the litigation, would be reviewable in this court by writ of error pursuant to section 241, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1218), in each case where the matter in controversy exceeds $1,000, besides costs. In the cases of the Chicago & Alton and the, Missouri Pacific Companies, the respective judgments with interest up to the issuance of the writs of error from this court were materially less than $1,000; in each of the other cases substantially in excess of that amount; the aggregate of the judgments being more than $150,000. For want of a sufficient amount in controversy the two smaller judgments would not be reviewable here by writ of error even were they final in effect; but all the writs of error must be dismissed because the judgments call for further proceedings in the trial court; it being elementary that this writ will lie to review final judgments only. McLish v. Roff, \n141 \nU.S. 661, 665\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 118; Luxton v. North River Bridge Co., \n147 \nU.S. 337, 341\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 356; Heike v. United States, \n217 \nU.S. 423, 429\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 539.\n However, upon consideration of the particular circumstances of the case, we have concluded that a writ of certiorari ought to be allowed, without further protracting the litigation to the extent that would be encessary in order to reach final judgments; the transcript of the record and proceedins returned in obedience to the writs of error to stand as the return to the writ of certiorari. This writ is allowable by virtue of section 240, Judicial Code (derived from section 6 of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, 26 Stat. 826, 828 [Comp. St.  1217]), in the case of the two smaller judgments, because the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals is made final by the combined effect of sections 128 and 241; and in the case of \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 122]\n\u00a0\n the larger judgments it is allowable under section 262 of the Code ( section 716, Revised Stat. U. S. [Comp. St.  1239]), in aid of the ultimate jurisdiction of this court to review those cases by writs of error. Lau Ow Bew v. United States, \n144 \nU.S. 47, 58\n, 12 S. Sup.

Cas. 1916B, 691.\n Coming to the merits: The ground upon which the CircuitCourt of Appeals reversed the judgments, and the ground principally relied upon to sustain its decision was the refusal by the trial court of a motion made by defendants to hold: (3) That upon all the evidence plaintiff was not entitled to recover against any or all of the defendants; and (b) that there was not sufficient evidence before the commission to sustain its order of reparation. The latter is the substantial question actually presented.\n The course of proceedings at the trial, as appears from the bill of exceptions, was as follows: Plaintiff introduced the report of the Interstate Commerce Commission (unreported opinion No. A-583 in case No. 732, Cattle Raisers' Association of Texas v. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Co., dated January 12, 1914), and the order of reparation made pursuant to it and upon which the action was based. Defendants having admitted the service of the order, and that the money awarded had not been paid, plaintiff rested. The report makes an award in favor of Spiller, plaintiff in error, as assignee of a large number of claims for reparation by reason of excessive rates charged by the respective carriers on interstate shipments of cattle from points of origin in Texas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Colorado, and Kansas, to destinations at Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, St. Joseph, and New Orleans, on various dates between August 29, 1906, and November 17, 1908; and a further award to named shippers in the case of certain unassigned claims pertaining to similar shipments; the \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 123]\n\u00a0\n several claims, assigned and unassigned, with distinguishing marks, being set forth in Appendix A, showing the delivering carriers against which the claims were allowed and, in each case, the consignor, points of origin and destination, number of cars shipped, weight, rate paid, the lower rate sanctioned by the commission, amount of refund required, and the interest thereon. The report contains appropriate findings adequate to support the award, among them the following: That the persons named in Appendix A as consignors shipped from the points of origin to the points of destination specified, by the line of road named as the 'delivering road,' the number of cars and of the aggregate net weight stated; that the shippers paid to the delivering carriers freight upon the shipments at certain rates named; that in each instance this rate was unreasonable and excessive, and a reasonable rate to have been charged would have been the lower rate specified as having been subsequently established by the commission, and that therefore the delivering carriers collected from the shippers unreasonable charges on account of the shipments in amounts named in the column headed 'Amount of Refund'; that the shipments of live stock were in all cases consigned to some person at the delivering market, usually a commission firm; that the freight was paid in the first instance by the 'consignor' (evidently a misprint for 'consignee') to the delivering carrier, and subsequently the cattle were sold upon the market and the amount of the freight deducted from the purchase price, remittance being made for the balance, so that in all cases the owner and shipper of the cattle finally paid the transportation charges; and that by the unreasonable exactions of the carriers the shippers were damaged in the amounts stated in the appropriate column of Appendix A, since they received for the cattle less by those amounts than they would have received had the rate found reasonable been charged; that in the case of \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 124]\n\u00a0\n some of the claims the shippers made assignments to H. E. Crowley, then being secretary of the Cattle Raisers's Association, in a form set forth in the report; that subsequently Crowley ceased to be such secretary, and was succeeded b Spiller, the plaintiff, to whom Crowley assigned all claims previously assigned to him; and that other specified claims were assigned by the shippers to Spiller after he became secretary, the form of assignment being the same as that previously employed.\n Defendants, endeavoring to show the insufficiency of the evidence upon which the findings and order of the commission were based, introduced a transcript of the stenographer's notes of the testimony taken upon the hearing of the reparation claims, following this by introducing a sample page taken from one of the exhibits introduced before the commission as illustrative of the form of exhibits there introduced. After other evidence not necessary to be mentioned, and a request for judgment in favor of defendants, and for certain rulings on points of law that would have produced that result, all of which were refused, the case was closed.\n It appears that in February, 1904, the Cattle Raisers' Association of Texas, in behalf of its members and of others interested, petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission under section 13 of the Commerce Act (Comp. St.  8581), alleging the rates in force in the territory in question to be unjust and unreasonable, they having been advanced some time before to the extent (in most cases) of 3 cents per hundred pounds. On August 16, 1905. the commission held (Cattle Raisers' Association of Texas v. Missouri, Kansas & Texas Ry. Co., 11 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 296, 352) that the then existing rates were unjust and unreasonable by the amount of the advance. At this time the commission was not empowered to fix rates for the future. This power having been conferred by the Hepburn Act of June 29, 1906 (chapter 3591, 34 Stat. 584, 589 [Comp. St.  8583]), which, by joint resolution of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 838), \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 125]\n\u00a0\n took effect 60 days after its approval by the President, or on August 28, 1906, the Cattle Raisers' Association immediately thereafter applied for and obtained a reopening of the matter, to the end that reasonable rates might be established; and on April 14, 1908, the commission decided that the former rates should be restored, but that reparation would not be allowed upon claims accruing prior to August 29, 1906 (date of the application). 13 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 418, 435. The reduced rates finally were put into effect November 17, 1908\n\n\n The reparation claims in controversy appear to have been filed in due season by the Cattle Raisers' Association in behalf of its members and other shippers interested, and in the names of the alleged owners of the cattle shipped.\n The transcript of the testimony taken by the commission, as introduced in evidence in the District Court, forms the basis of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals that the reparation order was unsupported by evidence. But the transcript shows that important documentary evidence was introduced, and furnished the principal foundation for the findings made. This documentary evidence (except the single sheet offered for purposes of illustration) was not introduced in the District Court, in order, as stated by counsel, to 'avoid introducing a number of papers that would almost fill a farm wagon.' But obviously we hardly could sustain a decision rejecting the reparation order upon the ground that there was not sufficient evidence before the commission to support it when the whole of the evidence that was before the commission was not produced.\n That this is a matter of substance will appear from a review of the course of the proceeding as disclosed by the stenographer's transcript. The evidence was taken by Mr. Commissioner Prouty at Chicago; there being three sessions, the first on September 19 and 20, 1912, the second on January 24 and the third on October 17 in the following year. They were held in the presence of counsel for the \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 126]\n\u00a0\n Cattle Raisers' Association, who appeared for the claimants, and counsel for the several carriers interested. If we were called upon to review the proceeding as upon a writ of error or appeali t might be difficult to say that no improper evidence was admitted, that production of the best available was insisted upon, or that a different conclusion might not have been reached upon that which was admitted. But the scope of the judicial review is not so extensive. Section 13 of the Act to Regulate Commerce ( Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, 383, amended June 18, 1910 [ chapter 309, 36 Stat. 539, 550]) requires the commission on receipt of a claim for reparation to proceed on notice to the carrier to 'investigate the matters complained of in such manner and by such means as it shall deem proper'; and by section 16 (34 Stat. 590; 36 Stat. 554), if, after such hearing, the commission shall determine that any party complainant is entitled to an award of damages, the commission is to make an order of reparation accordingly, and in a suit based thereon 'the findings and order of the commission shall be prima facie evidence of the facts therein stated.' The same section contemplates that numerous parties may unite in a claim for reparation, and that numerous carriers may be joined as defendants; and similarly that in a suit brought upon such award there may be a joinder of parties plaintiff and defendant. And, by section 17 (24 Stat. 385; 25 Stat. 861 [Comp. St.  8586]), 'the commission may conduct its proceedings in such manner as will best conduce to the proper dispatch of business and to the ends of justice.'\n These provisions allow a large degree of latitude in the investigation of claims for reparation, and the resulting findings and order of the commission may not be rejected as evidence because of any errors in its procedure not amounting to a denial of the right to a fair hearing, so long as the essential facts found are based upon substantial evidence.\n\n\n[253 U.S. 117, 127]\n\u00a0\n In the present case, the hearing was informal, but not to the extent of sacrificing essential rights of parties; and it cannot becharacterized as arbitrary or unfair. Many carriers were interested, and they were represented by counsel. Thousands of carload shipments were in question, but the points in real controversy were few, and there was a natural desire on all sides to expedite the hearing. In the main, counsel for the carriers co-operated in facilitating the investigation. It was not in dispute that all shipments under inquiry were made during a period when the tariff rates were under investigation, and that afterwards those rates were determined by the commission to have been excessive. It appeared that itemized claims for reparation had been made out in duplicate (one copy of each being filed), in the names of the parties alleged to have made shipments of cattle as owners during the period in question, that these were based in most cases upon data furnished by the commission houses at the several points of destination, as taken from their books, in other cases by the shippers themselves, and that they were computed by applying the excess charges, as determined, to the actual weights of the shipments where known, in other cases to the minimum carload weights. There was evidence that a few of the cattle shippers kept books, they relying upon the commission companies to do this, and that such companies were the consignees of the cattle, and made it a practice on receiving a shipment to pay the freight, sell the cattle, and remit the proceeds to the owner after deducting the freight paid and other charges. During the hearing, there was drawn off from the claims as made up and filed a summary for each carrier, purporting to show the consignor, consignee, originating road, point of origin, destination, date of delivery, number of cars moved, rate paid, rate established by the commission, and the overcharge claimed. These were submitted to the several carriers for investigation by their accounting officers, and \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 128]\n\u00a0\n some months later were reported back to Commissioner Prouty by their counsel with the results of such investigation, which in a majority of instances verified the statements said to have been deduced fromt he records of the commission houses. In some cases, in addition to check marks, 'O. K.' and other marks indicating that the items had been found correct, waybill references, car numbers, initials, etc., had been inserted; and where it had been found impossible to locate a shipment there were comments tending to add support to the verification of those that were located. No reparation was awarded by the commission except with respect to such shipments as were acknowledged in the reports of the defendants to have moved as stated. These reports were introduced in evidence before Commissioner Prouty, but, as already shown, were not in evidence before the District Court. What we have said as to their contents is gathered from the stenographer's transcript; what else may have appeared upon their face, in the nature of admissions, is left to be inferred. Counsel for some of the carriers undertook to qualify the effect of admissions contained in them, as by saying that the checking meant no more than that a particular car moved as stated, and that the carrier collected the amount of freight specified; that it was not intended to admit that remittance was made to the person named as claimant; that the statements were subject to confirmation by the books of the commission merchants, or the like. But the commission was justified in according to the reports of the checking an evidential effect, not limited by the qualifying statements, treating the latter as merely argumentative. It might regard the fact that the shipments could be and were identified from the records of the carriers, in the manner described, as evidence that the details respecting the shippers of the cattle and the particulars of the shipments were true; might take the movement and delivery of the freight thus \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 129]\n\u00a0\n acknowledged as evidence that the delivering carrier collected the freight charges according to the published tariffs, which of course included the overcharges; and might take this, in connection with the evidence as to the course of business, as showing that the shippers whose names were mentioned in the statements sustained damages to the extent of the excessive charge as determined by the commission. The minutes show that until near the conclusion of the hearing it was the intention to appoint an examiner to investigate the books of the commission merchants at the various points of destination in order to verify the details of the several shipments, and that this purpose was abandoned in view of the admissions made by the carriers. Perhaps it ought to have been carried out; but the court was not justified in treating the report of the commission as a nullity for this reason, if there was substantial evidence of the essential facts without such verification. We think that what we have detailed of the course of the hearing, taken in connection with what we know and what may be presumed as to the contents of the unproduced documentary evidence, shows there was substantial evidence that the owners specified in the claims had been subjected to the excessive charges with respect to the shipments acknowledged by the carriers; and, as already remarked, the award of reparation was confined to these shipments.\n The opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals severly criticizes the evidence on which these conclusions were based, characterizing it as hearsay. It is not to be disputed that much of the evidence-including essential parts of it-is properly so characterized. The only witness sworn was Mr. Williams, assistant secretary of the Cattle Raisers' Association, who had gathered the data upon which the claims were based, mostly from commission merchants, in some instances from the cattle shippers. He had prepared the claims, had spent much \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 130]\n\u00a0\n time and pains in investigating them, and in the course of his duties had visited several of the points of destination and examined the books and records of the commission merchants to ascertain the method in which their business was conducted and records kept. It was he who testified as to the customaryc ourse of business of cattle shippers and commission merchants. He had been connected with the Cattle Raisers' Association for about eight years, and might be presumed to have some general familiarity with the business in addition to that gained in the special study he had made of it while investigating the claims. His explanation of the method of business and the details of the claims was accepted, and accepted without objection, very much as the testimony of an expert witness might have been accepted. Whether he had shown such special knowledge as to qualify him to testify as an expert was for the Interstate Commerce Commission to determine; and its decision thereon is not to be set aside by the courts unless clearly shown to have been unfounded, which cannot be said in this case. Stillwell Mfg. Co. v. Phelps, \n130 \nU.S. 520, 527\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 601; Montana Ry. Co. v. Warren, \n137 \nU.S. 348, 353\n, 11 S. Sup. Ct. 96 34 L. Ed. 681.\n The evidence was not objected to as hearsay when introduced, nor, indeed, at any time during the hearing before the commission. Counsel did in some instances assert that there was a failure of proof, and suggest that the proceedings ought to be dismissed. But the objections came too late, and were too general in character, to be equivalent to an objection to the reception of the evidence because hearsay. Even in a court of law, if evidence of this kind is admitted without objection, it is to be considered, and accorded its natural probative effect, as if it were in law admissible. Diaz v. United States, \n223 \nU.S. 442, 450\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 250, Ann. Cas. 1913C, 1138; Rowland v. St. Louis & S. F. R. R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 106, 108\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 577; Damon v. Carrol, 163 Mass. 404, 408, 40 N. E. 185. And it is clear that the verification of the details of the \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 131]\n\u00a0\n claims by the carriers after full investigation by their auditing departments constituted primary evidence against them, and went far towards showing that the facts as disclosed by the hearsay evidence might be depended upon.\n We are not here called upon to consider whether the commission may receive and act upon hearsay evidence seasonably objected to as hearsay; but we do hold that in this case, where such evidence was introduced without objection and was substantially corroborated by original evidence clearly admissible against the parties to be affected, the commission is not to be regarded as having acted arbitrarily, nor may its findings and order be rejected as wanting in support, simply because the hearsay evidence was considered with the rest.\n In Interstate Com. Comm. v. Baird, \n194 \nU.S. 25, 44\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 563, 569 (48 L. Ed. 860), it was said:\n'The inquiry of a board of the character of the Interstate Commerce Commission should not be too narrowly constrained by technical rules as to the admissibility of proof. Its function is largely one of investigation and it should not be hampered in making inquiry pertaining to interstate commerce by those narrow rules which prevail in trials at common law where a strict correspondence is required between allegation and proof.'\n\n In Interstate Com. Comm. v. Louis. & Nash. R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 93\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 185, 187 (57 L. Ed. 431), the court recognized that--\n'The commission is an administrative body and, even where it acts in a quasi judicial capacity, is not limited by the strict rules, as to the admissibility of evidence, which prevail in suits between private parties.'\n\n And the fact that a reparation order has at most only the effect of prima facie evidence (Meeker & Co. v. Lehigh Valley R. R., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 430\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691; Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R., \n236 \nU.S. 434, 439\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 337; Mills v. Lehigh Valley R. R., \n238 \nU.S. 473, 482\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 888), being open to contradiction by the carrier when sued for recovery of the amount awarded, is an added reason for not binding down the \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 132]\n\u00a0\n commission too closely in respec of the character of the evidence it may receive or the manner in which its hearings shall be conducted.\n In this case the commission did not act upon evidence of which the carriers were not cognizant and to which they had no opportunity to reply, as in the case supposed in Interstate Com. Comm. v. Louis. & Nash. R. R., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 93 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 185. All the carriers participated in the hearing, and had full opportunity to object, to cross- examine, and to introduce evidence on their own part.\n It is objected that the evidence failed to show who owned the cattle shipped or who paid the freight. This cannot be sustained. True, it appeared that the cattle were not in all instances billed in the name of the owner, but sometimes in the name of a caretaker, his name being inserted in the bill as evidence of his right to free transportation. But it is probable that in the latter cases there was a want of correspondence between the claims as presented and the carriers' books, and that for want of checking by the carriers they were omitted from the award. The evidence upon the whole was sufficient to sustain a finding, so far as the claims were allowed, that the parties in whose behalf they were allowed were consignors of the shipments and presumably owners of the cattle shipped.\n If there be doubt whether it was sufficient to sustain each and every claim that was allowed, we are not now concerned with this; the ruling in question being the refusal of the trial court to treat the award as void in toto. This was not erroneous if to any substantial extent the award was legally valid. If a part only of the claims was unsupported by evidence, the request for an adverse ruling should have been directed to these.\n The principal defense before the commission was that the payment of a published rate afterwards decided to have been excessive was not evidence that the party who paid \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 133]\n\u00a0\n the freight sustained damage to the extent of the excess. The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained this contention at the first hearing. 246 Fed. 1, 23, 158 C. C. A. 227. But it has since been ruled otherwise by this court (Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531, 534\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 186), and, in view of this, upon the rehearing the Circuit Court of Appeals withdrew this part of its former opinion (249 Fed. 677, 161 C. C. A. 587).\n That court held, further, that upon the undispurted evidence the legal title to the claims for reparation never vested in Spiller, and hence that the commission was wholly without authority to order reparation to be made to him. The minutes show that of the claims in favor of Spiller a number had been assigned to Crowley when he was secretary of the Cattle Raisers' Association, and afterwards assigned by him to Spiller when Crowley retired and Spiller succeeded him; that other claims were assigned by the consignors to Spiller direct; and that still others had not been assigned. The assignments were produced before Commissioner Prouty, and an offer made to file them, but as we interpret the minutes this was waived, a copy of one of the assignments (they were said to be alike in form) being inserted in the stenographer's notes instead. There was evidence that the assignments were made for nominal considerations because the Cattle Raisers' Association was prosecuting the claims for the benefit of the owners thereof. In the schedule of the claims as submitted to the commission those assigned were suitably identified, and the commission awarded reparation to Spiller upon these, and in other cases made the order in favor of the parties named as owners. There was substantial evidence to support the finding that the claims had been assigned. Formal proof of the handwriting of the assignors by subscribing witnesses or otherwise was not necessary in so summary a hearing, in the absence of objection or contradiction. What was shown as \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 134]\n\u00a0\n to the relation of the shippers to the association and the possession of the instruments of assignmn t by the representative of the association who was prosecuting the claims gave a reasonable assurance of the genuineness of the instruments.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held further, however, that, supposing there was sufficient evidence to support the finding that the claims had been legally assigned to Spiller, it showed that the purpose of the assignment was not such as to vest the legal title to the claims in him so as to authorize the commission to make the award of damages in his name. To this we cannot assent. The assignments were absolute in form, and plainly their effect-supposing the claims to be assignable-was to vest the legal title in Spiller. What they did not pass to him was the beneficial or equitable title. But this was not necessary to support the right of the assignee to claim an award of reparation and enable him to recover it by action at law brought in his own name but for the benefit of the equitable owners of the claims; especially since it appeared that such was the real purpose of the assignments.\n We have said enough to show that the reversal of the judgments of the District Court cannot be sustained on the grounds upon which the Circuit Court of Appeals based it. It is insisted, however, that, failing this, the same result ought to have been reached upon the ground that the provisions of the Commerce Act do not permit an assignment of a claim for reparation to a third party and hence the Interstate Commerce Commission was without jurisdiction to award reparation to Spiller. This is based upon the language of sections 8 and 9 (Comp. St.  8572, 8573), which remain in their original form, of section 13, as amended June 18, 1910 ( chapter 309, 36 Stat. 550), and of section 16 as amended June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 584). Section 8 (24 Stat. 382) makes the common carrier, for anything done contrary to the prohibition of the act, 'liable to the person or \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 135]\n\u00a0\n persons injured thereby for the full amount of damages sustained in consequence of any such violation of the provisions of this act.' Section 9 entitles any person claiming to be damaged either to make complaint to the commission or to 'bring suit in his or their own behalf for the recovery of the damages for which such common carrier may be liable.' Section 13 contains nothing that need be quoted. Section 16 as amended (34 Stat. 590) provides that where an award of damages is made by the commission and the carrier does not comply with the order, 'the complainant, or any person for whose benefit such order was made' may bring suit. Stress is laid upon the absence of language expressly extending the remedy to the representatives or assigns of the person aggrieved; but we attribute no controlling significance to this. The provisions of the act giving redress, compensatory in its nature, to persons sustaining pecuniary injury through the violation of public duty by the carrier must receive a reasonably liberal and not a narrow interpretation. A claim for damages sustained through the exaction of unreasonable charges for the carriage of freight is a claim not for a penalty but for compensation, is a property right assignable in its nature ( Comegys v. Vasse, 1 Pet. 193, 213; Erwin v. United States, \n97 U.S. 392\n, 395-396), and must be regarded as assignable at law, in the absence of any expression of a legislative intent to the contrary. We find nothing in the letter or spirit of the act inconsistent with such assignability. We are referred to certain expressions in Texas & Pacific Ry. Co. v. Abilene Cotton Oil Co., \n204 \nU.S. 426, 442\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 350, 9 Ann. Cas. 1075, and Southern Pacific Co. v. Darnell- Taenzer Lumber Co., \n245 \nU.S. 531, 533\n, 534 S., 38 Sup. Ct. 186; but they do not bear upon the present question, and are not inconsistent with the view that reparation claims are assignable.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission, by Conference Ruling No. 362 ( June 4, 1912), declared:\n'In awarding reparation the commission will recognize an assignment \n\n[253 U.S. 117, 136]\n\u00a0\n by a consignor to a consignee or by a consignee to a consignor, but will not recognize an assignment to a stranger to the transportation records.'\n\n See Robinson Co. v. American Express Co., 38 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 733, 735. So far as this involves a construction of the act, we are unable to accept it, for reasons that have been indicated. Treating it as an administrative regulation, it of course constituted no limitation upon the jurisdiction of the commission, even were it consistent with a correct construction of the act, which we hold it was not. In any event, the commission had power to disregard the regulation, as in effect it did by recognizing the assignments in this case.\n Other points discussed in the argument require no special comment.\n It results that the judgments of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and those of the District Court affirmed.\n Writs of error dismissed.\n Writs of certiorari allowed.\n Judgments of Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and judgments of District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","145":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTALLINGS v. SPLAIN(1920)\nNo. 534\nArgued: April 23, 1920Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 339, 340]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William B. Jaynes, of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Solicitor General King, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Stallings was indicted in the District Court of the United States for the District of Wyoming for embezzling moneys intrusted to him as United States commissioner. Being in the District of Columbia, he was arrested there by Splain, marshal for the District, and was detained to await the institution of proceedings for his removal. In making the arrest Splain had relied, not upon a warrant issued by a commissioner for the District, but upon a bench warrant issued to the marshal for the district of Wyoming on the indictment. Stallings filed immediately in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia a petition for writ of habeas corpus, contending, for this reason apparently, that the arrest and detention were illegal. The writ issued, Splain produced the body, the hearing on the writ was postponed, and Stallings was admitted to bail.\n While he was at large on bail, awaiting a hearing in the habeas corpus proceedings, an affidavit of complaint was filed before a United States commissioner for the District, setting forth the same offenses charged in the indictment. A warrant issued thereon, but Stallings was not arrested. He appeared voluntarily before the commissioner, admitted his identity and that he held the office named at the times the offenses were charged to have been committed, declined to offer any evidence, and moved that he be discharged. The commissioner denied the motion. Then, certified copies of the indictment and other papers having been introduced, he found probable cause. No order was made that Stallings be held to await an application for his removal. He requested that he be admitted to bail for his appearance in Wyoming to answer the charges \n\n[253 U.S. 339, 341]\n\u00a0\n against him. The bail was fixed at $2,000 and was furnished.\n After this Splain filed a return to the petition for writ of habeas corpus, setting up the above facts, and Stallings demurred. He also secured, in aid of the habeas corpus proceeding, a writ of certiorari, by which all proceedings before the United States commissioner were certified to the Supreme Court of the District. The case was then heard both upon the demurrer to the petition for writ of habeas corpus and upon the return to the writ of certiorari. The demurrer was overruled; and, Stallings electing to stand thereon, the court dismissed the petition for a writ of habeas corpus and discharged the writ issued thereon. The petition for a writ of certiorari and the writ issued thereon were also dismissed, and the proceedings were remanded to the commissioner for further action. Stallings appealed to the Court of Appeals for the District, which affirmed the final order below. 49 App. D. C. 38, 258 Fed. 510. It is contended here that Stallings should be discharged: (a) Because the original arrest and detention on the bench warrant were illegal and the later proceedings before the commissioner were without jurisdiction, since he could not legally be rearrested for the same offense until the habeas corpus proceeding had been disposed of; (b) because the affidavit and the indictment fail to charge a crime against the United States.\n First. The original arrest and detention were lawful. A person, duly charged with a felony in one state, may, if he flees to another, be arrested, without a warrant, by a peace officer in the state in which he is found, and be detained for the reasonable time necessary to enable a requisition to be made. Burton v. New York Central Railroad, \n245 \nU.S. 315, 318\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 108. See Kurtz v. Muffitt, \n115 \nU.S. 487, 504\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 148. The rule is not less liberal where the fugitive stands charged by an indictment found in one federal district and flees to another. See \n\n[253 U.S. 339, 342]\n\u00a0\n 2 Moore on Extradition,  540. If the bench warrant issued in Wyoming was not effective as a warrant wt hin the District of Columbia, the possession of it did not render illegal an arrest which could lawfully have been made without it. It would, at least, serve as evidence that Splain had reasonable cause to believe that a felony had been committed by Stallings. Commonwealth v. Phelps, 209 Mass. 396, 404, 95 N. E. 868, Ann. Cas. 1912B, 566.\n Second. The pendency of the habeas corpus proceeding did not deprive the commissioner of jurisdiction to entertain the application for arrest on the affidavit of complaint. When Splain, in obedience to the writ, brought Stallings before the court, he passed from thr custody of the marshal into that of the court, and he remained under its protection and control, although enlarged on bail. Barth v. Clise, 12 Wall. 400. But he did not thereby become immune from all other process until the habeas corpus proceedings should been finally disposed of. Commonwealth v. Hall, 9 Gray (Mass.) 262, 69 Am. Dec. 285. Lack of jurisdiction in the commissioner did not follow from the fact that the court had acquired, by virtue of the habeas corpus proceedings, the custody of and control over Stallings. Even if the affidavit of complaint had related to another indictment brought in a different district, the commissioner would have had jurisdiction to entertain it. The question would merely have been whether a second arrest could properly be made where it conflicted with the first. Peckham v. Henkel, \n216 U.S. 483\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 255; In re Beavers (D. C.) 125 Fed. 988; Id. (C. C.) 131 Fed. 366. Here there could be no conflict; for the second arrest, if it had been made, would have been merely for the purpose of carrying out the first. The government was not precluded from taking such additional proceedings as it might deem necessary or advisable to supplement or perfect those originally instituted. If the original arrest was lawful, the detention would remain legal only for the reasonable time required to enable \n\n[253 U.S. 339, 343]\n\u00a0\n appropriate removal proceedings to be instituted. Unless the lawful arrest was promptly followed by such proceedings, the prisoner would be entitled to his discharge. In the Matter of Fetter, 23 N. J. Law, 311, 321, 57 Am. Dec. 382. On the other hand, if the original arrest and detention had been illegal, Stallings would not be entitled to his discharge, if before final hearing in the habeas corpus proceedings legal cause for detaining him had arisen through the institution of removal proceedings. Where it appears that sufficient ground for detention exists a prisoner will not be discharged for defects in the original arrest or commitment. Nishimura Ekiu v. United States, \n142 U.S. 651\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 336; Iasigi v. Van de Carr, \n166 U.S. 391\n, 17 Sup. Ct. 595; Kelly v. Griffin, \n241 \nU.S. 6, 13\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 487.\n Third. The admission to bail by the commissioner to answer the indictment in the district of Wyoming was upon this own request on advice of counsel. When this bail was given no application had been made to the court for his removal, and there had not even been an order of the commissioner that he be held to await such application. He ceased, therefore, to be in the position ordinarily occupied by one who is contesting the validity of his detention and who has been released on bail pending the habeas corpus proceeding. Sibray v. United States, 185 Fed. 401, 107 C. C. A. 483. Stallings' position was thereafter no better than if he had applied for the writ after he had given bail. It is well settled that under such circumstances a petitioner is not entitled to be discharged on habeas corpus. Respublica v. Arnold, 3 Yeates (Pa.) 263; Dodge's Case, 6 Mart. O. S. (La.) 569; State v. Buyck, 1 Brev. (S. C.) 460. Being no longer under actual restraint within the District of Columbia he was not entitled to the writ of habeas corpus. Wales v. Whitney, \n114 U.S. 564\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 1050.\n Furthermore by voluntarily giving bail to appear in Wyoming, the purpose of h e removal proceedings had been accomplished, and all questions in controversy in the habeas corpus and in the removal proceedings terminated. \n\n[253 U.S. 339, 344]\n\u00a0\n Whether his arrest and detention had originally been valid was thereby rendered immaterial. In re Esselborn (C. C.) 8 Fed. 904. And likewise the question whether there was a right then to remove him. Compare Cheong Ah Moy v. United States, \n113 U.S. 216\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 431; Ex parte Baez, \n177 U.S. 378\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 673.\n Fourth. Stallings' contention that he should be discharged, because the indictment failed to charge a crime under the laws of the United States, is also unfounded. He was indicted under section 97 of the Penal Code,1 which declares that any officer of the United States who shall embezzle any money which may have come into his possession in the execution of such office or under claim of authority as such officer shall be punished. The indictment charges Stallings with having received as commissioner divers sums of money from persons named, to be paid over to the receiver of the land office at Cheyenne, and embezzling the same. It is contended that the money could not have been received as commissioner for transmission, because it is not among the statutory duties of a commissioner. But section 2294 of the Revised Statutes, as amended by Act March 4, 1904, c. 394, 3 Stat. 59 (Comp. St.  4546), provides that, where applicants for the benefit of the homestead and other land laws make the required affidavits before commissioners of the United States, the proof so made shall have the same effect as if made before the register and receiver, 'when transmitted to them with the fees and commissions allowed and required by law.' The circular issued by the Land Office in 1905 (33 Land Dec. 480, 481), containing 'Suggestions to United States Commissions,' etc., directs that the proofs so taken be 'transmitted to the register and receiver with the necessary fees and commissions.' And the circular issued in 1915 (44 Land Dec. 350, 352) directs that in 'no case should the transmittal thereof be left to the claimant.'\n Duties of an officer may be prescribed by rule. If the validity of the indictment was open to reasonable doubt, \n\n[253 U.S. 339, 345]\n\u00a0\n it was to be resolved, not by the committing magistrate, but, after the removal, by the court which found the indictment.

In the event the said Commission cannot now locate with reasonable certainty the line of the river as it ran immediately before the avulsion of 1848, it shall report the nature and extent of the erosions, accretions and changes that occurred in the old channel of navigation as the result of said avulsion, and in said report, if necessary to be made in obedience to this paragraph of the decree, said Commission shall give its findings of fact and the evidence on which same are based.\n\n 6. \nBefore entering upon the discharge of their duties, each of said Commissioners shall be duly sworn to perform faithfully, impartially and without prejudice or bias the duties hereinafter imposed; said oaths to be taken before the Clerk of this Court, or before the clerk of any District Court of the United States, or before an officer authorized by law to administer an oath in the State of Arkansas or Mississippi, and returned with their report.

Complainant claims to the middle of each bay-halfway between the shores. The defendant does not seriously question this claim as to the lower bay, but earnestly maintains that in the upper one the line follows a sinuous course near complainant's shore. Since 1893 a deep channel has been dredged through these waters and harbor lines have been established. According to Wisconsin's insistence, its border crosses and recrosses this channel and intersects certain docks extending from the Minnesota shore, leaving portions of them in each state.

Ct. 97.\n'An act to enable the peol e of Wisconsin Territory to form a Constitution and state government, and for the admission of such state into the Union,' approved August 6, 1846 (9 Stat. 56, c. 89), described the boundary in part as follows:\n\n'Thence [with the northwesterly boundary of Michigan] down the main channel of the Montreal river to the middle of Lake Superior; thence [ westwardly] through the center of Lake Superior to the mouth of the St. Louis river; thence up the main channel \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 276]\n\u00a0\n of said river to the first rapids in the same, above the Indian village, according to Nicollet's map; thence due south to the main branch of the River St. Croix,' etc.\n\n With the boundaries described by the Enabling Act, Wisconsin entered the Union May 29, 1848 (9 Stat. 233, c. 50).\n'An act to authorize the people of the territory of Minnesota to form a Constitution and state government, preparatory to their admission in the Union,' approved February 26, 1857 (11 Stat. 166, c. 60), specifies a portion of the boundary thus:\n\n'Thence by a due south line to the north line of the state of Iowa; thence east along the northern boundary of said state to the main channel of the Mississippi river; thence up the main channel of said river, and following the boundary line of the state of Wisconsin, until the same intersects the St. Louis river; thence down said river to and through Lake Superior, on the boundary line of Wisconsin and Michigan, until it intersects the dividing line between the United States and the British possessions.'\n\n With boundaries as therein described, Minnesota became a state May 11, 1858 (11 Stat. 285, c. 31).\n The present controversy arises from conflicting interpretations of the words:\n'Thence [westwardly] through the center of Lake Superior to the mouth of the St. Louis river; thence up the main channel of said river to the first rapids in the same, above the Indian village, according to Nicollet's map.'\n\n The situation disclosed by an accurate survey gives much room for differences concerning the location of the 'mouth of the St. Louis river' and 'the main channel of said river.' Nicollet's map of the 'Hydrographical Basin of the Upper Mississippi River,' published in 1843, and drawn upon a scale of 1: 1,200,000-approximately 20 miles to the inch- is too small either to reveal or to give material aid in solving the difficulties. A sketch from it-approximately on original scale-is printed on the next page. \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 277]\n\u00a0\n During 1823-1825 Lieut.

A chart compiled from data so obtained (1:49,300-4,108 feet to the inch) and published in 1828, shows the general configuration and lays the proper sailing course southward of \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 278]\n\u00a0\n Big Island. Prior to 1865 this was the only available chart, and navigators often used it.\n The first accurate map of these waters was drawn from surveys and soundings made under direction of Capt. George W. Meade in 1861, and is now on file in the Lake Survey Office at Detroit. After being reduced one- half-to a scale of 1: 32,000 or approximately two inches to a mile-it was engraved and published in 1865 or 1866. Known as the Meade Chart, this reproduction is accepted by both parties as adequately disclosing conditions existing in 1846. A rough sketch based upon the chart-about one- third of its size-and also a photographic reproduction of a portion of the original map, are printed on succeeding pages.\n Minnesota and Wisconsin Points are low narrow strips of sand-the former 6 miles in length, the latter approximately 3. Between them there is a narrow opening known as 'The Entry,' and inside lies a bay (Allouez and Superior) 9 miles long and a mile and a half wide. A narrow channel between Rice's Point and Connor's Point leads into Lower St. Louis Bay, approximately a mile and a half wide and 3 miles long. Passing south of Grassy Point, another channel leads into irregular shaped Upper St. Loui Bay, with Big Island at its southwesterly end. Southeast of this island begin the well-defined banks, deep narrow channel, and obvious current characteristic of a true river; these continue through many windings to the falls above the Indian village noted on Nicollet's Map.\n Meade's Chart indicates: A depth of not over 8 feet across the bar at 'The Entry'; a deep channel through Superior Bay; rather shallow water, with a ruling depth of 8 feet, in Lower St. Louis Bay; 8 feet of water on a fairly direct course, about a mile in length, from the deep channel south of Grassy Point and east of Fisherman's Island to the deep water immediately westward of the \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 279]\n\u00a0\n bar, about seven-eighths of a mile northeast of Big Island. It further discloses a curving channel along the west side of Grassy Point, and thence close to the Minnesota shore and around Big Island, with a depth of 15 or more feet, except at the bar, where there are only 10, possibly 8, feet. To the south of Big Island lies the well-known and formerly much- used course indicated on Lieut. Bayfield's Map.\n The level of the water within all the bays is substantially the same as in Lake Superior; such current as exists flows in opposite directions, according to the wind and movement within the take. The shores are irregular and much indented.\n Since 1893 the United States have dredged a 22 foot channel through Upper St. Louis Bay and around Grassy Point; thence through Lower St. Louis Bay (where there are two branches) and between Rice's and Connor's Points; thence through Superior Bay to 'The Entry' and into the lake. Extensive docks have been constructed from the Minnesota shore in both the upper and lower bays; those extending southwest from Grassy Point cross the boundary claimed by Wisconsin. The general situation of 1846 continued until long after 1861, but during the last 30 years extensive improvements required for a large and busy harbor have produced great changes.\n The complainant maintains that within the true intendment of the statute the 'mouth of the St. Louis river' is southeast of Big Island, where end the banks, channel, and current characteristic of a river and lake features begin. On the other hand, the defendant insists, and we think correctly, that such mouth is at the junction of Lake Superior and the deep channel between Minnesota and Wisconsin Points-'The Entry.'\n It is unnecessary to specify the many facts and circumstances, historical and otherwise, which lead to the conclusion stated. They seem adequate, notwithstanding \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 280]\n\u00a0\n some troublesome objections based upon the peculiar hydrographic conditions.\n Treating 'The Entry' as the mouth of the St. Louis river, where is the line 'thence up the main channel of said river to the first rapids,' etc.? This must be determined upon consideration of the situation existing in 1846, whcih the parties admit remained substantially unchanged until after the Meade survey. No alterations now material have come about through accretion or erosion.\n The line through Superior Bay is not here called in question. But let it be noted that no vessel drawing more than 8 feet could have passed into that bay from Lake Superior, that within 'The Entry' there were only small boats of light draft, and that navigation long remained rather primitive.\n Lower St. Louis Bay was shallow, with a ruling depth of 8 feet, and had no welldefined channel. From the deep water at the southern tip of Grassy Point a vessel drawing less than 8 feet bound north of Big Island and beyond could have turned northwest and followed the narrow winding channel near the Minnesota shore with a ruling depth of 10, possibly 8, feet, or it could have proceeded westward, approximately one mile, over a more direct course with a depth of 8 feet or more, until it came to the deeper channel about seven-eighths of a mile northeast of Big Island. This latter course is indicated by the red trace 'A, B, C,' on Minnesota's Exhibit No. 1-Meades Chart. For many years officers and representatives of both states regarded the boundary as on or near this line; and, considering all the circumstances, we think it must be accepted as the main channel within intendment of the statute. No current controlled navigation, and vessels proceeding in opposite directions followed the same general course.\n Both parties say that in 1846--\n'practically all of Upper and Lower St. Louis Bays between the shores were navigable \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 281]\n\u00a0\n for such vessels as were accustomed to use said bays at said time for the purpose of navigation, and there was no defined course, or channel, in said bays, which said vessels followed, but, owing to the depth of the water, they were permitted and accustomed to travel across said bays in any direction.'\n\n For very many years subsequent to 1846 there were no vessels with 8- foot draft upon these waters, and probably none of such size regularly plied there until 1890 or later.\n The course south of big Island shown on the Bayfield Map was never accepted as the boundary, and need not be further considered. Wisconsin's claim to that island is not denied.\n Manifestly, from the description heretofore given, the waters between Big Island and Lake Superior were broad sheets, without any definite uninterrupted deep channel extending throughout their entire length; also there was no steady, controlling current. Such vessels as plied there in 1846 and long thereafter moved with freedom in different directions. The evidence convinces us that, as navigation gradually increased prior to 1890, the northerly course in Upper St. Louis Bay commonly followed by vessels going to or coming from points above Big Island was not along the narrow curving channel skirting Grassy Point, but over the shorter one near the middle of the bay.\n This court approved the doctrine of Thalweg, as opposed to the physical middle line, in Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 U.S. 1\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 239, and has adhered thereto. Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 U.S. 1\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 408, 571; Washington v. Oregon, \n211 U.S. 127\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 47; Id., \n214 U.S. 205\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 631; Arkansas v. Tennessee, \n246 U.S. 158\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 301, L. R. A. 1918D, 258.\n'When a navigable river constitutes the boundary between two independent states, tht line defining the point at which the jurisdiction of the two separates is well established to be the middle of the main channel of the stream. The interest of each state in the navigation of the river admits \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 282]\n\u00a0\n of no other line. The preservation by each of its equal right in the navigation of the stream is the subject of paramount interest. ... Thus the jurisdiction of each state extends to the thread of the stream, that is, to the 'mid-channel,' and, if there be several channels, to the middle of the principal one, or, rather, the one usually followed.' Iowa v. Illinois, supra, \n147 \nU.S. 7, 13\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 241, 243.\n\n'As to boundary lakes and landlocked seas, where there is no necessary track of navigation, the line of demarcation is drawn in the middle, and this is true of narrow straits separating the lands of two different states.' Louisiana v. Mississippi, supra, \n202 U.S. 50\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 421.\n\n The doctrine of Thalweg, a modification of the more ancient principle, which required equal division of territory, was adopted in order to preserve to each state equality of right in the beneficial use of the stream as a means of communication. Accordingly, the middle of the principal channel of navigation is commonly accepted as the boundary. Equality in the beneficial use often would be defeated, rather than promoted, by fixing the boundary on a given line merely because it connects points of greatest depth. Deepest water and the principal navigable channel are not necessarily the same. The rule has direct reference to actual or probable use in the ordinary course, and common experience shows that vessel do not follow a narrow crooked channel, close to shore, however deep, when they can proceed on a safer and more direct one with sufficient water.\n As we view the whole record, the claim of Wisconsin cannot prevail, unless the doctrine of Thalweg requires us to say that the main channel is the deepest one. So to apply it here would defeat its fundamental purpose. The ruling depth in the waters below Upper Bay was 8 feet, and practically this limited navigation to vessels of no greater draft. For these there was abundant water near the middle line. Under such circumstances \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 283]\n\u00a0\n Minnesota would be deprived of equality of right both in navigation and to the surface, if the boundary line were drawn near its shore.\n A decree will be entered, declaring and adjudging as follows: That the boundary line between the two states must be ascertained upon a consideration of the situation existing in 1846 and accurately disclosed by the Meade Chart. That when traced on this chart the boundary runs midway between Rice's Point and Connor's Point, and through the middle of Lower St. Louis Bay to and with the deep channel leading into Upper St. Louis Bay, and to a point therein immediately south of the southern extremity of Grassy Point; thence westward along the most direct course, through water not less than 8 feet deep, eastward of Fisherman's Island and as indicated by the red trace 'A, B, C,' on Minnesota's Exhibit No. 1, approximately one mile, to the deep channel and immediately west of the bar therein; thence with such channel north and west of Big Island up stream to the falls.\n Within 30 days counsel may present a proper decree for carrying this opinion into effect. The costs will be equally divided between the states.\n It seems appropriate to repeat the suggestion, made in Washington v. Oregon, supra, \n214 \nU.S. 217, 218\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 631, that the parties endeavor with consent of Congress to adjust their boundaries.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS concurs in the result. \n\n[252 U.S. 273, 284]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 273, 285]\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","148":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF MISSOURI v.

United States v. Thompson (D. C.) 258 Fed. 257; United States v. Rockefeller (D. C.) 260 Fed. 346. The State appeals.\n On December 8, 1916, a treaty between the United States and Great Britain was proclaimed by the President. It recited that many species of birds in their annual migrations traversed many parts of the United States and of Canada, that they were of great value as a source of food and in destroying insects injurious to vegetation, but were in danger of extermination through lack of adequate protection. It therefore provided for specified closed seasons and protection in other forms, and agreed that the two powers would take or propose to their lawmaking bodies the necessary mes ures for carrying the treaty out. 39 Stat. 1702. The above mentioned act of July 3, 1918, entitled an act to give effect to the convention, prohibited the killing, capturing or selling any of the migratory birds included in the terms of the treaty except as permitted by regulations compatible with those terms, to be made by \n\n[252 U.S. 416, 432]\n\u00a0\n the Secretary of Agriculture. Regulations were proclaimed on July 31, and October 25, 1918. 40 Stat. 1812, 1863. It is unnecessary to go into any details, because, as we have said, the question raised is the general one whether the treaty and statute are void as an interference with the rights reserved to the States.\n To answer this question it is not enough to refer to the Tenth Amendment, reserving the powers not delegated to the United States, because by Article 2, Section 2, the power to make treaties is delegated expressly, and by Article 6 treaties made under the authority of the United States, along with the Constitution and laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, are declared the supreme law of the land. If the treaty is valid there can be no dispute about the validity of the statute under Article 1, Section 8, as a necessary and proper means to execute the powers of the Government. The language of the Constitution as to the supremacy of treaties being general, the question before us is narrowed to an inquiry into the ground upon which the present supposed exception is placed.\n It is said that a treaty cannot be valid if it infringes the Constitution, that there are limits, therefore, to the treaty-making power, and that one such limit is that what an act of Congress could not do unaided, in derogation of the powers reserved to the States, a treaty cannot do. An earlier act of Congress that attempted by itself and not in pursuance of a treaty to regulate the killing of migratory birds within the States had been held bad in the District Court. United States v. Shauver, 214 Fed. 154. United States v. McCullagh, 221 Fed. 288. Those decisions were supported by arguments that migratory birds were owned by the States in their sovereign capacity for the benefit of their people, and that under cases like Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 U.S. 519\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 600, this control was one that Congress had no power to displace. The same argument is supposed to apply now with equal force. \n\n[252 U.S. 416, 433]\n\u00a0\n Whether the two cases cited were decided rightly or not they cannot be accepted as a test of the treaty power. Acts of Congress are the supreme law of the land only when made in pursuance of the Constitution, while treaties are declared to be so when made under the authority of the United States. It is open to question whether the authority of the United States means more than the formal acts prescribed to make the convention. We do not mean to imply that there are no qualifications to the treaty- making power; but they must be ascertained in a different way. It is obvious that there may be matters of the sharpest exigency for the national well being that an act of Congress could not deal with but that a treaty followed by such an act could, and it is not lightly to be assumed that, in matters requiring national action, 'a power which must belong to and somewhere reside in every civilized government' is not to be found. Andrews v. Andrews, \n188 \nU.S. 14, 33\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 237. What was said in that case with regard to the powers of the States applies with equal force to the powers of the nation in cases where the States individually are incompetent to act. We are not yet discussing the particular case before us but only are considering the validity of the test proposed. With regard to that we may add that when we are dealing with words that also are a constituent act, like the Constitution of the United States, we must realize that they have called into life a being the development of which could not have been foreseen completely by the most gifted of its begetters. It was enough for them to realize or to hope that they had created an organism; t has taken a century and has cost their successors much sweat and blood to prove that they created a nation. The case before us must be considered in the light of out whole experience and not merely in that of what was said a hundred years ago. The treaty in question does not contravene any prohibitory words to be found in the Constitution. The only question is whether \n\n[252 U.S. 416, 434]\n\u00a0\n it is forbidden by some invisible radiation from the general terms of the Tenth Amendment. We must consider what this country has become in deciding what that amendment has reserved.\n The State as we have intimated founds its claim of exclusive authority upon an assertion of title to migratory birds, an assertion that is embodied in statute. No doubt it is true that as between a State and its inhabitants the State may regulate the killing and sale of such birds, but it does not follow that its authority is exclusive of paramount powers. To put the claim of the State upon title is to lean upon a slender reed. Wild birds are not in the possession of anyone; and possession is the beginning of ownership. The whole foundation of the State's rights is the presence within their jurisdiction of birds that yesterday had not arrived, tomorrow may be in another State and in a week a thousand miles away. If we are to be accurate we cannot put the case of the State upon higher ground than that the treaty deals with creatures that for the moment are within the state borders, that it must be carried out by officers of the United States within the same territory, and that but for the treaty the State would be free to regulate this subject itself.\n As most of the laws of the United States are carried out within the States and as many of them deal with matters which in the silence of such laws the State might regulate, such general grounds are not enough to support Missouri's claim. Valid treaties of course 'are as binding within the territorial limits of the States as they are elsewhere throughout the dominion of the United States.' Baldwin v. Franks, \n120 \nU.S. 678, 683\n, 7 S. Sup. Ct. 656, 657. No doubt the great body of private relations usually fall within the control of the State, but a treaty may override its power. We do not have to invoke the later developments of constitutional law for this proposition; it was recognized as early as Hopkirk v. Bell, 3 Cranch, 454, with regard to statutes \n\n[252 U.S. 416, 435]\n\u00a0\n of limitation, and even earlier, as to confiscation, in Ware v. Hylton, 3 Dall. 199. It was assumed by Chief Justice Marshall with regard to the escheat of land to the State in Chirac v. Chirac, 2 Wheat. 259, 275; Hauenstein v. Lynham, \n100 U.S. 483\n; DeGeofroy v. Riggs, \n133 U.S. 258\n, 10 Sup. Ct. 295; Blythe v. Hinckley, \n180 \nU.S. 333, 340\n, 21 S. Sup. Ct. 390. So as to a limited jurisdiction of foreign consuls within a State. Wildenhus' Case, \n120 U.S. 1\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 385. See Ross v. McIntyre, \n140 U.S. 453\n, 11 Sup. Ct. 897. Further illustration seems unnecessary, and it only remains to consider the application of established rules to the present case.\n Here a national interest of very nearly the first magnitude is involved. It can be protected only by national action in concert with that of another power. The subject matter is only transitorily within the State and has no permanent habitat therein. But for the treaty and the statute there soon might be no birds for any powers to deal with. We see nothing in the Constitution that compels the Government to sit by while a food supply is cut off and the protectors of our forests and our crops are destroyed. It is not sufficient to rely upon the States. The reliance is vain, and were it otherwise, the question is whether the United States is forbidden to act. We are of opinion that the treaty and statute must be upheld. Carey v. South Dakota, \n250 U.S. 118\n, 39 Sup.

Mr. Solicitor General King and Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for appellees.\n\n\n[253 U.S. 350, 384]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER announced the conclusions of the Court.\n Power to amend the Constitution was reserved by article 5, which reads:\n'The Congress, whenever two-thirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose Amendments to this Constitution, or, on the Application of the Legislatures \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 385]\n\u00a0\n of two-thirds of the several States, shall call a Convention for proposing Amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all Intents and Purposes, as Part of this Constitution, when ratified by the Legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, or by Conventions in three-fourths thereof, as the one or the other Mode of Ratification may be proposed by the Congress; Provided that no Amendment which may be made prior to the Year One thousand eight hundred and eight shall in any Manner affect the first and fourth Clauses in the Ninth Section of the first Article; and that no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate.'\n\n The text of the Eighteenth Amendment, proposed by Congress in 1917 and proclaimed as ratified in 1919 (40 Stat. 1050, 1941), is as follows:\n'Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.\n\n'Sec. 2. The Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\n\n We here are concerned with seven cases involving the validity of that amendment and of certain general features of the National Prohibition Law, known as the Volstead Act, c. 85, Acts 66th Cong., 1st Sess. (41 Stat. 305 ), which was adopted to enforce the amendment. The relief sought in each case is an injunction against the ee cution of that act. Two of the cases- Nos. 29 and 30, original,-were brought in this court, and the others in District Courts. Nos. 696, 752, 788, and 837 are here on appeals from decrees refusing injunctions, and No. 794 from a decree granting an injunction. The cases have been elaborately argued at the bar and in \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 386]\n\u00a0\n printed briefs; and the arguments have been attentively considered, with the result that we reach and announce the following conclusions on the questions involved:\n\n 1. \nThe adoption by both houses of Congress, each by a two-thirds vote, of a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution sufficiently shows that the proposal was deemed necessary by all who voted for it. An express declaration that they regarded it as necessary is not essential. None of the resolutions whereby prior amendments were proposed contained such a declaration.\n\n 2. \nThe two-thirds vote in each house which is required in proposing an amendment is a vote of two-thirds of the members present-assuming the presence of a quorum-and not a vote of two-thirds of the entire membership, present and absent. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Kansas, \n248 U.S. 276\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 93, 2 A. L. R. 1589\n\n\n 3. The referendum provisions of state Constitutions and statutes cannot be applied, consistently with the Constitution of the United States, in the ratification or rejection of amendments to it. Hawke v. Smith, \n253 U.S. 221\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 495, 64 L. Ed. --, decided June 1, 1920.\n\n 4. \nThe prohibition of the manufacture, sale, transportation, importation and exportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, as embodied in the Eighteenth Amendment, is within the power to amend reserved by article 5 of the Constitution.\n\n 5. \nThat amendment, by lawful proposal and ratification, has become a part of the Constitution, and must be respected and given effect the same as other provisions of that instrument.\n\n 6. \nThe first section of the amendment-the one embodying the prohibition-is operative throughout the entire territorial limits of the United States, binds all legislative bodies, courts, public officers and individuals within those limits, and of its own force invalidates every \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 387]\n\u00a0\n legislative act, whether by Congress, by a state Legislature, or by a territorial assembly, which authorizes or sanctions what the section prohibits.\n\n 7. \nThe second section of the amendment-the one declaring 'The Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation'-does not enable Congress or the several states to defeat or thwart the prohibition, but only to enforce it by appropriate means.\n\n 8. \nThe words 'concurrent power,' in that section, do not mean joint power, or require that legislation thereunder by Congress, to be effective, shall be approved or sanctioned by the several states or any of them; nor do they mean that the power to enforce is divided between Congress and the several states along the lines which separate or distinguish foreign and interstate commerce from intrastate affairs.\n\n 9. \nThe power confided to Congress by that section, while not exclusive, is territorially coextensive with the prohibition of the first section, embraces manufacture and other intrastate transactions as well as importation, exportation and interstate traffic, and is in no wise dependent on or affected by action or inaction on the part of the several states or any of them.\n 10. That power may be exerted against the disposal for beverage purposes of liquors manufactured before the amendment became effective just as it may be against subsequent manufacture for those purposes. In either case it is a constitutional mandate or prohibition that is being enforced.\n 11. While recognizing that there are limits beyond which Congress cannot go in treating beverages as within its power of enforcement, we think those limits are not transcended by the provision of the Volstead Act (title 2,  1), wherein liquors containing as much as one-half of 1 perc ent. of alcohol by volume and fit for use for beverage \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 388]\n\u00a0\n purposes are treated as within that power. Jacob Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 U.S. 264\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 141, 64 L. Ed. --.\n Giving effect to these conclusions, we dispose of the cases as follows:\n In Nos. 29 and 30, original, the bills are dismissed.\n In No. 794, the decree is reversed.\n In Nos. 696, 752, 788 and 837, the decrees are affirmed.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE concurring.\n I profoundly regret that in a case of this magnitude, affecting as it does an amendment to the Constitution dealing with the powers and duties of the national and state governments, and intimately concerning the welfare of the whole people, the court has deemed it proper to state only ultimate conclusions without an exposition of the reasoning by which they have been reached.\n I appreciate the difficulties which a solution of the cases involve and the solicitude with which the court has approached them, but it seems to my mind that the greater the perplexities the greater the duty devolving upon me to express the reasons which have led me to the conclusion that the amendment accomplishes and was intended to accomplish the purposes now attributed to it in the propositions concerning that subject which the court has just announced and in which I concur. Primarily in doing this I notice various contentions made concerning the proper construction of the provisions of the amendment which I have been unable to accept, in order that by contrast they may add cogency to the statement of the understanding I have of the amendment.\n The amendment, which is reproduced in the announcement for the court, contains three numbered paragraphs or sections, two of which only need be noticed. The first prohibits--\n'the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 389]\n\u00a0\n or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes.'\n\n The second is as follows:\n'Sec. 2. The Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\n\n\n 1. \nIt is contended that the result of these provisions is to require concurrent action of Congress and the states in enforcing the prohibition of the first section and hence that in the absence of such concurrent action by Congress and the states no enforcing legislation can exist, and therefore until this takes place the prohibition of the first section is a dead letter. But in view of the manifest purpose of the first section to apply and make efficacious the prohibition, and of the second to deal with the methods of carrying out that purpose, I cannot accept this interpretation, since it would result simply in declaring that the provisions of the second section, avowedly enacted to provide means for carrying out the first, must be so interpreted as to practically nullify the first.\n\n 2. \nIt is said, conceding that the concurrent power given to Congress and to the states does not as a prerequisite exact the concurrent action of both, it nevertheless contemplates the possibility of action by Congress and by the states and makes each action effective, but as under the Constitution the authority of Congress in enforcing the Constitution is paramount, when state legislation and congressional action conflict the state legislation yields to the action of Congress as controlling. But as the power of both Congress and the states in this instance is given by the Constitution in one and the same provision, I again find myself unable to accept the view urged because it ostensibly accepts the constitutional mandate as to the concurrence of the two powers and proceeds immediately by way of interpretation to destroy it by making one paramount over the other.\n\n 3. \nThe proposition is that the concurrent powers conferred \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 390]\n\u00a0\n upon Congress and the states are not subject to conflict because their exertion is authorized within differet areas, that is, by Congress within the field of federal authority, and by the states within the sphere of state power, hence leaving the states free within their jurisdiction to determine separately for themselves what, within reasonable limits, is an intoxicating liquor, and to Congress the same right within the sphere of its jurisdiction. But the unsoundness of this more plausible contention seems to me at once exposed by directing attention to the fact that in a case where no state legislation was enacted there would be no prohibition, thus again frustrating the first section by a construction affixed to the second. It is no answer to suggest that a regulation by Congress would in such event be operative in such a state, since the basis of the distinction upon which the argument rests is that the concurrent power conferred upon Congress is confined to the area of its jurisdiction and therefore is not operative within a state.\n Comprehensively looking at all these contentions, the confusion and contradiction to which they lead, serve in my judgment to make it certain that it cannot possibly be that Congress and the states entered into the great and important business of amending the Constitution in a matter so vitally concerning all the people solely in order to render governmental action impossible, or, if possible, to so define and limit it as to cause it to be productive of no results and to frustrate the obvious intent and general purpose contemplated. It is true indeed that the mere words of the second section tend to these results, but if they be read in the light of the cardinal rule which compels a consideration of the context in view of the situation and the subject with which the amendment dealt and the purpose which it was intended to accomplish, the confusion will be seen to be only apparent.\n In the first place, it is indisputable, as I have stated, \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 391]\n\u00a0\n that the first section imposes a general prohibition which it was the purpose to make universally and uniformly operative and efficacious. In the second place, as the prohibition did not define the intoxicating beverages which it prohibited, in the absence of anything to the contrary, it clearly, from the very fact of its adoption, cast upon Congress the duty, not only of defining the prohibited beverages, but also of enacting such regulations and sanctions as were essential to make them operative when defined. In the third place, when the second section is considered with these truths in mind it becomes clear that it simply manifests a like purpose to adjust, as far as possible, the exercise of the new powers cast upon Congress by the amendment to the dual system of government existing under the Constitution. In other words, dealing with the new prohibition created by the Constitution, operating throughout the length and breadth of the United States, without reference to state lines or the distinctions between state and federal power, and contemplating the exercise by Congress of the duty cast upon it to make the prohibition efficacious, it was sought by the second section to unite national and state administrative agencies in giving effect to the amendment and the legislation of Congress enacted to make it completely operative.\n Mark the relation of the text to this view, since the power which it gives to state and nation is, not to construct or perfect or cause the amendment to be completely operative, but as already made completely operative, to enforce it. Observe also the words of the grant which confines the concurrent power given to legislation appropriate to the purpose of enforcement.\n I take it that if the second section of the article did not exist no one would gainsay that the first section in and of itself granted the power and imposed the duty upon Congress to legislate to the end that by definition and sanction the amendment would become fully operative. This being \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 392]\n\u00a0\n true it would follow, if the contentions under consideration were sustained, that the second section gv e the states the power to nullify the first section, since a refusal of a state to define and sanction would again result in no amendment to be enforced in such refusing state.\n Limiting the concurrent power to enforce given by the second section to the purposes which I have attributed to it, that is, to the subjects appropriate to execute the amendment as defined and sanctioned by Congress, I assume that it will not be denied that the effect of the grant of authority was to confer upon both Congress and the states power to do things which otherwise there would be no right to do. This being true, I submit that no reason exists for saying that a grant of concurrent power to Congress and the states to give effect to, that is, to carry out or enforce, the amendment as defined and sanctioned by Congress, should be interpreted to deprive Congress of the power to create, by definition and sanction, an enforceable amendment.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurring.\n I do not dissent from the disposition of these causes as ordered by the court, but confine my concurrence to that. It is impossible now to say with fair certainty what construction should be given to the Eighteenth Amendment. Because of the bewilderment which it creates, a multitude of questions will inevitably arise and demand solution here. In the circumstances I prefer to remain free to consider these questions when they arrive.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA, dissenting.\n This case is concerned with the Eighteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, its validity and construction. In order to have it, and its scope in attention, I quote it: \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 393]\n\u00a0\n 'Section 1. After one year from the ratification of this article the manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States and all territory subject to the jurisdiction thereof for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited.\n'Sec. 2. The Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\n\n The court in applying it has dismissed certain of the bills, reversed the decree in one, and affirmed the decrees in four others. I am unable to agree with the judgment reversing No. 794 and affirming Nos. 752, 696, 788, and 837.\n I am, however, at a loss how or to what extent to express the grounds for this action. The court declares conclusions only, without giving any reasons for them. The instance may be wise-establishing a precedent now, hereafter wisely to be imitated. It will undoubtedly decrease the literature of the court if it does not increase its lucidity. However, reasons for the conclusions have been omitted, and my comment upon them may come from a misunderstanding of them, their present import and ultimate purpose and force.\n There are, however, clear declarations that the Eighteenth Amendment is part of the Constitution of the United States, made so in observance of the prescribed constitutional procedure, and has become part of the Constitution of the United States, to be respected and given effect like other provisions of that instrument. With these conclusions I agree.\n Conclusions 4, 5, and 6 seem to assert the undisputed. I neither assent to them or dissent from them except so far as I shall presently express.\n Conclusion 7 seems an unnecessary declaration. It may, however, be considered as supplementary to some other declaration. My only comment is that I know of no \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 394]\n\u00a0\n intimation in the case that section 2 in conferring concurrent power on Congress and the states to enforce the prohibition of the first section, conferred a power to defeat or obstruct prohibition. Of course, the power was conferred as a means to enforce the prohibition and was made concurrent to engage the resources and instrumentalities of the nation and the states. The power was conferred for use, not for abuse.\n Conclusions 8 and 9, as I view them, are complements of each other, and express, with a certai verbal detail, the power of Congress and the states over the liquor traffic, using the word in its comprehensive sense as including the production of liquor, its transportation within the states, its exportation from them, and its importation into them. In a word, give power over the liquor business from producer to consumer, prescribe the quality of latter's beverage. Certain determining elements are expressed. It is said that the words 'concurrent power' of section 2 do not mean joint power in Congress and the states, nor the approval by the states of congressional legislation, nor its dependency upon state action or inaction.\n I cannot confidently measure the force of the declarations or the deductions that are, or can be made from them. They seem to be regarded as sufficient to impel the conclusion that the Volstead Act is legal legislation and operative throughout the United States. But are there no opposing considerations, no conditions upon its operation? And what of conflicts, and there are conflicts, and more there may be, between it and state legislation? The conclusions of the court do not answer the questions and yet they are submitted for decision; and their importance appeals for judgment upon them. It is to be remembered states are litigants as well as private citizens, the former presenting the rights of the states, the latter seeking protection against the asserted aggression of the act in controversy. And there is opposing state legislation, why not a decision \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 395]\n\u00a0\n upon it? Is it on account of the nature of the actions being civil and in equity, the proper forum being a criminal court investigating a criminal charge? There should be some way to avert the necessity or odium of either.\n I cannot pause to enumerate the contentions in the case. Some of them present a question of joint action in Congress and the states, either collectively with all or severally with each. Others assert spheres of the powers, involving no collision, it is said, the powers of Congress and the states being supreme and exclusive within the spheres of their exercise- called by counsel 'historical fields of jurisdiction.' I submit again, they should have consideration and decision.\n The government has felt and exhibited the necessity of such consideration and decision. It knows the conflicts that exist or impend. It desires to be able to meet them, silence them and bring the repose that will come from a distinct declaration and delimitation of the power of Congress and the states. The court, however, thinks otherwise and I pass to the question in the case. It is a simple one, it involves the meaning of a few English words-in what sense they shall be taken, whether in their ordinary sense, or have put upon them an unusual sense.\n Recurring to the first section of the amendment, it will be seen to be a restriction upon state and congressional power, and the deduction from it is that neither the states nor Congress can enact legislation that contravenes its prohibition. And there is no room for controversy as to its requirements. Its prohibition of 'intoxicating liquors' 'for beverage purposes' is absolute. And, as accessory to that prohibition, is the further prohibition of their manufacture, sale or transportation within or their importation into or exportation 'from the United States.' Its prohibition, therefore, is national, and considered alone, the means of its enforcement might be such as Congress, the agency of national power might \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 396]\n\u00a0\n prescribe. But it does not stand alone. Section 2 associates Congress and the states in power to enforce it. Its words are:\n'The Congress and the several states shall have concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.'\n\n What, then, is meant by the words 'concurrent power'? Do they mean united action, or separate and independent action, and, if the actions differ (there is no practical problem unless they differ), shall that of Congress be supreme?\n The government answers that the words mean separate and independent acto n, and, in case of conflict, that of Congress is supreme, and asserts besides, that the answer is sustained by historical and legal precedents. \n1\n I contest the assertions and oppose to them the common usage of our language, and the definitions of our lexicons, \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 397]\n\u00a0\n general and legal. \n2\n Some of the definitions assign to the words 'concurrent power' action in conjunction, contribution of effort, certainly harmony of action, not antagonism. Opposing laws are not concurring laws, and to assert the supremacy of one over the other is to assert the exclusiveness of one over the other, not their concomitance. Such is the result of the government's contention. It does not satisfy the definitions, or the requirement of section 2-'a concurrent power excludes the idea of a dependent power.' Mr. Justice McLean in the Passenger Cases, 7 How. 283, 399.\n Other definitions assign to the words 'existing or happening at the same time,' 'concurring together,' 'coexistent.' These definitions are, as the others are, inconsistent with the government's contention. If coexistence of the power of legislation is given to Congress and the states by section 2, it is given to be coexistently exercised. It is to be remembered that the Eighteenth Amendment was intended to deal with a condition, not a theory, and one demanding something more than exhortation and precept. The habits of a people were to be changed, large business interests were to be disturbed, and it was considered that the change and disturbance could only be effected by punitive and repressive legislation, and it was naturally thought that legislation enacted by 'the Congress and the several states,' by its concurrence would better enforce prohibition and avail for its enforcement the two great divisions of our governmental system, \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 398]\n\u00a0\n the nation and the states, with their influences and instrumentalities.\n From my standpoint, the exposition of the case is concluded by the definition of the words of section 2. There are, however, confirming considr ations; and militating considerations are urged. Among the confirming considerations are the cases of Wedding v. Meyler, \n192 U.S. 573\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 322, 66 L. R. A. 833, and Nielsen v. Oregon, \n212 U.S. 315\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 383, in which 'concurrent jurisdiction' was given respectively to Kentucky and Indiana over the Ohio river by the Virginia Compact, and respectively to Washington and Oregon over the Columbia river by act of Congress. And it was decided that it conferred equality of powers, 'legislative, judicial and executive,' and that neither state could override the legislation of the other. Other courts have given like definitions. 2 Words and Phrases Judicially Defined, p. 1391 et seq.; Bouvier's Dictionary, vol. 1, page 579. Analogy of the word 'concurrent' in private instruments may also be invoked.\n Those cases are examples of the elemental rule of construction that in the exposition of statutes and constitutions, every word 'is to be expounded in its plain, obvious, and common sense, unless the context furnishes some ground to control, qualify or enlarge it,' and there cannot be imposed upon the words 'any recondite meaning or any extraordinary gloss.' 1 Story, Const.  451; Lake County v. Rollins, \n130 U.S. 662\n, 9 Sup. Ct. 651. And it is the rule of reason as well as of technicality, that if the words so expounded be 'plain and clear, and the sense distinct and perfect arising on them' interpretation has nothing to do. This can be asserted of section 2. Its words express no 'double sense,' and should be accepted in their single sense. It has not yet been erected into a legal maxim of constitutional construction, that words were made to conceal thoughts. Besides, when we depart from the words, ambiguity comes. There are as many solutions \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 399]\n\u00a0\n as there are minds considering the section, and out of the conflict, I had almost said chaos, one despairs of finding an undisputed meaning. It may be said that the court, realizing this, by a declaration of conclusions only, has escaped the expression of antithetical views and considered it better not to blaze the trails, though it was believed that they all led to the same destination.\n If it be conceded, however, that to the words 'concurrent power' may be ascribed the meaning for which the government contends, it certainly cannot be asserted that such is their ordinary meaning, and I might leave section 2, and the presumptions that support it, to resist the precedents adduced by the government. I go farther, however, and deny the precedents. The Federalist and certain cases are cited as such. There is ready explanation of both, and neither supports the government's contention. The dual system of government contemplated by the Union encountered controversies, fears, and jealousies that had to be settled or appeased to achieve union, and the Federalist in good and timely sense explained to what extent the 'alienation of state sovereignty' would be necessary to 'national sovereignty,' constituted by the 'consolidation of the states,' and the powers that would be surrendered, and those that would be retained. And the explanation composed the controversies and allayed the fears of the states that their local powers of government would not be displaced by the dominance of a centralized control. And this court after union had been achieved, fulfilled the assurances of the explanation and adopted its distribution of powers, designating them as follows: (1) Powers that were exclusive in the states-reserved to them; (2) powers that were exclusive in Congress, conferred upon it; (3) powers that were not exclusive in either, and hence said to be 'concurrent.' And it was decided that, when exercised by Congress, they were supreme-'the authority of the states then retires' to inaction. \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 400]\n\u00a0\n To understand them, it must be especially observed that their emphasis was, as the fundamental principle of the new government was, that it had no powers that were not conferred upon it,a nd that all other powers were reserved to the states. And this necessarily must not be absent from our minds, whether construing old provisions of the Constitution or amendments to it or laws passed under the amendments.\n The government nevertheless contends that the decisions (they need not be cited) constitute precedents for its construction of section 2 of the Eighteenth Amendment. In other words, the government contends (or must so contend for its reasoning must bear the test of the generalization) that it was decided that in all cases where the powers of Congress are concurrent with those of the states, they are supreme as incident to concurrence. The contention is not tenable; it overlooks the determining consideration. The powers of Congress were not decided to be supreme because they were concurrent with powers in the states, but because of their source, their source being the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance of the Constitution, as against the source of the powers of the states, their source being the Constitution and laws of the states, the Constitution and laws of the United States being made by article 6 the supreme law of the land, 'any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 426.\n This has example in other powers of soverignty that the states and Congress possess. In McCulloch v. Maryland, at pages 425, 430 of 4 Wheat. ( 4 L. Ed. 579), Chief Justice Marshall said that the power of taxation retained by the states was not abridged by the granting of a similar power to the government of the Union, and that it was to be concurrently exercised, and these truths, it was added, had never been denied, and that there was no 'clashing sovereignty' from incompatibility of right. And, necessarily, a concurrence \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 401]\n\u00a0\n of power in the states and Congress excludes the idea of supremacy in either. Therefore, neither principle nor precedent sustains the contention that section 2 by giving concurrent power to Congress and the states, gave Congress supreme power over the states. I repeat the declaration of Mr. Justice McLean:\n'A concurrent power excludes the idea of a dependent power.'\n\n It is, however, suggested (not by the government that if Congress is not supreme upon the considerations urged by the government, it is made supreme by article 6 of the Constitution. The article is not applicable. It is not a declaration of the supremacy of one provision of the Constitution or laws of the United States over another, but of the supremacy of the Constitution and laws of the United States over the Constitutions and laws of the states. Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 209, 211; Sec. 1838 et seq.; 2 Story, Const., 5th Ed.\n The Eighteenth Amendment is part of the Constitution of the United States, therefore of as high sanction as article 6. There seems to be a denial of this, based on article 5. That article provides that the amendments proposed by either of the ways there expressed 'shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of this Constitution.' Some undefinable power is attributed to this in connection with article 6, as if article 5 limits in some way, or defeats, an amendment to the Constitution inconsistent with a previously existing provision. Of course, the immediate answer is that an amendment is made to change a previously existing provision. What other purpose could an amendment have and it would be nullified by the mythical power attributed to article 5, either alone or in conjunction with article 6? A contention that ascribes such power to those articles is untenable. The Eighteenth Amendment is part of the Constitution and as potent as any other part of it. Section 2, therefore, is a new provision of Power, power to the \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 402]\n\u00a0\n states as well as to Congress, and it is a contradiction to say that a power constitutionally concurrent in Congress and the states, in some way becomes constitutionally subordinate in the states to Congress.\n If it be said that the states got no power over prohibition that they did not have before, it cannot be said that it was not preserved to them by the amendment, notwithstanding the policy of prohibition was made national, and besides, there was a gift of power to Congress that it did not have before, a gift of a right to be exercised within state lines, but with the limitation or condition that the powers of the states should remain with the states and be participated in by Congress only in concurrence with the states, and thereby preserved from abuse by either, or exercise to the detriment to prohibition. There was, however, a power given to the states, a power over importations. This power was subject to concurrence with Congress and had the same safeguards.\n This construction of section 2 is enforced by other considerations. If the supremacy of Congress had been intended it would have been directly declared as in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. And such was the condition when the amendment left the Senate. The precedent of preceding amendments was followed, there was a single declaration of jurisdiction in Congress.\n Section 2 was amended in the House upon recommendation of the Judiciary Committee and the provision giving concurrent power to Congress and to the states was necessarily estimated and intended to be additive of something. The government's contention makes it practically an addition of nothing but words, in fact denuding it of function, making it a gift of impotence, not one of power to be exercised independently of Congress or concurrently with Congress, or, indeed, at all. Of this there can be no contradiction, for what power is assigned to the states to legislate if the legislation be immediately \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 403]\n\u00a0\n superseded-indeed, as this case shows, is possibly forestalled and precluded by the power exercised in the Volstead Act. And meaningless is the difference the government suggests between concurrent power and concurrent legislation. A power is given to be exercised, and we are cast into helpless and groping bewilderment in trying to think of it apart from its exercise or the effect of its exercise. The addition to section 2 was a conscious adaptation of means to the purpose. It changed the relation between the states and the national government. The lines of exclusive power in one or the other were removed, and equality and community of powers substituted.\n There is a suggestion, not made by the government, though assisting its contention, that section 2 was a gift of equal power to Congress and to the states, not, however, to be concurrently exercised, but to be separately exercised; conferred and to be exercised is the suggestion, to guard against neglect in either Congress or the states, the inactivity of the one being supplied by the activity of the other. But there again we encounter the word 'concurrent' and its inexorable requirement of coincident or united action, not alternative or emergent action to safeguard against the delinquency of Congress or the states. If, however, such neglect was to be apprehended, it is strange that the framers of section 2, with the whole vocabulary of the language to draw upon, selected words that expressed the opposite of what the framers meant. In other words, expressed concurrent action instead of substitute action. I cannot assent. I believe they meant what they said and that they must be taken at their word.\n The government with some consciousness that its contention requires indulgence or excuse, but at any rate in recognition of the insufficiency of its contention to satisfy the words of section 2, makes some concessions to the states. They are, however, not very tangible to measurement. They seem to yield a power of legislation to the states \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 404]\n\u00a0\n and a power of jurisdiction to their courts, but almost at the very instant of concession, the power and jurisdiction are declared to be without effect.\n I am not, therefore, disposed to regard the concessions seriously. They cn fuse-'make not light, but darkness, visible.' Of what use is a concession of power to the states to enact laws which cannot be enforced? Of what use a concession of jurisdiction to the courts of the states when their judgments cannot be executed, indeed the very law upon which it is exercised may be declared void in an antagonistic jurisdiction exerted in execution of an antagonistic power?3 And equally worthless is the analogy that the government assays between the power of the national government and the power of the states to criminally punish violations of their respective sovereignties, as, for instance, in counterfeiting cases. In such cases the exercises of sovereignty are not in antagonism. Each is inherently possessed and independently exercised, and can be enforced no matter what the other sovereignty may do or abstain from doing. On the other hand, under the government's construction of section 2, the legislation of Congress is supreme and exclusive. Whatever the states may do is abortive of effect.\n The government seeking relief from the perturbation of mind and opinions produced by departure from the words of section 2, suggests a modification of its contention, that in case of conflict between state legislation and congressional \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 405]\n\u00a0\n legislation, that of Congress would prevail, by intimating that if state legislation be more drastic than congressional legislation, it might prevail, and in support of the suggestion, urges that section 1 is a command to prohibition, and that the purpose of section 2 is to enforce the command, and whatever legislation is the most prohibitive subserves best the command, displaces less restrictive legislation and becomes paramount. If a state, therefore, should define an intoxicating beverage to be one that has less than one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol, it would supersede the Volstead Act and a state might even keep its legislation supreme by forestalling congressional retaliation by prohibiting all artificial beverages of themselves innocuous, the prohibition being accessory to the main purpose of power; adducing Purity Extract Co. v. Lynch, \n226 U.S. 192\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 44, and Ruppert v. Caffey, \n251 U.S. 264\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 141. Of course this concession of the more drastic legislation destroys all that is urged for congressional supremacy, for necessarily supremacy cannot be transferred from the states to Congress or from Congress to the states as the quantity of alcohol may vary in the prohibited beverage. Section 2 is not quite so flexible to management. I may say, however, that one of the conclusions of the court has limited the range of retaliations. It recognizes 'that there are limits beyond which Congress cannot go in treating beverages as within its power of enforcement' and declares 'that those limits are not transcended by the provisions of the Volstead Act.' Of course, necessarily, the same limitations apply to the power of the states as well.\n From these premises the deduction seems inevitable that there must be united action between the states and Congress, or, at any rate, concordant and harmonious action; and will not such action promote better the purpose of the amendment-will it not bring to the enforcement of prohibition, the power of the states and the power of \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 406]\n\u00a0\n Congress, make all the instrumentalitieso f the states, its courts and officers, agencies of the enforcement, as well as the instrumentalities of the United States, its court and officers, agencies of the enforcement? Will it not bring to the states as well, or preserve to them, a partial autonomy, satisfying, if you will, their prejudices, or better say, their predilections; and it is not too much to say that our dual system of government is based upon them. And this predilection for self-government the Eighteenth Amendment regards and respects, and by doing so sacrifices nothing of, the policy of prohibition.\n It is, however, urged that to require such concurrence is to practically nullify the prohibition of the amendment, for without legislation its prohibition would be ineffectual, and that it is impossible to secure the concurrence of Congress and the states in legislation. I cannot assent to the propositions. The conviction of the evils of intemperance-the eager and ardent sentiment that impelled the amendment, will impel its execution through Congress and the states. It may not be in such legislation as the Volstead Act with its 1\/2 of 1 per cent. of alcohol or in such legislation as some of the states have enacted with their 2.75 per cent. of alcohol, but it will be in a law that will be prohibitive of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. It may require a little time to achieve, it may require some adjustments, but of its ultimate achievement there can be no doubt. However, whatever the difficulties of achievement in view of the requirement of section 2, it may be answered as this court answered in Wedding v. Meyler, supra:\n'The conveniences and inconveniences of concurrent' power by the Congress and the states 'are obvious and do not need to be stated. We have nothing to do with them when the lawmaking power has spoken.'\n\n I am, I think, therefore, justified in my dissent. I am alone in the grounds of it, but in the relief of the solitude of my position, I invoke the coincidence of my views with \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 407]\n\u00a0\n those entertained by the minority membership of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives, and expressed in its report upon the Volstead Act.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissents. See \n253 U.S. 350\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 588, \n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE (dissenting).\n I concur in the first seven paragraphs and in the tenth paragraph of the announced 'Conclusions' of the Court, but I dissent from the remaining three paragraphs.\n The eighth, ninth and eleventh paragraphs, taken together, in effect, declare the Volstead Act (41 Stat. 305) to be the supreme law of the land- paramount to any state law with which it may conflict in any respect.\n Such a result, in my judgment, can be arrived at only by reading out of the second section of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution the word 'concurrent,' as it is used in the grant to Congress and the several states of 'concurrent power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.' This important word, which the record of Congress shows was introduced, with utmost deliberation, to give accurate expression to a very definite purpose, can be read out of the Constitution only by violating the sound and wise rule of constitutional construction early announced and often applied by this Court-that in expounding the Constitution of the United States no word in it can be rejected as superfluous or unmeaning, but effect must be given to every word to the extent that this is reasonably possible.\n This rule was first announced in 1824 in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1; it was applied with emphasis in 1840 in Holmes v. Jennison, 14 Pet. 540, 570; and in the recent case of Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 U.S. 41\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 747. it is referred to as an elementary canon of constitutional construction.\n The authoritative dictionaries, general and law, and the decided cases, agree, that 'concurrent' means 'joint and equal authority,' 'running together, having the same authority,' and therefore the grant of concurrent power to the Congress and the states should give to each equal, the same, \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 408]\n\u00a0\n authority to enforce the Amendment by appropriate legislation. But the conclusions of the Court from which I dissent, by rendering the Volstead Act of Congress paramount to state laws, necessarily deprive the states of all power to enact legislation in conflict with it, and construe the Amendment precisely as if the word 'concurrent' were not in it. The power of Congress is rendered as supreme as if the grant to enforce the Amendment had been to it alone, as it is in the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and as it was in one proposed form of the Eighteenth Amendment which was rejected by Congress (Cong. Rec. July 30, 1917, p. 5548, and December 17, 1917, p. 469).\n Such a construction should not be given the Amendment if it can reasonably be avoided, as it very clearly may be, I think, with a resultant giving of a large and beneficent effect to the grant, as it is written. Giving to the word 'concurrent' its usual and authoritative meaning would result in congressional legislation under this grant of power being effective within the boundaries of any state only when concurred in by action of Congress and of such state, which, however, could readily be accomplished by the approval by either of the legislation of the other or by the adoption of identical legislation by both. Such legislation would be concurrent in fact and in law, and could be enforced by the courts and officers of either the nation or the state, thereby insuring a more general and satisfactory observance of it than could possibly be obtained by the federal authorities alone. It would, to a great extent, relieve Congress of the burden and the general government of the odium to be derived from the antagonism which would certainly spring from enforcing within states federal laws which must touch the daily life of the people very intimately and often very irritatingly. \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 409]\n\u00a0\n Such co-operation in legislation is not unfamiliar to our Constitution or in our practical experience.\n By section 10 of article 1 of the Constitution of the United States the states are deprived of power to do many things without the consent of Congress, and that consent has frequently been given, especially to contracts and agreements between states, which without it would be unconstitutional and void. The Wilson Act of 1890 (Comp. St.  8738), the Webb-Kenyon Act of 1913 (Comp. St.  8739), and the Reed Amendment of 1917 ( Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  8739a, 10387a-10387c), are familiar examples of co-operative legislation on the subject of intoxicating liquors. Other instances could readily be supplied. When to this we add that the Volstead Act is obviously in very large part a compilation from the prohibition codes of various states and is supposed to contain what is best in each of them, there is every reason to believe that if concurrent legislation were insisted upon, the act would be promptly approved by the Legislatures of many of the states and would thereby become the concurrent law of the state and nation throughout a large part of the Union.\n Under this construction, which I think should be given the Amendment, there would be large scope also for its operation even in states which might refuse to concur in congressional legislation for its enforcement. In my judgment the law in such a state would be as if no special grant of concurrent power for the enforcement of the first section had been made in the second section, but, nevertheless, the first section, prohibiting the manufacture, sale, transportation, importation or exportation, of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, would be the supreme law of the land within the nonconcurring states and they would be powerless to license, tax, or otherwise recognize as lawful anything violating that section, so that any state law in form attempting such recognition would be unconstitutional and void. Congress would have full power under the interstate commerce clause, \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 410]\n\u00a0\n and it would be its duty, to prevent the movement of such liquor for beverage purposes into or out of such a state and the plenary police power over the subject, so firmly established in the states before the Eighteenth Amendment was adopted, would continue for use in the restricted field which the first section of the Amendment leaves unoccupied-and the presumption must always be indulged that a state will observe and not defy the requirements of the national Constitution.\n Doubtless such a construction as I am proposing would not satisfy the views of extreme advocates of prohibition or of its opponents, but in my judgment it is required by the salutary rule of constitutional construction referred to, the importance of which cannot be overstated. It is intended to prevent courts from rewriting the Constitution in a form in which judges think it should have been written insta d of giving effect to the language actually used in it, and very certainly departures from it will return to plague the authors of them. It does not require the eye of a seer to see contention at the bar of this Court against liberal, paramount, congressional definition of intoxicating liquors as strenuous and determined as that which we have witnessed over the strict definition of the Volstead Act.\n With respect to the eleventh conclusion of the Court, it is enough to say that it approves as valid a definition of liquor as intoxicating which is expressly admitted not to be intoxicating in each of the cases in which it is considered. This is deemed warranted, I suppose, as legislation appropriate to the enforcement of the first section and precedent is found for it in prohibition legislation by states. But I cannot agree that the prohibition of the manufacture, sale, etc., of intoxicating liquors in the first section of the Eighteenth Amendment gives that plenary power over the subject which the Legislatures of the states derive from the people or which may be derived from the war powers \n\n[253 U.S. 350, 411]\n\u00a0\n of the Constitution. Believing, as I do, that the scope of the first section cannot constitutionally be enlarged by the language contained in the second section, I dissent from this conclusion of the Court.\n In the Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall 36, and other cases, this Court was urged to give a construction to the Fourteenth Amendment which would have radically changed the whole constitutional theory of the relations of our state and federal governments by transferring to the general government that police power, through the exercise of which the people of the various states theretofore regulated their local affairs in conformity with the widely differing standards of life, of conduct and of duty which must necessarily prevail in a country of so great extent as ours, with its varieties of climate, of industry and of habits of the people. But this Court, resisting the pressure of the passing hour, maintained the integrity of state control over local affairs to the extent that it had not been deliberately and clearly surrendered to the general government, in a number of decisions which came to command the confidence even of the generation active when they were rendered and which have been regarded by our succeeding generation as sound and wise and highly fortunate for our country.\n The cases now before us seem to me to again present questions of like character to, and of not less importance than, those which were presented in those great cases, and I regret profoundly that I cannot share in the disposition which the majority of my Associates think should be made of them. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The following is the contention of the government which we give to accurately represent it: 'It is true that the word 'concurrent' has various meanings, according to the connection in which it is used. It may undoubtedly be used to indicate that something is to be accomplished by two or more persons acting together. It is equally true that it means, in other connections, a right which two or more persons, acting separately and apart from each other, may exercise at the same time. It would be idle, however, to go into all the meanings which may attach to this word. In certain connections, it has a well-fixed and established meaning, which is controlled in this case.'\n And again: 'It is to be noted that section 2 does not say that legislation shall be concurrent, but that concurrent power to legislate shall exist. The concurrent power of the states and Congress to legislate is nothing new. And its meaning has been too long settled, historically and judicially, to now admit of question. The term has acquired a fixed meaning through its frequent use by this court and eminent statesmen and writers in referring to the concurrent power of Congress and the states to legislate.'\n And after citing cases, the government says: 'It will thus be seen that in legal nomenclature the concurrent power of the states and of Congress is clearly and unmistakably defined. It simply means the right of each to act with respect to a particular subject-matter separately and independently.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Definitions of the dictionaries are as follows: The Century: 'Concurrent: ... 2. Concurring; acting in conjunction; agreeing in the same act; contributing to the same event or effect; operating with; coincident. 3. Conjoint; joint; concomitant; coordinate; combined. ... That which concurs; a joint of contributory thing.' Webster's first definition is the same as that of the Century. The second is as follows: 'Joint; associate; concomitant; existing or happening at the same time.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] The government feels the inconsistency of its concessions and recessions. It asserts at one instant that the legislation of the states may be enforced in their courts, but in the next instant asserts that the conviction or acquittal of an offender there will not bar his prosecution in the federal courts for the same act as a violation of the federal law. From this situation the government hopes that there will be rescue by giving the Eighteenth Amendment 'such meaning that a prosecution in the courts of one government may be held to bar a prosecution for the same offence in the courts of the other.' The government considers, however, the question is not now presented. \n\n\n\n\n","151":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTRATHEARN S. S. CO. v. DILLON(1920)\nNo. 373\nArgued: Decided: March 29, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 348, 349]\n\u00a0\n Mr. R. J. M. Bullowa, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. George Sutherland, of Washington, D. C., and W. J. Waguespack, of New Orleans, La., for respondent.\n Messrs. Frederic R. Coudert and Howard Thayer Kingsbury, both of New York City, for British Embassy, by special leave.\n Mr. Solicitor General King, for the United States, by special leave.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents questions arising under the Seamen's Act of March 4, 1915, 38 Stat. 1164. It appears that Dillon, the respondent, was a British subject, and shipped at Liverpool on the eighth of May, 1916, on a British vessel. The shipping articles provided for a voyage of not exceeding three years, commencing at Liverpool and ending at such port in the United Kingdom as might be required by the master, the voyage including ports of the United States. The wages which were fixed by the articles were made payable at the end of the voyage. At \n\n[252 U.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n the time of the demand for one-half wages, and at the time of the beginning of the action, the period of the voyage had not been reached. The articles provided that no cash should be advanced abroad or liberty granted other than at the pleasure of the master. This, it is admitted, was a valid contract for the payment of wages under the laws of Great Britain. The ship arrived at the Port of Pensacola, Florida, on July 31, 1916, n d while she was in that port, Dillon, still in the employ of the ship, demanded from her master one-half part of the wages theretofore earned, and payment was refused. Dillon had received nothing for about two months, and after the refusal of the master to comply with his demand for one-half wages, he filed in the District Court of the United States a libel against the ship, claiming $125.00, the amount of wages earned at the time of demand and refusal.\n The District Court found against Dillon upon the ground that his demand was premature. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision, and held that Dillon was entitled to recover. 256 Fed. 631, 168 C. C. A. 25. A writ of certiorari brings before us for review the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals.\n In Sandberg v. McDonald, \n248 U.S. 185\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 84, and Neilson v. Rhine Shipping Co., \n248 U.S. 205\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 89, we had occasion to deal with section 11 of the Seamen's Act (Comp. St .  8323), and held that it did not invalidate advancement of seamen's wages in foreign countries when legal where made. The instant case requires us to consider now section 4 of the same act. That section amends section 4530, U. S. Revised Statutes, and so far as pertinent provides:\n'Section 4530. Every seaman on a vessel of the United States shall be entitled to receive on demand from the master of the vessel to which he belongs one-half part of the wages which he shall have then earned at every port where such vessel, after the voyage has been commenced, shall load or deliver cargo before the voyage is ended and all stipulations in the contract to the contrary \n\n[252 U.S. 348, 353]\n\u00a0\n shall be void: Provided, such a demand shall not be made before the expiration of, nor aftener than once in five days. Any failure on the part of the master to comply with this demand shall release the seaman from his contract and he shall be entitled to full payment of wages earned. ... And provided further, that this section shall apply to seamen on foreign vessels while in harbors of the United States, and the courts of the United States shall be open to such seamen for its enforcement.' Comp. St.  8322\n\n\n\n This section has to do with the recovery of wages by seamen, and by its terms gives to every seaman on a vessel of the United States, the right to demand one-half the wages which he shall have then earned at every port where such vessel, after the voyage has been commenced, shall load or deliver cargo before the end of the voyage, and stipulations in the contract to the contrary are declared to be void. A failure of the master to comply with the demand releases the seaman from his contract, and entitles him to recover full payment of the wages, and the section is made applicable to seamen on foreign vessels while in harbors of the United States, and the courts of the United States are open to such seamen for enforcement of the act.\n This section is an amendment of section 4530 of the Revised Statutes; it was intended to supplant that section, as amended by the act of December 21, 1898, which provided:\n'Every seaman on a vessel of the United States shall be entitled to receive from the master of the vessel to which he belongs one-half part of the wages which shall be due him at every port where such vessel, after the voyage has been commenced, shall load or deliver cargo before the voyage is ended unless the contrary be expressly stipulated in the contract,' etc. Comp. St.  8323.\n\n The section, of which the statute now under consideration is an amendment, expressly excepted from the right to recover one-half of the wages those cases in which the \n\n[252 U.S. 348, 354]\n\u00a0\n contract otherwise provided. In the amended section all such contract provisions are expressly rendered void, and the right to recover is given the seamen notwithstanding contractual obligations to the contrary. The language applies to all seamen on vessels of the United States, and the second proviso of the section as it now reads makes it applicable to seamen on foreign vessel while in harbors of the United States. The proviso does not stop there, for it contains the express provision that the courts of the United States shall be open to seamen on foreign vessels for its enforcement. The latter provision is of the utmost importance in determining the proper construction of this section of the act. It manifests the purpose of Congress to give the benefit of the act to seamen on foreign vessels, and to open the doors of the federal courts to foreign seamen. No such provision was necessary as to American seamen for they had the right independently of this statute to seek redress in the courts of the United States, and if it were the intention of Congress to limit the provision of the act to American seamen, this feature would have been wholly superfluous.\n It is said that it is the purpose to limit the benefit of the act to American seamen, notwithstanding this provision giving access to seamen on foreign vessels to the courts of the United States, because of the title of the act in which its purpose is expressed 'to promote the welfare of American seamen in the merchant marine of the United States.' But the title is more than this, and not only declares the purposes to promote the welfare of American seamen but further to abolish arrest and imprisonment as a penalty for desertion and to secure the abrogation of treaty provisions in relation thereto; and to promote safety at sea. But the title of an act cannot limit the plain meaning of its text, although it may be looked to to aid in construction in cases of doubt. Cornell v. Coyne, \n192 \nU.S. 418, 530\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 383, and cases cited. Apart from the text, which we think plain, it is by \n\n[252 U.S. 348, 355]\n\u00a0\n no means clear that if the act were given a construction to limit its application to American seamen only, the purposes of Congress would be subserved, for such limited construction would have a tendency to prevent the employment of American seamen, and to promote the engagement of those who were not entitled to sue for one-half wages under the provisions of the law. But, taking the provisions of the act as the same are written, we think it plain that it manifests the purpose of Congress to place American and foreign seamen on an equality of right in so far as the privileges of this section are concerned, with equal opportunity to resort to the courts of the United States for the enforcement of the act. Before the amendment, as we have already pointed out, the right to recover one-half the wages could not be enforced in face of a contractual obligation to the contrary. Congress, for reasons which it deemed sufficient, amended the act so as to permit the recovery upon the conditions named in the statute. In the case of Sandberg v. McDonald, \n248 U.S. 185\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 84, supra, we found no purpose manifested by Congress in section 11 to interfere with wages advanced in foreign ports under contracts legal where made. That section dealt with advancements, and contained no provision such as we find in section 4. Under section 4 all contracts are avoided which run counter to the purposes of the statute. Whether consideration for contractual rights under engagements legally made in foreign countries would suggest a different course is not our province to inquire. It is sufficient to say that Congress has otherwise declared by the positive terms of this enactment, and if it had authority to do so, the law is enforceable in the courts.\n We come then to consider the contention that this construction renders the statute unconstitutional as being destructive of contract rights. But we think this contention must be decided adversely to the petitioner upon the authority of previous cases in this court. The matter was \n\n[252 U.S. 348, 356]\n\u00a0\n fully considered in Patterson v. Bark Eudora, \n190 U.S. 169\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 821, in which the previous decisions of this court were reviewed, and the conclusion reached that the jurisdiction of this government over foreign merchant vessels in or ports was such as to give authority to Congress to make provisions of the character now under consideration; that it was for this government to determine upon what terms and conditions vessels of other countries might be permitted to enter our harbors, and to impose conditions upon the shipment of sailors in our own ports, and make them applicable to foreign as well as domestic vessels. Upon the authority of that case, and others cited in the opinion therein, we have no doubt as to the authority of Congress to pass a statute of this sort, applicable to foreign vessels in our ports and controlling the employment and payment of seamen as a condition of the right of such foreign vessels to enter and use the ports of the United States.\n But, it is insisted, that Dillon's action was premature as he made a demand upon the master within less than five days after the vessel arrived in an American port. This contention was sustained in the District Court, but it was ruled otherwise in the Court of Appeals. Turning to the language of the act, it enacts in substance that the demand shall not be made before the expiration of five days, nor oftener than once in five days. Subject to such limitation, such demand may be made in the port where the vessel stops to load or deliver cargo. It is true that the act is made to apply to seamen on foreign vessels while in United States ports, but this is far from requiring that the wages shall be earned in such ports, or that the vessels shall be in such ports five days before demand for one-half the wages earned is made. It is the wages of the voyage for which provision is made, with the limitation of the right to demand one- half of the amount earned not oftener than once in five days. The section permits no \n\n[252 U.S. 348, 357]\n\u00a0\n demand until five days after the voyage has begun, and then provides that it may be made at every port where the vessel stops to load or deliver cargo, subject to the five-day limitation. If the vessel must be five days in port before demand can be made, it would defeat the purpose of the law as to vessels not remaining that long in port, and would run counter to the manifest purpose of Congress to prevent a seaman from being without means while in a port of the United States.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit, whose judgment we are now reviewing, that the demand was not premature. It is true that the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held in the case of The Italier, 257 Fed. 712, 168 C. C. A. 662, that demand, made before the vessel had been in port for five days, was premature; this was upon the theory that the law was not in force until the vessel had arrived in a port of the United States. But, the limitation upon demand has no reference to the length of stay in the domestic port. The right to recover wages is controlled by the provisions of the statute and includes wages earned from the beginning of the voyage. It is the right to demand and recover such wages with the limitation of the intervals of demand as laid down in the statute, which is given to the seaman while the ship is in a harbor of the United States.\n We find no error in the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals and the same is\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","152":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTREET v.

Porter is an agent of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, charged with the duty of enforcing the Volstead Act, who in his offcial capacity has publicly declared and thereatened that such storage of liquor by the defendant Deposit Company would be unlawful after the Volstead Act became effective, and would expose plaintiff and the Deposit Company to the penalties of that act, which would be enforced against them; that \n\n[254 U.S. 88, 90]\n\u00a0\n the appellant desired to continue to store his liquors in said rented room after the Volstead Act should become effective, and intended to report the same to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, as therein required; and that the Deposit Company, moved wholly by the notices and threats of defendant Porter, had notified plaintiff that he must remove his liquors from its warehouse, or that it would remove and deliver them to Porter as outlawed property, to be dealt with under the Volstead Act after it became effective.\n Averring as a matter of law that such possession of liquors in a warehouse is not forbidden by the Eighteenth Amendment or the Volstead Act, the appellant prayed that an injunction should issue, restraining the defendants from interfering with his possession of the room in the warehouse and from removing or disposing of his liquors.\n The motion to dismiss was sustained, and a constitutional question being involved, appellant brought the case by direct appeal to this court.\n Thus is presented for decision the question:\n May a warehousing corporation lawfully permit to be stored in its warehouse, after the effective date of the Volstead Act, liquors admitted to have been lawfully acquired before that date and which are so stored, solely and in good faith, for the purpose of preserving and protecting them until they shall be consumed by the owner and his family or bona fide guests?\n Since the Volstead Act has been held by this court to be a valid law, the answer to this question must be found in its provisions, and the sections of it which it is argued sustain the negative anwer to the question given by the court below, are 3, 21, and 25 of title II.\n Since here, as always, the purpose of Congress in enacting a law is of importance in determining the meaning of it, it is noteworthy that title II of the Volstead Act was passed under the grant of power to enforce the first section \n\n[254 U.S. 88, 91]\n\u00a0\n of the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which prohibits the manufacture, sale, and transportation of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes, but does not indicate any purpose to confiscate liquors lawfully owned at the time the amendment should become effective and which the owner intended to use in a lawful manner.\n Section 33 of the act is the only one which deals specifically with liquors lawfully acquired before it should take effect and it is therefore of first importance in the consideration of the case before us. That section declares:\n'It shall not be unlawful to possess liquors in one's private dwelling while the same is occupied and used by him as his dwelling only and such liquor need not be reported, provided such liquors are for use only for the personal consumption of the owner thereof and his family residing in such dwelling and of his bona fide guests when entertained by him therein.'\n\n The admissions of fact under which this case is considered bring the liquors here involved precisely within these immunity provisions of section 33, except that they are stored in a public warehouse instead of in a private dwelling. They were lawfully acquired and were intended for a lawful use and thus the question is narrowed to, whether such custody by the warehouse company as is shown by the admissions was forbidden by the act.\n Coming now to the sections relied upon as rendering the custody or possession of the liquors by the warehouse company unlawful:\n Section 25 declares that--\n'It shall be unlawful to have or possess any liquor ... intended for use in violating this title. ...'\n\n But since section 33 declares that the uses to which it is admitted the plaintiff intends to devote his liquors are not unlawful, obviously this section does not apply to the case, \n\n[254 U.S. 88, 92]\n\u00a0\n for the unlawfulness declared by it is conditioned upon the intended use in violating the act.\n Section 21 declares that--\n'Any room, house, building ... or place where intoxicating liquor is manufactured, sold, kept, or bartered in violation of this title, and all intoxicating liquor and property kept and used in maintaining the same, is hereby declared to be a common nuisance,' and for the maintaining of such a place penalties are provided.\n\n The word 'kept' in this section is the only one of possible application to the case at bar, and the words with which it is immediately associated are such that, as here used, it plainly means kept for sale or barter or other commercial purpose. Its inapplicability to this case is apparent. Noscitur a sociis. United States v. Louisville & Nashville R. R. Co., \n236 \nU.S. 318, 334\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 363.\n Section 3, which is the omnibus section of the act, provides that--\n'No person shall on or after the date when the Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States goes into effect, manufacture, sell, barter, transport, import, export, deliver, furnish or possess any intoxicating liquor except as authorized in this act, and all the provisions of this act shall be liberally construed to the end that the use of intoxicating liquor as a beverage may be prevented.'\n\n It is argued that the declaration herein that no person shall 'possess,' 'transport' or 'deliver' intoxicating liquors is applicable to this case, because the warehouse company is not 'authorized' by the act to 'possess' them, and because they cannot be used, even lawfully, by the plaintiff unless delivered and taken away from the warehouse.\n By the admissions the appellant is lessee of the room in which the liquors are stored and he 'is in the exclusive possession and control of them.' Thereby the relation of the warehouse company to the liquors is restricted to the \n\n[254 U.S. 88, 93]\n\u00a0\n public function of furnishing such police, fire, and other protection to its buildings and their contents as the law or its lease requires on the part of such company and to allowing the plaintiff to have access to his property in order that he may remove it for an admittedly lawful purpose. The company could not sell, give away or otherwise transfer the liquors to any one other than in this limited way to the plaintiff owner.\n The purpose of the Eighteenth Amendment and of this act considered, we cannot bring ourselves to the conclusion that such a relation to the liquors on the part of the storage company as is here disclosed constitutes a possession of them within the meaning of this section of the act.\n It is equally clear that to permit the owner to have access to the liquors to take them to his dwelling for lawful use is not a delivery of them within the meaning of this third section.\n That transportation of the liquors to the home of appellant, under the admitted circumstances, is not such as is prohibited by the section is too apparent to justify detailed consideration of the many provisions of the act inconsistent with a construction which would render such removal unlawful, and that the act is understood by the officers charged with its execution as permitted such transportation is shown by the provision of the regulations of the Bureau of Internal Revenue authorizing permits for the transportation of liquors from one permanent residence of an owner to another in case of his removal, although no such transfer is in terms provided for by the act.\n Clearly there is like administrative power under the act to so regulate the transfer of such stored liquors from a warehouse to the dwelling of the owner as to prevent their being used to evade the prohibitions of the act or to substantially interfere with its effective enforcement.\n Thus it is plain that in the sections of the act relied upon \n\n[254 U.S. 88, 94]\n\u00a0\n there is no specific prohibition against the storage of liquors, under the circumstances admitted to exist in this case, and we find no other provisions by which such a custody is rendered unlawful.\n The implication from another provision of section 33, than the one quoted above, confirms this conclusion. It reads:\n'After February, 1, 1920, the possession of liquors by any person not legally permitted under this title to possess liquor shall be prima facie evidence that such liquor is kept for the purpose of being sold, bartered, exchanged, given away, furnished, or otherwise disposed of in violation of the provisions of this title.'\n\n Assuming that the unexplained presence of the liquors in the company's warehouse would give rise to the prescribed presumption, yet, if that presumption should be rebutted by appropriate testimony (as it is in this case by admissions) that the liquor to which it is applied is not being kept for the purpose of sale, barter, exchange, furnishing, or otherwise disposing of it in violation of the provisions of the title, the implication is plain that the possession should be considered not unlawful, even though it be by a person 'not legally permitted'-that is by a person not holding a technical permit to possess it, such as is provided for in the act.\n Without saying that there may not be other cases, the one at bar seems to be fairly within the scope of this obvious implication of section 33.\n It may be that the custody of liquors by a warehouse company was thus not declared to be unlawful because the writers of the act did not have such a case in mind, but it was more probably because Congress would not consent to allow lawful possession and use of liquors in dwellings having storage facilities for them, while denying the only possible means of preserving and protecting such liquors to persons with less commodious homes. The Congress was concerned with the great problem of preventing the manufacture \n\n[254 U.S. 88, 95]\n\u00a0\n and sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage purposes in the future, and it seems to have given but slight attention to the consumption of such relatively small amounts of such liquors as might be in existence in private ownership and intended for consumption by the owner, his family or his guests, when the amendment and the act should take effect.\n An intention to confiscate private property, even in intoxicating liquors, will not be raised by inference and construction from provisions of law which have ample field for other operation in effecting a purpose clearly indicated and declared.\n It results that the decree of the District Court must be\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurring.\n I concur in the judgment of the court, but do not assent to the reasoning advanced to support it. I think the Volstead Act was properly interpreted by the court below (267 Fed. 706); but to enforce it as thus construed would result in virtual confiscation of lawfully acquired liquors by preventing or unduly interfering with their consumption by the owner. The Eighteenth Amendment gave no such power to Congress. Manufacture, sale and transportation are the things prohibited; not personal use. \n\n\n\n","153":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTROUD v. U.S.(1920)\nNo. 276\nArgued: Decided: January 19, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Isaac B. Kimbrell and Martin J. O'Donnell, both of Kansas City, Mo., for plaintiff in error on petition for rehearing.\n\n Memorandum opinion by direction of the Court, by Mr. Justice DAY.\n In this proceeding on November 24, 1919, this court affirmed the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Kansas rendered upon a verdict convicting the plaintiff in error of murder in the first degree.\n A petition for rehearing has been presented. It has been considered, and we find occasion to notice only so \n\n[251 U.S. 380, 381]\n\u00a0\n much thereof as refers to the refusal of the court below to sustain the plaintiff in error's challenge for cause as to the juror Williamson. The other grounds urged have been examined and found to be without merit.\n Williamson was called as a juror, and, as we said in our former opinion, was challenged for cause by the plaintiff in error. This challenge was overruled, and the juror was then challenged peremptorily by the accused. The testimony of Williamson made it reasonably certain that in the event of conviction for murder in the first degree he would render no other verdict than one which required capital punishment. Granting that this challenge for cause should have been sustained, and that this ruling required the plaintiff in error to use one of his peremptory challenges to remove the juror from the panel, we held that the refusal to sustain the challenge was not prejudicial error, as the record disclosed that the defendant was allowed 22 peremptory challenges, when the law allowed but 20.\n In the petition for rehearing it is alleged that the record discloses that in fact the accused was allowed 20 peremptory challenges and no more, and this allegation is accompanied by an affidavit of counsel giving the names of 20 persons challenged peremptorily by the plaintiff in error, and stating that no other peremptory challenges were allowed to him at the trial. In this statement the counsel is mistaken. An examination of the original transcript, as also the printed transcript, shows that a juror, H. A. Shearer, was called and examined upon his voir dire (printed transcript, page 79), and later was peremptorily challenged by the plaintiff in error ( printed transcript, page 143) and excused from the panel. H. A. Shearer's name does not appear upon the list of those as to whom peremptory challenges were made and sustained in plaintiff in error's behalf as given in the petition and affidavit for \n\n[251 U.S. 380, 382]\n\u00a0\n a rehearing. It does appear in the transcript that plaintiff in error was allowed 21 peremptory challenges, and it follows that his right to exercise such challenges was not abridged to his prejudice by the failure to allow the single challenge for cause which in our opinion should have been sustained by the trial judge. Furthermore, the record shows that after the ruling and challenge as to Williamson the plaintiff in error had other peremptory challenges which he might have used; and the record does not disclose that other than an impartial jury sat on the trial. See Spies v. Illinois, \n123 \nU.S. 131, 168\n, 8 S. Sup. Ct. 22, and cases cited.\n It follows that the petition for rehearing must be denied.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE ATLANTEN(1920)\nNo. 171\nArgued: March 10, 1920Decided: March 22, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 313, 314]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Griffin, of New York City, and Clarence Bishop Smith, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Roscoe H. Hupper, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a libel in admiralty by a Danish corporation, the respondent here, against a Swedish corporation, owner of the steamship Atlanten, for breach of a charter party made in Denmark, on September 30, 1914. The voyage was to be from a southern port in the United States to Danish ports to be named. On January 8, 1915, the owner (the petitioner) wrote to the charterers that owing to the increased war risk and other difficulties 'we are compelled to cancel the Atlanten's charter party Pensacola to Scandinavia, and are ready to take all the consequences the Court after Clause No. 24 in the charter party will compel us to pay, not exceeding the estimated amount of freight.' It offered to proceed, however, if the charterers would pay a higher rate. This libel was brought five months later. The owner in its answer admitted the breach, but set up the clause 24 of the charter, \n\n[252 U.S. 313, 315]\n\u00a0\n 'Penalty for nonperformance of this agreement to be proved damages, not exceeding estimated amount of freight,' and clause 21, 'If any dispute arises the same to be settled by two referees, one to be appointed by the Captain and one by charterers or their agents, and if necessary, the arbitrators to appoint an Umpire. The decision ... shall be final, and any party attempting to revoke this submission to arbitration without leave of a court shall be liable to pay to the other or others, as liquidated damages, the estimated amount of chartered freight.' It is alleged that by the laws of both Denmark and Sweden such a provision is binding and that arbitration is a condition precedent to the right to sue by reason of any dispute arising under the charter. The case was heard on exceptions to the answer. The District Court made a decree for the libellant for full damages, Aktieselskabet Korn-Og Foderstof Kompagniet v. Rederiaktiebolaget Atlanten, 232 Fed. 403, and this decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 250 Fed. 935, 163 C. C. A. 185, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 491.\n With regard to the arbitration clause we shall not consider the general question whether a greater effect should not be given to such clauses than formerly was done, since it is not necessary to do so in order to decide the case before us. For this case it is enough that we agree substantially with the views of Judge Learned Hand in the District Court and Judge Hough in the Circuit Court of Appeals. Their opinion was that the owner repudiated the contract and that the arbitration clause did not apply. It is true that it would be inaccurate to say that the owner repudiated the contract in toto, for the letter that we have quoted assumed that the contract was binding and referred to it as fixing the liability incurred. It meant simply that the owner would not proceed with the voyage. United States v. McMullen, \n222 \nU.S. 460, 471\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 128. But we agree that such a refusal was not a 'dispute' of the kind referred to in the arbitration clause.\n As Judge Hand remarked, the withdrawal was before \n\n[252 U.S. 313, 316]\n\u00a0\n the voyage began and it is absurd to suppose that the captain, who might be anywhere in the world, was to be looked up and to pick an arbitrator in such a case. The clause obviously referred to disputes that might arise while the parties were trying to go on with the execution of the contract- not to a repudiation of the substance of the contract, as it is put by Lord Haldane n Jureidini v. National British & Irish Millers Ins. Co., Ltd., \n\n[252 U.S. 313, 1915]\n\u00a0\n A. C. 499, 505. The allegation in the answer as to the laws of Denmark and Sweden we do not understand to mean more than that arbitration agreements will be enforced according to their intent. It does not extend the scope or affect the construction of an agreement which, as we should construe it apart from that allegation, does not apply to the present case.\n Paragraph 24 of the charter, supposed to limit liability, may be met in similar and other ways. If it were a limitation of liability it hardly could be taken to apply to a case of wilful unexcused refusal to go on with the voyage. It obviously was not intended to give the owner an option to go on or stop at that price. But furthermore, as was fully pointed out below, the clause is a familiar modification of a very old one, and in the courts of England that have had frequent occasion to deal with it, is held to be only a penalty, even in the present form, and to leave the ordinary liability upon the undertakings of the contract unchanged.

We are of opinion that the decree was clearly right.\n Decree affirmed. \n\n\n\n","155":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHE FRANCIS MCDONALD(1920)\nNo. 97\nArgued: November 18, 1920Decided: December 6, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Samuel Park, of New York City, for appellant.\n Mr. Mark Ash, of New York City, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The libel was dismissed for want of jurisdiction and the cause is here on that question only. \n\n[254 U.S. 242, 243]\n\u00a0\n Seeking to recover for supplies furnished and repairs made to the schooner Francis McDonald, appellant libeled the vessel in United States District Court, Southern District of New York.\n Under a definite contract the Palmer Shipbuilding Company began construction of the schooner at Groton, Conn., and launched the hull. That company found itself unable to proceed further, thereupon appellant agreed with the owner to complete the work and for such purpose the hull was towed to its yard at New London. While lying there in the stream the materials, work, and labor for which recovery is now sought were furnished. Later the vessel, so advanced, was towed to Hoboken and finished by a third company. When received by appellant the schooner was manifestly incomplete-her masts were not in, the bolts and beams and gaff were lying on deck, the forward house was not built, and she was not 'in condition to carry on any service.' Appellant worked on her for 6 weeks, and 30 or 40 more days were required to finish her.\n Was appellant's contract to furnish the materials, work, and labor for her completion, made after the schooner was launched, but while yet not sufficiently advanced to discharge the functions for which intended, within the admiralty and maritime jurisdiction? The District Court thought not, and so do we.\n Under decisions of this court the settled rule is that a contract for the complete construction of a ship or supplying materials therefor is nonmaritime, and not within the admiralty jurisdiction. People's Ferry Co. v. Beers, 20 How. 393; Roach v. Chapman, 22 How. 129; Edwards v. Elliott, 21 Wall. 532; The Winnebago, \n205 \nU.S. 354, 363\n, 27 S. Sup. Ct. 509; North Pacific Steamship Co. v. Hall, \n249 \nU.S. 119, 125\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 221.\n But counsel for appellant insist that there is a broad distinction between such a contract and one for work and \n\n[254 U.S. 242, 244]\n\u00a0\n material to finish a vessel after she has been launched and is water-borne. In support of this position they rely upon The Eliza Ladd (1875) Fed. Cas. No. 4364; The Revenue Cutter (1877) Fed. Cas. No. 11,714-both by Judge Deady, in the United States District Court for Oregon; The manhattan ( District Court for Washington, 1891) 46 Fed. 797, which followed the District Court for Oregon; and Tucker v. Alexandroff, \n183 \nU.S. 424, 438\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 195. The first three cases are directly in point, but are opposed by many of no less authority. Tucker v. Alexandroff must be read in the light of the particular matter under consideration- detention of a foreign seaman-and the conclusion announced, that after the vessel was launched 'she was a ship within the meaning of the treaty.' The court had no immediate concern with contracts for ship construction, and there was no purpose to lay down any definite rule applicable to them. On the other side the following cases are cited, and they are entitled to the greater weight: The Tosco, Fed. Cas. No. 7,060; The Pacific (D. C.) 9 Fed. 120; The Count de Lesseps (D. C.) 17 Fed. 460; The Glenmont (D. C.) 32 Fed. 703, and (C. C.) 34 Fed. 403; The Paradox (D. C.) 61 Fed. 860; McMaster v. One Dredge (D. C.) 95 Fed. 832; The United Shores (D.

Ct. 221.\n Notwithstanding possible and once not inappropriate criticism, the doctrine is now firmly established that contracts to construct entirely new ships are nonmaritime because not nearly enough related to any rights and duties pertaining to commerce and navigation. It is said that in no proper sense can they be regarded as directly and immediately connected with navigation or commerce by water. Edwards v. Elliott, 21 Wall. 532, 554, 555; The William Windom (D. C.) 73 Fed. 496; Pacific Surety Co. v. Leatham & S. Tow. & Wreck. Co., 151 Fed. 440, 80 C. C. A. 670. And \n\n[254 U.S. 242, 245]\n\u00a0\n we think the same reasons which exclude such contracts from admiralty jurisdiction likewise apply to agreements made after the hull is in the water, for the work and material necessary to consummate a partial construction and bring the vessel into condition to function as intended.\n The judgment of the court below is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","156":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHORNTON v.

Vorys, of Columbus, Ohio, for plaintiffs in error.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 361, 363]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Timothy S. Hogan and B. W. Gearhart, both of Columbus, Ohio, for defendants in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the plaintiff in error, Thornton, against defendants in error, hereinafter called defendants, \n\n[254 U.S. 361, 364]\n\u00a0\n composing the Industrial Commission of Ohio. The Cleveland Stamping & Tool Company filed an answer and cross-petition. From a judgment sustaining demurrers to the petition of Thornton, and to the answer and cross- petition of the Cleveland Stamping & Tool Company, there was an appeal to the Court of Appeals, and thence by proceeding in error to the Supreme Court of the state, by which court the judgment was affirmed. These writs of error are prosecuted by Thornton and the Cleveland Company.\n Thornton's petition and the pleadings of the Cleveland Company are substantially the same. We use, for convenience, Thornton's petition, and state its allegations narratively as follows: He is a manufacturer at Cleveland, Ohio, employing more than 40 men. The Industrial Commission determined, as required by the act of the General Assembly of the state, passed February 26, 1913, and comprised in sections 1465-41a to 1465-106, General Code of Ohio, that he was of sufficient financial ability to render certain the payment of compensation to injured employes, the benefits provided by that act. He, on the _____ day of January, 1914, elected to accept the act and proceed under it, has since complied with its provisions, has abided by the rules of the commission and all that is required of him by the act.\n January, 1914, he made a written contract with the AEtna Insurance Company of Hartford, Conn., a duly licensed company, wherein that company agreed to pay to his injured employes the compensations required by the act of the assembly for injuries or upon death, and agreed to indemnify him against the liabilities and requirements of the act.\n December 1, 1917, the commission adopted a resolution which recited the act of the Assembly of the state of February 16, 1917, amending section 1465-101, General Code of Ohio, and an act of the General Assembly passed \n\n[254 U.S. 361, 365]\n\u00a0\n March 20, 1917, amending section 1465-69, General Code of the state, and an act passed March 21, 1917, and resolved and declared that no employers should be permitted to pay or furnish directly to injured employes, or the dependents of killed employes, the compensation and benefits provided for in sections 1465-41a to 1465-106, General Code of Ohio, if such employers by contract or otherwise, shall provide for the insurance of the payment by them of such compensation and benefits, or shall indemnify themselves against loss sustained by the direct payment thereof. The commission revoked its previous findings and authorizations, the revocation to stand as of January 10, 1918, and directed notices of the revocation and the resolution of the commission to be given to all employers, including Thornton, and these notices will be sent unless restrained.\n The resolution of the commission, the revocation of its previous action, and the notices which it threatens to send, are based upon the sole ground that it is its duty so to do under the laws of the state indicated above.\n The contract of Thornton with the AEtna Company is a valid, subsisting contract, and he has a right to continue it until it be canceled, and that the sending of the notices as above stated, and the revocation of the findings of fact that the commission had made and its refusal to certify to Thornton its findings of fact, as provided for in section 1465-69, will cause him irreparable injury and damage, for which he has no adequate remedy at law. Further, that there are more than 675 employers situated as Thornton is, and that, therefore, the questions involved are of common and general interest, and as it is impractical to bring them all into court, he sues for the benefit of all.\n The laws invoked by the commission do not justify its action, and if it be determined that they do, then they, and the acts of the commission under them, are in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution \n\n[254 U.S. 361, 366]\n\u00a0\n of the United States, and of article 1,  10, of that Constitution, and also of the Constitution of the state of Ohio.\n An injunction, temporary and permanent, against the action of the commission, was prayed, and a temporary restraining order granted, but it was subsequently dissolved, and, as we have said, a demurrer was sustained to the petition and judgment entered dismissing the suit. It, as we have also said, was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state.\n The various acts of legislation of the state were sustained by the courts of the state and hence their validity under the Constitution of the state is removed from the controversy, and our inquiry is confined to the effect upon them of the Constitution of the United States.\n In support of the contention that the Constitution of the United States makes the legislation and the action under it illegal, it is said that insurance against loss is the right of everybody, and specifically it is the right of employers to indemnify themselves against their liability to employes, and that the right is so fixed and inherent as to be an attribute of liberty removed from the interference of the state.\n The provisions of the legislation are necessary elements in the consideration of the contention: (1) The Constitution of Ohio authorizes Workmen's Compensation Laws. Explicitly it provides for the passage of laws establishing a state fund to be created by compulsory contributions thereto by employers, the fund to be administered by the state. The constitutionality of a law passed under that authorization was sustained by this court in Jeffrey Manufacturing Co. v. Blagg, \n235 U.S. 571\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 167, against the charge that its classifications were arbitrary and unreasonable. And Workmen's Compensation Laws of other states have been declared inoffensive to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. New York Central Railroad Co. v. White, \n243 U.S. 188\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 247, L. R. A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642. (2) \n\n[254 U.S. 361, 367]\n\u00a0\n The law that was passed provided that every employer (there were exceptions not necessary to mention) in the month of January, 1914, and semiannually thereafter, should pay into the state insurance fund the amount of premium determined and fixed by the state liability board of awards for the particular employment or occupation of the employer. It was, however, also provided (we quote from the opinion of the Supreme Court):\n'That certain employers under certain conditions might elect to pay individually, or from a benefit fund, department or association, compensation to workmen and their dependents for death, or injury received in the course of their employment.'\n\n This was an alternative granted, and its conditions were fulfilled, it was contended, and that upon the faith of the fulfillment of it and in indemnity against contingencies, plaintiff entered into a contract of insurance with the AEtna Company. It was further contended that the alternative and the insurance against its requirements became property, and inviolable; became contracts with immunity from impairment. To the contention the Supreme Court replied that the alternative of contribution to the state fund of dealing with the employes directly was a privilege that need not have been granted and that, therefore, to effect the purpose of the Constitution and law, could be withdrawn, that the right to withdraw the privilege depended not merely upon the police power of the state, 'but rather directly upon the constitutional grant of power,' and that, besides, the right was reserved in that provision of section 22 of the original act which gave to the commission power to \"at any time change or modify its findings of fact ... if in its judgment such action is necessary or desirable to secure or assure a strict compliance with all of the provisions of this act. ...\" And it was said that the experience of four years demonstrated the necessity or desirability of a change and that, therefore, it was made. \n\n[254 U.S. 361, 368]\n\u00a0\n The meaning thus ascribed to section 22 we must accept. It expressed a continuing condition upon the concession to employers to deal directly with their employes, and the Industrial Commission by the power reserved could terminate the concession at any time.\n There was besides, subsequent and empowering legislation in the amendment of March 20, 1917, as the Supreme Court pointed out. That act specifically limits the privilege of electing between directly dealing with employes and contribution to the state fund to those employers 'who do not desire to insure the payment thereof or indemnify themselves against loss sustained by direct payment thereof.' The court hence decided that it became the duty of the commission to change or modify its findings. And it was also decided that the act was not only clearly within the power of the state, but was 'in furtherance of the purpose and intention of the Constitution and the law, to create and maintain one insurance fund, to be administered by the state.'\n We repeat, we must accept the decision of the court as the declaration of the legislation and the requirement of the Constitution of the state, as much a part of both as if expressed in them (Douglass v. County of Pike, \n101 U.S. 677\n), and we are unable to yield to the contention that the legislation or the requirement transcends the power of the state, or in any way violates the Constitution of the United States. The law expressed the constitutional and legislative policy of the state to be that the compensation to workmen for injuries received in their employment was a matter of public concern, and should not be left to the individual employer or employe, or be dependent upon or influenced by the hazards of controversy or litigation, or inequality of conditions. There was an attempt at the accommodation of the new policy to old conditions in the concession to employers to deal directly with their employes, but there was precaution against failure in the \n\n[254 U.S. 361, 369]\n\u00a0\n provision of section 22 giving discretion to the commission to withdraw the concession. After a few years' experience, that discretion was turned into a duty, and by the amendment of March 20, 1917, the concession was taken away from those employers who indemnified themselves by insurance. This was considered necessary to execute the policy of the state, and we are unable to yield to the contention that property rights or contract rights had accrued against it. To assert that the first steps of a policy make it immutable is to assert that imperfections and errors in legislation become constitutional rights. This is a narrow conception of sovereignty. It is, however, not new and we have heretofore been invoked to pronounce judgment upon it. Complying, we said that an exercise of public policy cannot be resisted because of conduct or contracts done or made upon the faith of former exercises of it upon the ground that its later exercises deprive of property or invalidate those contracts. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 265, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 671.\n We are not disposed to extend the discussion. Indeed, we think the case is in narrow compass. We are not called upon to controvert the right to insure against contingent losses or liabilities, or to minimize the value of insurance to business activities and enterprises, or discuss the general power or want of power of the state over it. We are only called upon to consider its relation to and possible effect upon the policy of a workmen's compensation law and we can readily see that it may be, as it is said the experience of Ohio demonstrated, inimical to that policy to permit the erection of an interest or a power that may be exerted against it or its subsidiary provisions. This was the view of the Supreme Court of the state, and by it the court justified the power conferred upon and exercised by the commission. See Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, supra.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n[254 U.S. 361, 370]\n\u00a0\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, concurring.\n To compel an employer to insure his employe against loss from injury sustained in the course of the employment without reference to the negligence of the employe and at the same time to prohibit the employer from insuring himself against the burden thus imposed, it seems to me, if originally considered, would be a typical illustration of the taking of property without due process and a violation of the equal protection of the law.\n But in view of the decision in Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 U.S. 219\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642, sustaining the constitutionality of a law of the state of Washington which necessarily excluded the possibility of the insurance by the employer of the burden in favor of his employes, which the statute in that case imposed, I do not think I am at liberty to consider the subject as an original question, but am constrained to accept and apply the ruling in that case made, and for that reason I concur in the judgment now announced.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissents. \n\n\n\n","157":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRAVIS v. YALE & TOWNE MFG. CO.(1920)\nNo. 548\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 60, 61]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James S. Y. Ivins, of Albany, N. Y., and Jerome L. Cheney, First Deputy Atty. Gen., for appellant.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 60, 66]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis H. Porter and Archibald Cox, both of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 60, 72]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit in equity, brought in the District Court by appellee against appellant as comptroller of the state of New York to obtain an injunction restraining the enforcement of the Income Tax Law of that state ( chapter 627, Laws 1919) as against complainant, upon the ground of its repugnance to the Constitution of the United States because violating the interstate commerce clause, impairing the obligation of contracts, depriving citizens of the states of Connecticut and New Jersey employed by complainant of the privileges and immunities enjoyed by citizens of the state of New York, depriving complainant and its nonresident employes of their \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 73]\n\u00a0\n property without due process of law, and denying to such employes the equal protection of the laws. A motion to dismiss the bill-equivalent to a demurrer-was denied upon the ground that the act violated section 2 of article 4 of the Constitution by discriminating against nonresidents in the exemptions allowed from taxable income; an answer was filed, raising no question of fact; in due course there was a final decree in favor of complainant; and defendant took an appeal to this court under section 238, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1215).\n The act (section 351) imposes an annual tax upon every resident of the state with respect to his net income as defined in the act, at specified rates, and provides also:\n'A like tax is hereby imposed and shall be levied, collected and paid annually, at the rates specified in this section, upon and with respect to the entire net income as herein defined, except as hereinafter provided, from all property owned and from every business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in this state by natural persons not residents of the state.'\n\n Section 359 defines gross income, and contains this paragraph:\n'3. In the case of taxpayers other than residents, gross income includes only the gross income from sources within the state, but shall not include annuities, interest on bank deposits, interest on bonds, notes or other interest-bearing obligations or dividends from corporations, except to the extent to which the same shall be a part of income from any business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on in this state subject to taxation under this article.'\n\n In section 360 provision is made for deducting in the computation of net income expenses, taxes, losses, depreciation charges, etc.; but, by paragraph 11 of the same section:\n'In the case of a taxpayer other than a resident of the state the deductions allowed in this section shall be allowed only if, and to the extent that, they are connected with income arising from sources within the state. ...'\n\n By \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 74]\n\u00a0\n section 362, certain exemptions are allowed to any resident individual taxpayer, viz. in the case of a single person a personal exemption of $1, 000, in the case of the head of a family or a married person living with husband or wife, $2,000, and $200 additional for each dependent person under 18 years of age or mentally or physically defective. The next section reads as follows:\n'Sec. 363. Credit for Taxes in Case of Taxpayers Other Than Residents of the State.-Whenever a taxpayer other than a resident of the state has become liable to income tax to the state or country where he resides upon his net income for the taxable year, derived from sources within this state and subject to taxation under this article, the comptroller shall credit the amount of income tax payable by him under this article with such proportion of the tax so payable by him to the state or country where he resides as his income subject to taxation under this article bears to his entire income upon which the tax so payable to such other state or country was imposed; provided that such credit shall be allowed only if the laws of said state or country grant a substantially similar credit to residents of this state subject to income tax under such laws.'\n\n Section 366 in terms requires that every 'withholding agent' ( including employers) shall deduct and withhold 2 per centum from all salaries, wages, etc., payable to nonresidents, where the amount paid to any individual equals or exceeds $1,000 in the year, and shall pay the tax to the comptroller. This applies to a resident employe, also, unless he files a certificate showing his residence address within the state.\n Complainant, a Connecticut corporation doing business in New York and elsewhere, has employes who are residents, some of Connecticut, others of New Jersey, but are occupied in whole or in part in complainant's business in New York. Many of them have annual salaries or fixed compensation exceeding $1,000 per year, and the \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 75]\n\u00a0\n amount required by the act to be withheld by complainant from the salaries of such nonresident employes is in excess of $3,000 per year. Most of these persons are engaged under term contracts calling for stipulated wages or salaries for a specified period.\n The bill sets up that defendant, as comptroller of the state of New York, threatens to enforce the provisions of the statute against complainant, requires it to deduct and withhold from the salaries and wages payable to its employes residing in Connecticut or New Jersey and citizens of those states respectively, engaged in whole or in part in complainant's business in the state of New York, the taxes provided in the statute, and threatens to enforce against complainant the penalties provided by the act if it fails to do so; that the act is unconstitutional for the reasons above specified; and that, if complainant does withhold the taxes as required, it will be subjected to many actions by its employes for reimbursement of the sums so withheld. No question is made about complainant's right to resort to equity for relief; hence we come at once to the constitutional questions.\n That the state of New York has jurisdiction to impose a tax of this kind upon the incomes of nonresidents arising from any business, trade, profession, or occupation carried on within its borders, enforcing payment so far as it can by the exercise of a just control over persons and property within the state, as by garnishment of credits (of which the withholding provision of the New York law is the practical equivalent), and that such a tax, so enforced, does not violate the due process of law provision of the Fourteenth Amendment, is settled by our decision in Shaffer v. Carter, State Auditor, \n252 U.S. 37\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 221. 64 L. Ed . --, this day announced, involving the Income Tax Law of the state of Oklahoma. That there is no unconstitutional discrimination against citizens of other states in confining the deduction of expenses, losses, etc., in the case of nonresident taxpayers, to such as are \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 76]\n\u00a0\n connected with income arising from sources within the taxing state, likewise is settled by that decision.\n It is not here asserted that the tax is a burden upon interstate commerce; the point having been abandoned in this court.\n The contention that an unconstitutional discrimination against noncitizens arises out of the provision of section 366 confining the withholding at source to the income of nonresidents is unsubstantial. That provision does not in any wise increase the burden of the tax upon nonresidents, but merely recognizes the fact that as to them the state imposes no personal liability, and hence adopts a convenient substitute for it. See Bell's Gap Railroad Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 239\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 533.\n Nor has complainant on its own account any just ground of complaint by reason of being required to adjust its system of accounting and paying salaries and wages to the extent required to fulfill the duty of deducting and withholding the tax. This cannot be deemed an unreasonable regulation of its conduct of business in New York. Erie Railroad v. Pennsylvania, \n153 U.S. 628\n, 14 Sup. Ct. 952, cited in behalf of complainant, is not in point. In that case the state of Pennsylvania grantedto a railroad company organized under the laws of New York and having its principal place of business in that state the right to construct a portion of its road through Pennsylvania, upon prescribed terms which were assented to and complied with by the company and were deemed to constitute a contract, not subject to impairment or modification through subsequent legislation by the state of Pennsylvania except to the extent of establishing reasonable regulations touching the management of the business done and the property owned by the company in that state, not materially interfering with or obstructing the substantial enjoyment of the rights previously granted. Afterwards, Pennsylvania undertook by statute to re \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 77]\n\u00a0\n quire the company, when making payments of coupons upon bonds previously issued by it, payable at its office in the city of New York, to withhold taxes assessed by the state of Pennsylvania against residents of that state because of ownership of such bonds. The coupons were payable to bearer, and when they were presented for payment it was practically impossible for the company to ascertain who were the real owners, or whether they were owned by the same parties who owned the bonds. The statute was held to be an unreasonable regulation and hence to amount to an impairment of the obligation of the contract.\n In the case at bar complainant, although it is a Connecticut corporation and has its principal place of business in that state, is exercising the privilege of carrying on business in the state of New York without any contract limiting the state's power of regulation. The taxes required to be withheld are payable with respect to that portion only of the salaries of its employes which is earned within the state of New York. It might pay such salaries, or this portion of them, at its place of business in New York; and the fact that it may be more convenient to pay them in Connecticut is not sufficient to deprive the state of New York of the right to impose such a regulation. It is true complainant asserts that the act impairs the obligation of contracts between it and its employes; but there is no averment that any such contract made before the passage of the act required the wages or salaries to be paid in the state of Connecticut, or contained other provisions in any wise conflicting with the requirement of withholding.\n The District Court, not passing upon the above questions, held that the act, in granting to residents exemptions denied to nonresidents, violated the provision of section 2 of article 4 of the federal Constitution:\n'The citizens of each state shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states.'\n\n And, notwithstanding \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 78]\n\u00a0\n the elaborate and ingenious argument submitted by appellant to the contrary, we are constrained to affirm the ruling.\n The purpose of the provision came under consideration in Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180 (19 L. Ed. 357), where the court, speaking by Mr. Justice Field, said:\n'It was undoubtedly the object of the clause in question to place the citizens of each state upon the same footing with citizens of other states, so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those states are concerned. It relieves them from the disabilities of alienage in other states; it inhibits discriminating legislation against them by other states; it gives them the right of free ingress into other states, and egress from them; it insures to them in other states the same freedom possessed by the citizens of those states in the acquisition and enjoyment of property and in the pursuit of happiness; and it secures to them in other states the equal protection of their laws. It has been justly said that no provision in the Constitution has tended so strongly to constitute the citizens of the United States one people as this.'\n\n And in Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430 (20 L. Ed. 449), holding a discriminatory state tax upon nonresident traders to be void, the court, by Mr. Justice Clifford, said:\n'Beyond doubt those words [privileges and immunities] are words of very comprehensive meaning, but it will be sufficient to say that the clause plainly and unmistakably secures and protects the right of a citizen of one state to pass into any other state of the Union for the purpose of engaging in lawful commerce, trade, or business without molestation; to acquire personal property; to take and hold real estate; to maintain actions in the courts of the state; and to be exempt from any higher taxes or excises than are imposed by the state upon its own citizens.'\n\n Of course the terms 'resident' and 'citizen' are not synonymous, and in some cases the distinction is important \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 79]\n\u00a0\n (La Tourette v. McMaster, \n248 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 160); but a general taxing scheme such as the one under consideration, if it discriminates against all nonresidents, has the necessary effect of including in the discrimination those who are citizens of other states; and, if there be no reasonable ground for the diversity of treatment, it abridges the privileges and immunities to which such citizens are entitled. In Blake v. McClung, \n172 \nU.S. 239, 247\n, 19 S. Sup. Ct. 165, and \n176 \nU.S. 59, 67\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 307, the court held that a statute of Tennessee, declaring the terms upon which a foreign corporation might carry on business and hold property in that state, which gave to its creditors residing in Tennessee priority over all creditors residing elsewhere, without special reference to whether they were citizens or not, must be regarded as contravening the 'privileges and immunities' clause.\n The nature and effect of the crucial discrimination in the present case are manifest. Section 362, in the case of residents, exempts from taxation $1,000 of the income of a single person, $2,000 in the case of a married person, and $200 additional for each dependent. A nonresident taxpayer has no similar exemption; but by section 363, if liable to an income tax in his own state, including income derived from sources within New York and subject to taxation under this act, he is entitled to a credit upon the income tax otherwise payable to the state of New York by the same proportion of the tax payable to the state of his residence as his income subject to taxation by the New York act bears to his entire income taxed in his own state:\n'Provided, that such credit shall be allowed only if the laws of said state ... grant a substantially similar credit to residents of this state subject to income tax under such laws.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[252 U.S. 60, 80]\n\u00a0\n In the concrete, the particular incidence of the discrimination is upon citizens of Connecticut and New Jersey, neither of which states has an income tax law. A considerable number of complainant's employes, residents and citizens of one or the other of those states, spend their working time at its office in the city of New York, and earn their salaries there. The case is typical; it being a matter of common knowledge that from necessity, due to the geographical situation of that city, in close proximity to the neighboring states, many thousands of men and women, residents and citizens of those states, go daily from their homes to the city and earn their livelihood there. They pursue their several occupations side by side with residents of the state of New York-in effect competing with them as to wages, salaries, and other terms of employment. Whether they must pay a tax upon the first $1,000 or $2,000 of income, while their associates and competitors who reside in New York do not, makes a substantial difference. Under the circumstances as disclosed, we are unable to find adequate ground for the discrimination, and are constrained to hold that it is an unwarranted denial to the citizens of Connecticut and New Jersey of the privileges and immunities enjoyed by citizens of New York. This is not a case of occasional or accidental inequality due to circumstances personal to the taxpayer (see Amoskeag \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 81]\n\u00a0\n Savings Rank v. Purdy, \n231 U.S. 373\n, 393-394, 34 Sup. Ct. 114; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 543\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 2); but a general rule, operating to the disadvantage of all nonresidents including those who are citizens of the neighboring states, and favoring all residents including those who are citizens of the taxing state.\n\n It cannot be deemed to be counterbalanced by the provision of paragraph 3 of section 359, which excludes from the income of nonresident taxpayers--\n'annuities, interest on bank deposits, interest on bonds, notes, or other interest-bearing obligations or dividends from corporations, except to the extent to which the same shall be a part of income from any business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in this state subject to taxation under this article.'\n\n This provision is not so conditioned as probably to benefit nonresidents to a degree corresponding to the discrimination against them; it seems to have been designed rather (as is avowed in appellant's brief) to preserve the pre-eminence of New York City as a financial center.\n Nor can the discrimination be upheld, as is attempted to be done, upon the theory that nonresidents have untaxed income derived from sources in their home states or elsewhere outside of the state of New York, corresponding to the amount upon which residents of that state are exempt from taxation under this act. The discrimination is not conditioned upon the existence of such untaxed income; and it would be rash to assume that nonresidents taxable in New York under this law, as a class, are receiving additional income from outside sources equivalent to the amount of the exemptions that are accorded to citizens of New York and denied to them.\n In the brief submitted by the Attorney General of New York in behalf of appellant, it is said that the framers of the act, in embodying in it the provision for unequal treatment of the residents of other states with \n\n[252 U.S. 60, 82]\n\u00a0\n respect to the exemptions, looked forward to the speedy adoption of an income tax by the adjoining states, in which event injustice to their citizens on the part of New York could be avoided by providing similar exemptions similarly conditioned. This, however, is wholly speculative; New York has no authority to legislate for the adjoining states; and we must pass upon its statute with respect to its effect and operation in the existing situation. But besides, in view of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States, a discrimination by the state of New York against the citizens of adjoining states would not be cured were those states to establish like discriminations against citizens of the state of New York. A state may not barter away the right, conferred upon its citizens by the Constitution of the United States, to enjoy the privileges and immunities of citizens when they go into other states. Nor can discrimination be corrected by retaliation; to prevent this was one of the chief ends sought to be accomplished by the adoption of the Constitution.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS concurs in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Reading the statute literally, there would appear to be an additional discrimination against nonresidents, in that under section 366 the 'withholding agent' (employer) is required to withhold 2 per cent. from all salaries, wages, etc., payable to any individual nonresident amounting to $1,000 or more in the year; whereas by section 351 the tax upon residents (indeed, upon nonresidents likewise, so far as this section goes) is only 1 per centum upon the first $10,000 of net income. It is said, however, that the discrepancy arose through an amendment made to section 351 while the bill was pending in the Legislature; no corresponding amendment having been made in section 366. In view of this, and taking the whole of the act, together, the Attorney General has advised the comptroller that section 366 requires withholding of only 1 per centum upon the first $10,000 of income; and the comptroller has issued regulations to that effect. Hence we treat the discrepancy as if it did not exist. \n\n\n\n\n","158":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTURNER v. WADE(1920)\nNo. 29\nArgued: November 14, 1919Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Arthur G. Powell, John D. Little, Marion Smith, and Max F. Goldstein, all of Atlanta, Ga., for plaintiffs in error.\n Messrs. Graham Wright, of Rome, Ga., Clifford Walker, of Monroe, Ga., and Bennet & Harrell, of Quitman, Ga., for defendant in error. \n\n[254 U.S. 64, 65]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the constitutional validity under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of certain provisions of the Georgia Tax Equalization Act. Laws Ga. 1913, p. 123.\n The facts stated in the petition and amended petition are not disputed, and show that plaintiffs in error returned property for taxation at the value of $44,225. The county board of tax assessors, without hearing, raised the assessment to $80,650. Notice was then given to the plaintiffs in error of the increase. Following the statute, plaintiffs in error demanded arbitration, and named an arbitrator, the board selected an arbitrator, and the two selected a third. Upon meeting of the arbitrators, all agreed that the value assessed by the board was excessive. The arbitrator named by the plaintiffs in error fixed the valuation at $50,000. The arbitrator named by the board fixed the valuation at $66,000. The third arbitrator fixed the valuation at $63,000. The arbitrators could not agree; each adhering to his own view. All the arbitrators believed the assessment too high, but for lack of agreement the arbitration failed, and after 10 days from the date of naming of the arbitrator designated by the board had expired, the statutory requirement that the valuation of the board of assessors should stand affirmed was followed, and the collector demanded payment of the taxes in the sum of $80,640, the valuation fixed by the assessors. The tax collector issued execution for the taxes upon this valuation, and plaintiffs in error filed a petition in equity to prevent the enforcement of the execution, setting up the constitutional objection to which we have referred.\n The superior court of Georgia, on interlocutory hearing, granted an ad interim injunction. This action was revered by the Supreme Court of Georgia. Upon a second \n\n[254 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n writ of error from the Supreme Court of Georgia, the act was again held constitutional.\n The assessment by the board of assessors was made under section 6 of the act, which provides that the board of county assessors shall meet each year, within 10 days of the date of the closing of the tax returns, to receive and inspect the same. It is made the duty of the board to examine the returns of both real and personal property, and if at any time, in the opinion of the board, any taxpayer has omitted from his return any property which should be returned, or has failed to return property at its fair valuation, the board is authorized to correct such returns and assess and fix the fair valuation upon the property. When the corrections, changes, and equalizations have been made by the board, it is then its duty to give notice to any taxpayer of any changes made in his return, either personally or by leaving the same at his residence or place of business, or, in case of nonresidents by mail. The section further provides that, if the taxpayer is dissatisfied with the action of the board, he may within 10 days from the giving of said notice, give notice to the board that he demands an arbitration, giving at the same time the name of his arbitrator. Whereupon the board shall name its arbitrator within 3 days thereafter and the two shall select a third, a majority of whom shall fix the assessment upon the property upon which the taxpayer shall pay taxes, except so far as the same may be affected by the findings and orders of the state tax commissioner as in the act provided. Provision is made for qualification of arbitrators, and that they shall render their decision within 10 days from the date of naming of the arbitrator by the board of assessors; otherwise, the decision of the board of assessors shall stand and be binding in the premises. (The pertinent part of section 6 is given in the margin.1) \n\n[254 U.S. 64, 67]\n\u00a0\n In considering certain sections of the Georgia tax laws this court held, in Central of Georgia v. Wright, \n207 U.S. 127\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 47, 12 Ann. Cas. 463, that due process of law requires that after such notice as may be appropriate the taxpayer have opportunity to be heard as to the validity of a tax and the\n___ 'If any taxpayer is dissatisfied with the action of said board, he may within ten days from the giving of said notice in case of residents, and within twenty days in case of nonresidents of the county, give notice to said board that he demands an arbitration giving at the same time the name of his arbitrator; the board shall name its arbitrator within three ( 3) days thereafter and these two shall select a third, a majority of whom shall fix the assessments and the property on which said taxpayer shall pay taxes, and said decision shall be final, except so far as the same may be affected by the findings and orders of the state tax commissioner as hereinafter provided. The said arbitrators shall be freeholders of the county and shall render their decision within ten days from the date of the naming of the arbitrator by said board, else the decision of said board shall stand affirmed and shall be binding in the premises.' \n\n[254 U.S. 64, 68]\n\u00a0\n amount thereof, by giving him the right to appear for that purpose at some stage of the proceedings.

Ct. 708, wherein we said that if the Legislature of the state, instead of fixing the tax itself, commits to the subordinate body the duty of determining whether, and in what amount, and upon whom the tax shall be levied, due process of law requires that at some stage of the proceedings, before the tax becomes irrevocably fixed, the taxpayer must have the opportunity to be heard, of which he must have notice whether personal, by publication, or by some statute fixing the time and place of the hearing. See \n210 U.S. 385\n, and previous cases in this court cited on page 386, 28 Sup. Ct. 708. See, also, Coe v. Fertilizer Co., \n237 \nU.S. 413, 425\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 625.\n As we have understood the argument of the Attorney General, it is admitted that the provision for arbitration, under the facts herein shown, does not of itself afford due process of law. But it is now contended that section 7 saves the statute and provides for notice and hearing. Section 7 provides:\n'That it shall be the duty of the county board of tax assessors to diligently investigate and inquire into the property owned in the county for the purpose of ascertaining what property, real and personal, is subject to taxation in the county and to require its proper return for taxation.\n\n'The said board shall have authority to issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and to require the production by any person of all his books, papers and documents which may throw any light upon the question of the existence or liability of property of any class for taxation. If any witness, so subpoenaed, shall fail or refuse to answer questions propounded or shall fail or refuse to produce any such books, papers, or documents, such person shall be cited by said board to appear before the ordinary of the county,' etc. (Punishment as for a contempt is provided.) \n\n[254 U.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n This case was twice before the Supreme Court of Georgia. See 146 Ga. 600, 91 S. E. 690, in which the court held that when any change is made in the valuation of the property the taxpayer must be given notice of such change, and, if dissatisfied, may demand an arbitration, and have a hearing before arbitrators as provided for in the act, and that such hearing gave due process of law. In 147 Ga. 666, 95 S. E. 220, the previous decision is affirmed, and it was again held that, where any change is made in the valuation of the property of a taxpayer, he must be given notice of the change, and, if dissatisfied, demand arbitration and a hearing before arbitrators, as provided in the act, and the opinion refers to Vestel v. Edwards, 143 Ga. 368, 85 S. E. 187, wherein it was said that section 6 of the act was attacked as violative of the due process of law clause of the Constitution, for the reason, among others that the act requires the arbitration to be made within 10 days from the date of selection of the arbitrator by the tax assessors, and without making allowance for inability to agree upon a third assessor or arbitrator, or adequate time for the examination of property and the ascertainment of its value, or for any other cause which might render the arbitration impossible within the time specified in the act. The court said that this part of the act was not obnoxious to the state or federal Constitutions.\n\n In Vestel v. Edwards the court held that the appointment of a brother of one of the assessors as arbitrator disqualified him from acting as arbitrator, and in considering the statute we find no suggestion from the Georgia Supreme Court that a hearing was provided before the board of assessors. The court said that the provisions of a previous act (Acts 1910, p. 22), read in connection with the statute of 1913, provided that the ordinary might appoint the third arbitrator in event of inability to agree to such arbitrator by the two already selected. But this case presents no such situation. The arbitrators were agreed \n\n[254 U.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n upon. The arbitration failed because within the 10-day period fixed neither of the three arbitrators would recede from the valuation fixed by himself upon the property, and hence no majority award could be made. We are, therefore, unable to find in the decisions of the Supreme Court of Georgia that that court understood section 7 to provide for the notice and hearing required by due process of law. Therefore, looking to the sections of the statute for ourselves, selves, we are forced to the conclusion that, reading the provisions together, being parts of one and the same act, they clearly show that the board of assessors was not required to give any notice to the taxpayer, nor was opportunity given him to be heard as of right before the assessment was finally made against him. But provision was made for notice of the assessment to the taxpayer after it was made, and in event of his dissatisfaction the arbitration was to afford a hearing to him. Such hearing was all that the statute contemplated that the taxpayer should have.\n In the present case, as the facts already stated show, the taxpayer is subject to an assessment made without notice and hearing. In that situation we are clear that the case comes within the decision of this court in Central of Georgia v. Wright, supra, and kindred cases, and not within that line of cases wherein the statute has fixed the time and place of hearing with opportunity to the taxpayer to appear and be heard upon the extent and validity of the assessment against him.\n Entertaining this view, it follows that the assessment of the board of assessors ought to have been enjoined, because section 6 of the act, as construed and applied in this case, denies to the complaining taxpayer due process of law. It follows that the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia must be reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 6.

C., for plaintiff in error.\n The Attorney General and Assistant Attorney General Nebeker, for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the consideration of a mandamus brought by plaintiff in error, hereinafter called relator, against the Secretary of the Interior.\n The proceedings were instituted in the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia by petition, and its essential allegations states narratively are as follows:\n The lands in question are within a township which was reserved under an act passed August 18, 1894 (28 Stat. 394 [Comp. St.  4876]) from adverse appropriation by settlement or otherwise except under rights found to exist of prior inception, for a period to extend from the application for survey until the the expiration of 60 days from the date of the filing of the township plat of the survey in the proper district land office.\n The plat of the survey was filed in the proper district land office May 17, 1915. During the 60-day period, nor since, the described land has not been selected by the state. On June 15, 1915, the relator settled on the land and on July 17, 1915, was still actually residing thereon \n\n[254 U.S. 343, 345]\n\u00a0\n with the bona fide intention and purpose of appropriating and entering it under the homestead laws of the United States, in the event that the state of Montana did not select the same in accordance with the statute.\n On the latter date relator filed in the land office perfect application for the land as a homestead, which the register and receiver rejected for the stated reason that on July 16, 1915, they had permitted one George E. Kennedy to make a homestead entry of the lands.\n The permission for the entry of Kennedy rested wholly upon an application made May 25, 1915, at a time when the lands were reserved as before stated.\n On May 25, 1915, the register and receiver rejected Kennedy's application in the following terms:\n'Rejected May 25, 1915, because land not open to entry until July 17, 1915, except to state of Montana and settlers prior to March 10, 1910.'\n\n On June 4, 1915, the register and receiver made the following notation upon Kennedy's application:\n'Suspended June 4, 1915, pending preference right of state of Montana. Rejection of May 25, 1915, hereby revoked.'\n\n Theretofore it had been the consistent and uniform practice of the General Land office to reject any and all filings such as Kennedy's.\n Relator appealed from the rejection of his application to the General Land Office and that office affirmed the decision of the register and receiver, and relator appealed to the Secretary of the Interior, who on July 28, 1916, affirmed the decision of the General Land Office and held that 'Kennedy's application, being prior in time, is also prior in right.'\n The Secretary in his decision did not refer to any of the asserted prior decisions or practice, but arbitrarily disregarded the mandate and will of Congress expressed in the Act of August 18, 1894\n\n\n Relator at the moment of the expiration of the 60-day \n\n[254 U.S. 343, 346]\n\u00a0\n limit was actually residing on the land with the intention of making entry thereof under the homestead laws, and the right to make such entry after the 60-day period was secured to him by such residence by the provisions of the third section of the Act of May 14, 1880 (21 Stat. 140 [Comp. St.  4538]), and the uniform decisions of the Department of the Interior under said act, and the Secretary of the Interior has arbitrarily denied to him the exercise and enjoyment of that right; and in ruling that Kennedy had acquired a right under the homestead laws relator is deprived of the benefit to him of performance by the Secretary of the Interior of a purely ministerial duty, and he prays that a writ of mandamus be issued, directed to the Secretary to approve his, the relator's application, and deliver to him the proper evidence thereof. General relief is also prayed.\n An order to show cause against the petition was issued and served on the Secretary, to which he made reply affirming the legality of the action of the local land office, and the decision of the General Land Office affirming it, and his decision of concurrence.\n He denies that there had been any ruling by the Secretary of the Interior that during the 60-day period applications for homestead entry must be rejected. Such, however, he admits, may have been the ruling by the local land office and even by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, but he stated that from August 31, 1910, the construction of the act was pending before the Secretary upon an appeal from a decision of the Commissioner, that a decision upon said appeal is reported in 45 Land Dec. 37, under the title of Northern Pacific Railway Company v. State of Idaho, dated April 12, 1916, and that he decided that selections during such period should not be rejected, but held suspended until final adjudication of the rights of the state.\n He avers that such is the proper construction of the act, and that the act being one of the land laws of the United States, its construction as well as the determination of all \n\n[254 U.S. 343, 347]\n\u00a0\n equitable rights of parties under it, is within the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior so long as the legal title of the land yet remains in the United States (and that it appears on the face of relator's petition that the legal title of the land in controversy is still in the United States) and involves the exercise of judgment and discretion, not reviewable by any court on direct proceeding either by mandamus or in equity.\n He prays that the rule to show cause be discharged.\n Relator demurred to the return and in passing upon it the court observed that there were two questions in the case-one, whether the facts exhibited a case for mandamus of the Secretary, that is, 'in apparent defiance of the law, acting capriciously or arbitrarily or beyond the scope of the administrative authority confided to him'; the other, the construction of the act of 1894.\n To the first question the court answered negatively, and to the second question replied, that 'independently of the question of the propriety of reviewing the action of the Secretary of the Interior in the pending case, it would seem that the decision rendered by him was one entirely permissible under the law.' The demurrer to the return was therefore overruled. Relator electing to stand upon it, the rule was discharged and the petition dismissed.\n This action was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.\n It is manifest from this statement that the petition presents a controversy over the true construction of the act of 1894. From the act, and the Secretary's decision, it is apparent that the latter was not arbitrary or capricious, but rested on a possible construction of the act, and one that the reported decisions of the Land Department show is being applied in other cases. The direction of the act that the lands be reserved 'from any adverse appropriation' means necessarily an appropriation adverse to the state, and this gives color to the Secretary's view. He could not administer or apply the act without construing \n\n[254 U.S. 343, 348]\n\u00a0\n it, and its construction involved the exercise of judgment and discretion. The view for which the relator contends was not so obviously and certainly right as to make it plainly the duty of the Secretary to give effect to it. The relator, therefore, is not entitled to a writ of mandamus. Riverside Oil Co. v. Hitchcock, \n190 U.S. 316\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 698; Ness v. Fisher, \n223 U.S. 683\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 356.\n We need not consider the fact that Kennedy, whose application was sustained, is not a party to the petition (see Litchfield v. Register and Receiver, 9 Wall. 575, 578); nor need we consider whether a more appropriate remedy will be open to the relator. See Brown v. Hitchcock, \n173 U.S. 475\n, 19 Sup. Ct. 485; Minnesota v.

The petition was dismissed by the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia and the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Appeals. We are not called upon to consider the antecedent facts of the petitioners' case as all that is material can be stated in a few words. Rights as a member of the Nation depend upon the approved rolls. March 4, 1907, was fixed by statute as the time when the rolls were to be completed by the Secretary of the Interior and his previously existing jurisdiction to approve enrollment then ceased. Act of April 26, 1906, c. 1876,  2, 34 Stat. 137, 138. Before that date the petitioners had on file an application for enrollment, hearings had been had before the proper tribunal, a favorable report had been made to the Secretary and the Secretary had written a letter to the Commissioner to the Five Civilized Tribes, saying, 'Your decision is hereby affirmed.' But on the last day, March 4, 1907, the Secretary addressed another communication to the same official rescinding the former letter to \n\n[253 U.S. 209, 211]\n\u00a0\n him, and reversing his decision. It was ordered that if the petitioners' names were on the rolls they should be stricken off. The Secretary gave no reasons for his action but it is suggested that he acted under mistakes of law and fact, and it is argued that when the first letter was written the petitioners' rights were fixed.\n The last is the only point in the case and with regard to that it is argued that this reversal of the first decision without a hearing was a denial of due process of law. It is not denied that the Secretary might have declined to affirm the decision below in the first instance, and that having been his power, the only question is when it came to an end. While the case was before him he was free to change his mind, and he might do so none the less that he had stated an opinion in favor of one side or the other. He did not lose his power to do the conclusive act, ordering and approving an enrollment, Garfield v. Goldsby, \n211 U.S. 249\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 62, until the act was done. New Orleans v.

The Secretary was the final judge whether they should be, and they cannot be ordered to be put on now, upon a suggestion that the Secretary made a mistake or that he came very near to giving the petitioners the rights they claim.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S EX REL KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN R.

Moore, of Kansas City, Mo., and Frank W. Swacker, of Washington, D. C., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Patrick J. Farrell, of Washington, D. C., for defendant in error.\n\n\n\n[252 U.S. 178, 182]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Act of Congress of March 1, 1913 (37 Stat. 701), amending the 'Act to Regulate Commerce,' imposed the duty upon the Interstate Commerce Commission (section 19a [Comp. St.  8591]) to 'investigate, ascertain, and report the value of all the property owned or used by every common carrier subject to the provisions of this act.' Specifying the steps to be taken in the performance of the general duties thus imposed, the same section commanded as follows:\n'First. In such investigation said Commission shall ascertain and report in detail as to each piece of property owned or used by said carrier for its purposes as a common carrier, ... the cost of reproduction new, the cost of reproduction less depreciation, and an analysis of the methods by which these several costs are obtained, and the reason for their differences, if any. ...\n\n'Second. Such investigation and report shall state in detail and separately from improvements the original cost of all lands, rights of way, and terminals owned or used for the purposes of a common carrier, and ascertained as of the time of dedication to public use, and the present value of the same, and separately the original and present cost of condemnation and damages or of purchase in excess of such original cost or present value. ...\n\n'Fifth ... [seventh paragraph]. Whenever the Commission shall have completed the tentative valuation of the property of any common carrier, as herein directed, and before such valuation shall become final, the Commission shall give notice by registered letter to the said carrier, ... stating the valuation placed upon the several \n\n[252 U.S. 178, 183]\n\u00a0\n classes of property of said carrier, and shall allow thirty days in which to file a protest of the same with the Commission. ...\n\n'If notice of protest is filed the Commission shall fix a time for hearing the same, and shall proceed as promptly as may be to hear and consider any matter relative and material thereto. ... All final valuations by the commission and the classification thereof shall be published and shall be prima facie evidence of the value of the property in all proceedings under the Act to Regulate Commerce as of the date of the fixing thereof, and in all judicial proceedings for the enforcement of the act approved February 4, 1887, commonly known as 'the Act to Regulate Commerce,' and the various acts amendatory thereof, and in all judicial proceedings brought to enjoin, set aside, annul or suspend, in whole or in part, any order of the Interstate Commerce Commission.'\n\n Pursuant to these requirements the Commission proceeded to investigate and report the value of the property of the Kansas City Southern Railway Company. Upon completing a tentative valuation, the Commission gave the notice required by the statute to the railway company, which thereupon filed a protest against such valuation on the ground that in making it the Commission had failed to consider and include the 'present cost of condemnation and damages or of purchase in excess of such original cost or present value.' Upon the subject of the protest, the railway company took a large amount of testimony and much was also taken by the Commission, both parties having incurred considerable expense in the matter.\n Pending this situation, in order that the excessive expense of taking each individual parcel and showing what it would cost to acquire it or a right of way over it by purchase or condemnation might be avoided, an agreement \n\n[252 U.S. 178, 184]\n\u00a0\n was entered into between the Director of the Bureau of Valuation of the Commission, C. A. Prouty, and the railway company, that in the event the Commission should decide that evidence upon the cost of acquiring land by purchase or condemnation would be received by it, the Bureau of Valuation would recommend to the Commission the percentage or multiplier of the naked value of the land, to be used for the purpose of reaching the railway cost of acquiring the same.\n At that time there was also pending a protest concerning a tentative valuation made by the Commission as to the property of the Texas Midland Railroad Company, raising the same question as to error committed in failing to carry out the provisions of the statute concerning the present cost of condemnation, etc., in which case the Commission overruled the protest, holding that the provision of the statute in question was not susceptible of being enforced or acted upon for reasons stated by the Commission in part as follows (I. C. C. Val. Rep. 1, p. 54 et seq.):\n'However, the direction in paragraph 'Second' for the ascertainment of the present cost of condemnation and damages or of purchase in effect calls for a finding as to the cost of reproduction of these lands. Must this be done, and can this be done? It seems elementary that the cost of reproduction can be estimated only by assuming that the thing in question is to be produced again, and that if it is to be produced again, it is to be taken as not existent. It seems sophistry to contend that the lands of the railroad can be produced again at a cost to the railroad without first making the assumption that they are no longer lands of the railroad; and this necessary assumption carries with it the mental obliteration of the railroad itself.\n\n'Considerable testimony was produced to the effect that in the acquisition of a railroad right of way it is necessary for the carrier to pay sums in excess of the value of \n\n[252 U.S. 178, 185]\n\u00a0\n the land if measured by the present or market value of similar contiguous lands, and this because of the elements which have been enumerated and embraced in the protest, such as cost of acquisition, damages to the severed property, cost of buildings and other improvements, accrued taxes and various incidental rights. ...\n\n'We are unable to distinguish between what is suggested by the carrier in this record and nominally required by the act and what was condemned by the court (in the Minnesota Rate Cases [\n230 U.S. 352\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48, L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18]) as beyond the possibility of rational determination; nor is there any essential difference in the actual methods there employed and those now urged upon us. Before we can report figures as ascertained, we must have a reasonable foundation for our estimate, and when, as here, if the estimate can be made only upon inadmissible assumptions, and upon impossible hypotheses, such as those pointed out by the Supreme Court in the opinion quoted, our duty to abstain from reporting as an ascertained fact that which is incapable of rational ascertainment, is clear. ...\n\n'Because of the impossibility of making the self-contradictory assumptions which the theory requires when applied to the carrier's lands, we are unable to report the reproduction cost of such lands or its equivalent, the present cost of acquisition and damages, or of purchase in excess of present value. The present value of lands as found by us appears in the final valuation, appended hereto.'\n\n Applying the ruling thus made to the protest which was pending in this case, the Commission gave notice to the railway that the agreement made with the Director of the Bureau of Valuation concerning the method of proof would be treated as not further operative; and thereafter when an offer was made by the railway before an examiner \n\n[252 U.S. 178, 186]\n\u00a0\n of the Commission of further testimony concerning the subject in hand, it was excluded because in conflict with the ruling announced in the Midland Case. The Commission sustained this action of the examiner on the ground that that officer had rightly held that the ruling in the Midland Case was controlling; and the Commission therefore decided that no further testimony on the particular subject would be heard in this case, and that it would make no report concerning that subject.\n This suit was then brought to obtain a mandamus to compel the Commission to hear the proof and act upon it under the statute. The amended petition, after reciting the facts as we have outlined them and making the appropriate formal averments to justify resort to mandamus, alleged:\n'That the refusal of respondent to investigate and find such present cost of condemnation and damages or of purchase in excess of original cost or present value of relator's lands will result in great wrong and injury to relator; by way of illustration, such refusal will result in a finding by respondent of a value of but $60,000 with respect to parcels of land acquired by relator by judicial award in condemnation proceedings during four years immediately preceding such valuation at an actual cost to relator of $180,000, and in the aggregate will result in a finding with respect to said lands at least $5,000,000 less than the value so directed by the act of Congress above mentioned to be found.'\n\n It was further averred, with considerable elaboration, that the petitioner stood ready to produce proof to meet the requirements of the statute which was neither speculative nor impossible to be acted upon, since it would conform to the character of proof usually received in judicial proceedings involving the exercise of eminent domain.\n The Commission in its answer, either stating or conceding \n\n[252 U.S. 178, 187]\n\u00a0\n the history of the case as we have recited it, and summarily reiterating the grounds for the refusal by the Commission to receive the proof or report concerning it, challenged the right to the relief sought. A demurrer to the answer as stating no defense was overruled by the trial court, which denied relief without opinion. In the Court of Appeals, two judges sitting, the judgment of the trial court was affirmed by a divided court, also without opinion, and the case is here on writ of error to review that judgment.\n It is obvious from the statement we have made, as well as from the character of the remedy invoked, mandamus, that we are required to decide, not a controversy growing out of duty performed under the statute, but one solely involving an alleged refusal to discharge duties which the statute exacts. Admonishing, as this does, that the issue before us is confined to a consideration of the face of the statute and the nonaction of the Commission in a matter purely ministerial, it serves also to furnish a ready solution of the question to be decided, since it brings out in bold contrast the direct and express command of the statute to the Commission to act concerning the subject in hand, and the Commission's unequivocal refusal to obey such command.\n It is true that the Commission held that its nonaction was caused by the fact that the command of the statute involved a consideration by it of matters 'beyond the possibility of rational determination,' and called for 'inadmissible assumptions,' and the indulging in 'impossible hypotheses' as to subjects 'incapable of rational ascertainment,' and that such conclusions were the necessary consequence of the Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 U.S. 352\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 729, 48 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18.\n We are of opinion, however, that, considering the face of the statute and the reasoning of the Commission, it results that the conclusion of the Commission was erroneous, an error which was exclusively caused by a mistaken \n\n[252 U.S. 178, 188]\n\u00a0\n conception by the Commission of its relation to the subject, resulting in an unconscious disregard on its part of the power of Congress and an unwitting assumption by the Commission of authority which it did not possess. And the significance which the Commission attibuted to the ruling in the Minnesota Rate Cases, even upon the assumption that its view of the ruling in those cases was not a mistaken one, but illustrates in a different form the disregard of the power of Congress which we have just pointed out, since, as Congress indisputably had the authority to impose upon the Commission the duty in question, it is impossible to conceive how the Minnesota Rate ruling could furnish ground for refusing to carry out the commands of Congress, the cogency of which consideration is none the less manifest, though it be borne in mind that the Minnesota Rate Cases were decided after the passage of the act in question.\n Finally, even if it be further conceded that the subject-matter of the valuations in question which the act of Congress expressly directed to be made necessarily opened a wide range of proof and called for the exercise of close scrutiny and of scrupulous analysis in its consideration and application, such assumption, we are of opinion, affords no basis for refusing to enforce the act of Congress, or what is equivalent thereto, of exerting the general power which the act of Congress gave, and at the same time disregarding the essential conditions imposed by Congress upon its exercise.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed, with directions to reverse that of the Supreme Court, and direct the Supreme Court to grant a writ of mandamus in conformity with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","162":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

King, of Atlanta, Ga., for the United States.[ U S v. A. Schrader's Son, Inc. \n252 U.S. 85\n (1920) ]\n\n\n[252 U.S. 85, 89]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frank M. Avery, of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 85, 94]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant in error, a New York corporation, manufactured at Brooklyn, under letters patent, valves, gauges and other accessories for use in connection with automobile tires, and regularly sold and shipped large quantities of these to manufacturers and jobbers throughout the United States. It was indicted in the District Court, Northern District of Ohio, for engaging in a combination rendered criminal by section 1 of the Sherman Act of July 2, 1890 (26 Stat. 209, c. 6471), which declares illegal 'every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, or with foreign nations.' After interpreting the indictment as indicated by quotations from its opinion which follow, the District Court sustained a demurrer thereto, basing the judgment upon construction of that act (264 Fed. 175):\n'The ubstantive allegations of this indictment are that defendant is engaged in manufacturing valves, valve parts, pneumatic pressure gauges, and various other accessories; that it sells and ships large quantites of such articles to tire manufactures and jobbers in the Northern district of Ohio and throughout the United States; that these tire manufacturers and jobbers resell and reship large quantities of these products to (a) jobbers and vehicle manufacturers , (b) retail dealers, and (c) to the public, both within and without the respective states into which the products are shipped; that these acts have been committed within three years next preceding the presentation of this indictment and within this district; that the defendant executed, and \n\n[252 U.S. 85, 95]\n\u00a0\n caused all the said tire manufacturers and jobbers to whom it sold its said products to execute with it, uniform contracts concerning resales of such products; that every manufacturer and jobber was informed by the defendant and well knew when executing such contracts that identical contracts were being executed and adhered to by the other manufacturers and jobbers; that these contracts thus executed purported to contain a grant of a license from the defendant to resell its said products at prices fixed by it to (a) jobbers and vehicle manufacturers similarly licensed, (b) retail dealers, and (c) the consuming public; that all these contracts provided (that the) [ concerning] products thus sold to tire manufacturers and jobbers ( provided) that they should not resell such products at prices other than those fixed by the defendant. Copies of these contracts are identified by exhibit numbers and attached to the indictment. It is further charged that the defendant furnished to the tire manufacturers and jobbers who entered into such contracts lists of uniform prices, such as are shown in said exhibits, which the defendant fixed for the resale of its said products to (a) jobbers and vehicle manufacturers, (b) retail dealers, and (c) the consuming public, respectively; and that the defendant uniformly refused to sell and ship its products to tire manufacturers and jobbers who did not enter into such contracts and adhere to the uniform resale prices fixed and listed by the defendant. Further, that tire manufacturers and jobbers in the Northern district of Ohio and throughout the United States uniformly resold defendant's products at uniform prices fixed by the defendant and uniformly refused to resell such products at lower pricers, whereby competition was suppressed and the prices of such products to retail dealers and the consuming public were maintained and enhanced. ...\n\n'Thus it will be observed that the contract, combination, \n\n[252 U.S. 85, 96]\n\u00a0\n or conspiracy charged comes merely to this: That the defendant has agreed, combined, or conspired with tire manufacturers and with jobbers by the selling or agreeing to sell valves, valve parts, pneumatic pressure gauges, and various accessories, with the further understanding or agreement that in making resales thereof they will sell only at certain fixed prices. It will be further observed that the retailers, to whom the jobbers in ordinary course of trade would naturally sell rather than to the consuming public, and who in turn sell and distribute these articles to and among the ultimate consumers, are not included within the alleged combination or conspiracy. ...\n\n'The so-called license agreements, exhibited with the indictment, are in my opinion, both in substance and effect, only selling agreements. The title to the valves, valve parts, pneumatic pressure gauges, and other automobile accessories passed to the so-called licensees and licensed jobbers.'\n\n The Court further said:\n'Defendant urges that there is a manifest inconsistency between the reasoning, if not between the holdings, of these two cases [Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., \n220 U.S. 373\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 376, and United States v. Colgate Co., \n250 U.S. 300\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 465]; that if the basic principles a nounced in the latter case are to be taken in the ordinary sense imported by the language the present case falls within the Colgate Case, and that, properly construed, neither section 1 nor 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Law makes the defendant's conduct a crime. The Dr. Miles Medical Company Case, standing alone, would seem to require that this demurrer be overruled, and a holding that the Sherman Anti-Trust Law is violated and a crime committed, merely upon a showing of the making by defendant and two or more jobbers of the agreements set up in the indictment, certainly if the jobbers were competitors in the \n\n[252 U.S. 85, 97]\n\u00a0\n same territory. That case has been frequently cited as establishing this proposition. ... The retailers are not in the present case included. They may compete freely with one another and may even give away the articles purchased by them. No restriction is imposed which prevents them from selling to the consumer at any price, even though it be at a ruinous sacrifice and less than the price made to them by the jobber, Personally, and with all due respect, permit me to say that I can see no real difference upon the facts between the Dr. Miles Medical Company Case and the Colgate Company Case. The only difference is that in the former the arrangement for marketing its product was put in writing, whereas in the latter the wholesale and retail dealers observed the prices fixed by the vendor. This is a distinction without a difference. The tacit acquiescence of the wholesalers and retailers in the prices thus fixed is the equivalent for all practical purposes of an express agreement. ...\n\n'Granting the fundamental proposition stated in the Colgate Case, that the manufacturer has an undoubted right to specify resale prices and refuse to deal with any one who fails to maintain the same, or, as further stated, the act does not restrict the long-recognized right of a trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to the parties with whom he will deal, and that he, of course, may announce in advance the circumstances under which he will refuse to sell, it seems to me that it is a distinction without a difference to say that he may do so by the subterfuges and devices set forth in the opinion and not violate the Sherman Anti-Trust Act: yet if he had done the same thing in the form of a written agreement, adequate only to effectuate the same purpose, he would be guilty of a violation of the law. Manifestly, therefore, the decision in the Dr. Miles Medical Case must rest upon some other ground than the mere fact that there were \n\n[252 U.S. 85, 98]\n\u00a0\n agreements between the manufacturer and the wholesalers. ...\n\n'The point, however, which I wish to emphasize is that the allegations of this indictment, not alleging any purpose, or facts from which such a purpose can be inferred, to monopolize interstate trade, within the prohibition and meaning of section 2 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act and the last clause of section 2 of the Clayton Act, does not charge a crime under section 1 of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act as that act should be construed.'\n\n Our opinion in United States v. Colgate Co. declared quite plainly:\n That upon a writ of error under the Criminal Appeals Act (34 Stat. 1246, c. 2564 [Comp. St.  1704]) 'we have no authority to revise the mere interpretation of an indictment and are confined to ascertaining whether the court in a case under review erroneously construed the statute.' 'We must accept that court's interpretation of the indictments and confine our review to the question of the construction of the statute involved in its decision.' That we were confronted by an uncertain interpretation of an indictment itself couched in rather vague and general language, the meaning of the opinion below being the subject of serious controversy. The 'defendant maintains that, looking at the whole opinion, it plainly construes the indictment as alleging only recognition of the manufacturer's undoubted right to specify resale prices and refuse to deal with any one who failed to maintain the same.' 'The position of the defendant is more nearly in accord with the whole opinion and must be accepted; and as counsel for the government were careful to state on the argument that this conclusion would require affirmation of the judgment below, an extended discussion of the principles involved is unnecessary.'\n And further:\n'The purpose of the Sherman Act is to prohibit monopolies, contracts, and combinations which probably would unduly interfere with \n\n[252 U.S. 85, 99]\n\u00a0\n the free exercise of their rights by those engaged, or who wish to engage, in trade and commerce-in a word, to preserve the right of freedom to trade. In the absence of any purpose to create or maintain a monopoly, the act does not restrict the long-recognized right of trader or manufacturer engaged in an entirely private business, freely to exercise his own independent discretion as to parties with whom he will deal. And, of course, he may announce in advance the circumstances under which he will refuse to sell.'\n\n The court below misapprehended the meaning and effect of the opinion and judgment in that cause. We had no intention to overrule or modify the doctrine of Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., where the effort was to destroy the dealers' independent discretion through restrictive agreements. Under the interpretation adopted by the trial court and necessarily accepted by us, the indictment failed to charge that Colgate Company made agreements, either express or implied, which undertook to obligate vendees to observe specified resale prices, and it was treated 'as alleging only recognition if the manufacturer's undoubted right to specity resale prices and refuse to deal with any one who fails to maintain the same.'\n It seems unnecessary to dwell upon the obvious difference between the situation presented when a manufacturer merely indicates his wishes concerning prices and declines further dealings with all who fail to observe them, and one where he enters into agreements-whether express or implied from a course of dealing or other circumstances-with all customers throughout the different states which undertake to bind them to observe fixed resale prices. In the first, the manufacturer but exercises his independent discretion concerning his customers and there is no contract or combination which imposes any limitation on the purchaser. In the second, the parties \n\n[252 U.S. 85, 100]\n\u00a0\n are combined through agreements designed to take away dealers' control of their own affairs and thereby destroy competition and restrain the free and natural flow of trade amongst the states.\n The principles approved in Dr. Miles Medical Co. v. Park & Sons Co., should have been applied. The judgment below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE concurs in the result.\n Mr. Justice HOLMES and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Comp.

Needham, of Washington, D. C., and Alexander C. King, Sol. Gen., of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\n Messrs. Roscoe Hupper, of New York City, and Theodore W. Reath, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A petition was filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York by numerous interstate carriers and carriers by water against the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission to set aside an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission dated March 14, 1919, requiring the carriers to use two certain modified bills of landing, one pertaining to domestic and the other to export transportation. The cause came on for hearing upon application for a temporary injunction and upon a motion to dismiss the petition. The hearing was had before three judges, a Circuit Judge and two District Judges. A majority concurred in holding that the Interstate Commerce Commission had no authority to prescribe the terms of carrier's bills of lading, and that in any event there was no power to prescribe an inland bill of lading depriving the carriers of the benefits of certain statutes of the United States limiting the liability of vessel owners. Alaska S. S. Co. v. U. S. (D. C.) 259 Fed. 713. One of the District Judges dissented, holding that the Commission had the power to prescribe bills of lading, and that the particular bills of lading in question were within the authority of the Commission. An order was entered refusing to dismiss the petition, and an injunction pendente lite was granted. From this order an appeal was taken directly to this court under the statute of 1913. 38 Stat. 220. \n\n[253 U.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n It appears that the matter in controversy as to the authority of the Commission and the character of the bills of lading were subjects of much inquiry before the Commission, where hearings were had, and an elaborate report upon the proposed changes in carriers' bills of lading resulted in the adoption by the Commission of the two bills of lading. 52 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 671.\n Pending this appeal Congress passed on February 28, 1920, the act known as the 'Transportation Act of 1920,' which terminated the federal control of railroads, and amended in various particulars previous acts to regulate interstate commerce. In view of this act of Congress this court on March 22, 1920, entered an order requesting counsel to file briefs concerning the effect of the act upon this cause. Briefs have been filed, and we now come to consider the altered situation arising from the new legislation, and what effect should be given to it in the disposition of this case.\n The thing sought to be accomplished by the prosecution of this suit was an annulment of the order of the Commission, and an injunction restraining the putting into effect and operation of such order, which prescribe the two forms of bills of lading. The temporary injunction granted was against putting into effect the Commission's order prescribing the forms of the bills of lading.\n The Transportation Act of 1920, passed pending this appeal, makes it evident (and it is in fact conceded in the brief filed by appellants) that changes will be required in both forms of bills of lading in order that they may conform to the requirements of the statute. We need not now discuss the details of these changes. It is sufficient to say that the act requires them as to both classes of bills. We are of opinion that the necessary effect of the enactment of this statute is to make the cause a moot one. In the appellant's brief it is insisted that the power of the Commission to prescribe bills of lading is till existent, \n\n[253 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n and has not been modified by the provisions of the new law. But that is only one of the questions in the case. It is true that the determination of it underlies the right of the Commission to prescribe new forms of bills of lading, but it is a settled principle in this court that it will determine only actual matters in controversy essential to the decision of the particular case before it. Where by an act of the parties, or a subsequent law, the existing controversy has come to an end, the case becomes moot and should be treated accordingly. However convenient it might be to have decided the question of the power of the Commission to require the carriers to comply with an order prescribing bills of lading, this court 'is not empowered to decide moot questions or abstract propositions, or to declare, for the government of future cases, principles or rules of law which cannot affect the result as to the thing in issue in the case before it. No stipulation of parties or counsel, whether in the case before the court or in any other case, can enlarge the power, or affect the duty, of the court in this regard.' California v. San Pablo & Tulare R. Co., \n149 \nU.S. 308, 314\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 876, 878 (37 L. Ed. 747); United States v. Hamburg American Line, \n239 \nU.S. 466, 475\n, 476 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 212, and previous cases of this court therein cited.\n In the present case what we have said makes it apparent that the complainants do not now need an injunction to prevent the Commission from putting in force bills of lading in the form prescribed. The subsequent legislation necessitates the adoption of different forms of bills in the event that the power of the Commission be sustained. This legislation having that effect renders the case moot. Berry v. Davis, \n242 U.S. 468\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 208.\n In our view the proper course is to reverse the order, and remand the cause to the court below with directions to dismiss the petition, without costs to either party, and without prejudice to the right of the complainants to assail in the future any order of the Commission prescribing \n\n[253 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n bills of lading after the enactment of the new legislation. United States v. Hamburg American Line, supra; Berry v. Davis, supra.\n And it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. ATLANTIC DREDGING CO.(1920)\nNo. 214\nArgued: March 16, 1920Decided: April 26, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Action in the Court of Claims to recover the sum of $545,121.72 from the United States on account of expenditures and loss caused, it is alleged, in the execution of a contract which it was induced to enter into by false and misleading statements of the officers of the United States in charge of excavations in the Delaware river.\n In pursuance of advertisement by the United States through Col. Kuhn, the dredging company entered into a contract to do a certain part of the work for the sum of 12.99 cents per cubic yard, scow measurement.\n Sealed proposals were required by the advertisement and it was stated that information could be had on application, and bidders were invited to base their dids upon the specifications, which had been prepared by, and were submitted by the government.\n The specifications stated that the depth of the channel to be dredged was 35 feet, and under the heading 'Quality or Character of the Material' contained the following:\n'The material to be removed is believed to be mainly mud, or mud with an admixture of fine sand, except from station 54 to station 55+144, at the lower end of West Horseshoe Range (the latter is not included in the contract) where the material is firm mud, sand, and gravel or cobbles.'\n\n It was stated that--\n'Bidders were expected to examine the work, however, and decide for themselves as to its character and to make their bids accordingly, as the United States does not guarantee the accuracy of this description.' \n\n[253 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n The further statement was that--\n\n'A number of test borings have been made in all of the areas where dredging is to be done under these specifications, and the results thereof may be seen by intending bidders on the maps on file in this office. (See paragraph 17.) No guaranty is given as to correctness of these borings in representing the character of the bottom over the entire vicinity in which they were taken, although the general information given thereby is believed to be trustworthy.'\n\n To ascertain the character of the material to be dredged the government officers had subjected the bottom of the river to certain borings, called, according to their manner of being made, 'test borings and wash borings,' and the results thereof were correctly reported and recorded on the log or field notes at the time-that is, that the probe had penetrated or had not penetrated-but there was nothing on the map exhibited to bidders showing the field notes taken at the time the borings were made. It was hence shown that the material to be encountered was 'mainly mud or mud with an admixture of sand.' In other words, the map did not contain a true description of the character of the material which was to be encountered, and was encountered by the dredging company in the prosecution of the work. The material dredged, at certain places, differed from that shown on the map exhibited to bidders. The company made no independent examination, though it had time to do so, and in making its proposal it stated that it did so with full knowledge of the character and quality of the work required.\n The proposals required the character and capacity of the plant proposed to be employed by the contractor to be stated and that it should be kept in condition for efficient work and be subject to the inspection and approval of the 'contracting officer.' In compliance with the requirement the plant was submitted to such officer and by him inspected and approved. It was efficient for dredging \n\n[253 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n the character of material mentioned in the specifications and described on the map to which bidders were referred for information; it was not efficient for dredging the material actually found to exist, and the company secured the services of another concern to do the dredging for it, and that concern did all of the work that was done.\n After the company, and the concern it had employed, had been at work for some time, it complained of the character of material which was being encountered, and a supplementary contract was entered into by it and the 'contracting officer.'\n This contract recited that 'heavy and refractory material, consisting mainly of compacted sand and gravel, with a small percentage of cobbles had been encountered,' and provided that such material might be deposited in the Delaware river, instead of on shore, as provided in the original contract.\n At the time of making the supplemental contract the company was not aware of the manner in which the 'test borings' over the area embraced in its contract had been made. Upon learning of this in December, 1915, it discontinued work and declined to do further work. The company then had not been informed of the fact that impenetrable material had been reached by the probe. At the time of the cessation of work there remained approximately 350,000 cubic yards of material to be dredged in the area of the contract. The American Dredging Company completed the dredging at 16.2 cents per cubic yard.\n The amount expended by the company was $354,009.19, upon which it had received $142,959.10, making its loss on the contract $211,050.09. For such sum judgment was rendered, and the United States prosecuted this appeal.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n\n[253 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William L. Marbury, of Baltimore, Md., for appealees.\n\n\n[253 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n\n After stating the case as above, Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case turns upon the statement of the government of its belief of the character of the material to be encounterd , \n\n[253 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n and, as misrepresentation, the omission from the map exhibited to bidders of the actual borings made and their disclosures.\n The government asserts that there was no misrepresentation, basing the assertion upon the declaration of the specifications that no guarantee was intended and the admonition to bidders that they must decide as to the character of the materials to be dredged, and to 'make their bids accordingly.'\n The assertion puts out of view, we think, other and determining circumstances. There was not only a clear declaration of the belief of the government that its representation was true, but the foundation of it was asserted to be the test of actual borings, and the reference to maps as evidence of what the borings had disclosed. The finding is that the maps contained a record of 26 borings as covering specified sections that were to be dredged, and of these 10 were in the section of the river, which, by its contract afterwards made, the plaintiff agreed to dredge.\n There was a further assertion of belief, through its 'contracting officer,' by the approval of the company's plant. As we have seen the government's care of its interests extended to the inspection of the instrumentalities of the contractor, and required the character and capacity of the plant which was to be used, to be submitted for inspection and approval. In fulfillment of the requirement the company submitted its plant. It was only efficient for dredging material of the character mentioned in the specifications and described on the map, and it was so approved. The significance of the submission and approval are manifest. The character and capacity of the plant conveyed to the officer the fact that the company was accepting as true the representation of the specifications and the map of the materials to be dredged; and reciprocally the approval of the plant by the officer was an \n\n[253 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n assurance to the company of the truth of the representation and a justification of reliance upon it.\n The case is therefore within the ruling of United States v. Spearin, \n248 \nU.S. 132, 136\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 59, where it is stated that the direction to contractors to visit the site and inform themselves of the actual conditions of a proposed undertaking, will not relieve from defects in the plans and specifications, citing Christie v. United States, \n237 U.S. 234\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 565, Hollerbach v. United States, \n233 U.S. 165\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 553, and United States v. Utah, Nevada & California Stage Co., \n199 U.S. 424\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 69. It is held in those cases 'that the contractor ought to be relieved, if he was misled by erroneous statements in the specifications.' The present case is certainly within the principle expressed. In the cited cases there was no qualification of the requirement; in this case it was accompanied by the expression of belief, and conduct which was, in effect, a repetition and confirmation of the belief and gave assurance that it had a reliable foundation. The company, therefore, was justified in acting upon it.\n The government, however, contends that at best, the alternative was presented to the company, when it discovered the character of the materials, to either quit work and sue for damages, or continue the work; and that having elected the latter, it cannot now resort to the other. In fortification of this contention it is said that--\n'Even if the government made a misrepresentation as to the borings that misrepresentation would necessarily have been as to the character of the materials to be dredged, and claimant knew all there was to know about this from the 'very beginning.\"\n\n This assumption and the extent of it and the conclusion from it, are not justified. It is true the company discovered that the material it encountered was different in character from that represented, but the company did not know of the concealment of the actual test of the borings, and the fact that it, the company, attempted to \n\n[253 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n struggle on against the difficult conditions with its inefficient plant, should not be charged against it. In other words, it should not now be held to have been put to the suggested election. It did not know at that time of the manner in which the 'test borings' had been made. Upon learning that they had been made by the probe method, it then elected to go no further with the work, that is, upon discovering that the belief expressed was not justified and was in fact a deception. And it was not the less so because its impulse was not sinister or fraudulent.\n The government makes the point, however, that the implication of the case is that bad methods were used, and insists that the implication makes the action one for a tort, and not tenable against the United States. We cannot assent. There is no intimation of bad faith against the officers of the government, and the Court of Claims regarded the representation of the character of the material as in the nature of a warranty; besides, its judgment is in no way punitive. It is simply compensatory of the cost of the work, of which the government got the benefit.\nAFFIRMED.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","165":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. BUTT(1920)\nNo. 275\nArgued: Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 38, 39]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Assistant Attorney General Stewart and Harry S. Ridgely, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 38, 41]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Error to review a judgment of the District Court quashing an indictment against defendant in error, Butt, which charged him with feloniously bringing four Chinese aliens into the United States in violation of Immigration Act Feb. 5, 1917, c. 29, 39 Stat. 874, 880 (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  959, 960, 4289 1\/4 a et seq.).\n The legality of the ruling depends upon the coexistence of that act with Chinese Exclusion Act July 5, 1884, 23 Stat. 117 (Comp. St.  4295, 4298, 4299).\n We may use in exposition of the case the memorandum of the District Court (Judge Rudkin). It appears therefrom that an earlier indictment was presented against Butt, charging him in three counts with having brought the same four Chinese aliens into the United States. The first two counts were based on section 8 of the Immigration Act of February, 1917, and the third count on section 11 of the Chinese Exclusion Act (22 Stat. 61, as amended by Act July 5, 1884 [Comp. St.  4298]). All of the counts were based on the unlawful landing of four Chinese laborers into the United States. A motion to quash the first and second counts on the grounds of misjoinder, and on the further ground that the several acts did not state facts sufficient to constitute a crime was granted. The ruling was based on a decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. Stoneberg v. Morgan, 246 Fed. 98, 158 C. C. A. 324.\n Upon the trial of the third count a verdict of not guilty was directed by the court (judge Farrington) the government having failed to prove that the Chinese were actually landed in the United States.\n On June 11, 1919, the indictment in controversy was found. As we have said, it charged Butt with bringing the same Chinese aliens into the United States, and all of its counts were based on the Immigration Act. A motion to quash was made, accompanied by the record in the former case, in the nature of a plea of former jeopardy. \n\n[254 U.S. 38, 42]\n\u00a0\n To this procedure the government consented, but contended that, inasmuch as defendant did not proceed far enough to violate section 11 of the Exclusion Act, he was subject to prosecution under section 8 of the Immigration Act, it being broader and more comprehensive in its terms. To this contention the court replied, and we quote its language:\n'In my opinion Congress did not intend that the courts should indulge in any such refinement as this. In other words Congress either intended that persons bringing Chinese laborers into the United States should be prosecuted under the immigration act or that they should not. Such was manifestly the view of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in the case already cited.'\n\n The court considered that it was its duty to follow that decision until the question should be decided by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit or by this court. The motion to quash was sustained.\n This ruling is attacked and that of the case adduced in its support, by the citation of United States v. Wong You, \n223 U.S. 67\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 195, and United States v. Woo Jan, \n245 \nU.S. 552, 557\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 207. The cases support the contention, for which they are cited, and it follows therefore that the ruling of the District Court in the case at bar, sustaining the motion to quash the indictment, was error, and it is reversed.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","166":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. CHASE NAT BANK(1920)\nNo. 134\nArgued: Decided: April 19, 1920\n\n\n\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Spellacy, for the United states.[ U S v. Chase Nat Bank \n252 U.S. 485\n (1920) ]\n\n\n[252 U.S. 485, 488]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry Root Stern and Charles E. Rushmore, both of New York City, for defendant in error.\n\n\n[252 U.S. 485, 490]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Plaintiff in error sued the defendant bank, at law, to recover money paid out under mistake of fact. The complaint alleged:\n'First. That at all the times hereinafter mentioned, the plaintiff was and is a coro ration sovereign, and the defendant was and is an association organized for and transacting the business of banking in the city, state, and Southern District of New York, under and pursuant to the provisions of the acts of Congress in such case made and provided;\n\n'Second. That on or about the 18th day of December, 1914, the defendant presented to the Treasurer of the United States at Washington, D. C., for payment, a draft in the sum of $3,571.47, drawn on the Treasurer of the United States, payable to the order of E. V. Sumner, 2d Lt., 2d Cav., A. Q. M., and purporting to be drawn by E. V. Sumner, Acting Quartermaster, U. S. A., and to be endorsed by E. V. Sumner, 2d Lt., 2d Cav., A. Q. M., the \n\n[252 U.S. 485, 491]\n\u00a0\n Howard National Bank, and the defendant; a copy of said draft and the indorsements on the back thereof is hereto attached and market Exhibit A,1 and made a part hereof; \n\n[252 U.S. 485, 492]\n\u00a0\n 'Third. That at the date of the presentation of said draft by the defendant to the Treasurer of the United States, the defendant was a depository of the funds of the United States of America, and payment of said draft to the defendant was thereupon made by the plaintiff, by passing a credit for the amount of said draft to the defendant upon the accounts of the defendant, as depository for the funds of the plaintiff;\n\n'Fourth. That the name of said E. V. Sumner, 2d Lt., 2d Cav., A. Q. M ., indorsed upon the back of said draft, was forged and had been wrongfully and fraudulently written upon the same by a person other than the said E. V. Sumner, without his knowledge or consent, and no part of the proceeds of said draft were ever received by him;\n\n'Fifth. That the payment of said draft made by the plaintiff to the defendant, as described in paragraph three of this complaint, was made under a mistake of fact and without knowledge that the signature of the said E. V. Sumner, 2d Lt., 2d Cav., A. Q. M., payee thereof, had been forged upon the back of said draft;\n\n'Sixth. That the plaintiff has duly requested the defendant to repay to it the amount of said draft, to wit, $3,571.47, but the defendant has failed and refused to pay the same or any part thereof to the plaintiff.\n\n'Wherefore, the plaintiff demands judgment against the defendant in the sum of $3,571.47, with interest thereon from the 18th day of December, 1914, together with the costs and disbursements of this action.'\n\n The bank denied liability and among other things claimed that the same person wrote the name E. V. Sumner upon the draft both as drawer and indorser. The facts were stipulated.\n It appears: Lieutenant Sumner, quartermaster and disbursing officer at Ft. Ethan Allen, near Burlington, Vt., had anthority to draw on the United States Treasurer. Sergeant Howard was his finance clerk and so \n\n[252 U.S. 485, 493]\n\u00a0\n known at the Howard National Bank of Burlington. Utilizing the official blank form, Howard manufactured in toto the draft in question-Exhibit A. Having forged Lieutenant Sumner's name both as drawer and indorser, he cashed the instrument over the counter at the Howard National Bank without adding his own name. That bank immediately indorsed and forwarded it for collection and credit to the defendant at New York City; the latter promptly presented it to the drawee (the Treasurer), received payment and credited the proceeds as directed. Two weeks thereafter the Treasurer discovered the forgery and at once demanded repayment which was refused. Before discovery of the forgery the Howard National Bank withdrew from the Chase National Bank sums aggregating more than its total balance immediately after such proceeds were credited; but additional subsequent credit items had maintained its balance continuously above the amount of the draft.\n Both sides asked for an instructed verdict without more. The trial court directed one for the defendant (241 Fed. 535) and judgment thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (250 Fed. 105, 162 C. C. A. 277). If important, the record discloses substantial evidec e to support the finding necessarily involved that no actual negligence or bad faith, attributable to defendant, contributed to success of the forgery. Williams v. Vreeland, \n250 \nU.S. 295, 298\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 438, 3 A. L. R. 1038\n\n\n The complaint placed the demand for recovery solely upon the forged indorsement-neither negligence nor bad faith is set up. If the draft had been a valid instrument with a good title thereto in some other than the collecting bank, nothing else appearing, the drawee might recover as for money paid under mistake. Hortsman v. Henshaw, 11 How. 177, 183. But here the whole instrument was forged, never valid, and nobody had better right to it than the collecting bank. \n\n[252 U.S. 485, 494]\n\u00a0\n Price v. Neal (1762) 3 Burrows, 1354, 1357, held that it is incumbent on the drawee to know the drawer's hand and that if the former pay a draft upon the latter's forged name to an innocent holder not chargeable with fault there can be no recovery. 'The plaintiff cannot recover the money unless it be against conscience in the defendant to retain it.' 'But it can never be thought unconscientious in the defendant to retain this money when he has once received it upon a bill of exchange indorsed to him for a fair and valuable consideration which he had bona fide paid without the least privity or suspicion of any forgery.' And the doctrine so announced has been approved and adopted by this court. Bank of United States v. Bank of Georgia, 10 Wheat. 333, 348; Hoffman v. Bank of Milwaukee, 12 Wall. 181, 192; Leather Mfgs. Bank v. Morgan, \n117 \nU.S. 96, 109\n, 6 S. Sup. Ct. 657; United States v. Natl. Exch. Bank, \n214 \nU.S. 302, 311\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 665, 16 Ann. Cas. 1184.\n In Bank of United States v. Bank of Georgia, through Mr. Justice Story, this court said concerning Price v. Neal:\n'There were two bills of exchange, which had been paid by the drawee, the drawer's hand-writing being a forgery; one of these bills had been paid, when it became due, without acceptance; the other was duly accepted, and paid at maturity. Upon discovery of the fraud, the drawee brought an action against the holder to recover back the money so paid, both parties being admitted to be equally innocent. Lord Mansfield, after adverting to the nature of the action, which was for money had and received, in which no recovery could be had, unless it be against conscience for the defendant to retain it, and that it could not be affirmed that it was unconscientious for the defendant to retain it, he having paid a fair and valuable consideration for the bills, said 'here was no fraud, no wrong. It was incumbent upon the plaintiff to be satisfied that the bill drawn upon him was the drawer's hand, before he accepted or paid it; but it was not incumbent upon the defendant \n\n[252 U.S. 485, 495]\n\u00a0\n to inquire into it. There was a notice given by the defendant to the plaintiff, of a bill drawn upon him, and he sends his servant to pay it, and take it up; the other bill he actually accepts, after which, the defendant, innocently and bona fide, discounts it. The plaintiff lies by for a considerable time after he has paid these bills, and then found out that they were forged. He made no objection to them at the time of paying them. Whatever neglect there was, was on his side. The defendant had actual encouragement from the plaintiff for negotiating the second bill, from the plaintiff's having, without any scruple or hesitation, paid the first; and he paid the whole value bona fide. It is a misfortune which has happened without the defendant's fault or neglect. If there was no neglect in the plaintiff, yet there is no reason to throw off the loss from one innocent man upon another innocent man. But, in this case, if there was any fault or negligence in any one, it certainly was in the plaintiff, and not in the defendant.' The whole rasoning of this case applies with full force to that now before the court. In regard to the first bill, there was no new credit given by any acceptance, and the holder was in possession of it before the time it was paid or acknowledged. So that there is no pretense to allege, that there is any legal distinction between the case of a holder before or after the acceptance. Both were treated in this judgment as being in the same predicament, and entitled to the same equities. The case of Price v. Neal has never since been departed from; and, in all the subsequent decisions in which it has been cited, it has had the uniform support of the court, and has been deemed a satisfactory authority.'\n\n Does the mere fact that the name of Lieutenant Sumner was forged as indorser as well as drawer prevent application here of the established rule? We think not. In order to recover plaintiff must show that the defendant cannot retain the money with good conscience. Both are \n\n[252 U.S. 485, 496]\n\u00a0\n innocent of intentional fault. The drawee failed to detect the forged signature of the drawer. The forged indorsement puts him in no worse position than he would occupy if that were genuine. He cannot be called upon to pay again and the collecting bank has not received the proceeds of an instrument to which another held a better title. The equities of the drawee who has paid are not superior to those of the innocent collecting bank who had full right to act upon the assumption that the former knew the drawer's signature or at least took the risk of a mistake concerning it.

DIAMOND COAL & COKE CO(1920)\nNo. 87\nArgued: November 11, 1920Decided: November 11, 1920\n\n\nDecided, March 7, 1921.\n\n\n\n[255 U.S. 323, 324]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Nebeker, for the United States.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 323, 325]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. B. Rodgers, of Anaconda, Mont., for appellee.\n\n\n[255 U.S. 323, 329]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit, begun by the United States against the Diamond Coal & Coke Company in October, 1917, had a threefold object: (1) To cancel 18 patents granted to that number of persons, at dates ranging from 14 to 21 years prior to the commencment of the suit, and covering 2,283 acres of coal land situated in the Evanston land district, state of Wyoming; (2) to cancel deeds of conveyance to the corporation made by the entrymen who \n\n[255 U.S. 323, 330]\n\u00a0\n had purchased from the United States the land which the patents embraced; ( 3) to recover the value of coal which it was alleged had been taken by mining operations of the corporation from the land in question during the period stated.\n It suffices from the view we take of the matters requiring consideration to briefly resume the averments of the bill. It was alleged that in the year 1894 the defendant corporation had formed a conspiracy to defraud the United States of the land covered by the patents by procuring the purchase of said land from the United States by persons acting ostensibly for themselves, but really as the representatives of the corporation and for its sole account and benefit. In furtherance of the conspiracy thus formed, it was alleged that 18 persons described as entrymen, at the suggestion and in the pay of the corporation, made application at the proper land office of the United States to purchase in their own names the land covered by the patents, the land so applied for having been designated by the corporation and the entries being exclusively intended for its benefit. It was charged that these entrymen falsely swore, for the purposes of their applications to purchase, that the applications were made for their own benefit, when in fact they were solely made for the benefit of the corporation; that the entrymen additionally falsely swore that they were in possession of the land, had developed coal mines on it, and were engaged in working the same, when in truth the lands had never been in the possession of the applicants, who had expended no money and had done no work thereon, since the lands were, prior to and at the time of the applications, in the possession of the corporation through its officers or some persons or agents acting for it and for its benefit.\n It was further alleged that shortly after the entries were made, in furtherance of the fraudulent purpose, and \n\n[255 U.S. 323, 331]\n\u00a0\n upon the false allegations and affidavits above stated and before patent issued, the entrymen conveyed the land applied for by warranty deed to the corporation, although there was no allegation concerning the registry or nonregistry of the deeds of conveyance thus made. The bill in addition charged that for the purpose of securing the right which was contemplated for the benefit of the corporation, further false affidavits as to the exclusive interest of the entrymen were made and that all the money paid by way of price for the land or for expenses or otherwise was furnished by the corporation for its own account. It was alleged that the corporation for many years before the transactions thus stated had engaged in the mining, production, and sale of coal in the state and district in which the land covered by the entries was situated; that its operations had been principally carried on in the vicinity of such lands, and that the lands involved in the suit had been mined for coal and large quantities of coal had been and were still being removed therefrom to the irreparable injury of the United States; the value of the coal thus removed being the subject- matter of the claim in that respect to which we have at the outset referred.\n There were general averments that the previously alleged acts concerning the making of the entries, which were alike in all, were done not only for the purpose of defrauding the United States and enriching the corporation, but in order to conceal the wrong which was being accomplished, and that the acts of concealment were of such a character as to deceive the officers of the United States and to lead them to believe that the entries were what they purported to be, that is, purchases by the entrymen, and to exclude, therefore, not only the knowledge that they were for the account of the corporation, but also to exclude all basis for affording any reasonable ground to put the United States upon inquiry as to the \n\n[255 U.S. 323, 332]\n\u00a0\n real situation. Additionally, it was averred that, so completely did the fraud which was committed and its concealment accomplish the purposes thus intended, that the officers of the United States had no knowledge whatever of the fraudulent title acquired by the corporation and no reason to believe in its existence until a short time before the bringing of the suit when, by report of a special agent of the Land Office, knowledge of the true situation was in part conveyed, leading up to a further investigation by the Department of Justice, consequent upon which the suit was commenced.\n It was moved to dismiss on four grounds: (1) That the bill stated no cause of action; (2) that it was barred by the limitation of the Act of March 3, 1891, c. 559, 26 Stat. 1093 (Comp. St.  4992), as the six-year period Fixed by that act had elapsed; (3) because the facts as to fraud and concealment alleged in the bill were not of such a character as to suspend the operation of the statute; and (4) because those facts were of such a nature as necessarily to impute the knowledge of the fraud complained of, or if not, to make it clear that the failure to seek relief within the statutory time was the result of inexcusable laches. The court, not questioning that in an adequate case the fraud and the concealment thereof would suspend the operation of the statute until the discovery of the fraud (Exploration Co. v. United States, \n247 \nU.S. 435, 445\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 571), based its conclusion upon the qualifications and limitations inhering in that rule, as stated in the Exploration Case and as previously expounded in Bailey v. Glover, 21 Wall. 342. Concluding that the averments of the bill were insufficient to establish that the failure to discover within the statutory time was not solely attributable to laches, and finding the bar of the statute under these circumstances absolute, the court applied the statute and dismissed the bill. The United States having elected not to avail of leave to amend within a period of 90 days allowed by \n\n[255 U.S. 323, 333]\n\u00a0\n the court of its own motion, but to stand on its bill, a final decree was entered dismissing the bill, and the case was taken to the court below.\n That court, while considering the subject in the light of the burden cast upon the United States resulting from the fact that the time fixed by the statute had run before the suit was brought, and the technical sufficiency of the bill viewed merely from that aspect, proceeded to consider the averments of the bill comprehensively. As a result it concluded (a) that the allegations of the bill did not meet the requirements as to the exertion of due diligence to discover the fraud which they charged had been committed, and (2) that the bar of the statute was applicable because the allegations of the bill stated the existence of facts and circumstances from which knowledge of the fraud was necessarily to be imputed, or from which such inferences were plainly deducible as would have led to discovery if diligence had been exerted; in other words, that there was either knowledge of the fraud within the statutory period, or such laches resulting from failure to make inquiry as to take the case out of the equitable principle by which the positive bar of the statute could be avoided.\n Before testing the accuracy of the deductions from the averred facts upon which these conclusions are necessarily based, we dispose of a legal contention of the United States, that in any event the propositions were wrongfully applied because under the statute laches in discovering the fraud could not be imputed to the United States. As the statute in express terms deals with the rights of the United States and bars them by the limitation which it prescribes, and as that bar would be effective unless the equitable principle arising from the fraud and its discovery be applied, it must follow, since the doctrine of laches is an inherent ingredient of the equitable principle in question, that the proposition is wholly without \n\n[255 U.S. 323, 334]\n\u00a0\n merit because, on the one hand, it seeks to avoid the bar of the statute by invoking the equitable principle suspending its operation, and, on the other, rejects the fundamental principle upon which the equitable doctrine invoked can alone rest.\n Coming, then, to consider the allegations of the bill for the purpose of testing the conclusions based upon them by the court below, as just stated, we are of opinion that such conclusions cannot be sustained without drawing unauthorized inferences from the facts alleged and thus deciding the case by indulging in mere conjecture. Without going into detail, we briefly advert to the inferences from two subjects dealt with by the court below which illustrate the necessity for the conclusion just stated. In the first place, let it be conceded arguendo that the conveyances from the entrymen to the corporation as alleged, following almost immediately the initiation of the right to purchase and preceding the patents, the uniformity of the method employed, and the surrounding circumstances, would all, if known, have constituted badges of fraud of such a character as to produce the result which the court below based upon them. But the result thus stated depends upon the existence of knowledge of such facts or of knowledge of other facts from which they were reasonably deducible-a situation which does not here exist, as the averments of the bill as to concealment exclude that conclusion. True it is, that in dealing with the question of the technical sufficiency of the pleading the court below directed attention to the fact that it contained no allegation that the conveyances made by the entrymen had not been seasonably recorded; but that in no way justifies the inference that they had been recorded and therefore gave notice of the fraud, even if it be conceded, for the sake of the argument, that such recording was adequate to give such notice-a question which we do not now decide. \n\n[255 U.S. 323, 335]\n\u00a0\n So, also, let it be conceded, as held by the court below, that the allegations of the bill as to the possession of the land by the corporation at the time of the purchase by the entrymen and subsequent to their conveyances; of the propinquity of the land to the field of operations of the corporation; of its exploitation by the corporation for the purpose of taking coal therefrom, all in and of themselves, if open and public so as to be known, constituted such indications of fraud as to give notice to the United States, or at least to put it upon inquiry. But again, that concession is here irrelevant since the averments of concealment and other allegations in the bill are susceptible of the construction that the possession of the corporation was clandestine and that its operations as to the property were of the same character because not conducted in its own name but by persons interposed with the very object of concealment.\n Viewing the case in the light of these considerations, as well as of others to the same effect to which we do not stop to refer, we are of opinion that error was committed in disposing of the bill upon the motion to dismiss, and that the ends of justice require that it should be only finally disposed of after hearing and proof, thus excluding the danger of wrong to result from a final determination of the cause upon mere inferences without proof.\n It follows that the decree of the court below must be and it is reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court, with directions to set aside its decree of dismissal and to overrule the motion to dismiss, and for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n Reversed and remanded. \n\n\n\n","168":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v.

St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830]); and also for the alleged reason that the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company was transporting over its lines of railway anthracite coal in which it had an interest, in violation of the commodities clause of the Act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 585). \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 258]\n\u00a0\n It will be necessary to consider only the relations and activities of the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, hereinafter designated the Railroad Company, the Lehigh Valley Coal Company, designated the Coal Company, and the Lehigh Valley Coal Sales Company, designated the Sales Company.\n A condensed history, chiefly admitted, of the organization, stock ownership and conduct of these three companies, and the application to the facts thus developed of fully established principles of law, will be decisive of the case.\n The limited area of anthracite producing territory, its relation to the interstate transportation system and markets of our country and the various attempts to monopolize and control the great railway tonnage originating therein have all been so often described in reported cases, that they need not be repeated here in detail. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n It will suffice for our present purpose to say that the anthracite producing territory is very restricted in area, it all being within seven counties of Eastern Pennsylvania with the known deposits underlying only 309,760 acres of land. For trade purposes it is divided into three fields; the northerly is called the Wyoming field, the next southerly the Lehigh or middle field, and the southerly the Schuylkill field. The lines of the Railroad Company extend into the Wyoming and Lehigh fields, but to only one colliery in the Schuylkill field. Much the greater part of its tonnage is derived from the Wyoming field, and four-fifths of it moves in interstate commerce.\n The Railroad Company in 1913 owned 1,438 miles of main line and a total trackage of 3,354 miles, its capital \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 259]\n\u00a0\n stock was $60,600,000, its funded debt was $85,800,000, its total assets had a book value of $182,700,000, but a much greater actual value, and it carried a larger tonnage of anthracite coal than any other railroad in the country-over 13,000,000 tons in 1913, this being 18.84 per cent. of the total 69,000,000 tons shipped over all railroads in that year.\n In 1864 the Railroad Company by merger with a coal company acquired a small acreage of anthracite containing land and thereupon added the mining, shipping, and selling of coal to its duties as a carrier.\n The annual reports of the Railroad Company show that, as early as 1868, it entered upon the policy of acquiring by purchase and lease the control of as much as possible of the anthracite coal containing lands tributary to its lines of railroad for the purpose of preventing, or, when it had become established of suppressing, competition in the carrying of coal over its interstate lines to interstate markets.\n Thus the annual report of the company for 1868 shows that, it having been determined that it was of 'the utmost importance' to the future welfare of the company to secure 'control of tonnage from regions having other outlets to markets,' the company, by merger of two coal companies, obtained coal lands which secured to it the whole trade of the Hazelton coal field and 'the withdrawal from competition' of a business so large as to greatly strengthen the 'future prospects of the road.'\n In 1869 the policy of securing a proportion of the coal trade from each region by the purchase of interests in companies owning lands on or near the several branches of the company was approved and 'continued.'\n In 1871 it is reported:\n'We have continued to acquire interests in coal lands situated in our various regions.'\n\n In 1872, after detailing the purchase for $2,000,000 of 5,800 acres of land having upon it 10 collieries, the report of the company declares that:\n'Should there be a corre \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 260]\n\u00a0\n sponding increase for a year or two more the total consumption will so nearly equal the full capacity of the mines for production as to render unnecessary all attempts to regulate or control the trade.'\n\n After reciting that a contract had been entered into granting to the Delaware, Susquehanna & Schuylkill Railroad Company trackage rights to tidewater, the report of the Railroad Company for 1894 continues, saying that there is thereby assured to the company--\n'an important traffic ... for which several outlets existed and which had been in contention for some time previous. It also removes an incentive to the construction of further new lines into the territory tributary to the Lehigh Valley system.'\n\n Although in 1875 it caused the Coal Company (hereinafter discussed) to be organized for the purpose of taking title to coal lands then owned or which might thereafter be purchased, and although the Anti-Trust Law was enacted in 1890, nevertheless, the Railroad Company continued its policy of purchasing for control and from time to time it acquired and took in its own name the title to extensive tracts of coal lands and to stocks in coal companies. Thus in 1885 it acquired the entire capital stock of the Wyoming Valley Coal Company, the owner of 1,657 acres of anthracite land, in 1900 it acquired the entire capital stock of the Westwood Coal Company, a considerable owner of anthracite land, in 1901 it acquired the entire capital stock of the Connell Coal Company, and in the same year the entire capital stock of the Seneca Coal Company, the owner of 1,308 acres of anthracite land.\n In the years prior to 1905 the Railroad Company made a number of other purchases of coal land, but in that year it made its largest single and most significant purchase, when it acquired, for the sum of $17,440, 000 all of the capital stock of Coxe Bros. & Co., Incorporated. This company was the largest independent coal operator then \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 261]\n\u00a0\n on the line of the Railroad Company, and its production for 1905 exceeded 1,100,000 tons. It not only owned extensive areas of coal land, on which were located 8 collieries, but it was also owner of all of the capital stock of the Delaware, Susquehanna & Schuylkill Railroad Company, which owned 50 miles of railway which served other large independent mines in addition to those of Coxe Bros. & Co., Incorporated. This railroad had connections with the Reading, Pennsylrania, and New Jersey Central lines, which were taken up or fell into disuse when the control of it passed to the defendant Lehigh Valley Railroad Company. The Railroad Company continued to own all the capital stock of Coxe Bros. & Co., Incorporated, to the time the testimony was taken in this suit, and it is admitted that that company then held in fee or under long lease 36,490 acres of land in the anthracite field, 7,169 acres of which were known to contain anthracite coal. This purchase was confessedly made to prevent the diversion of traffic to other lines, and, while the company was continued in form as a separate corporation, the officers and directors of the coal company were made its officers and directors, and in June following the year of the purchase its directors by resolution provided that the net earnings of the company should be paid to the Railroad Company without the formality of declaring a dividend, and this practice continued until 1911.\n Thus, this important coal company and its railroad became a mere coal producing and transporting agency of the defendant Railroad Company.\n In 1874 the state of Pennsylvania adopted a constitution containing the provision that--\n'No incorporated company, doing the business of a common carrier, shall, directly or indirectly, prosecute or engage in mining or manufacturing articles, for transportation over its works.' Constitution of Pennsylvania, 1874, art. 17,  5. \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 262]\n\u00a0\n Prior to this time the Railroad Company had been a large owner, miner, shipper, and seller, as well as carrier, of anthracite coal, and, as if for the purpose of complying with the new constitution of the state from which it derived its franchise, it caused the Lehigh Valley Coal Company to be created in 1875 by the consolidation of two smaller companies. This company which was organized for the purpose of taking title to coal lands and stocks in coal companies, then owned or thereafter to be acquired by the Railroad Company, and to conduct the business of mining, shipping, and selling coal, had an original capital of $650,000, which was afterwards increased to $1,965,000, all of which has been owned by the Railroad Company from the beginning. Coal-producing lands and stocks in various coal companies were purchased from time to time by the Railroad Company, directly or through advances of money to the new coal company for that purpose, title thereto being taken in the Coal Company, with the result: that when this suit was commenced that company admitted itself to be the owner of 54,229 acres of land in the anthracite producing regions, of which 24,748 acres were located along the lines of the Railroad Company; that the funded debt of the company had become $20,000,000; and that the value of its assets amounted to about $35,000,000. Eight and one-half million tons of anthracite, of the 13,000,000 carried by the Railroad Company in 1913, were produced by this Coal Company and by Coxe Bros. & Co ., Incorporated, owned, as we have seen, by the Railroad Company. The combined acreage of lands owned by the Coal Company and by Coxe Bros. & Co ., Incorporated, is admitted to be 90,719 acres, of which 61,238 acres are located along the lines of the Railroad Company. The annual reports of the Coal Company show that in 1903 56.77 per cent. of the coal transported over the railroad was produced by the Coal Company and its affiliated companies; that in 1906 the percentage produced and purchased \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 263]\n\u00a0\n was 85.25 per cent. of that transported; and in 1907 it was 87.11 per cent. The Interstate Commerce Commission found that in 1908 the company controlled 95 per cent. of the tonnage moving over its line to tidewater. Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 21 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 129, 154.\n\n The Railroad Company and the Coal Company had usually the same president, secretary, treasurer, and auditor, and the latter company admits, as it must, that the Railroad Company 'as the owner of stock controls and long since has been controlling the election of its directors.' The Railroad Company constantly advanced large sums of money to the Coal Company for the purchase of property and for operating capital. The total of these advances to the year 1892 exceeded $15,500,000, which amount, however, was reduced by operations of the Coal Company to $11,500,000. The Coal Company never paid any dividends, its earnings being frankly treated as those of the Railroad Company, and the financial and other relations between the two companies were so intimate and interlaced that in argument it is admitted that 'in the last analysis the assets of the Coal Company are the assets of the Railroad Company.'\n There is much more in the record to like effect, but sufficient has been stated to make it clear beyond controversy, that the Coal Company was organized and conducted as a mere agency or instrumentality of the Railroad Company, for the purpose of avoiding the legal infirmity which it was thought might inhere in the owning of coal lands and in the conducting of coal mining, shipping and selling operations by the Railroad Company, and that the policy of purchasing and leasing coal lands tributary to its lines for the purpose of controlling interstate trade and commerce in anthracite coal and of preventing and suppressing competition therein, was deliberately entered upon by the Railroad Company, and in combination with its agency, the Coal Company, was consistently pursued, sued, with in creasing \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 264]\n\u00a0\n energy and scope after the passage of the Anti-Trust Act, until the commencement of this suit, unless these purposes and results, in point of law, were modified and cured by the organization in 1912 of the Sales Company and by the functions which it performed-which remain to be considered.\n On January 11, 1912, the board of directors of the Railroad Company requested the directors of the Coal Company 'to consider the propriety of organizing a Sales Company' and of entering into a contract with it when formed 'for a limited time' for the purchase and sale by it 'of the coal mined, purchased and owned by the Coal Company.' The board also requested that the privilege of subscribing for the stock of the new company be extended, 'not to the Railroad Company, but, pro rata, to the common and preferred stockholders of the Railroad Company.' As if anticipating compliance with its request on the part of the Coal Company, of which it owned all of the stock, the officers of the Railroad Company were authorized at the same meeting of the board to take such action and make such conveyances as might be deemed necessary or advantageous in perfecting the sales arrangement with the new company to be organized, and in aid of the enterprise a dividend of 10 per cent. on the stock of the Railroad Company was declared, payable on February 26, which amounted in the aggregate to $6,060,800.\n On the same day the board of directors of the Coal Company resolved: That the new Sales Company should be organized, as requested by the Railroad Company, with a capital stock of $10,000,000, but that only $6, 060,800 of it should be issued; that when the new company was formed the Coal Company should, 'if possible,' contract with it for a 'limited time' for the sale to it 'of all coal which shall be mined, purchased, owned, or acquired' by the Coal Company during the term of the proposed contract, so that the title to such coal should vest in the Sales \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 265]\n\u00a0\n Company 'before the transportation thereof shall be commenced.'\n The privilege of subscription to the capital stock of the new company was restricted to the stockholders of the Railroad Company.\n The Sales Company was promptly organized and the minutes of the company show that slightly less than 97 per cent. of the stock was subscribed for by stockholders of the Railroad Company.\n The Sales Company had seven directors. One of these, J. W. Skeele, who was also elected president, had been general sales agent of the Coal Company; another, W. R. Evans, had been assistant to the general sales agent of the Coal Company; another, L. D. Smith, was a director of the Railroad Company; and a fourth, Paul Moore, was a son of a large stockholder in the Railroad Company. The vice president of the company, G. N. Wilson, had been general auditor of the Railroad Company, and the treasurer, W. J. Burton, had been employed as assistant secretary of the Coal Company.\n It is too plain for discussion that, with a company thus organized and officered, the making of a contract by the Coal Company for the sale of all of its coal to the Sales Company was, in substance and effect, making a contract with itself, the terms of which it could determine in its discretion.\n Immediately after the organization of the Sales Company the anticipated contract between that company and the Coal Company for the purchase of all the coal which the latter might mine or purchase was entered into and bears date March 1, 1912. This contract was to continue for 10 years unless terminated in the manner which it provides for and its terms are so nearly identical with the earlier Lackawanna contract, which is considered in United States v. Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R. R. Co., \n238 U.S. 516\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 873, that the judge who tried this case below, with \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 266]\n\u00a0\n entire propriety, says that the differences between the two are 'wholly unsubstantial.' 225 Fed. 401. This court held that the contract in the Lackawanna Case was void, because violative of the provisions of the Anti- Trust Act and the commodities clause of the Act to Regulate Commerce.\n The discussion of the Lackawanna con tract is so full and satisfactory in \n238 U.S. 516\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 873, that it would not serve any useful purpose to comment in detail upon the contract which we have here. It will suffice to say that the provisions of the Lackawanna contract, which were clearly determinative of the former decision by this court, are plainly the same in substance, and almost exactly the same in form, as those in the contract we are considering, viz .: The agreement of the Coal Company (1) to sell and of the Sales Company to buy all of the coal mined by the Coal Company from lands owned or leased by it, together with all coal which it might purchase; (2) that the prices to be paid for the more important grades of coal shall be 65 per cent. of the New York prices-the two contracts are in precisely the same words in this respect; (3) that, with negligible exceptions, the Sales Company is to sell no other coal, for itself or for any other, than that 'purchased' from the Coal Company; (4) that the Coal Company shall lease all of its facilities, structures and trestles to the Sales Company; (5) that either party shall have the right to abrogate and cancel the contract upon giving to the other 6 months' notice of its desire so to do; (6) that the Sales Company shall not buy coal except from the Coal Company-a provision which excludes the Sales Company, potentially a strong competitor, from the market. The Coal Company purchased 2,960,000 tons of coal in 1911 in addition to that which it mined.\n These are the contract provisions which led this court, in the former case, to hold that a corporation organized and circumstanced as is the Sales Company which we have \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 267]\n\u00a0\n here-subject to be stripped at the will of another of all of its business and of all its facilities for carrying on the business for which it was incorporated-was neither an 'independent buyer nor a free agent.'\n Being entirely satisfied with the reasoning upon which the Lackawanna Case proceeds to its conclusion, we hold now, as it was there in principle held, that the purchase in form by the Sales Company did not so dissociate the Railroad Company from the transportation of coal in which it was interested as to meet the requirements of the law; that the contract, nominally of purchase, was so calculated to restrain interstate trade as to be obnoxious to the Anti-Trust Act of Congress; and that for this reason it is unlawful and void.\n It will be of service, in determining the purposes of the defendant Railroad Company, with its corporate subsidiaries in the activities thus discussed, to recall the history of the defendant Railroad Company, as it appears in the decisions of this and of other courts.\n In 1892 the defendant Railroad Company and the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey leased their lines of railway for the term of 999 years to the Reading Railroad Company, a parallel competing carrier, extensively engaged in mining, marketing and selling anthracite coal. This combination, had it become operative, would have gone far toward monopolizing the interstate transportation and trade in anthracite coal of our entire country, but all operations under the lease of the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey were enjoined by the New Jersey courts, for the reason that it was deemed to be in restraint of trade, against public policy and calculated to partially destroy competition in the production and sale of anthracite coal, a staple commodity of the state. Stockton, Atty. Gen., v. Central R. R. Co., 50 N. J. Eq. 52, 24 Atl. 964, 17 L. R. A. 97. Thereupon the lease of defendant's property was abandoned and surrendered. \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 268]\n\u00a0\n Six years later, in 1898, the defendant Railroad Company combined with the Reading and four other railway companies to contribute a large sum of money, which was successfully used to prevent the construction of a projected, competing line of railroad from the anthracite fields to tidewater. Of this enterprise this court said:\n'We are in entire accord with the view of the court below in holding that the transaction involved a concerted scheme to combine for the purpose of restraining commerce among the states, in plain violation of the Act of Congress of July 2, 1890.' United States v. Reading, \n226 \nU.S. 324, 355\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 90, 97 (57 L. Ed. 243).\n\n Four years later, in 1902, the defendant Railroad Company united with the Reading and four other anthracite carriers in a combination to control the entire tonnage of coal produced by independent operators along the lines of their respective railways. The devise this time resorted to was contract to purchase all the coal produced by independent mines, then opened or which might thereafter be opened by the vendors, and to pay therefor 65 per cent. of the market price prevailing at tidewater points at New York, to be computed from month to month by an arbitrator to be selected by agreement. These contracts were elaborately considered and unsparingly condemned by this court in the case which is cited, and the conclusion reached was that the defendants in that case had unlawfully combined, by and through the instrumentality of the 65 per cent. contract, for the purpose of controlling the sale at tidewater of the independent output of anthracite coal. The contracts were declared to be unlawful and were ordered canceled. \n226 \nU.S. 370, 371\n, 373 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 90.\n In 1911, in Meeker & Co. v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., 21 Interst. Co. Com'n R. 129, 154, 163, the Interstate Commerce Commission held that the only line of demarkation between the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company and the Lehigh Valley Coal Company was one of bookkeeping; that the Railroad \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 269]\n\u00a0\n Company 'had monopolized the coal field served by it,' and that it had been guilty of unjust discrimination and of charging unreasonable rates for which reparation was awarded. 23 Interest. Com. Com'n R. 480. This decision was sustained by this court in Meeker & Co. v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n236 U.S. 412\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691.\n And yet again, in 1915, the Interstate Commerce Commission, after an investigation extending over three years, in which the defendant Railroad Company and all other initial carriers of anthracite were parties, held that the rates charged by the defendant and other carriers to tidewater and to certain interior points were unreasonable; that by trackage and other arrangements they had extended advantages to their subsidiary coal companies, to the prejudice of other shippers; and that concessions as obnoxious as 'direct cash rebates' had been made to such coal companies.

Com'n R. 220.\n This history of almost 25 years casts an illuminating light upon the intent and purpose with which the combination here assailed was formed and continued. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 76\n, 31 S. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734.\n Without further comment, this discussion of the record requires us to conclude that it is clearly established that, prior to the enactment of the Anti-Trust Act, the Railroad Company, in combination with its coal company subsidiary, deliberately entered upon a policy of making extensive purchases of anthracite land tributary to the Railroad Company's lines, for the purpose of controlling the mining, transportation and sale of coal to be obtained therefrom and of preventing and suppressing competition, especially in the transportation and sale of such coal in interstate commerce, and that this policy was continued after the passage of the Anti- Trust Act with increasing energy and tenacity of purpose, with the result that a \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 270]\n\u00a0\n practical monopoly was attained of the transportation and sale of anthracite coal derived from such lands.\n The area of the anthracite territory is so restricted that to thus obtain control of the supply of such coal on a great system of railway ( the amount transported exceeded one-fifth of the entire production of the country for the year before this suit was commenced) by a combination of corporations, such as we have here, and by such methods as we have seen were employed, effected a restraint of trade or commerce among the several states, and constituted an attempt to monopolize and an actual monopolization of a part of such trade or commerce in anthracite coal, clearly within the meaning of the first and second sections of the Anti- Trust Act as they have frequently been interpreted by this court. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 61\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; New York, New Haven & Hartford R. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361, 392\n, 393 S., 26 Sup. Ct. 272; United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n226 U.S. 61\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 53; International Harvester Co. v.

Ct. 873; United States v. Reading Co., \n253 U.S. 26\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 425.\n Since we have also found that the contract between the Coal Company and the Sales Company was a mere device to evade the commodities clause of the Interstate Commerce Act and therefore void, it results that the decree of the District Court must be reversed and the case remanded, with instructions to enter a decree, in conformity with this opinion, dissolving the combination effected through the intercorporate relations subsisting between the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company, the Lehigh Valley Coal Company, Coxe Bros. & Co., Incorporated, the Delaware, Susquehanna & Schuylkill Railroad Company, and the Lehigh Valley Sales Company, with such provisions for the disposition of all shares of stock, bonds, or other evidences of indebtedness, and of all property \n\n[254 U.S. 255, 271]\n\u00a0\n of any character, of any one of said companies owned or in any manner controlled by any other of them as may benecessary to establish their entire independence of and from each other. The contract of March 1, 1912, between the Coal Company and the Sales Company must be decreed to be void and all contract relations between the two companies enjoined which would serve in any manner to render the Sales Company not entirely free to extend its business of buying and selling coal where and from and to whom it chooses with entire freedom and independence, so that it may in effect, as well as in form, become an independent dealer in coal, and free to act in competition, if it desires, with the defendant Coal Company or Railroad Company.\n As to the New York & Middle Coal Field Railroad & Coal Company, the G. B. Markle Company, the Girard Trust Company, and the individual defendants, the bill must be dismissed.\n Reversed and remanded, with instructions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE and Mr. Justice HOLMES, while, if they exercised an independent judgment, would be for affirmance, nevertheless concur in the conclusion now announced by the court, because they consider that they are so constrained to do in virtue of the controlling effect of the previous decisions in the Lackawanna and\n Reading Cases cited in the opinion of the court.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS did not take part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] United States v.

Section 833, R. S. (Comp. St.  1394); Act June 28, 1902, 32 Stat. 475, 476; section 839, R. S. (Comp. St.  1404); section 844, R. S. (Comp. St.  1414). \n\n[253 U.S. 195, 199]\n\u00a0\n The controversy originated by a suit commenced by the United States against the defendants in error as clerk of the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, and the surety on his official bond to recover $3,861.05. The right to the e lief was based upon averments that during the period from December 27, 1905, to January 27, 1910, the clerk had collected the sum named as interest on the average daily balances of his bank accounts resulting from the deposit by him of the fees and emoulments of his office and of moneys placed by litigants with him to meet payments for costs or otherwise which they might lawfully be required to make during the course of the litigation.\n It was further alleged that although the interest thus received constituted a fee or emolument of the office of the clerk, or money held in trust by him for the United States, for the receipt of which he was bound by law semiannually to account, he had failed to do so and was therefore liable.\n By plea the defendants admitted the collection by the clerk of the amount sued for as interest on the average daily balances of his bank accounts made up as alleged of moneys derived from fees and emoluments and deposits by litigants under the rules or orders of court. The plea averred that, as required by law, the clerk had made his semiannual accountings in which, although he did not charge himself with the interest allowed him on his bank balances as stated, he had charged himself with every item constituting a fee or emolument of his office from whatever source due, and after debiting the charge thus made with the proper proportion of his salary and the expenses of his office, had turned the balance, if any there was, into the Treasury of the United States. There was annexed to the plea a copy of the rules of court relating to the placing by litigants of money with the clerk, and the plea alleged that whenever, out of such money, any \n\n[253 U.S. 195, 200]\n\u00a0\n charge whether for a fee or emolument or otherwise became due, it was at once paid, so that the amount of that deposit always solely represented money belonging to and held for the account of the depositing litigant to meet payments due by him which might thereafter arise.\n To this plea the United States demurred as stating no defense and, after hearing, its demurrer was overruled. 209 Fed. 266. In consequence of an election by the United States to plead no further, the case was submitted for judgment on the petition and plea.\n At that time the court had under advisement eight other cases involving the questions arising in this, five being suits by the United States against the clerks of other United States courts and three, in addition to this, being against the clerk who is defendant here, covering interest collected for different periods. The court disposed of the nine cases in one opinion. It held that as there was no contention as to a default by the clerk concerning any money deposited with him by litigants, that subject would be put out of view. Carefully considering the pleadings, it held that the claim of the United States to the interest rested upon one or the other of two propositions: (1) That the money deposited by the clerk and upon which the interest was allowed was public moneys of the United States and therefore the interest belonged to the United States; (2) that without reference to whether the deposits were public moneys, the interest paid was an emolument for which the clerk was bound to account. Elaborately considering these questions the court decided both against the United States.\n Reviewing on error one of the cases against this defendant which was decided, as we have seen, by the trial court along with this, the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court in a brief per curiam opinion in which it approved the analysis of the case as made by the trial court and concurred in holding decisive the cases in this \n\n[253 U.S. 195, 201]\n\u00a0\n court which the trial court relied upon. Subsequently when the case now before us came to be heard the ruling in the case just stated was applied to this and the judgment was therefore also affirmed.\n In argument here it is suggested by the United States that as the defendant clerk was by exceptional legislation an officer whose salary was specifically appropriated for (Act July 31, 1894, 28 Stat. 162, 204; Act March 2, 1895, 28 Stat. 764, 806; Act Aug. 24, 1912, 37 Stat. 417, 465), therefore the principles passed upon below are not necessarily decisive. But aside from the disregard of the admissions resulting from the pleadings which the suggestion involves and the entire absence of even an intimation that such a contention was raised in either of the courts below, we put the belated suggestion out of view, since as it is not disputed that the defendant clerk was under obligation to meet the expenses of his office from the fees and emoluments thereof and to pay over to the United States only the surplus resulting, we think the distinction assumed to arise from the proposition stated makes no difference in the application of the principles which the court below held to be conclusive and the soundness of which we are now therefore required to pass upon.\n As we agree with the lower court that the two propositions decided by the trial court embraced the whole case, we are thus brought, first, to determine whether the fees and emoluments collected by the clerk and deposited by him in bank and upon which interest was allowed him were public moneys of the United States, thus entitling the United States to the interest as an increment of its ownership. That it was not is so completely foreclosed as to cause it to be only necessary to consider the previous ruling on the subject.\n In United States v. Mason, \n218 U.S. 517\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 28, the court was called upon to determine the validity of the action of a \n\n[253 U.S. 195, 202]\n\u00a0\n Circuit Court of the United States in quashing three indictments against the clerk of a Circuit Court of the United States for the 'embezzlement of certain moneys of the United States,' which moneys were a portion of the surplus of fees and emoluments of his office over and above the compensation and allowances authorized by law to be retained by him. The indictments were based, and the sole reliance to sustain them and thus reverse the court below was rested, upon sections 5490 and 5497, Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  10257, 10264), with the amendments made by Act Feb. 3, 1879, c. 42 (20 Stat. 280 [Comp. St.  10265]), each of which sections exclusively dealt with embezzlement of 'public moneys.' Whether, therefore, the particular moneys which were there in question, being derived from fees and emoluments of the clerk, were public moneys required necessarily to be decided. Reviewing historically the legislation covering clerks of courts of the United States which had been previously recapitulated in United States v. Hill, \n120 U.S. 169\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 510, it was pointed out, first, that originally clerks of courts were not salaried, but were remunerated by the right to collect and retain established fees and emoluments and that under such legislation the sums collected by the clerks were in no sense public moneys of the United States, but were moneys of the clerks held by them in their personal capacity in payment for their official services.\n Coming to state the evolution in the situation by which in time it came to pass that a limit was placed on the amount of compensation which a clerk should annually receive and consequently making it his duty to account for his fees and emoluments and to turn over to the United States the surplus, if any, remaining after the payment of his compensation and the expenses of his office, the court observed (\n218 \nU.S. 523, 524\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 31):\n'The plain object of this statute was to limit the amount which the clerk was to retain and to require an accounting, an audit of expenses, and a payment of the surplus. Other wise \n\n[253 U.S. 195, 203]\n\u00a0\n the established method of administering the office was not changed. The fees were to be recovered as theretofore; and to the extent of the amount of the fixed compensation of the clerk and the necessary expenses of his office, he was entitled to use and to pay as formerly. The statute suggests no other course. What, i anything, should be paid into the public treasury at the end of the half year, when he was to make his return, depended upon the amount of the fees, the amount of the expenses and the result of the audit. If his fixed compensation and his necessary expenses exhausted the fees there would be nothing to pay. The amount payable was to be determined when the return was made.'\n\n Testing the possible application of the statutes dealing with the embezzlement of public moneys to the rights and duties of a clerk to collect the fees and emoluments of his office and to make use of them as authorized by law, it was pointed out that such application could not be made because of the incompatibility between the powers and duties of the clerk, on the one hand, and the provisions of the statutes relied upon, on the other. This incongruity was aptly illustrated by the statement which follows dealing with the duties of the clerk and the impossibility of applying to them the prohibitions of one of the statutes in question (\n218 U.S. 525\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 32):\n'They lay outside of the prohibition of section 16 against loaning, using, converting to his own use, depositing in banks, and exchanging for other funds, for it was upon these fees that the clerk depended for his livelihood and for the payment of the expenses of his office, subject only to the duty twice a year to make his accounting and to pay over the surplus if the fees exceeded the total amount allowed him.'\n\n Again marking the broad line which lay between public money and the clerk's fees and emoluments and his right to collect and disburse the same, the court declared (\n218 U.S. 529\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 33):\n'There has thus been established a distinct system with \n\n[253 U.S. 195, 204]\n\u00a0\n respect to the fees and emoluments of the clerks. Its features are to be explained by the history of the clerk's office and the requirements of its convenient administration. It is urged that the fees and emoluments are attached to the office, and are received in an official capacity. This consideration, however, does not aid the prosecution, for they were attached to the office before the statute of 1841, when they belonged to the clerk without any duty on his part to account for any portion of them.'\n\n And once more emphasizing the distinction it was said (\n218 U.S. 531\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 34):\n'The fees and emoluments are not received by the clerk as moneys or property belonging to the United States, but as the amount allowed to him for his compensation and office expenses under the statutes defining his rights and duties, and with respect to the amount payable when the return is made the clerk is not trustee but debtor. Any other view must ignore not only the practical construction which the statutes governing the office have received, but their clear intent.'\n\n Indeed the decisive principles which were thus announced in the Mason Case were but a reiteration and application of the general doctrine on the subject announced in United States v. Hill, \n123 U.S. 681\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 308, where it was in express terms pointed out that--\n'A clerk of a court of the United States collects his taxable 'compensation,' not as the revenue of the United States, but as fees and emoluments of his office, with the obligation on his part to account to the United States for all he gets over a certain sum which is fixed by law.'\n\n Conclusively disposing as these cases do of the contention of the government as to public moneys of the United States, it leaves only for consideration the question of whether the interest on the sum of the fees and emoluments deposited by the clerk in bank was in and of itself an emolument for which he was liable to account. But that \n\n[253 U.S. 195, 205]\n\u00a0\n question is virtually also foreclosed in view of what was held in the Mason Case, since the individual character of the bank deposit as there defined and the right to make it necessarily causes the increment of such deposit, that is, the interest, to pat ake of the character of the principal. And besides, aside from the ruling in the Mason Case, it had been previously held that a sum collected by a clerk for a service not pertaining to his office or provided for in the schedule of fees allowed him for official services was not a fee or emolument in the sense of the statute. United States v. Hill, \n120 U.S. 169\n, 7 Sup. Ct. 510.\n Although at the outset we eliminated from consideration liability for interest on money of litigants deposited with the clerk under the rules of court because not embraced in the claim of money or property of the United States upon which all the government contentions here rest, in leaving the case we observe that the question of the liability of the clerk to pay interest to litigants on money deposited by them is in a large degree covered by the rules of court annexed to the plea, which permit in the cases specified an application of a litigant to the court to direct the allowance of such interest and to provide for its payment by the clerk when the request is granted.\n In conclusion we direct attention, as was done in the Mason Case and as did the trial court in this case, to the incompatibility which would result, on the one hand, from enforcing an absolute obligation on the part of the clerk to account for all the fees and emoluments of the clerk's office whether collected or not as well as his duty to defray the expenses of his office out of such revenue, and the upholding, on the other hand, of the conflicting theory that the fees and emoluments were public moneys and the power of the clerk to deal with them accordingly limited.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE dissent. \n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. NATIONAL SURETY CO.(1920)\nNo. 271\nArgued: Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 73, 74]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Assistant Attorney General Spellacy and Leonard B. Zeisler, of Chicago, Ill., for the United States.\n Messrs. S. W. Fordyce, Jr., and Thomas W. White, both of St. Louis, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The National Surety Company executed as surety two bonds given to secure contracts entered into with the United States. The contractor defaulted, and was later adjudicated a bankrupt. The loss to the government was about $13,000. The Surety Company paid to it on account of this loss $3,150, the full amount of the liability on the bonds. Thereupon the government proved its claim in bankruptcy for the balance, claiming, under Revised Statutes,  3466 (Comp. St.  6372),1 priority therefore over all other \n\n[254 U.S. 73, 75]\n\u00a0\n creditors. The Surety Company proved for the $3,150, and claimed that under Revised Statutes,  3468 (Comp. St.  6374),2 it was entitled to a share in the distribution of the estate pro rata on an equality with the government. The net assets of the estate were less than the amount of the government's claim. The referee sustained the contention of the Surety Company, and his order was affirmed both by the District Judge and by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 262 Fed. 62. The case comes here on writ of certiorari. \n252 U.S. 577\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 396. The single question presented is whether in the distribution of the bankrupt's estate the United States has priority over the Surety Company.\n Section 3468 applying an ostablished rule of the law of subrogation, Lidderdale v. Robinson, 12 Wheat. 594, 596, declares that when 'a surety pays the United States the money due upon ... [a] bond, such surety ... shall have the like priority for the recovery ... of the moneys ... as is secured to the United States.' Section 3466, embodying the common-law rule by which the sovereign has priority over other creditors of an insolvent, United States v. State Bank of North Carolina, 6 Pet. 29, 35, declares that 'the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied.' There is no conflict between the two sections, which are substantially a reenactment and extension of the provisions of section 65 of the Act of March 2, \n\n[254 U.S. 73, 76]\n\u00a0\n 1799, c. 22, 1 Stat. 627, 676 (Comp. St.  6372, 6374). The priority secured to the United States by section 3466 is priority over all other creditors; that is, private persons and other public bodies. This priority the surety obtains upon discharging its obligation. But what the surety asks here is not to enjoy like priority over such other creditors, but equality with the United States, a creditor whose debt it partly secured. To accord such equality would abridge the priority expressly conferred upon the government. While the priority given the surety by the statute attaches as soon as the obligation upon the bond is discharged, it cannot ripen into enjoyment unless or until the whole debt due the United States is satisfied. This result is in harmony with a familiar rule of the law of subrogation under which a surety liable only for part of the debt does not become subrogated to collateral or to remedies available to the creditor unless he pays the whole debt or it is otherwise satisfied. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 3466. Whenever any person indebteded to the United States is insolvent, or whenever the estate of any deceased debtor, in the hands of the executors or administrators, is insufficient to pay all the debts due from the deceased, the debts due to the United States shall be first satisfied; and the priority hereby established shall extend as well to cases in which a debtor, not having sufficient property to pay all his debts, makes a voluntary assignment thereof, or in which the estate or effects of an absconding, concealed, or absent debtor are attached by process of law, as to cases in which an act of bankruptcy is committed. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Sec. 3468.

C., for Omaha Tribe of indians.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n We have here an appeal and a cross-appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims in a suit brought under the Act of Jund 22, 1910 (36 Stat. 580, c. 313), which conferred upon that court jurisdiction to hear and determine 'all claims of whatsoever nature which the Omaha tribe of Indians may have or claim to have against the United States ... under the treaty between the United States and the said tribe of Indians, ratified and affirmed March sixteenth, eighteen hundred and fifty-four, or under \n\n[253 U.S. 275, 277]\n\u00a0\n any other treaties or laws, or for the misappropriation of any funds of said tribe for purposes not for its material benefit, or for failure of the United States to pay said tribe any money du, ' with authority to hear and determine all legal and equitable claims of the tribe, and also any legal or equitable defense, set-off, or counterclaim, and to settle the rights both legal and equitable of the parties, notwithstanding lapse of time or statutes of limitation.\n The Court of Claims, after hearing the case, made findings upon which it awarded judgment in favor of the Indians for various sums aggregating $ 122,295.31. 53 Ct. Cl. 549.\n By article 1 of the treaty of March 16, 1854 (10 Stat. 1043), the Omaha Indians ceded to the United States all their lands west of the Missouri river and south of a line drawn due west from a point stated, reserving the country north of that line for their future home, with a proviso that, if this country should not, on exploration, prove to be a satisfactory and suitable location for the Indians, the President might with their consent set apart and assign to them, within or outside of the ceded country, a residence suited for and acceptable to them, not greater in extent than 300,000 acres, in which ase all of the country belonging to said Indians north of the line specified should be ceded to the United States, and the Indians should receive the same rate per acre for it, less the number of acres assigned in lieu of it, as was agreed to be paid for the lends south of the line. By article 4, in consideration of and payment for the country thus ceded, and certain relinquishments made by the Indians, the United States agreed to pay to them certain sums of money, aggregating $840,000, in specified annual installments commencing on January 1, 1855; these sums to be paid to the Omahas or expended for their use and benefit under the direction of the President of the United States, who was from time to time to determine at his discretion what proportion of the annual payments should be paid in money and what proportion \n\n[253 U.S. 275, 278]\n\u00a0\n applied to and expended for the moral improvement and education of the Indians, for such beneficial objects as in his judgment would be calculated to advance them in civilization, for buildings, opening farms, fencing, breaking land, providing stock, etc., and for medical purposes. By article 5, in order to enable the Indians to settle their affairs and to remove and subsist themselves for one year at their new home, and for certain other expenses, they were to receive from the United States the further sum of $41,000, to be paid out and expended under the direction of the President and in such manner as he should approve.\n The Court of Claims found that the Omahas were not satisfied with the country to the north of the east and west line mentioned, and duly elected to take for their future home a tract of 300,000 acres south of the line; and, this fact being reported to the President, by his direction a tract of 300,000 acres south of the line was set apart for them. The court found that the area of the land north of the line belonging to the Indians was 783,365 acres, and that after deducting from this the 300,000 acres set apart for them in accordance with the provisions of the treaty, there was an excess of 483,365 acres, for which they had not been paid. The price for this was fixed by taking the aggregate of the treaty payments ($881, 000) and dividing it by 4,500,000 acres, the area of the lands south of the line ceded by the Omahas to the United States, making the treaty price 19.6 cents per acre, at which rate the 483,365 acres for which the Indians were still to be paid amounted to $94,739.54. This was awarded to them.\n The court found that, of the $41,000 specified in article 5, the government expended $23,453.21 in carrying out the provisions of that article, and the balance, $17,546.79, remained in the hands of the Indian agents of the United States charged with the disbursement of the treaty funds, who were guilty of defalcations of this and other moneys to the aggregate amount of $18,202.19. This was allowed. \n\n[253 U.S. 275, 279]\n\u00a0\n By the seventh article of the treaty the United States agreed to protc t the Omahas from the Sioux and all other hostile tribes as long as the President might deem such protection necessary. The court found that after the treaty the Sioux made repeated attacks upon the Omahas in the year of removal and subsequent years; that the United States was called upon by the Omahas to protect them, and such protection was necessary as soon as they removed to their new home and for several years thereafter, but no protection was afforded them by the United States. The Sioux killed 22 Omahas and stole 152 horses; the latter worth $30 per head. The court allowed $4,560 for the horses, but made no allowance for the Indians killed.\n By a treaty concluded March 6, 1865 (14 Stat. 667), the United States agreed to pay the Omahas for the cession of a part of their reservation the sum of $50,000, to be expended 'for goods, provisions, cattle, horses,' etc., for their benefit. Pursuant to this, as the Court of Claims found, 103 head of stock cattle were delivered in the year 1867, for which $3,432. 99 was paid out of money beloging to the Omahas. 'These cattle, when they reached the reservation, were in bad condition, and 50 of them died,' of an average value of $33.33 per head; the 50 being worth $1,666.50. This sum was allowed.\n Under article 4 of the treaty of 1854 and article 2 of the treaty of 1865 certain moneys were to be or might be expended for the benefit of the Indians in the way of improvements upon their reservation, and in other ways. Under these provisions, in the year 1875 an infirmary was constructed upon the Omaha and Winnebago consolidated reservation. The Court of Claims found that this building was not used, and was not such a building as was contemplated by the treaties with the Omahas, and that, of its cost, $3,127.08 was paid out of money belonging to them. This sum was allowed.\n The principal reason for the government's appeal lay in \n\n[253 U.S. 275, 280]\n\u00a0\n the award to the tribe of $94,739.54 for the excess land north of the dividing line mentioned in the treaty; it having been contended in the court below that the tribe owned none of that land. The Court of Claims having found to the contrary, the government moved this court, after taking appeal, for an order remanding the case, with directions for further findings on the question. This motion having been overruled, as well as a counter motion submitted by the claimant for a certification of the entire record to this court, the government concedes that it cannot contest the correctness of the judgment upon this item.\n As to the item of $4,560 allowed as the value of horses killed by the Sioux Indians, we conclude that the objection of the government is well founded. The obligation of the treaty was to protect the Omahas from the Sioux and other hostile tribes 'as long as the President may deem such protection necessary.' The obligation depended upon an exercise of discretion by the President. There is no finding of a failure to provide any protection deemed by the President to be necessary; hence nothing to create a liability, legal or equitable, under the treaty clause.\n The item of $18,202.19 allowed for defalcations of the Indian agents is not disputed.\n The government contests the allowance for the stock cattle upon the ground that the fact that they were in bad condition when they reached the reservation is not sufficient to show that they were in such condition when purchased; it being suggested that their defective condition upon reaching the reservation may have been due to the rigors and hardships of the drive from the market to the reservation. We cannot so interpret the finding, deeming its necessary import to be that the cattle either were in bad condition when purchased or were badly cared for on the way to the reservation. In either event the fault lay with the agents of the United States, and the Indians were entitled to credit for the sum allowed on this account. \n\n[253 U.S. 275, 281]\n\u00a0\n The allowance for the infirmary is disputed upon the ground that the treaties, fairly construed, gave authority for x pending moneys of the Omahas for this purpose, especially the very general language of article 4 of the treaty of 1854, authorizing the President to expend a part of the fund 'for such beneficial objects as in his judgment will be calculated to advance them in civilization' and 'for medical purposes.' We construe the finding, 'This building was not used, and it was not such a building as was contemplated by the treaties,' as meaning, not that a building of this general character was not contemplated, but that the particular building was not what it ought to have been, and not suitable for the use of the Indians. So construed, it is either a finding upon a mere question of fact, or at most a finding of mixed fact and law, where the question of law is inseparable. In the latter case, as in the former, the finding, on familiar principles, is not reviewable. Ross v. Day, \n232 \nU.S. 110, 116\n, 117 S., 34 Sup. Ct. 233, and cases cited. The fact that the building was not used shows that the tribe did not accept it, and received no benefit from it. And since, because of its unfitness, they were not obliged to accept it, the expenditure of their money in its construction was a misappropriation of funds of the tribe 'for purposes not for its material benefit,' within the meaning of the jurisdictional act. We affirm the allowance of this item.\n Upon the cross-appeal, assignments of error are based upon the disallowance of interest. As to the $94,739.54 awarded for the land north of the dividing line in excess of 300,000 acres, it is contended that payment of this consideration was a concurrent condition of the passing of title to the United States, and as equity considers that as done which ought to be done the purchase money was, potentially, in the Treasury of the United States as a trust fund, and ought to be treated as if invested for the benefit of the Indians at 5 per cent. interest, under Rev. Stat. \n\n[253 U.S. 275, 282]\n\u00a0\n  2095, 2096, and 3659 (Comp. St.  4073, 4074, 6667), or, in the alternative, that the assumption by the United States of title to the land without compliance with the concurrent condition of payment to the Indians and its sale by the United States to settlers was a breach of trust, requiring the United States to account to the Omahas for the miniumum sale price of $1.25 per acre. But the provisions of articles 1 and 4 of the treaty show that the theory that the passing of title was conditioned upon the payment of the consideration money, or any part of it, is untenable; hence there was no such trust as is asserted, and the price of the land was fixed by the treaty itself. By article 1 there was a cession in praesenti of the land south of the described line, with a proviso that if upon exploration the country north of the line did not prove to be a satisfactory and suitable location for the Indians the President might, with their consent, set apart and assign to them a suitable residence, in which case all of the country belonging to them north of the line 'shall be and is hereby ceded to the United States by the said Indians, they to receive the same rate per acre for it, less the number of acres assigned in lieu of it for a home, as now paid for the land south of said line.' By article 4 the consideration money for the principal cession was to be paid in the future, and either paid to the Indians direct or expended for their use and benefit from time to time, in the discretion of the President; and, by fair construction, the money that the Indians were to receive under article 1 for the additional cession of the land north of the line, in the event of such cession taking effect, was subject to the same terms as to payment, at least to the extent that it was for the President to determine in his discretion whether it should be paid in cash to the Omahas or expended for their benefit 'from time to time.' Clearly, an intent to defer passing of title until payment of consideration is negatived, and this as truly with respect to the land north of the line as to that sot h of it. In both cases there was \n\n[253 U.S. 275, 283]\n\u00a0\n simply a present cession, with a covenant for payment of the cosideration thereafter, no mention being made of interest. Clearly, the provision of section 177, Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1168), is applicable:\n'No interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest.'\n\n It is contended, however, both as to the award for the excess land and as to another claim allowed, that as the jurisdictional act calls for the consideration of equitable as well as legal claims, the ordinary rule of equity ought to be followed as to the allowance of interest; Himely v. Rose, 5 Cranch. 313, 319, being cited. But the jurisdictional act cannot be regarded as taking the case out of the usual rule. Tillson v. United States, \n100 U.S. 43\n, 46; Harvey v. United States, \n113 \nU.S. 243, 249\n, 5 S. Sup. Ct. 465. Nor does United States v. Old Settlers, \n148 U.S. 427\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 650, support the claim for interest, for there the particular question was a subject of difference in the negotiation that preceded the treaty; a clause of the treaty itself provided that it should be submitted to the Senate of the United States for decision; the Senate allowed interest; and its determination was accepted by the United States as valid and binding. This court held that the decision of the Senate was controlling, and that therefore interest must be allowed upon that part of the claim to which it applied.

Ira Bronson, of Seattle, Wash., and George H. Patrick, of Washington, D. C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit to cancel a patent issued to William B. Poland for one hundred and sixty acres of land in Alaska, the gravamen of the complaint being that by this and another patent, both based upon soldiers' additional homestead rights, Poland acquired a single body of land of larger acreage than was permitted by the statute under which the patents were sought and issued. The defendants, who were the patentee and another claiming under him, separately demurred to the complaint, and the court sustained the demurrers and dismissed the suit. That decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting, 231 Fed. 810, 145 C. C. A. 630, and the case is here on writ of certiorari.\n Of course, it rested with Congress to determine whether, when, and with what restrictions the general land laws should be extended to Alaska. For many years there was no affirmative action upon the subject. The first steps consisted of limited extensions of the laws relating to mining claims, Act May 17, 1884, c. 53,  8, 23 Stat. 24, 26, and Town Sites Act March 3, 1891, c. 561,  11, \n\n[251 U.S. 221, 223]\n\u00a0\n 26 Stat. 1095, 1099 (Comp. St.  5079); but with these we are not now concerned. The homestead laws were the next to receive attention. By the Act of May 14, 1898, c. 299, 30 Stat. 409, they were extended to that district with the restrictions (a) that 'no homestead' should exceed eighty acres in extent, and (b) that 'no entry' should extend more than eighty rods along the shore of any navigable water, and along such shore a space of at least eighty rods should be reserved from entry between all such claims. And by the amendatory Act of March 3, 1903, c. 1002, 32 Stat. 1028 (Comp. St.  5046), the extension of the homestead laws was repeated and confirmed, but with the qualifications (a) that an actual settler intending to comply with the requirements in respect of continued residence, cultivation, etc., should be entitled to enter three hundred and twenty acres or a less quantity, (b) that 'no more than one hundred and sixty acres shall be entered in any single body' by means of soldiers' additional homestead rights, and (c) that 'no entry' should extend more than one hundred and sixty rods along the shore of any navigable water, and along such shore a space of at least eighty rods should be reserved from entry between all such claims. Further restrictions were imposed, but there is no present need for noticing them.\n The controversy here is over the meaning and purpose of the provision that no more than one hundred and sixty acres shall be entered in any single body by means of soldiers' additional homestead rights.\n The material facts to be gathered from the complaint are these: Poland, who was the assignee of certain soldiers' additional homestead rights entitling their owner to enter and acquire in the aggregate 319.75 acres, wished to use them in entering and acquiring certain land in Alaska. The regular public surveys had not been extended to that locality, so he caused a special survey of the land to be made at his expense, as was permitted by applicable- \n\n[251 U.S. 221, 224]\n\u00a0\n regulations. 32 Land Dec. 424; 28 Land Dec. 149. By that survey the land, which was in a compact or single body, was divided into two tracts-one of 159.75 acres, designated as survey No. 241, and the other of 160 acres, designated as survey No. 242. As surveyed the north boundary of one tract was the south boundary of the other, and this was shown in the surveyor's return. On April 26, 1906, after the survey, he presented at the local land office two applications whereby he sought to make separate entries of the two tracts with his soldiers' additional rights-some of the rights being used on one tract and the others on the other tract. The applications were approved and passed to entry and patent-the patent for the 160 acres being issued a considerable period after the other.\n In these circumstances the complaint charges that the 319.75 acres, although surveyed in the form of two tracts, were but a single body of land in the sense of the provision in question; that the land officers in passing both applications to entry and patent acted upon a misconception of the law and of their authority; and that in consequence the later patent, whereby Poland's acquisition was made in exceed one hundred and sixty acres in a single body, was issued in violation of law and should be canceled.\n The complaint also contains an allegation that that patent was fraudulently procured in that among the proofs presented to the land officers was an affidavit falsely representing, in effect, that the two tracts were more than eighty rods apart, when in truth they were adjoining tracts. But this allegation must be put out of view, first, because the words of the affidavit as set forth in the complaint do not sustain the pleader's conclusion as to what was represented, and, second, because the complaint makes it certain that the application and other entry papers clearly disclosed \n\n[251 U.S. 221, 225]\n\u00a0\n In approaching the consideration of the provision whose meaning and purpose are in question, it is well to recall what soldiers' additional homestead rights are and what use could be made of them outside Alaska when the provision was adopted. They are rights to enter and acquire unappropriated nonmineral public land without settlement, residence, improvement, or cultivation, and without payment of any purchase price. They are not personal to the original beneficiaries but are transferable at will, and the number that may be assigned to the same person is not limited. A single right is always for less, and generally much less, than one hundred and sixty acres, but rights aggregating many times that number of acres may be and often are held by a single assignee. When the provision was adopted there were almost no restrictions upon the use of such rights outside Alaska. Indeed, the only restriction of any moment was one, uniformly respected, preventing the inclusion of more than one hundred and sixty acres in a single entry. But the number of such entries that might be made by the same person was not restricted, nor was there any limitation upon the amount of land in a single body that might be entered in that way. Thus an assignee having rights aggregating six hundred and forty acres could use them in entering that amount of land in a compact body one mile square, if only he did so through four entries of one hundred and sixty acres each. And, if he had rights the aggregate of which was sufficient, he could in a like way enter a body of land three miles square or even an entire township. See Rev. Stat.  2289, 2304, 2306 (Comp. St.  4530, 4592, 4594); Webster v. Luther, \n163 U.S. 331\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 963; Diamond Coal Co. v. United States, \n233 \nU.S. 236, 243\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 507; Robinson v. Lundrigan, \n227 \nU.S. 173, 178\n, 179 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 255; 3 Land Dec. 472; Edgar Boice, 29 Land Dec. 599, and Edgar O'Keefe, Id., 643; 30 Land Dec. 285; 31 Land Dec. 441; 32 Land Dec. 418; Ole B. Olsen, 33 Land Dec. 225; 45 Land Dec. 236, par. 3; General Circular of 1904, pp. 11, 26-28.\n With this understanding of the circumstances in which \n\n[251 U.S. 221, 226]\n\u00a0\n the provision was incorporated into the Act of 1903 extending the homestead laws to Alaska, we think the meaning and purpose of the provision are manifest. It is in form a proviso and says 'no more than one hundred and sixty acres shall be entered in any single body' by means of soldiers' additional homestead rights. A purpose to prevent the use of these rights in entering a large acreage in a single body hardly could be more plainly expressed. There is nothing in the provision indicating that it is concerned merely with what may be taken by a single entry; and to construe it in that way would make it practically useless, for a large acreage in a single body still could be taken by merely resorting to two or more entries. Besides, the amount of land that could be taken by a single entry had long been limited to one hundred and sixty acres, and of course to say that no greater amount should be taken in a single body by a single entry would add nothing to that limitation. But the provision does not speak of a single entry but only of the amount that may be 'entered in any single body,' and if it is to have any real effect it must be construed according to the natural import of its words; that is to say, as limiting the amount of land in a compact or single body that may be entered by means of soldiers' additional homestead rights, whether the entering be by one or several entries. We conclude therefore that the provision, while leaving one who holds several rights free to exercise all of them and to make as many entries as his rights will sustain, prohibits him from using them to enter and acquire more than one hundred and sixty acres in a compact or single body.\n The court in Alaska regarded the provision as sufficiently like that relating to the area of placer mining claims (Rev. Stat.  2330, 2331 [ Comp. St.  4629, 4630]) to require that it be similarly construed. But we think there is a marked difference between the two provisions. That in the placer mining law says 'no location' shall exceed a prescribed \n\n[251 U.S. 221, 227]\n\u00a0\n area and it means, as the statute otherwise shows, that no single location shall include more.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals was of opinion that--\n'What the statute was seeking to protect was the shores of the navigable waters of Alaska and not to prohibit the entry of a tract of more than 160 acres.'\n\n In this the court apparently confused the present provision, which operates in the same way in all parts of Alaska, with another and wholly distinct provision, which relates only to entries along the shore. Their independence and the subjects to which they relate are best shown by quoting both in the order in which they appear in the statute, which we do:\n'And provided further that no more than one hundred and sixty acres shall be entered in any single body by ... soldier's additional homestead right.'\n\n'Previded, that no entry shall be allowed extending more than one hundred and sixty rods along the shore of any navigable water, and along such shore a space of at least eighty rods shall be reserved from entry between all such claims.'\n\n There is in this case no question as to what distance along the shore an entry may extend, or as to what space shall be reserved between claims along the shore, but only a question as to whether making separate entries of lands which in point of contiguity and compactness constitute a single body of 319.75 acres is in contravention of the provision first quoted, where both entries are by the same person and are based upon soldiers' additional homestead rights. That question we answer in the affirmative for the reasons before indicated.\n It follows that, if the facts be as alleged in the complaint, the second patent was issued in violation of law and the Government is entitled to demand that it be canceled, unless, as is asserted in the brief for the defendants, one of them is a bona fide purchaser. The complaint does not show that he is such, and the rule is that this is an \n\n[251 U.S. 221, 228]\n\u00a0\n affirmative defense, which he must set up and establish. Wright-Blodgett Co. v. United States, \n236 \nU.S. 397, 403\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 339; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Hower, \n236 \nU.S. 702, 710\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 465.\n If the patent is canceled, Poland, or his assignee, will be free to exercise the rights with which the patent was obtained (see Harlan Cole, 6 Land Dec. 290, and John E. Courtright, Id. 459), and also to ask repayment under the Act of June 16, 1880, c. 244, 21 Stat. 287 (Comp. St.  4595- 4598), of the fees and commissions paid to the land officers.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","173":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU S v. THOMPSON(1920)\nNo. 250\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 407, 408]\n\u00a0\n Mr. W. C. Herron, of Washington, D. C., for the United States.\n Mr. J. E. B. Cunningham, of Harrisburg Pa., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Comptroller of the Currency, in January, 1915, closed the doors of the First National Bank of Uniontown, Pennsylvania. At the opening of the November term, 1915, of the court below, sitting at Pittsburgh, the attention of the grand jury was called by the court to alleged criminal acts connected with the administration of the affairs of the bank, and, following an investigation, the district attorney submitted to the grand jury a proposed indictment charging Thompson, the president of the bank, in 47 counts with violations of the National \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 409]\n\u00a0\n Bank Act. The grand jury having concluded to indict only for the first 17 of said counts, the district attorney prepared an indictment embracing them and withdrew the other 30 from consideration. The bill thus drawn was submitted to the grand jury, by it presented as a true bill, and was ordered filed.\n On March 17, 1916, the Attorney General of the United States, pursuant to the Act of June 30, 1906 (34 Stat. 816 [Comp. St.  534]), appointed a special assistant for the purpose of co-operating with the district attorney in the matter of the steps to be taken to procure the indictment of Thompson. The next session of the court was held in March, 1916, at Erie, and the district attorney and the assistant to the Attorney General, without asking authority of the court, directed the attention of the grand jury to the charges against Thompson covered by the counts as to which the grand jury at Pittsburgh had failed to make a presentment, and after hearing witnesses called by the district attorney, the Erie grand jury on the 24th day of March, found a true bill containing 30 counts covering such charges. When this indictment was presented the court expressed doubt, in view of the fact that the charges had been submitted to a previous grand jury and no presentment had been made, whether there was any authority in the Erie grand jury, at the instance of the district attorney, to consider such charges without previously obtaining the consent of the court. However, the court observed that as the grand jury had reported a true bill, it would be placed on file, with the reservation of a right to take such future action regarding it as might be deemed appropriate.\n Both indictments went upon the calendar for hearing, but that result was postponed from time to time in order to afford the accused an opportunity to prepare his defense. Finally in May, 1918, when both indictments were set for trial, a motion was made to quash both, based, as \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 410]\n\u00a0\n far as concerned the Erie indictment, upon the ground that the grand jury had considered the subject of that indictment, not of its own motion, but upon the suggestion of the district attorney without any previous authority given him by the court. The motionw as further supported by the assertion that the presentment of a true bill by the Erie grand jury was not made--\n'from the personal knowledge of any of the grand jurors, nor from the testimony of witnesses sent before the grand jury by leave or by order of the court; that the knowledge upon which said presentment was so made came to said grand jury through the evidence of certain witnesses called before said grand jury by the United States attorney without the order or permission of the court; and the subject-matter of said presentment was not called to the attention of or given in charge or submitted to the grand jury by the court.'\n\n In addition, the motion averred that the 30 counts included in the Erie indictment covered the same offenses which were embrached by the 30 counts as to which the Pittsburgh grand jury had failed to find a true bill, and that the witnesses introduced by the district attorney at Erie were virtually the same witnesses previously by him introduced as to the same charges before the Pittsburgh grand jury.\n The motion as to the Pittsburgh indictment was rejected and we put it out of view. That as to the Erie indictment was granted on the ground that the district attorney had no authority, after the action of the Pittsburgh grand jury, to resubmit the same matters to the Erie grand jury without the approval of the court, and that the Erie grand jury, for the same reason, had no authority to consider the subject. The court said:\n'The resubmission of those matters to the later grand jury at the Erie term was without the knowledge or approval of the court. The resubmission of the offenses against the government to a new grand jury is a matter of the \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 411]\n\u00a0\n highest prerogative, and is always subject to the control of the court, and, in proper cases, always granted by the court. ... Again, it appears ... that there was a special designation by the Attorney General, of some one, to attend the sessions of the grand jury at Erie and proceed with the investigation.\n\n'We find, then, a subsequent introduction of the same matters to a later grand jury with the pressure, perhaps, of a specially designated representative of the highest officer in the Department of Justice, without the approval or without the permission of the court, and perhaps to the prejudice of the defendant. ...\n\n'I am satisfied that the matters in connection with the finding of the indictment at Erie were more than irregularities, and, therefore, I must sustain the motion to quash the indictment found at Erie, and note an exception to the government.\n\n'The court further wishes to state that the control of the grand jury by common law and by statute law is under the court and the proceedings are under the control of the court.\n\n'Mr. Rush (the district attorney): May it please the court, the holding, then, of the court, as I understand it, is that the presentation of the case to the grand jury, which has been formerly ignored, would be a bar to a subsequent presentation, unless leave of court were granted.\n\n'By the court: Without the permission of the court; yes. I think that is the law and that is what I have stated.'\n\n A rehearing was asked on the ground, among others, that if the allowance of the motion to quash were adhered to, the result would be to bar the right of the government to further prosecute for the offenses charged, as in consequence of the continuances which had been granted and the delay in making the motion to quash, the statute of \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 412]\n\u00a0\n limitations would be operative. The rehearing was denied, the court reiterating its previous rulings and pointing out that, as the Pittsburgh indictment had not been quashed, there was opportunity for the government to prosecute for the offenses therein charged, although its right to further prosecute the offenses charged in the Erie indictment would be lost.\n This direct writ of error was then prosecuted under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564 (34 Stat. 1246 [Comp. St.  1704]), both pat ies agreeing, for the purposes of a motion to dismiss for want of jurisdiction, which we now consider, that under the circumstances here disclosed the authority to review must depend upon whether the quashing of the indictment was a 'decision or judgment sustaining a special plea in bar when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.'\n As it is settled that this question is to be determined, not by form but by substance (United States v. Barber, \n219 \nU.S. 72, 78\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 209; United States v. Openheimer, \n242 U.S. 85\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 68, 3 A. L. R. 516), it follows that the fact that the ruling took the form of granting a motion to quash is negligible. Testing, then, the existence of jurisdiction by the substantial operation of the judgment, and assuming for the purpose of that test that the United States possessed the right to submit the indictment to the second grand jury without leave of court, which right was denied by the judgment below, we are of opinion that the power to review the judgment is conferred by the provision of the statute quoted, (a) because its necessary effect was to bar the absolute right of the United States to prosecute by subjecting the exercise of that right, not only as to this indictment, but as to all subsequent ones for the same offenses, to a limitation resulting from the exercise of the judicial power upon which the judgment was based; and (b) because a like consequence resulted as to the authority of the district attorney and the powers of the grand jury, since the exercise in \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 413]\n\u00a0\n both cases of lawful authority was barred by the application of unauthorized judicial discretion.\n It is true it is argued that as the rights which the United States asserted were not possessed, the judgment did not bar the United States or the district attorney or the grand jury from the exercise of any lawful power. But this can only rest upon the assumption, that is there was no error in the judgment there is no power to review it, which, if its premise has any force, will be disposed of by the decision of the merits to which we now proceed.\n The government urges that in the absense of statute of the United States giving such authority, the want of power in the court to quash the indictment for the reasons by it stated, is clearly established by the following propositions, which in an elaborate argument it is insisted are made certain by a consideration of the common law, of the statutory law of the United States, of the practices from the beginning, and of the adjudications of this court which settle the question. The propositions are these:\n\n\n (1)\n That the power and duty of the grand jury to investigate is original and complete, susceptible of being exercised upon its own motion and upon such knowledge as it may derive from any source which it may deem proper, and is not therefore dependent for its exertion upon the approval or disapproval of the court; that this power is continuous and is therefore not exhausted or limited by adverse action taken by a grand jury or by its failure to act, and hence may thereafter be exerted as to the same instances by the same or a subsequent grand jury.\n\n\n (2)\n That the United States district attorney, in virtue of his official duty and to the extent that criminal charges are susceptible of being preferred by information, has the power to present such informations without the previous approval of the court; and that by the same token the duty of the district attorney to direct the attention of a \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 414]\n\u00a0\n grand jury to crimes which he tninks have been committed is coterminous with the authority of the grand jury to entertain such charges.\n We do not stop to review or even cite the extensive array of authorities from which the government deduces these propositions, but content ourselves with referring to the following cases and the authorities therein cited by which the propositions are sustained: Hale v. Henkel, \n201 U.S. 43\n, 59-66, 26 Sup. Ct. 370; Blair v. Unie d States, \n250 U.S. 273\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 468. And see, with particular reference to the second proposition, Weeks v. United States, 216 Fed. 292, 297, 298, 132 C. C. A. 436, L. R. A. 1915B, 651, Ann. Cas. 1917C, 524; Creekmore v. United States, 237 Fed. 743, 150 C. C. A. 497, L. R. A. 1917C, 845; Abbott Bros. v. United States, 242 Fed. 751, 155 C. C. A. 339; Kelly v. United States, 250 Fed. 947, 163 C. C. A. 197. To do more than to make this reference is unnecessary as in argument the abstract correctness of the propositions advanced by the government is conceded and the only controversy is as to their application, based upon the insistence that the present case is governed by an exception which exacts the necessity of procuring the prior approval of the court wherever a district attorney presents to one grand jury charges which a previous grand jury has ignored. The existence of this particular exception was expressly declared by the court below to be the basis for its decision. But we think the ruling, although it rested upon the assumption stated, cannot be sustained, since the assumed exception is so incompatible with the general principles governing the subject as to cause it to be, in substance, not an exception at all, but, under the guise of an exception, a mere disregard or repudiation of the principles themselves, for the following reasons: In the first place, because while admitting the power of the grand jury, it yet denies such power, since it limits the right of that body to inquire by causing it to be unlawful for it to listen, without the approval of the court, to a suggestion of the district attorney under the circumstances stated, and \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 415]\n\u00a0\n therefore causes any finding made to depend upon an inquiry as to the particular source of information which led to the investigation from which the finding resulted. In the second place, because, while conceding that the power of the grand jury is continuous, so that unfavorable action does not exhaust the authority of that or of another grand jury to examine, it limits or restrains thereafter the power of both to do so. In the third place, because, while the general rule which is stated establishes the authority of the district attorney as official prosecutor, and makes it, as we have seen, coterminous with the right of the grand jury to consider, the exception subjects that authority to the exercise of a judicial discretion, which, as well illustrated by the case under consideration, destroys it. In the fourth place, because, comprehensively considering the subject, the assertion of the judicial discretion which was the basis of the judgment below is incompatible with the spirit and purpose underlying the admitted principles as to the power of grand juries, and the right of the goverment to initiate prosecutions for crime, since in the case stated such powers are controlled, not by a rule of law, but depend upon a mere exercise of judicial discretion.\n From the point of view of authority, the argument seeks to establish the existence of the exception upheld by the court below by a reference to a number of cases decided in Pennsylvania and in other states. \n1\n As to the Pennsylvania cases, they undoubtedly support the existence of the exception, not in virtue of any statutory provision to \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 416]\n\u00a0\n that effect, but solely in contemplation of the common law of the state. But, in view of what we have just said concerning the error upon which the exception rests, its departure from the common law, its conflict with the settled rule applicable in the courts of the United States, as sustained by the decisions of this court, we are unable to accept the doctrine of the Pennsylvania cases as being even persuasively controlling.\n As to the cases from other states which are relied upon as sustaining the exception, they are inapplicable because, with one or two exceptions, they rest exclusively upon the provisions of state statutes which on their face show intention to deviate from the general rule which t herwise would prevail at the common law. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n It remains only to consider the contention that, irrespective of the want of persuasive power of the Pennsylvania cases, as the case in hand concerns the prosecution for a crime committed in Pennsylvania, even through it be a crime against the United States, the state rule, in virtue of the provisions of section 722 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (Comp. St.  1542), was authoritatively controlling on the court below and is so controlling here. But the section relied upon provides for applying a state rule only where that course is required by an absence of federal rule on the subject. In view of the existence of a controlling federal rule which would be overthrown by applying the state law, the want of merit in the contention is so self-evident that we heave it without further notice.\n The difference between calling into play a discretion for the purpose of prohibiting the performance of duties authorized by law, lest if their performance be permitted, they may be abused, and the exertion of a sound discretion \n\n[251 U.S. 407, 417]\n\u00a0\n possessed, for the purpose of reasonably regulating the performance of duties by law imposed, serves, in the last analysis, to dispose of the arguments concerning the dangers of abuse of power which may result from a failure to uphold the existence of the discretion which the court below deemed it possessed and upon which its action was based.\n As we have exercised jurisdiction to review on the writ of error, the prayer of the United States for the granting of a rule to show cause why mandamus and prohibition should not issue, if jurisdiction of the writ of error was not maintained, has nothing now to rest upon and it is denied. It further follows from what we have said on the merits that the judgment below must be and it is\n Reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Rowand v.

U S STEEL CORPORATION(1920)\n\nArgued: Decided: March 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 417, 419]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. C. B. Ames, Asst. Atty. Gen., and Henry E. Colton, of Nashville, Tenn., for the United States.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 417, 430]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. R. V. Lindabury, of Newark, N. J., David A. Reed, of Pittsburg, Pa., C. A. Severance, of St. Paul, Minn., and Geo. Welwood Murray, Kenneth B. Halstead, W. J. Curtis and Raynal C. Bolling, all of New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 417, 436]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Suit against the Steel Corporation and certain other companies which it directs and controls by reason of the ownership of their stock, it and they being separately and collectively charged as violators of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830).\n It is prayed that it and they be dissolved because engaged in illegal restraint of trade and the exercise of monopoly.\n Special charges of illegality and monopoly are made and special redresses and remedies are prayed, among others, that there be a prohibition of stoc ownership and exercise \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 437]\n\u00a0\n of rights under such ownership, and that there shall be such orders and distribution of the stock and other properties as shall be in accordance with equity and good conscience and 'shall effectuate the purpose of the Anti-Trust Act.' General relief is also prayed.\n The Steel Corporation is a holding company only; the other companies are the operating ones, manufacturers in the iron and steel industry, 12 in number. There are, besides, other corporations and individuals more or less connected in the activities of the other defendants, that are alleged to be instruments or accomplices in their activities and offendings, and that these activities and offendings (speaking in general terms) extend from 1901 to 1911, when the bill was filed, and have illustrative periods of significant and demonstrated illegality.\n Issue is taken upon all these charges, and we see at a glance what detail of circumstances may be demanded, and we may find ourselves puzzled to compress them into an opinion that will not be of fatiguing prolixity.\n The case was heard in the District Court by four judges. They agreed that the bill should be dismissed; they disagreed as to the reasons for it . (D. C.) 223 Fed. 55. One opinion (written by Judge Buffington and concurred in by Judge McPherson) expressed the view that the Steel Corporation was not formed with the intention or purpose to monopolize or restrain trade, and did not have the motive or effect 'to prejudice the public interest by unduly restricting competition or unduly obstructing the course of trade.' The corporation, in the view of the opinion, was an evolution, a natural consummation of the tendencies of the industry on account of changing conditions, practically a compulsion from 'the metallurgical method of making steel and the physical method of handling it,' this method, and the conditions consequent upon it, tending to combinations of capital and energies rather than diffusion in independent action. And the \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 438]\n\u00a0\n concentration of powers (we are still representing the opinion) was only such as was deemed necessary, and immediately manifested itself in improved methods and products and in an increase of domestic and foreign trade. Indeed an important purpose of the organization was the building up of the export trade in steel and iron which at that time was sporadic, the mere dumping of the products upon foreign markets.\n Not monopoly, therefore, was the purpose of the organization of the corporation, but concentration of efforts, with resultant economies and benefits.\n The tendency of the industry and the purpose of the corporation in yielding to it was expressed in comprehensive condensation by the word 'integration,' which signifies continuity in the processes of the industry from ore mines to the finished product.\n All considerations deemed pertinent were expressed and their influence was attempted to be assigned and, while conceding that the Steel Corporation after its formation in times of financial disturbance, entered into informal agreements or understandings with its competitors to maintain prices, they terminated with their occasions, and, as they had ceased to exist, the court was not justified in dissolving the corporation.\n The other opinion, by Judge Woolley and concurred in by Judge Hunt ( 223 Fed. 161), was in some particulars, in antithesis to Judge Buffington's. The view was expressed that neither the Steel Corporation nor the preceding combinations, which were in a sense its antetypes, had the justification of industrial conditions, nor were they or it impelled by the necessity for integration, or compelled to unite in comprehensive enterprise because such had become a condition of success under the new order of things. On the contrary, that the organizers of the corporation and the preceding companies had illegal purpose from the very beginning, and the corporation \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 439]\n\u00a0\n became 'a combination of combinations by which, directly or indirectly, approxia tely 180 independent concerns were brought under one business control,' which, measured by the amount of production, extended to 80 per cent. or 90 per cent. of the entire output of the country, and that its purpose was to secure great profits which were thought possible in the light of the history of its constituent combinations, and to accomplish permanently what those combinations had demonstrated could be accomplished temporarily, and thereby monopolize and restrain trade. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[251 U.S. 417, 440]\n\u00a0\n The organizers, however, (we are still representing the opinion) underestimated the opposing conditions and at the very beginning the corporation instead of relying upon its own power sought and obtained the assistance and the cooperation of its competitors (the independent companies). In other words the view was expressed that the testimony did 'not show that the corporation in and of itself ever possessed or exerted sufficient power when acting alone to control prices of the products of the industry.' Its power was efficient only when in co-operation with its competitors, and hence it concerted with them in the expedients of pools, associations, trade meetings, and finally in a system of dinners inaugurated in 1907 by the president of the company, E. H. Gary, and called 'the Gary Dinners.' The dinners were congregations of producers and 'were nothing but trade meetings,' successors of the other means of associated action and control through such action. They were instituted first in 'stres of panic,' but their potency being demonstrated they were afterwards called to control prices 'in periods of industrial calm.' 'They were pools without penalties' and more efficient in stabilizing prices. But it was the further declaration that 'when joint action was either refused or withdrawn the corporation's prices were controlled by competition.\n The corporation, it was said, did not at any time abuse the power or ascendency it possessed. It resorted to none of the brutalities or tyrannies that the cases illustrate of \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 441]\n\u00a0\n other combinations. It did not secure freight rebates; it did not increase its profits by reducing the wages of its employes-whatever it did was not at the expense of labor; it did not increase its profits by lowering the quality of its products, nor create an artificial scarcity of them; it did not oppress or coerce its competitors-its competition, though vigorous, was fair; it did not undersell its competitors in some localities by reducing its prices there below these maintained elsewhere, or require its customers to enter into contracts limiting their purchases or restricting them in resale prices; it did not obtain customers by secret rebates or departures from its published prices; there was no evidence that it attempted to crush its competitors or drive them out of the market, nor did it take customers from its competitors by unfair means, and in its competition it seemed to make no difference between large and small competitors. Indeed it is said in many ways and illustrated that 'instead of relying upon its own power to fix and maintain prices, the corporation, at its very beginning sought and obtained the assistance of others.' It combined its power with that of its competitors. It did not have power in and of itself, and the control it exerted was only in and by association with its competitors. Its offense, therefore, such as it was, was not different from theirs and was distinguished from 'theirs only in the leadership it assumed in promulgating and perfecting the policy.' This leadership it gave up and it had ceased to offend against the law before this suit was brought. It was hence concluded that it should be distinguished from its organizers and that their intent and unsuccessful attempt should not be attributed to it, that it 'in and of itself is not now and has never been a monopoly or a combination in restraint of trade,' and a decree of dissolution should not be entered against it.\n This summary of the opinions, given necessarily in paraphrase, does not adequately represent their ability \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 442]\n\u00a0\n and strength, but it has value as indicating the contentions of the parties, and the ultimate propositions to which the contentions are addressed. The opinions indicate that the evidence admits of different deductions as to the genesis of the corporation and the purpose of its organizers, but only of a single deduction as to the power it attained and could exercise. Both opinions were clear and confident that the power of the corporation never did and does not now reach to monopoly, and their review of the evidence, and our independent examination of it, enables us to elect between their respective estimates of it, and we concur in the main with that of Judges Woolley and Hunt. And we add no comment except, it may be, that they understimated the influence of the tendency and movement to integration, the appreciation of the necessity or value of the continuity of manufacture from the ore to the finished product. And there was such a tendency, and though it cannot be asserted it had become a necessity, it had certainly become a facility of industrial progress. There was, therefore, much to urge it and give incentive to conduct that could accomplish it. From the nature and properties of the industry, the processes of production were something more than the state and setting of the human activities. They determined to an extent those activities, furnished their motives, and gave test of their quality not, of course, that th activities could get any immunity from size, or resources, or energies, whether exerted in integrated plants or diversified ones.\n The contentions of the case, therefore, must be judged by the requirements of the law, not by accidental or adventitious circumstances. But what are such circumstances? We have seen that it was the view of the District Court that size was such a circumstance and had no accusing or excusing influence. The contention of the government is to the contrary. Its assertion is that the size of the corporation being the result of a 'combination \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 443]\n\u00a0\n of powerful and able competitors' had become 'substantially dominant' in the industry and illegal. And that this was determined. The companies combined, is the further assertion, had already reached a high degree of efficiency, and in their independence were factors in production and competition, ceased to be such when brought under the regulating control of the corporation, which by uniting them offended the law, and that the organizers of the corporation 'had in mind the specific purposes of the restraint of trade and the enormous profits resulting from that restraint.'\n It is the contention of the corporation opposing those of the government and denying the illegal purposes charged against it, that the industry demanded qualities and an enterprise that lesser industries do not demand and must have a corresponding latitude and facility. Indeed it is insisted that the industry had practically, to quote the words of Judge Buffington, he quoting those of a witness, \"reached the limit, or nearly, at which economies from a metallurgical or mechanical standpoint could be made effective\" and \"that instead, as was then the practice, of having one mill make 10, or 20, or 50 products, the greatest economy would result from one mill making one product and making that product continuously.\" In other words that there was a necessity for integration, and rescue from the old conditions-from their improvidence and waste of effort-and that in redress of the conditions the corporation was formed; its purpose and effect being 'salvage not monopoly,' to quote the words of counsel. It was, is the insistence, the conception of ability, 'a vision of a great business which should embrace all lines of steel and all processes of manufacture, from the ore to the finished product, and which by reason of the economies thus to be effected, and the diversity of products it would be able to offer, could successfully compete in all the markets of the world.' \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 444]\n\u00a0\n IT IS URGED, FURTHER, THAT TO THE DISCERNmeNt of that great possibility was added a courage that dared attempt its accomplishment, and the conception and the courage made the formation of the corporation notable, but did not make it illegal.\n We state the contentions, we do not have to discuss them, or review the arguments advanced for their acceptance or repulsion. That is done in the opinions of the District Judges, and we may well despair to supplement the force of their representation of the conditions antecedent to the formation of the corporation, and in what respect and extent its formation changed them. Of course, in that representation and its details there is guidance to decision, but they must be rightly estimated to judge of what they persuade. Our present purpose is, not retrospect for itself, however instructive, but practical decision upon existing conditions that we may not by their disturbance, produce, or even risk, consequences of a concern that cannot now be computed. In other words, our consideration should be of, not what the corporation had power to do or did, but what it has now power to do and is doing, and what judgment shall be now pronounced- whether its dissolution, as the government prays, or the dismissal of the suit, as the corporation insists.\n The alternatives are perplexing, involve conflicting considerations, which, regarded in isolation, have diverse tendencies. We have seen, that the judges of the District Court unanio usly concurred in the view that the corporation did not achieve monopoly, and such is our deduction, and it is against monopoly that the statute is directed; not against an expectation of it, but against its realization, and it is certain that it was not realized. The opposing conditions were underestimated. The power attained was much greater than that possessed by any one competitor-it was not greater than that possessed by all of them. Monopoly, therefore, was not achieved, and \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 445]\n\u00a0\n competitors had to be persuaded by pools, associations, trade meetings, and through the social form of dinners, all of them, it may be, violations of the law, but transient in their purpose and effect. They were scattered through the years from 1901 (the year of the formation of the corporation) until 1911, but, after instances of success and failure, were abandoned nine months before this suit was brought. There is no evidence that the abandonment was in prophecy of or dread of suit; and the illegal practices have not been resumed, nor is there any evidence of an intention to resume them, and certainly no 'dangerous probability' of their resumption, the test for which Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 396\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 276, is cited. It is our conclusion, therefore, as it was that of the judges below, that the practices were abandoned from a conviction of their futility, from the operation of forces that were not understood, or were underestimated, and the case is not peculiar. And we may say in passing that the government cannot fear their resumption, for it did not avail itself of the offer of the District Court to retain jurisdiction of the cause in order that, if illegal acts should be attempted, they could be restrained.\n What, then, can now be urged against the corporation? Can comparisons in other regards be made with its competitors and by such comparisons guilty or innocent existence be assigned it? It is greater in size and productive power than any of its competitors, equal or nearly equal to them all, but its power over prices was not and is not commensurate with its power to produce.\n It is true there is some testimony tending to show that the corporation had such power, but there was also testimony and a course of action tending strongly to the contrary. The conflict was by the judges of the District Court unanimously resolved against the existence of that power, and in doing so they but gave effect to the greater weight of the evidence. It is certain that no such power \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 446]\n\u00a0\n was exerted. On the contrary, the only attempt at a fixation of prices was, as already said, through an appeal to and confederation with competitors, and the record shows besides that when competition occurred it was not in pretense, and the corporation, declined in productive powers-the competition growing either against or in consequence of the competition. If against the competition we have an instance of movement against what the government insists was an irresistible force; if in consequence of competition, we have an illustration of the adage that 'competition is the life of trade' and is not easily repressed. The power of monopoly in the corporation under either illustration is an untenable accusation.\n We may pause here for a moment to notice illustrations of the government of the purpose of the corporation, instancing its acquisition after its formation of control over the Shelby Steel Tube Company, the Union Steel Company, and, subsequently, the Tennessee Company. There is dispute over the reasons for these acquisitions which we shall not detail. There is, however, an important circumstance in connection with that of the Tennessee Company which is worthy to be noted. It was submitted to President Roosevelt and he gave it his approval. His approval, of course, did not make it legal; but it gives assurance of its legality, and we know from his earnestness in the public welfare he would have approved of nothing that had even a tendency to its detriment, and he testified he was not dc eived and that he believed that 'the Tennessee Coal & Iron People had a property which was almost worthless in their hands, nearly worthless to them, nearly worthless to the communities in which it was situated, and entirely worthless to any financial institution that had the securities the minute that any panic came, and that the only way to give value to it was to put it in the hands of people whose possession of it \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 447]\n\u00a0\n would be a guaranty that there was value to it.' Such being the emergency, it seems like an extreme accusation to say that the corporation which relieved it, and, perhaps, rescued the company and the communities dependent upon it from disaster, was urged by unworthy motives. Did illegality attach afterwards and how? And what was the corporation to do with the property? Let it decay in desuetude, or develop its capabilities and resources? In the development, of course, there would be profit to the corporation; but there would be profit as well to the world. For this reason President Roosevelt sanctioned the purchase, and it would seem a distempered view of purchase and result to regard them as violations of law.\n From this digression we return to the consideration of the conduct of the corporation to its competitors. Besides the circumstances which we have mentioned there are others of probative strength. The company's officers, and, as well, its competitors and customers, testified that its competition was genuine, direct, and vigorous and was reflected in prices and production. No practical witness was produced by the government in opposition. Its contention is based on the size and asserted dominance of the corporation-alleged power for evil, not the exertion of the power in evil. Or, as counsel put it, 'a combination may be illegal because of its purpose; it may be illegal because it acquires a dominating power, not as a result of normal growth and development, but as a result of a combination of competitors.' Such composition and its resulting power constitute, in the view of the government, the offense against the law, and yet it is admitted 'no competitor came forward and said he had to accept the Steel Corporation's prices.' But this absence of complaint counsel urge against the corporation. Competitors, it is said, followed the corporation's prices, because they made money by the imitation. Indeed, the imitation is urged as \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 448]\n\u00a0\n an evidence of the corporation's power. 'Universal imitation,' counsel assert, is 'an evidence of power.' In this concord of action, the contention is, there is the sinister dominance of the corporation-'its extensive control of the industry is such that the others [independent companies] follow.' Counsel, however, admit that there was 'occasionally' some competition, but reject the suggestion that it extended practically to a war between the corporation and the independents. Counsel say:\n'They [the corporation is made a plural] called a few-they called 200 witnesses out of some 40,000 customers-and they expect with that customer evidence to overcome the whole train of price movement shown since the corporation was formed.'\n\n And by 'movement of prices,' counsel explained, 'as shown by the published prices, ... they were the ones that the competitors were maintaining all during the interval.'\n It would seem that '200 witnesses' would be fairly representative. Besides the balance of the '40,000 customers' was open to the government to draw upon. Not having done so, is it not permissible to infer that none would testify to the existence of the influence that the government asserts? At any rate, not one was called, but instead the opinion of an editor of a trade journal is adduced, and that of an author and teacher of economics, whose philosophical deductions had, perhaps, fortification from experience as Deputy Commissioner of Corporations and as an employe in the Bureau of Corporations. His deduction was that, when prices are constant through a definite period, an artificial influence is indicate; if they vary during such a period, it is a consequence of competitive conditions. It has become an aphorism that there is danger of deception in generalities, and in a case of this importance we should have something surer for judgment than speculation, something more than a deduction, equivocal of itself, even though the \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 449]\n\u00a0\n facts it rests on or asserts were not contradicted. If the phenomena of production and rices were as easily resolved as the witness implied, much discussion and much literature have been wasted, and some of the problems that are now distracting the world would be given composing solution. Of course, competition affects prices; but it is only one among other influences, and does not, more than they, register itself in definite and legible effect.\n We magnify the testimony by its consideration. Against it competitors, dealers, and customers of the corporation testify in multitude that no adventitious interference was employed to either fix or maintain prices, and that they were constant or varied according to natural conditions. Can this testimony be minimized or dismissed by inferring that, as intimated, it is an evidence of power, not of weakness, and power exerted, not only to suppress competition, but to compel testimony, is the necessary inference, shading into perjury, to deny its exertion? The situation is indeed singular, and we may wonder at it, wonder that the despotism of the corporation, so baneful to the world in the representation of the government, did not produce protesting victims.\n But there are other paradoxes. The government does not hesitate to present contradictions, though only one can be true; such being, we were told in our schoolbooks, the 'principle of contradiction.' In one, competitors (the independents) are represented as oppressed by the superior power of the corporation; in the other, they are represented as ascending to opulence by imitating that power's prices, which they could not do, if at disadvantage from the other conditions of competition, and yet confederated action is not asserted. If it were, this suit would take on another cast. The competitors would cease to be the victims of the corporation, and would become its accomplices. And there is no other alternative. The suggestion \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 450]\n\u00a0\n that lurks in the government's contention that the acceptance of the corporation's prices is the submission of impotence to irresistible power is, in view of the testimony of the competitors, untenable. They, as we have seen, deny restraint in any measure or illegal influence of any kind. The government, therefore, is reduced to the assertion that the size of the corporation, the power it may have, not the exertion of the power, is an abhorrence to the law, or, as the government says, 'the combination embodied in the corporation unduly restrains competition by its nccessary effect [the italics are the emphasis of the government], and therefore is unlawful regardless less of purpose.' 'A wrongful purpose,' the government adds, is 'matter of aggravation.' The illegality is statical; purpose or movement of any kind only its emphasis. To assent to that, to what extremes should we be led? Competition consists of business activities and ability-they make its life; but there may be fatalities in it. Are the activities to be encouraged when militant, and suppressed or regulated when triumphant, because of the dominance attained? To such paternalism the government's contention, which regards power, rather than its use, the determining consideration, seems to conduct. Certainly conducts we may say, for it is the inevitable logic of the government's contention that competition must not only be free, but that it must not be pressed to the ascendency of a competitor, for in ascendency there is the menace of monopoly.\n We have pointed out that there are several of the government's contentions which are difficult to represent or measure, and the one we are now considering-that is, the power is 'unlawful regardless of purpoe '- is another of them. It seems to us that it has for its ultimate principle and justification that strength in any producer or seller is a menace to the public interest and illegal, because there is potency in it for mischief. The regression is extreme, but \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 451]\n\u00a0\n short of it the government cannot stop. The fallacy it conveys is manifest.\n The corporation was formed in 1901, no act of aggression upon its competitors is charged against it, it confederated with them at times in offense against the law, but abandoned that before this suit was brought, and since 1911 no act in violation of law can be established against it, except its existence be such an act. This is urged, as we have seen, and that the interest of the public is involved, and that such interest is paramount to corporation or competitors. Granted-though it is difficult to see how there can be restraint of trade when there is no restraint of competitors in the trade, nor complaints by customers-how can it be worked out of the situation, and through what proposition of law? Of course it calls for nothing other than a right application of the law, and, to repeat what we have said above, shall we declare the law to be that size is an offense, even though it minds its own business, because what it does is imitated? The corporation is undoubtedly of impressive size, and it takes an effort of resolution not to be affected by it or to exaggerate its influence. But we must adhere to the law, and the law does not make mere size an offense, or the existence of unexerted power an offense. It, we repeat, requires overt acts, and trusts to its prohibition of them and its power to repress or punish them. It does not compel competition, nor require all that is possible.\n Admitting, however, that there is pertinent strength in the propositions of the government, and in connection with them, we recall the distinction we made in the Standard Oil Case, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 77\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734, between acts done in violation of the statute and a condition brought about which 'in and of itself, is not only a continued attempt to monopolize, but also a monopolization.' In such case, we declared, 'the duty to enforce the statute' required 'the application of broader and more controlling' remedies \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 452]\n\u00a0\n than in the other. And the remedies applied conformed to the declaration; there was prohibition of future acts and there was dissolution of 'the combination found to exist in violation of the statute' in order to 'neutralize the extension and continually operating force which the possession of the power unlawfully obtained' had 'brough' and would 'continue to bring about.'\n Are the case and its precepts applicable here? The Steel Corporation by its formation united under one control competing companies, and thus, it is urged, a condition was brought about in violation of the statute, and therefore illegal, and became a 'continually operating force' with the 'possession of power unlawfully obtained.'\n But there are countervailing considerations. We have seen whatever there was of wrong intent could not be executed; whatever there was of evil effect was discontinued before this suit was brought, and this, we think, determines the decree. We say this in full realization of the requirements of the law. It is clear in its denunciation of monopolies, and equally clear in its direction that the courts of the nation shall prevent and restrain them (its language is 'to prevent and restrain violations of' the act); but the command is necessarily submissive to the conditions which may exist and the usual powers of a court of equity to adapt its remedies to those conditions. In other words, it is not expected to enforce abstractions, and do injury thereby, it may be, to the purpose of the law. It is this flexibility of discretion-indeed, essential function-that makes its value in our jurisprudence-value in this case as in others. We do not mean to say that the law is not its own measure, and that i can be disregarded, but only that the appropriate relief in each instance is remitted to a court of equity to determine, not, and let us be explicit in this, to advance a policy contrary to that of the law, but in submission to the law and its policy, and in execution of both. And it is certainly a \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 453]\n\u00a0\n matter for consideration that there was no legal attack on the corporation until 1911, 10 years after its formation and the commencement of its career. We do not, however, speak of the delay simply as to its time, or say that there is estoppel in it because of its time, but on account of what was done during that time-the many millions of dollars spent, the development made, and the enterprises undertaken; the investments by the public that have been invited and are not to be ignored. And what of the foreign trade that has been developed and exists? The government, with some inconsistency, it seems to us, would remove this from the decree of dissolution. Indeed, it is pointed out that under congressional legislation in the Webb Act (Comp. St. 1918, Comp. St. Ann. Supp. 1919,  8836 1\/4 c-8836 1\/4 e) the foreign trade of the corporation is reserved to it. And further, it is said, that the corporation has constructed a company called the Products Company, which can be 'very easily preserved as a medium through which the steel business might reach the balance of the world,' and that in the decree of 'dissolution that could be provided.' This is supplemented by the suggestion that not only the Steel Corporation, 'but other steel makers of the country, could function through an instrumentality created under the Webb Act.'\n The propositions and suggestions do not commend themselves. We do not see how the Steel Corporation can be such a beneficial instrumentality in the trade of the world, and its beneficence be preserved, and yet be such an evil instrumentality in the trade of the United States that it must be destroyed. And by whom and how shall all the adjustments of preservation or destruction be made? How can the corporation be sustained, and its power of control over its subsidiary companies be retained and exercised in the foreign trade, and given up in the domestic trade? The government presents no solution of the problem. Counsel realize the difficulty, and seem to think that its solution or its evasion is in the suggestion \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 454]\n\u00a0\n that the Steel Corporation and 'other steel makers could function through an instrumentality created under the Webb Act.' But we are confronted with the necessity of immediate judicial action under existing laws, not action under conceptions which may never be capable of legal execution. We must now decide, and we see no guide to decision in the propositions of the government.\n The government, however, tentatively presents a proposition which has some tangibility. It submits that certain of the subsidiary companies are so mechanically equipped and so officially directed as to be released and remitted to independent action and individual interests and the competition to which such interests prompt, without any disturbance to business. The companies are enumerated. They are the Carnegie Steel Company (a combination of the old Carnegie Company, the National Steel Company, and the American Steel Company), the Federal Steel Company, the Tennessee Company, and the Union Steel Company (a combination of the Union Steel Company of Donora, Pa., Sharon Steel Company of Sharon, Pa., and Sharon Tin Plate Company). They are fully integrated, it is said-possess their own supplies, facilities of transportation, and distribution. They are subject to the Steel Corporation, is in effect the declaration, in nothing but its control of their prices. We may say parenthetically that they are defendants in the suit and charged as offenders, and we have the strange circumstance of violators of the law being urged to be used as expedients of the law.\n But let us see what guide to a procedure of dissolution of the corporation and the dispersion asw ell of its subsidiary companies, for they are asserted to be illegal combinations, is prayed. And the fact must not be overlooked or underestimated. The prayer of the government calls for, not only a disruption of present conditions, but the restoration of the conditions of 20 years ago, if \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 455]\n\u00a0\n not literally, substantially. Is there guidance to this in the Standard Oil Case and the Tobacco Case, 31 Sup. Ct. 632? As an element in determining the answer we shall have to compare the cases with that at bar, but this can only be done in a general way. And the law necessarily must be kept in mind. No other comment of it is necessary. It has received so much exposition that it and all it prescribes and proscribes should be considered as a consciously directing presence.\n The Standard Oil Company had its origin in 1882 and through successive forms of combinations and agencies it progressed in illegal power to the day of the decree, even attempting to circumvent by one of its forms the decision of a court against it. And its methods in using its power was of the kind that Judge Woolley described as 'brutal,' and of which practices, he said, the Steel Corporation was absolutely guiltless. We have enumerated them, and this reference to them is enough. And of the practices this court said no disinterested mind could doubt that the purpose was 'to drive others from the field, and to exclude them from their right to trade, and thus accomplish the mastery which was the end in view.' It was further said that what was done and the final culmination 'in the plan of the New Jersey corporation' made 'manifest the continued existence of the intent ... and inpelled the expansion of the New Jersey corporation.' It was to this corporation, which represented the power and purpose of all that preceded, that the suit was addressed and the decree of the court was to apply. What we have quoted contrasts that case with this. The contrast is further emphasized by pointing out how in the case of the New Jersey corporation the original wrong was reflected in and manifested by the acts which followed the organization, as described by the court. It said:\n'The exercise of the power which resulted from that organization fortifies the foregoing conclusions (as to monopoly, etc.), since the \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 456]\n\u00a0\n development which came, the acquisition here and there which ensued of every efficient means by which competition could have been asserted, the slow but resistless methods which followed by which means of transportation were absorbed AND BROUGHT UNDER CONTROL, THE SYSTEM OF marketing which was adopted, by which the country was divided into districts and the trade in each district in oil was turned over to the designated corporation within the combination and all others were excluded, all lead the mind up to a conviction of a purpose and intent which we think is so certain as practically to cause the subject not to be within the domain of reasonable contention.'\n\n The Tobacco Company Case (31 Sup. Ct. 632) has the same bad distinctions as the Standard Oil Case. The illegality in which it was formed [there were two American Tobacco Companies, but we use the name as designating the new company as representing the combinations of the suit] continued-indeed, progressed in intensity and defiance to the moment of decree. And it is the intimation of the opinion, if not its direct assertion, that the formation of the company (the word 'combination' is used) was preceded by the intimidation of a trade war 'inspired by one or more of the minds which brought about and became parties to that combination.' In other words, the purpose of the combination was signaled to competitors, and the choice presented to them was submission or ruin, to become parties to the illegal enterprise or be driven 'out of the business.' This was the purpose, and the achievement, and the processes by which achieved, this court enumerated to be the formation of new companies, taking stock in others to 'obsu re the result actually attained, but always to monopolize and retain power in the hands of the few and mastery of the trade; putting control in the hands of seemingly independent corporations as barriers to the entry of others into the trade; the expenditure of millions upon millions in buying out plants, not to utilize them, but to close them; by constantly \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 457]\n\u00a0\n recurring stipulations by which numbers of persons, whether manufacturers, stockholders, or employes, were required to bind themselves, generally for long periods, not to compete in the future. In the Tobacco Case (31 Sup. Ct. 632), therefore as in the Standard Oil Case, the court had to deal with a persistent and systematic lawbreaker masquerading under legal forms, and which not only had to be stripped of its disguises but arrested in its illegality. A decree of dissolution was the manifest instrumentality and inevitable. We think it would be a work of sheer supererogation to point out that a decree in that case or in the Standard Oil Case furnishes no example for a decree in this.\n In conclusion, we are unable to see that the public interest will be served by yielding to the contention of the government respecting the dissolution of the company or the separation from it of some of its subsidiaries; and we do see in a contrary conclusion a risk of injury to the public interest, including a material disturbance of, and, it may be serious detriment to, the foreign trade. And in submission to the policy of the law and its fortifying prohibitions the public interest is of paramount regard.\n We think, therefore, that the decree of the District Court should be affirmed.\n So ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY, dissenting.\n This record seems to me to leave no fair room for a doubt that the defendants, the United States Steel Corporation and the several subsidiary corporations which make up that organization, were formed in violation of the Sherman Act. I am unable to accept the conclusion \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 458]\n\u00a0\n which directs a dismissal of the bill instead of following the well- settled practice, sanctioned by previous decisions of this court, requiring the dissolution of combinations made in direct violation of the law.\n It appears to be thoroughly established that the formation of the corporations, here under consideration, constituted combinations between competitors, in violation of law, and intended to remove competition and to directly restrain trade. I agree with the conclusions of Judges Woolley and Hunt, expressed in the court below (223 Fed. 161 et seq.), that the combinations were not submissions to business conditions but were designed to control them for illegal purposes, regardless of other consequences, and 'were made upon a scale that was huge and in a manner that was wild,' and 'properties were assembled and combined with less regard to their importance as integral parts of an integrated whole than to the advantages expected from the elimination of the competition which theretofore existed between them.' Those judges found that the constituent companies of the United States Stell Corporation, nine in number, were themselves combinations of steel manufacturers, and the effect of the organization of these combinations was to give a control over the industry at least equal to that theretofore possessed by the constituent companies and their subsidiaries; that the Steel Corporation was a combination of combinations by which directly or indirectly 180 independent concerns were brought under one control, and in the language of Judge Woolley (167):\n'Without referring to the great mass of figures which bears upon this aspect of the case, it is clear to me that combinations were created by acquiring competing producing concerns at figures not based upon their physical or ... business values, as independent and separate producers, but upon their values in combination; that is, upon their values as manufacturn g plants and business \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 459]\n\u00a0\n concerns with competition eliminated. In many instances, capital stock was issued for amounts vastly in excess of the values of the properties purchased, thereby capitalizing the anticipated fruits of combination. The control acquired over the branches of the industry to which the combinations particularly related measured by the amount of production, extended in some instances from 80 per cent. to 95 per cent. of the entire output of the country, resulting in the immediate increase of prices, in some cases double and in others treble what they were before, yielding large dividends upon greatly inflated capital.\n\n'The immediate, as well as the normal effect of such combinations, was in all instances a complete elimination of competition between the concerns absorbed, and a corresponding restraint of trade.'\n\n The enormous overcapitalization of companies and the appropriation of $ 100,000,000 in stock to promotion expenses were represented in the stock issues of the new organizations thus formed, and were the basis upon which large dividends have been declared from the profits of the business. This record shows that the power obtained by the corporation brought under its control large competing companies which were of themselves illegal combinations, and succeeded to their power; that some of the organizers of the Steel Corporation were parties to the preceding combinations, participated in their illegality, and by uniting them under a common direction intended to augment and perpetuate their power. It is the irresistible conclusion from these premises that great profits to be derived from unified control were the object of these organizations.\n The contention must be rejected that the combination was an inevitable evolution of industrial tendencies compelling union of endeavor. Nothing could add to the vivid accuracy with which Judge Woolley, speaking for himself \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 460]\n\u00a0\n and Judge Hunt, has stated the illegality of the organization, and its purpose to combine in one great corporation the previous combinations by a direct violation of the purposes and terms of the Sherman Act.\n For many years, as the record discloses, this unlawful organization exerted its power to control and maintain prices by pools, associations, trade meetings, and as the result of discussion and agreements at the so- called 'Gary Dinners,' where the assembled trade opponents secured co- operation and joint action through the machinery of special committees of competing concerns, and by prudent prevision took into account the possibility of defection, and the means of controlling and perpetuating that industrial harmony which arose from the control and maintenance of prices.\n It inevitably follows that the corporation violated the law in its formation and by its immediate practices. The power, thus obtained from the combination of resources almost unlimited in the aggregation of competing organizations, had within its control the domination of the trade, and the ability to fix prices and restrain the free flow of commerce upon a scale heretofore unapproached in the history of corporate organization in this country.\n These facts established, as it seems to me they are by the record, it follows that if the Sherman Act is to be given efficacy, there must be a decree undoing so far as is possible that which has been achieved in open, notorious, and continued violation of its provisions.\n I agree that the act offers no objection to the mere size of a corporation, nor to the continued exertion of its lawful power, when that size and power have been obtained by lawful means and developed by natural growth, although its resources, capital and strength may give to such corporation a dominating place in the business and industry with which it is concerned. It is entitled to maintain its size and the power that legitimately goes with it, provided \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 461]\n\u00a0\n no law has been transgressed in obtaining it. But I understand the reiterated decisions of this court construing the Sherman Act to hold that this power may not legally be derived from conspiracies, combinations, or contracts in restraint of trade. To permit this would be to practically annul the Sherman Law by judicial decree. This principle has been so often declared by the decisions that it is only necessary to refer to some of them. It is the scope of such combinations, and their power to suppress and stifle competition and create or tend to create monopolies, which, as we have declared so often as to make its reiteration monotonous, it was the purpose of the Sherman Act to condemn, including all combinations and conspiracies to restrain the free and natural flow of trade in the channels of interstate commerce. Pearsall v. Great Northern Ry. Co., \n161 \nU.S. 646, 676\n, 677 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 705; Trans-Missouri Freight Ass'n Case, \n166 \nU.S. 290, 324\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 540; Northern Securities Case, \n193 U.S. 197\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 436; Addyston Pipe Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 238\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 96; Harriman v.

While it was not the purpose of the act to condemn normal and usual contracts to lawfully expand business and further legitimate trade, it did intend to effectively reach and control all conspiracies and combinations or contracts of whatever form which unduly restrain competition and unduly obstruct the natural course of trade, or which from their nature, or effect, have proved effectual to restrain interstate commerce. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 U.S. 1\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; United States v. American Tobacco Co., \n221 U.S. 106\n, 31 Sup.

Cas. 1915A, 369; Eastern States Lumber Association v. United States, \n234 U.S. 600\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 951, L. R. A. 1915A, 788.\n This statute has been in force for nearly 30 years. It has been frequently before this court for consideration, and the nature and character of the relief to be granted \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 462]\n\u00a0\n against combinations found guilty of violations of it have been the subject of much consideration. Its interpretation has become a part of the law itself, and if changes are to be made now in its construction or operation, it seems to me that the exertion of such authority rests with Congress and not with the courts.\n The fourth section is intended to give to courts of equity of the United States the power to effectively control and restrain violations of the act. In none of the cases which have been before the courts was the character of the relief to be granted, where organizations were found to be within the condemnation of the act, more thoroughly considered than in the Standard Oil and Tobacco Company Cases reported in 221 U. S. In the former case, considering the measure of relief to be granted in the case of a combination, certainly not more obnoxious to the Sherman Act than the court now finds the one under consideration to be, this court declared that it must be twofold in character (\n221 U.S. 78\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 523, 34 L. R. A. [N. S.] 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734):\n'(1) To forbid the doing in the future of acts like those which we have found to have been done in the past which would be violative of the statute. (2) The exertion of such measure of relief as will effectually dissolve the combination found to exist in violation of the statute, and thus neutralize the extension and continually operating force which the possession of the power unlawfully obtained has brought and will continue to bring about.'\n\n In the American Tobacco Company Case the nature of the relief to be granted was again given consideration, and it was there concludd that the only effectual remedy was to dissolve the combination and the companies comprising it, and for that purpose the cause was remanded to the District Court to hear the parties and determine a method of dissolution and of recreating from the elements composing it 'a new condition which should be in honest harmony with and not repugnant to the law.' In that \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 463]\n\u00a0\n case the corporations dissolved had long been in existence, and the offending companies were organized years before the suit was brought and before the decree of dissolution was finally made. Such facts were considered no valid objection to the dissolution of these powerful organizations as the only effective means of enforcing the purposes of the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. These cases have been frequently followed in this court, and in the lower federal courts, in determining the nature of the relief to be granted, and I see no occasion to depart from them now.\n As I understand the conclusions of the court, affirming the decree directing dismissal of the bill, they amount to this: That these combinations, both the holding company and the subsidiaries which comprise it, although organized in plain violation and bold defiance of the provisions of the act, nevertheless are immune from a decree effectually ending the combinations and putting it out of their power to attain the unlawful purposes sought, because of some reasons of public policy requiring such conclusion. I know of no public policy which sanctions a violation of the law, nor of any inconvenience to trade, domestic or foreign, which should have the effect of placing combinations, which have been able to thus organize one of the greatest industries of the country in defiance of law, in an impregnable position above the control of the law forbidding such combinations. Such a conclusion does violence to the policy which the law was intended to enforce, runs counter to the decisions of the court, and necessarily results in a practical nullification of the act itself.\n There is no mistaking the terms of the act as they have hitherto been interpreted by this court. It was not intended to merely suppress unfair practices, but, as its history and terms amply show, it was intended to make it criminal to form combinations or engage in conspiracies or contracts in restraint of interstate trade. The remedy by injunction, at the instance of the Attorney General, was \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 464]\n\u00a0\n given for the purpose of enabling the courts, as the statute states, to prohibit such conspiracies, combinations and contracts, and this court interpreting its provisions has held that the proper enforcement of the act requires decrees to end combinations by dissolving them and restoring as far as possible the competitive conditions which the combinations have destroyed. I am unable to see force in the suggestion that public policy, or the assumed disastrous effect upon foreign trade of dissolving the unlawful combination, is sufficient to entitle it to immunity from the enforcement of the statute.\n Nor can I yield assent to the proposition that this combination has not acquired a dominant position in the trade which enables it to control prices and production when it sees fit to exert its power. Its total assets on December 31, 1913, were in excess of $1,800,000; its outstanding capital stock was $868,583,600; its surplus $151,798,428. Its cash on hand ordinarily was $75,000,000; this sum alone exceeded the total capitalization of any of its competitors, and with a single exception, the total capitalization and surplus of any one of them. That such an organization thus fortified and equipped could if it saw fit dominate the trade and control competition would seem to be a business proposition too plain to require extended argument to support it. Its resources, strength and comprehensive ownership of the means of production enable it to adopt measures to do again as it has done in the past, that is, to effectually dominate and control the steel business of the country. From the eal iest decisions of this court it has been declared that it was the effective power of such organizations to control and restrain competition and the freedom of trade that Congress intended to limit and control. That the exercise of the power may be withheld, or exerted with forbearing benevolence, does not place such combinations beyond the authority of the statute which was intended to prohibit their formation, \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 465]\n\u00a0\n and when formed to deprive them of the power unlawfully attained.\n It is said that a complete monopolization of the steel business was never attained by the offending combinations. To insist upon such result would be beyond the requirements of the statute and in most cases practicably impossible. As we said in dealing with the Packers' combination in Swift & Co. v. United States, \n196 U.S. 396\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 279:\n'Where acts are not sufficient in themselves to produce a result which the law seeks to prevent-for instance, the monopoly-but require further acts in addition to the mere forces of nature to bring that result to pass, an intent to bring it to pass is necessary in order to produce a dangerous probability that it will happen. Commonwealth v. Peachie, 177 Mass. 267, 272 [59 N. E. 55]. But when that intent and the consequent dangerous probability exist, this statute [Sherman Act] like many others and like the common law in some cases, directs itself against that dangerous probability as well as against the completed result.'\n\n It is affirmed that to grant the government's request for a remand to the District Court for a decree of dissolution would not result in a change in the conditions of the steel trade. Such is not the theory of the Sherman Act. The act was framed in the belief that attempted or accomplished monopolization, or combinations which suppress free competition were hurtful to the public interest, and that a restoration of competitive conditions would benefit the public. We have here a combination in control of one-half of the steel business of the country. If the plan were followed, as in the American Tobacco Case, of remanding the case to the District Court, a decree might be framed restoring competitive conditions as far as practicable. See United States v. American Tobacco Co. (C. C.) 191 Fed. 371. In that case the subject of reconstruction so as to restore such conditions was elaborated and carefully \n\n[251 U.S. 417, 466]\n\u00a0\n considered. In my judgment the principles there laid down, if followed now, would make a very material difference in the steel industry. Instead of one dominating corporation, with scattered competitors, there would be competitive conditions throughout the whole trade which would carry into effect the policy of the law.\n It seems to me that if this act is to be given effect, the bill, under the findings of fact made by the court, should not be dismissed, and the cause should be remanded to the District Court, where a plan of effective and final dissolution of the corporations should be enforced by a decree framed for that purpose.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY and Mr. Justice CLARKE concur in this dissent. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As bearing upon the power obtained and what the corporation did we give other citations from Judge Woolley's opinion as follows:\n'The ore reserves acquired by the corporation at and subsequent to its organization, the relation which such reserves bear to ore bodies then existing and subsequently discovered, and their bearing upon the question of monopoly of raw materials, are matters which have been discussed in the preceding opinion, and with the reasoning as well as with the conclusion that the corporation has not a monopoly of the raw materials of the steel industry, I am in entire accord.'\n\n'Further inquiring whether the corporation inherently possesses monopolistic power attention is next given to its proportion of the manufacture and sale of finished iron and steel products of the industry. Upon this subject there is a great volume of testimony, a detailed consideration of which in an opinion would be quite inexcusable. As a last analysis of this testimony, it is sufficient to say it shows that, large as was the corporation, and substantial as was its proportion of the business of the industry, the corporation was not able in the first ten years of its history to maintain its position in the increase of trade. During that period, its proportion of the domestic business decreased from 50.1 per cent. to 40.9 per cent. and its increase of business during that period was but 40.6 per cent. of its original volume. Its increase of business, measured by percentage, was exceeded by eight of its competitors, whose increase of business, likewise measured by percentage, ranged from 63 to 3779. This disparity in the increase of production indicates that the power of the corporation is not commensurate with its size, and that the size and the consequent power of the corporation are not sufficient to retard prosperous growth of efficient competitors.'\n\n'From the vast amount of testimony, it is conclusively shown that the Steel Corporation did not attempt to exert a power, if such it possessed, to oppress and destroy its competitors, and it is likewise disclosed by the history of the industry subsequent to the organization of the corporation that if it had made such an attempt it would have failed. It is also shown by the testimony that, acting independently and relying alone upon its power and wealth, great as they were, the corporation has never been able to dominate the steel industry by controlling the supply of raw materials, restraining production of finished products, or enhancing and maintaining the prices of either.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","175":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.

St.  8820, 8821]); and also for the alleged reason that the defendants, Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company and Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, are violating the commodities clause of the act of Congress of June 29, 1906 ( 34 Stat. 585 [Comp. Stat.  8563(6)]) by transporting over their lines of railroad, in interstate commerce, coal mined or purchased by coal companies with which they are associated by stock ownership.\n It will contribute to brevity and clearness to designate the defendant corporations as follows: Reading Company, as Holding Company; Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company as Reading Railway Company; Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, as Reading Coal Comapny; Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, as Central Railroad Company; Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company as Wilkes-Barre Company; Lehigh Coal & Navigation Cm pany as Navigation Company.\n Practically all of the anthracite coal in this country is found in Northeastern Pennsylvania, in three limited and substantially parallel deposits, located in valleys which are separated by mountainous country. For trade purposes these coal areas are designated: The most northerly, as the Wyoming field, estimated to contain about 176 square miles of coal; the next southerly, as the Middle or Lehigh field, estimated to contain about 45 square miles, and the most southerly, as the Schuylkill field, estimated to contain about 263 square miles of coal.\n The annual production of the mines in these three fields in 1896 was about 43,640,000 tons and in 1913 it slightly exceeded 71,000,000 tons. The chief marketing centers for this great tonnage of coal are New York, distant by rail from the fields about 140 miles, and Philadelphia, distant \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 42]\n\u00a0\n about 90 miles. From these cities it is widely distributed by rail and water throughout New York and New England, and to some extent, through the South.\n Such a large tonnage was naturally attractive to railroad carriers, with the result that the Wyoming field has six outlets by rail to New York harbor, viz.: The Central Railroad of New Jersey and five others, known as initial anthracite carriers. The Lehigh field has three such rail outlets, but the largest, the Schuylkill field, has only two direct rail connections with Philadelphia and New York, viz.: The Reading and the Pennsylvania Railroads. Outlets by canal to Philadelphia and tidewater, at one time important, may here be neglected.\n This description of the subject-matter and of its relation to the interstate transportation system of the country will suffice for the purposes of this opinion. It may be found in much greater detail in the cases cited in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n The essential claims of the government in the case have become narrowed to these, viz.:\n First. That the ownership by the Holding Company of controlling interests in the shares of the capital stocks of the Reading Railway Company, of the Reading Coal Company and of the Central Railroad Company, constitutes a combination in restraint of interstate trade and commerce and an attempt to monopolize and a monopolization of a part of the same in violation of the Anti-Trust Act of July 2, 1890.\n Second. That the Holding Company in itself constitutes a like violation of the act.\n Third. That certain covenants and agreements between the Central Railroad Company and the Navigation Company \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 43]\n\u00a0\n contained in a lease, by the latter to the former, of the Lehigh & Susquehanna Railroad, constitute a like violation of the act.\n Fourth. That the transportation in interstate commerce by the Reading Railway Company and by the Central Railroad Company, of coal mined or purchased by the coal companies affiliated with each of them, constitutes a violation of the commodities clause of the Act to Regulate Commerce.\n Pursuant to the provisions of the act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 854 [ Comp. St.  8824]), the case was heard by three Circuit Judges of the Third circuit, who while holding against the contention of the government on many of the prayers for relief in the bill, some generally and some without prejudice, also held that the Reading Coal Compamy and the Wilkes- Barre Coal Company were naturally competitive producers and sellers of anthracite coal, and that their union through the Holding Company and the Central Company constituted a combination in restraint of trade within the Anti-Trust Act, and for this reason the Cenr al Company was ordered to dispose of all the stock, bonds, and other securities of the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company owned by it, and was enjoined from requiring the Coal Company to ship its coal over the lines of the Central Company.\n The court also held that clauses in mining leases by the Reading Coal Company and by the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, and their subsidiaries, requiring the lessees to ship all coal produced, over roads, named or to be designated, were unlawful and void.\n The case has been appealed by both parties, and is before us for review on all of the issues as we have thus stated them.\n Reference to the history of the properties now controlled by the Holding Company will be of value for the assistance it will be in determining the intent and purpose \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 44]\n\u00a0\n with which the combinations here assailed were formed. Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n221 \nU.S. 1, 46\n, 76 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734.\n The Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company was chartered by special act of the Pennsylvania General Assembly in 1833 (P. L. 144), and it conducted the business of a railroad carrier prosperously for about 30 years, when, as its annual reports show, it embarked upon the policy of attempting to control the anthracite tonnage of the Schuylkill field by acquiring extensive ownership of coal lands. Thus, the report of the company for 1870 contains the following:\n'Up to this time about 70,000 acres of the best anthracite coal lands in Pennsylvania have been acquired and will be held by an auxiliary company known as the Philadelphia & Reading Coal and Iron Company of which the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company is the only stockholder. The result of this action has been to sencure-and attach to the company's railroad-a body of coal land capable of supplying all the coal tonnage that can possibly be transported over the road for centuries.'\n\n And this is from the report for 1880:\n'The transportation of coal has always been a source of great profit to the railroad company and the only doubt in the past as to the permanency of the earning power of the company as a transporter was due to the fear that rival companies would tap the Schuylkill region and divert the coal tonnage to their own lines. This danger was happily averted by the purchase of the coal lands.'\n\n And this from the report of 1881:\n'The coal estates of the Philadelphia & Reading Company ... consist of 91,149 acres (142 square miles) of coal lands, which is sixty per cent of all the anthracite lands in the Schuylkill district, and thirty per cent of all in Pennsylvania.'\n\n This area of coal lands had increased by 1891 to 102,573 acres, of which the report said: \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 45]\n\u00a0\n 'The coal lands comprise in extent about thirty-three per cent of the entire anthracite coal fields of the state, and taking into account the aggregate thickness of the veins on the company's lands, and the greater proportionate depletion of the estates in the other regions which has been going on for many years, it must be conceded that we have at least fifty per cent of the entire deposit remaining unmined.'\n As if in further pursuit of this now settled purpose, in the following year, 1892, the Reading Railroad Company leased the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the Central Railroad of New Jersey for 999 years. These were both anthracite carriers, competing with the Reading and each had an important coal mining subsidiary company. But the lease by the Central Railroad Company was assailed in the New Jersey courts and all operations under it were enjoined, with the result that both leases were abandoned.\n It is obvious that these reports show an avowed and consistently pursued purpose (not then prohibited by statute) to secure by purchase a dominating control over the coal of the Schuylkill field and over the transportation of it to market.\n In the large financial operations incident to the expansion policy thus described, bonds wer issued, secured by a mortgage on all of the property of the Reading Railroad Company and of the Reading Coal Company. In 1893 there was default in the payment of interest on these bonds and receivers were appointed who operated both properties until 1896 when they were sold to representatives of the creditors and stockholders of the two companies, and under a scheme of reorganization, the validity of which is assailed in this suit, both properties were transferred to three corporations in the manner now to be described:\n First. To the Reading Railway Company, a corporation newly organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, were allotted about 1,000 miles of the railroad (but none of \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 46]\n\u00a0\n the equipment) which had been owned or leased by the former Reading Railroad Company. The capital stock of this company was fixed at $20,000, 000 and it issued $20,000,000 of bonds, all of which were given to the Holding Company. The property thus transferred was valued, in the representations made at the time to the New York Stock Exchange, at $90, 000,000. In 1896 this railroad carried in excess of 9,000,000 tons of anthracite-more than one-fifth of the then total production of the country. But by the plan of reorganization adopted it was disabled from performing its functions as a carrier, except with the aid of the Holding Company, for all of the equipment, engines, cars and ships, owned by the former Railroad Company, and its tidewater terminals at Philadelphia and on New York Harbor, were allotted to the Holding Company.\n Second. By the decree of sale the Reading Coal & Iron Company was released from its former obligations and to it thus freed the principal part of the property (coal and other), owned by it before the sale, was allotted and retransferred upon condition that it would deliver all of its capital stock to the Holding Company, would become co-obligor with that company on bonds to be issued, and would join with it in executing a mortgage for $135,000,000 on all of its property to secure such bonds. This company thus came into possession of 102,573 acres of anthracite lands, owned and leased-almost two-thirds of the entire acreage of the Schuylkill coal field-stocks and bonds in other coal companies, coal in storage and other property, all of the estimated value of $95,000,000.\n Third. To serve the purposes of the intended Holding Company, a charter granted in 1871 by special act of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania, but unused for 20 years, was utilized. This charter was of the class denominated 'omnibus' by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 47]\n\u00a0\n and in terms it authorized the company to engage in, or control, almost any business other than that of a bank of issue-this broad charter was the occasion for making use of the company in this enterprise. The corporate name was changed to 'Reading Company,' its capital stock was increased from $100,000 to $140,000,000, and the purchasers at the receivers' sale allotted and transferred to it railroad equipment, real estate, colliers and barges, formerly owned by the Reading Railroad Company, together with stocks which gave it control of more than 30 short line railroads, aggregating 275 miles of track, and other property of large value, in addition to all of the bonds and stock of the new Reading Railway Company and all of the stock of the Reading Coal Company.\n The result of this intercorporate transfer of the property, owned before the reorganization by the Reading Railroad Company and the Reading Coal & Iron Company, was that the Holding Company without any outlay- solely because the creditors and stockholders of the former Reading Railroad Company and of the Reading Coal Company desired to establish the proposed scheme for control of the properties formerly owned by the two companies-became the owner of the title to railway equipment, real estate, colliers and barges of an estimated value of $34,400,000; plus all of the capital stock and bonds of the new Railway Company, $40,000,000; plus al of the capital stock of the Coal Company, $8,000,000, and a contract by that company to mortgage, for the use of the Holding Company, its entire property; plus other stocks, bonds and mortgages owned by the former Railroad Company of the estimated value of over $38,000,000-making a total value, as represented at the time to the New York Stock Exchange, of $193, 613,000.\n Thus, this scheme of reorganization, adopted and executed \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 48]\n\u00a0\n 6 years after the enactment of the Anti-Trust Act, combined and delivered into the complete control of the board of directors of the Holding Company all of the property of much the largest single coal company operating in the Schuylkill anthracite field, and almost 1,000 miles of railway over which its coal must find its access to interstate markets. This board of directors, obviously, thus acquired power: To increase or decrease the output of coal from very extensive mines, the supply of it in the market, and the cost of it to the consumer; to increase or lower the charge for transporting such coal to market; and to regulate car supply and other shipping conveniences, and thereby to help or hinder the operations of independent miners and shippers of coal. This constituted a combination to unduly restrain interstate commerce within the meaning of the act. United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n226 U.S. 61\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 53.\n Obviously, also, it made the Coal Company and the Railway Company mere agents or instrumentalities of the Holding Company-the mining and transportation departments of its business-for producing, purchasing, and selling coal and for transporting it to market. The Reading Railway Company and the Reading Coal Company each had thereafter but one stockholder-the Holding Company-and their earnings were to be distributed not in proportion to the shares of their capital stocks, aggregating $28, 000,000, but were to go to the creditors and shareholders of the Holding Company, with its mortgage debt of $135,000,000 and its capital stock of $ 140,000,000. The Holding Company thus served to pool the property, the activities and the profits of the three companies. Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 327\n, 362 S., 24 Sup. Ct. 436.\n It will be profitable to consider next what use was made of the great power thus gathered into the one Holding Company. \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 49]\n\u00a0\n In 1898 this Holding Company entered into a combination with five other anthracite carrying railroad companies to prevent the then contemplated construction of an additional line of railway from the Wyoming field to tidewater, which independent miners and shippers of coal were promoting for the purpose of securing better rates on their coal to the seaboard. In a mere holding company, the Temple Iron Company, all six carriers combined, as stockholders for the purpose of providing $5,000,000 with which the properties of the chief independent operators, Simpson and Watkins, were purchased and thereby the new railroad project was defeated. The president of the Holding Company was active in the enterprise and that company, although only one of six, became responsible for 30 per cent. of the required financing. In United States v. Reading, \n226 \nU.S. 324, 351\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 90, 96 (57 L. Ed. 243), this court characterized what was done by this combination, under the leadership of the Holding Company, in these terms:\n'The New York, Wyoming & Western Railroad Company was successfully strangled, and the monopoly of transportation collectively held by the six defendant carrier companies was maintained.'\n\n And, again, at page 355 of 226 U. S., at page 97 of 33 Sup. Ct. (57 L. Ed. 243):\n'We are in entire accord with the view of the court below in holding that the transaction involved a concerted scheme and combination for the purpose of restraining commerce among the states in plain violation of the act of Congress of July 2, 1890.'\n\n About the year 1900 the Holding Company and many other initial anthracite carriers and their controlled coal compn ies, pursuant to an agreement with each other, made separate agreements with nearly all of the independent producers of coal along their lines, to purchase at the mines 'all the anthracite coal thereafter mined from any of their mines now opened or operated or which might thereafter be opened and operated,' and to pay therefor \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 50]\n\u00a0\n per cent. of the average price of coal prevailing at tidewater points at or near New York, computed from month to month. In the case above cited, this court discussed these contracts and declared: That they were made for the purpose of eliminating the competition of independent operators from the markets and thus removing 'a menace to the monopoly of transportation to tidewater which the defendants collectively possessed'; that before these contracts, there existed not only the power to compete but actual competition between the coal of the independents and that produced by the buying defendants, but that after the contracts were made 'such competition was impracticable'; that the case fell well within not only the Standard Oil and Tobacco Cases, \n221 U.S. 1\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 502, 34 L. R. A. (N. S.) 834, Ann. Cas. 1912D, 734; \n221 U.S. 106\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 632, but was of such an unreasonable character as to be 'within the authority of a long line of cases decided by this court;' and finally that the defendants had combined, by and through the instrumentality of the 65 per cent. contracts with the purpose and design of unlawfully controlling the sale of the independent output of coal at tidewater.\n Thus, this court held that once within 2 years and again within 4 years after it was organized, this Holding Company used the great power which we have seen was centered in its board of directors, by adroit division of property and of corporate agency, for the purpose of violating, in a flagrant manner, the Anti-Trust Act of 1890.\n Almost immediately after the two attempts to monopolize the trade in anthracite thus condemned by this court, the Holding Company, in January, 1901, purchased a controlling interest in the capital stock of the Central Railroad Company. When this suit was commenced that company was operating 675 miles of track, over which it carried in 1913, 10,783,000 tons of anthracite-almost one-half of its total freight traffic. Its capital stock was then $27,436,000 and its funded debt was $46,881,000.\n This Central Company owned, at the time, in excess of \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 51]\n\u00a0\n eleven-twelfths of the capital stock of the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, with a capital stock of over $9,000,000 and a funded debt of about $17,000, 000. And that company owned or had leased in excess of 14,000 acres of coal bearing lands-13,000 acres in the Wyoming field-and in the year ending June 30, 1913, it shipped from its lands thus owned or controlled, 6,243,000 tons of coal, which was sold for over $20,000,000.\n Immediately after this purchase, the president of the Holding Company, Mr. Baer, was made president of the Central Railroad Company and of the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, and remained such until his death, after the commencement of this suit, and from one-third to one-half of the directors of each company were thereafter chosen from the board of the Holding Company. Thus from the time of this purchase both companies have been actively dominated by the Holding Company management.\n It is argued that the Central Railroad, thus acquired, and the Reading System were not competitors, but this question is put beyond discussion by the testimony of Mr. Baer, the president of the Reading Company, and his immediate predecessor in office, Mr. Harris. The former testified:\n'Q. You are president of the defendants, the Reading Company, Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Lehigh & Wilkes- Barre Coal Company, and the Temple Iron Company?\n\n'A. I am. ...\n\n'Q. What do you regard as the competitors of the Philadelphia & Reading now in New York Harbor as to anthracite coal?\n\n'A. All the companies that ship to New York. They would be the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Lehigh Valley, the Delaware & Lackawanna, the Delaware & Hudson, \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 52]\n\u00a0\n the Erie, Ontario & Western. I guess those are all the roads leading to New York directly or indirectly. [He did not name the Central Company because it was a part of the Reading System when he testified.]\n\n'Q. Those roads are all carrying anthracite coal to New York Harbor?\n\n'A. Yes, sir.\n\n'Q. And you regard them as competitors who must be considered in fixing rates?\n\n'A. Yes, sir; unquestionably.'\n\n Mr. Harris testified:\n'Q. During the time that you were president of the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad Company, from 1893 to 1901, what were the competitive roads in the coal trade with which you came in competition?\n\n'A. We came in competition with all the roads that were carrying coal from Pennsylvania.\n\n'Q. Name the principal ones in reference to carrying coal from the coal mines to New York Harbor.\n\n'A. The Reading, the Lehigh Valley, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western, the Erie, and the Pennsylvania Railroad.'\n\n That the Reading Coal Company and the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company were competitors before the latter passed under the control of the Holding Company is obvious, but Mr. Baer put this also beyond disputed by testifying:\n'Q. Prior to 1901 were the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Company competitors as sellers of coal in New York Harbor?\n\n'A. Yes; and they are to-day.\n\n'Q. And generally throughout the eastern territory they were competitors at that time?\n\n'A. Yes, sir; through that northern territory. Not in this territory nor in the southern.'\n\n Thus, by this purchase, the Reading Holding Company \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 53]\n\u00a0\n acquired complete control, not only of one of the largest competitive anthracite carriers, but also of one of the largest competitive coal producing and selling companies, in the country. The anthracite tonnage of the Central and Reading Railway Companies thus combined, exceeded, at the time, 18,000,000 tons-over one-third, of the then total production of the country-and the revenue derived from it was more than one-third of the total earnings of the two railroad companies.\n In 1915 the Interstate Commerce Commission concluded an investigation of the 'Rates, practices, rules and regulations governing the transportation of anthracite coal,' which had been in progress for 3 years. The 11 initial anthracite carriers which have lines penetrating the coal producing region were required to furnish special reports as to their anthracite coal transportation operations, and they appeared and participated in the hearing. The result of this exhaustive investigation was that the commission found: That since about 1901, with variations and exceptions which are negligible here, the carriers have had the same fixed and flat rates to tidewater, regardless of the distance and character of the haul; that these rates were the result of co-operation or combination among the carriers; and that they were excessive to such an extent that material reductions by all of the carriers were ordered, including, of course, those of the Central and Reading Companies. The commission also found, and this appears in the record of this case, that the Reading Coal Company had never paid any dividends on its stock, and that, while the books of the Holding Company showed the Coal Company to have been indebted to it in a sum exceeding $68,000,000 for advances of capital made by the Reading Railroad Company before the reorganization in 1896, it has paid interest thereon only occasionally and in such small amounts that up to 1913 it fell short by more than $30,000,000 of equaling 4 per cent. per \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 54]\n\u00a0\n annum on the indebtedness. In the meantime advances of large sums had been made by the Holding Company to the Coal Company and unusual credits had been allowed the latter in the payment o its freight bills. This dealing Coal the Holding Company with the Reading Coal Company, and similar dealing of the Central Company with the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company and the Navigation Company are denounced by the Commission as unlawful discrimination against other shippers of coal over the rails of these two companies, and, obviously, such favoritism tends to discourage competition and to unduly restrain interstate commerce.\n Upon this history of the transactions involved, not controverted save as to some findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission, we must proceed to judgment, and very certainly it makes a case calling for the application of repeated decisions of this court, which clearly rule it.\n It will be convenient to first dispose of several minor contentions.\n In 1871 the Navigation Company leased the Lehigh & Susquehanna Railroad, which it owned, to the Central Railroad Company, by an instrument containing a covenant which the government claims requires the Navigation Company to ship to market over the leased line three-fourths of all of the coal which it should produce in the future. This covenant has been amended and supplemented by several agreements but not so as to essentially modify it with respect to the contention we are to consider.\n It is argued that this covenant necessarily imposed an undue restriction upon the Navigation Company in selecting its markets and in shipping its coal, in violation of the Anti-Trust Act.\n Is is not entirely clear that the covenant will bear the restrictive interpretations as to shipments which the \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 55]\n\u00a0\n government puts upon it, but, assuming that it may be so interpreted, nevertheless, the conditions and circumstances of the case considered, the result contended for cannot be allowed.\n When the lease was made, in 1871, the Central Railroad extended from Jersey City to its western terminus at Phillipsburg, N. J., and it was without access to the coal fields. The Lehigh & Susquehanna Railroad was about 100 miles in length and extended from Phillipsburg into the Wyoming field, where the Navigation Company owned extensive coal producing properties and mines. The lines of the two companies were in no sense competitive, but, on the contrary, the Lehigh & Susquehanna line served as a natural extension of the Central Company's lines to the great tonnage producing coal districts. The rental to be paid was one-third of the gross earnings of the railroad and it was natural and 'normal' that the lessor should desire that the traffic should continue to be as large as possible. Plainly this covenant was not written with the purpose of suppressing interstate commerce and the history of its operation shows that, instead of supressing it, it has greatly promoted it. The claim is quite too insubstantial to be entertained and the decree of the District Court with respect to it will be affirmed and the bill, as to it, dismissed.\n In many leases for the operation of coal producing lands the Reading Coal Company and the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company incorporated a covenant that the lessee should ship all coal mined by rail routes, which were named or which were to be designated. Since this covenant was resorted to as a part of the scheme to control the mining and transportation of coal, which is condemned as unlawful in this opinion, the decree of the District Court enjoining the lessors and the other defendants herein from attempting to enforce such covenants will be affirmed.\n The other charges against the Lehigh Coal & Navigation \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 56]\n\u00a0\n Company and the case stated in the bill with respect to the Wilmington & Northern Railroad Company, the Lehigh & Hudson River Railway Company, and the Lehigh & New England Railroad Company are substantially abandoned in the government's brief, and, having regard to the results arrived, at with respect to the principal defendants, the ends of justice will be best served by dismissing the bill as to all of these defendants, without prejudice, as was done by the District Court as to all bt the Wilmington & Northern Railroad Company, as to which the dismissal was unqualified. A majority of the individual defendants have died since the suit was instituted and their successors in office have not been made parties, and, since the conclusion to be announced can be given full effect by an appropriate decree against the corporation defendants, the case as against the remaining individual defendants need not be considered, and as to them the bill will be dismissed without prejudice.\n We are thus brought to the consideration of what the decree shall be with respect to the really important defendants in the case, the three Reading Companies, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey and the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company.\n Before the reorganization of 1896 the gathering of more than two- thirds of the acreage of the Schuylkill field into the control of the two Reading Companies was, as their reports show, for the frankly avowed purpose, then not forbidden by statute, of monopolizing the production, transportation and sale of the anthracite coal of the largest of the three sources of supply.\n When in 1896 the problem was presented of reorganizing the financial affairs of the two companies, it was not solved as it might have been, by creating separate coal and railroad companies to conduct independently interstate commerce in the two departments to which their railroad and coal properties were adapted, but, on the \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 57]\n\u00a0\n contrary, and very obviously for the purpose of evading the provision of the Constitution of Pennsylvania prohibiting any incorporated common carrier from, directly or indirectly, engaging in mining 'articles' for transportation over its lines (Constitution of Pennsylvania 1874, art. 17 ,  5), and also of evading the provisions of the federal Anti-Trust Act against restraining and monopolizing interstate commerce, resort was had to the holding company device, by which one company was given unrestricted control over the other two, with the power, inherent in that form of organization, of continuing and carrying forward the restraint and monopoly which had previously been acquired over that large volume of interstate commerce which was to be conducted by the coal and railroad companies.\n Again, when in 1901 a rivalry, imaginary or real, arose for the control of the Central Railroad Company, the Holding Company, regardless of the law, did not hesitate to purchase control of that great competing anthracite coal carrying system, with its extensive coal owning and mining subsidiary. This acquisition placed the Holding Company in a position of dominating control not only over two great competing interstate railroad carriers but also over two great competing coal companies, engaged extensively in mining and selling anthracite coal, which must be transported to interstate markets over the controlled interstate lines of railway.\n Again, and obviously, this dominating power was not obtained by normal expansion to meet the demands of a business growing as a result of superior and enterprising management, but by deliberate, calculated purchase for control.\n That such a power, so obtained, regardless of the use made of it, constitutes a menace to and an undue restraint upon interstate commerce within the meaning of the Anti-Trust Act has been frequently held by this court. \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 58]\n\u00a0\n Thus, in Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 327\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 436, 452 (48 L. Ed. 679), when dealing with a holding company, such as we have here, this court, in 1903, held:\n'No scheme or device could more certainly come within the words of the act-'combination in the form of a trust or otherwise ... in restraint of commerce among the several states or with foreign nations'-or could more effectively and certainly suppress free competition between the constituent companies. ... The mere existence of such a combination and the power acquired by the holding company as its trustee, constitute a menace to, and a restraint upon, that freedom of commerce which Congress intn ded to recognize and protect, and which the public is entitled to have protected.'\n\n And again, in United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., \n226 \nU.S. 61, 88\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 53, 58 (57 L. Ed. 124), decided 9 years later, in 1912, this court held:\n'The consolidation of two great competing systems of railroad engaged in interstate commerce by transfer to one of a dominating stock interest in the other creates a combination which restrains interstate commerce within the meaning of the statute, because, in destroying or greatly abridging the free operation of competition theretofore existing, it tends to higher rates. ... Nor does it make any difference that rates for the time being may not be raised and much money be spent in improvements after the combination is effected. It is the scope of such combinations and their power to suppress or stifle competition or create monopoly which determines the applicability of the act.'\n\n It will suffice to add that this doctrine was referred to as the settled conclusion of this court, in 1914, when discussing a similar state Anti-Trust Act in International Harvester Co. v. State of Missouri, \n234 \nU.S. 199, 209\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 859, 862 (58 L. Ed. 1276, 52 L. R. A. [N. S.] 525 ), it was said:\n'The specification under this head is that the Supreme Court [of Missouri] found, it is contended, benefit-not \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 59]\n\u00a0\n injury-to the public had resulted from the alleged combination. Granting that this is not an overstatement of the opinion the answer is immediate. It is too late in the day to assert against statutes which forbid combinations of competing companies that a particular combination was induced by good intentions and has had some good effect. ... The purpose of such statutes is to secure competition and preclude combinations which tend to defeat it.'\n\n Thus, this record clearly shows a group of men selecting the Holding Company with an 'omnibus' charter and not only investing it by stock control with such complete dominion over two great competing interstate carriers and over two great competing coal companies extensively engaged in interstate commerce in anthracite coal as to bring it, without more, within the condemnation of the Anti-Trust Act, but it also shows that this power of control was actually used, once successfully, to suppress the building of a prospective competitive railway line, and a second time, successfully until this court condemned the 65 per cent. contracts as illegal, to suppress the last prospect of competition in anthracite production and transportation. To this it must be added that up to the time when this suit was commenced this Holding Company had continued in active, dominating control of the Reading Railway Company and of the competing Central Railroad System, and also of the two coal companies, thus effectually suppressing all competition, between the four companies and pooling their earnings. It is difficult to imagine a clearer case and in all essential particulars it rests on undisputed conduct and upon perfectly established law. It is ruled by many decisions of this court, but specifically and clearly by United States v. Union Pacific R. R. Co., supra.\n For flagrant violation of the first and second sections of the Anti- Trust Act, the relations between the Reading \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 60]\n\u00a0\n Company, the Reading Railway Company and the Reading Coal Company and between these companies and the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey must be so dissolved as to give to each of them a position in all respects independent and free from stock or other control of either of the other corporations.\n With respect to the contention that the commodities clause of the Act of June 29, 1906 (34 Stat. 584, 585), is being violated by the Reading Railway Company and the Central Railroad Company:\n The Circuit Judges centering their attention upon the fact that the Reading Railway Company did not own any of the stock of the Reading Coal Company, that the two companies had separate forces of operatives and separate accu nting systems, and upon the importance of maintaining 'the theory of separate corporate entity' as a legal doctrine, concluded upon the authority of United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 413\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 527, that the evidence did not justify holding that in transporting the products of the Reading Coal Company's mines to market the Reading Railway Company was carrying a commodity 'mined or produced by it or under its authority' or which it owned 'in whole or in part' or in which it had 'any interest, direct or indirect.'\n But the question which we have presented by this branch of the case is not the technical one of whether ownership by a railroad company of stock in a coal company renders it unlawful for the former to carry the product of the latter, for here the railroad company did not own any of the stock of the coal company. The real question is whether combining in a single corporation the ownership of all of the stock of a carrier and of all of the stock of a coal company results in such community of interest or title in the product of the latter as to bring the case within the scope of the provisions of the act.\n The purpose of the commodity clause was to put an \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 61]\n\u00a0\n end to the injustice to the shipping public, which experience had shown to result from discriminations of various kinds, which inevitably grew up where a railroad company occupied the inconsistent positions of carrier and shipper. Plainly in such a case as we have here this evil would be present as fully as if the title to both the coal lands and the railroads were in the Holding Company, for all of the profits realized from the operations of the two must find their way ultimately into its treasury-any discriminating practice which would barm the general shipper would profit the Holding Company. Being thus clearly within the evil to be remedied, there remains the question whether such a controlling stock ownership in a corporation is fairly within the scope of the language of the statute.\n In terms the act declares that it shall be unlawful for any railroad company to transport in interstate commerce 'any article or commodity ... mined or produced by it, or under its authority, or which it may own in whole or in part, or in which it may have any interest, direct or indirect.'\n Accepting the risk of obscuring the obvious by discussing it, and without splitting hairs as to where the naked legal title to the coal would be when in transit, we may be sure that it was mined and produced under the same 'authority' that transported it over the railroad. All three of the Reading Companies had the same officers and directors and it was under their authority that the mines were worked and the railroad operated, and they exercised that authority in the one case in precisely the same character as in the other-as officials of the Holding Company. The manner in which the stock of the three was held resulted and was intended to result, in the abdication of all independent corporate action by both the Railway Company and the Coal Company, involving as it did the surrender to the Holding Company of the en tire \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 62]\n\u00a0\n conduct of their affairs. It would be to subordinate reality to legal form to hold that the coal mined by the Coal Company, under direction of the Holding Company's officials, was not produced by the same 'authority' that operated the Reading Railway lines. The case falls clearly within the scope of the act, and for the violation of this commodity clause, as well as for its violation of the Anti-Trust Act, the combination between the Reading Railway Company and the Reading Coal Company must be dissolved.\n The relation between the Central Railroad Company and the Wilkes- Barre Coal Company presents a different question, for here the Railroad Company owns over eleven-twelfths of the stock of the Coal Company, and therefore the holding in \n213 U.S. 366\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 527, supra, is especially pressed in argument-that the ownership of stock by ar ailroad company in a coal company does not cause the former to have such an interest in a legal or equitable sense in the product of the latter as to bring it within the prohibition of the act. But this holding was considered in United States v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 257, 272\n, 31 S. Sup. Ct. 387, and it was there held not applicable where a railroad company used its stock ownership for the purpose of securing a complete control over the affairs of a Coal Company, and of treating it as a mere agency or department of the owning company. This rule was repeated and applied in United States v. D. L. & W. R. R. Co., \n238 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 873. It results that it may confidently be stated that the law upon this subject now is that while the ownership by a railroad company of shares of the capital stock of a mining company does not necessarily create an identity of corporate interest between the two such as to render it unlawful under the commodities clause for the railroad company to transport in interstate commerce the products of such mining company, yet where such ownership of stock is resorted to, not for \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 63]\n\u00a0\n the purpose of participating in the affairs of the corporation in which it is held in a manner normal and usual with stockholders, but for the purpose of making it a mere agent, or instrumentality or department of another company, the courts will look through the forms to the realities of the relation between the companies as if the corporate agency did not exist and will deal with them as the justice of the case may require. United States v. Lehigh Valley R. R. Co., \n220 \nU.S. 257, 272\n, 273 S., 31 Sup. Ct. 387; United States v. D., L. & W. R. R. Co., \n238 \nU.S. 516, 529\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 873; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. R. Co. v. Minneapolis Civic & Commerce Association, \n247 \nU.S. 490, 501\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 553.\n Applying this rule of law to the relation between the Central Railroad Company and the Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, with the former owning over eleven-twelfths of the capital stock of the latter and using it as the coal mining department of its organization, we cannot doubt that it falls within the condemnation of the commodities clause and that this relation must also, for this reason, be dissolved.\n It results that the decree of the District Court will be affirmed, as to the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, the Lehigh & New England Railroad Company, the Lehigh & Hudson River Railway Company, as to the restrictive covenants in the mining leases with respect to the shipping of coal, as to the dissolution of the combination between the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, maintained through the Reading Company and the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey. As to the Wilmington and Northern Railroad Company and as to the individual defendants, the bill will be dismissed without prejudice. As to the Reading Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company and the \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 64]\n\u00a0\n Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, the decree of the District Court will be reversed and the cause remanded with directions to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion, dissolving the combination of the Reading Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey and the Lehigh and Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, existing and maintained through the Reading Company, with such provision for the disposition of the shares of stock and bonds and other property of the various companies, held by the Reading Company, as may be necessary to establish the entire independence from that company and from each other, of the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, and also that such disps ition shall be made by the decree of the stocks and bonds of the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, held by the Central Railroad Company of New Jersey, as may be necessary to establish entire independence between these two companies to the end that the affairs of all of these now combined companies may be conducted in harmony with the law.\n Affirmed in part; reversed in part, and remanded, with direction to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE, Mr. Justice HOLMES, and Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, dissenting.\n Except in so far as the decree below commanded a separation of interest between the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, the court below dismissed, for want of equity, the bill of the United States brought to sever the existing relations \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 65]\n\u00a0\n between the Reading Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Railway Company, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company, the Central Railroad of New Jersey, the Lehigh & Wilkes-Barre Coal Company, and other corporations, on the ground that the relations between those companies resulted in a monopoly or combination in restraint of trade in violation of the Sherman Act (Comp. St.  8820-8823, 8827-8830) and gave rise to a disregard of the commodities clause of the act of Congress (Comp. St.  8563 \n\n[253 U.S. 26, 6]\n\u00a0\n).\n By the opinion now announced, this action of the court below, in so far as it directed a dismissal, is reversed and virtually the full relief prayed by the government is therefore granted. We are unable to concur in this conclusion because in our opinion neither the contentions as to the Sherman Act, nor the reliance upon the commodities clause, except to the extent that in the particulars stated they were sustained by the court below, have any foundation to rest upon. We do not state at any length the reasons which lead us to this view because the court below, composed of three circuit judges, in a comprehensive and clear opinion announced by McPherson, Judge, sustains the correctness of the action which it took and also demonstrates the error involved in the decree of this court reversing its action.

C., for the United States.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 281, 289]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, of New York City, E. E. Ellinwood and John Mason Ross, both of Bisbee, Ariz., and Clifton Mathews, of Globe, Ariz., for defendants in error.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 281, 292]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The case is here under the Criminal Appeals Act (Comp. St.  1704) to directly review a judgment quashing an indictment against the 25 persons who are defendants in error. The indictment contained four counts, but as the fourth is now abandoned by the government we need not consider it.\n The first count charged the accused with conspiring, in violation of section 19 of the Criminal Code (Comp. St.  10183), to injure, oppress, threaten, or intimidate 221 named persons, alleged to be citizens of the United States residing in Arizona, of rights or privileges secured to them by the Constitution or laws of the United States; that is to say, the right and privilege pertaining to citizens of said state peacefully to reside and remain therein and to be immune from unlawful deportation from that state to another. And th overt acts alleged were: The arming of the conspirators; the seizure and holding of the persons named until by means of a railway train procured for that purpose they were forcibly transported into New Mexico, and in that state released under threat of death or great bodily harm should they ever return to the state of Arizona.\n The second count was the same as the first, except that only 25 of the persons alleged in the first count to have been injured were named, and they were stated to be citizens of the United States residing in, but not citizens of, the state of Arizona.\n The third count was also identical with the first, except that it embraced only 196 of the injured persons named in \n\n[254 U.S. 281, 293]\n\u00a0\n the first count and 1 additional person not therein named, all being declared to be citizens of the United States and of the state of Arizona, residing in that state.\n The court quashed the indictment, on the ground that no power had been delegated by the Constitution to the United States to forbid and punish the wrongful acts complained of, as the right to do so was exclusively within the authority reserved by that instrument to the several states. As the entire case will be disposed of by testing the accuracy of this view, we come immediately to consider that subject.\n In argument, the asserted error in the conclusion is based, not upon the direct result of any particular provision of the Constitution, but upon implications arising from that instrument as a whole, the conditions existing at the time of its adoption, and the consequences inevitably produced from the creation by it of the government of the United States. A wide field of inquiry common to all the contentions is thus opened. In order, therefore, to afford a common basis by which to measure the correctness of the various implications insisted upon, we state under separate headings doctrines which are applicable to all the contentions, and which are in reason so well founded and so conclusively sustained by authority as to be indisputable.\n\n\n (a)\n In all the states, from the beginning down to the adoption of the Articles of Confederation, the citizens thereof possessed the fundamental right, inherent in citizens of all free governments, peacefully to dwell within the limits of their respective states, to move at will from place to place therein, and to have free ingress thereto and egress therefrom, with a consequent authority in the states to forbid and punish violations of this fundamental right. Corfield v. Coryell, 4 Wash. C. C. 371, 380, 381, Fed. Cas. No. 3,230; Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 76.\n\n\n (b)\n Whether, in disregard of the principles of comity, any of the states recognized in their own citizens rights on \n\n[254 U.S. 281, 294]\n\u00a0\n this subject which they refused to grant to citizens of other states, we need not consider, in view of the provision of the Articles of Confederation on the subject. By that provision uniformity was secured, not by lodging power in Congress to deal with the subject, but, while reserving in the several states the authority which they had theretofore enjoyed, yet subjecting such authority to a limitation inhibiting the power from being used to discriminate. The text of article 4 which provides for this subject is as follows:\n'The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different states in this Union, the free inhabitants of each of these states, paupers, vagabonds and fugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges and immunities of free citizens in the several states; and the people of each state shall have free ingress and egress to and from any other state, ...'\n\n Thus, while power remained in the several states, the boundaries demarking them became, at least for the purpose of the enjoyment of the right here in question, negligible, and the frontiers of the Confederation became the measure of the equal right secured to the inhabitants of each and all the states.\n\n\n (c)\n That the Constitution plainly intended to preserve and enforce the limitation as to discrimination imposed upon the states by article 4 of the Confederation, and thus necessarily assumed the continued possession by the states of the reserved power to deal with free residence, ingress and egress, cannot be denied for the following reasons: (1) Because the text of article 4,  2, of the Constitution, makes manifest that it was drawn with reference to the corresponding clause of the Articles of Confederation and was intended to perpetuate its limitations; and (2) because that view has been so conclusively settled as to leave no room for controversy. Thus \n\n[254 U.S. 281, 295]\n\u00a0\n in Paul v. Virginia, 8 Wall. 168, 180, considering the operation and effect of article 4,  2, of the Constitution, it was said:\n'It was undoubtedly the object of the clause in question to place the citizens of each state upon the same footing with citizens of other states, so far as the advantages resulting from citizenship in those states are concerned. It relieves them from the disabilities of alienage in other states; it inhibits discriminating legislation against them by other states; it gives them the right of free ingress into other states, and egress from them; it insures to them in other states the same freedom possessed by the citizens of those states in the acquisition and enjoyment of property and in the pursuit of happiness; and it secures them in other estates the equal protection of their laws. It has been justly said that no provision in the Constitution has tended so strongly to constitute the citizens of the United States one people as this.\n\n'Indeed, without some provision of the kind removing from the citizens of each state the disabilities of alienage in the other states, and giving them equality of privilege with citizens of those states, the republic would have constituted little more than a league of states; it would not have constituted the Union which now exists.'\n\n Again, in Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430 (20 L. Ed. 449), upon the same subject, the court declared:\n'Attempt will not be made to defind the words 'privileges and immunities,' or to specify the rights which they are intended to secure and protect, beyond what may be necessary to the decision of the case before the court. Beyond doubt those words are words of very comprehensive meaning, but it will be sufficient to say that the clause plainly and unmistakably secures and protects the right of a citizen of one state to pass into any other state of the Union for the purpose of engaging in lawful commerce, trade, or business without molestation; to acquire personal \n\n[254 U.S. 281, 296]\n\u00a0\n property; to take and hold real estate; to maintain actions in the courts of the state; and to be exempt from any higher taxes or excises than are imposed by the state upon its own citizens.'\n\n In the Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 75, 76, the court, after reciting both the provisions of article 4 of the Confederation and article 4,  2, of the Constitution, said:\n'There can be but little question that the purpose of both these provisions is the same, and that the privileges and immunities intended are the same in each. In the article of the Confederation we have some of these specifically mentioned, and enough perhaps to give some general idea of the class of civil rights meant by the phrase.\n\n'Fortunately we are not without judicial construction of this clause of the Constitution. The first and leading case on the subject is that of Corfield v. Coryell, decided by Mr. Justice Washington in the Circuit Court for the District of Pennsylvania in 1823\n\n\n\n\"The inquiry,' he says, 'is, What are the privileges and immunities of citizens of the several states? We feel no hesitation in confining these expressions to those privileges and immunities which are fundamental, which belong of right to the citizens of all free governments, and which have at all times been enjoyed by citizens of the several states which compose this Union, from the time of their becoming free, independent, and sovereign. What these fundamental principles are it would be more tedious than difficult to enumerate. They may all, however, be comprehended under the following general heads: Protection by the government, with the right to acquire and possess property of every kind, and to pursue and obtain happiness and safety, subject, nevertheless, to such restraints as the government may prescribe for the general good of the whole.' \n\n[254 U.S. 281, 297]\n\u00a0\n 'This definition of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the states is adopted in the main by this court in the recent case of Ward v. State of Maryland, while it declines to undertake an authoritative definition beyond what was necessary to that decision. The description, when taken to include others not named, but which are of the same general character, embraces nearly every civil right for the establishment and protection of which organized government is instituted. They are, in the language of Judge Washington, those rights which are fundamental. Throughout his opinion, they are spoken of as rights belonging to the individual as a citizen of a state. They are so spoken of in the constitutional provision which he was construing. And they have always been held to be the class of rights which the state governments were created to establish and secure.'\n\n The controlling influence of the opinion in the Slaughterhouse Cases, as well as that of Mr. Justice Washington in Corfield v. Coryell, stand out in bolder relief when it is observed that in the latter case, following the statement of the general principles contained in the passage quoted in the Slaughterhouse Cases, there is found, by way of illustration, an enumeration of particular rights declared to be clearly embraced by the general principles, one of which is described as:\n'The right of a citizen of one state to pass through, or reside in any other state, for purposes of trade, agriculture, professional pursuits, or otherwise.'\n\n Applying these doctrines, let us come to test the soundness of the implications from the Constitution relied upon to establish the absence of all state authority to deal with the individual wrongs complained of, and the possession by the federal government of power for that purpose, and, as pertinent thereto, to refer briefly to the authorities which it is assumed sustained those implications.\n Undoubtedly the right of citizens of the states to reside peacefully in, and to have free ingress into and egress from, \n\n[254 U.S. 281, 298]\n\u00a0\n the several states had, prior to the Confederation, a twofold aspect: (1) As possessed in their own states; and (2) as enjoyed in virtue of the comity of other states. But although the Constitution fused these distinct rights into one, by providing that one state should not deny to the citizens of other states rights given to its own citizens, no basis is afforded for contending that a wrongful prevention by an individual of the enjoyment by a citizen of one state in another of rights possessed in that state by its own citizens was a violation of a right afforded by the Constitution. This is the necessary result of article 4,  2, which reserves to the several states authority over the subject, limited by the restriction against state discriminatory action, hence excluding federal authority, except where invoked to enforce the limitation, which is not here the case; a conclusion expressly sustained by the ruling in United States v. Harris, \n106 \nU.S. 629, 645\n, 1 S. Sup. Ct. 601, to the effect that the second section of article 4, like the Fourteenth Amendment, is directed alone against state action. And this was but a summary of what had been previously pointed out in the Slaughterhouse Cases, 16 Wall. 36, where, in dealing with the privileges and immunities embraced by article 4,  2, of the Constitution, it was observed (page 77):\n'It would be the vainest show of learning to attempt to prove by citations of authority that up to the adoption of the recent amendments, no claim or pretence was set up that those rights depended on the federal government for their existence or protection, beyond the very few express limitations which the federal Constitution imposed upon the states-such, for instance, as the prohibition against ex post facto laws, bills of attainder, and laws impairing the obligation of contracts. But, with the exception of these and a few other restrictions, the entire domain of the privileges and immunities of citizens of the states, as above defined, lay within the constitutional and legislative power \n\n[254 U.S. 281, 299]\n\u00a0\n of the states, and without that of the federal government.'\n\n Nor is the situation changed by assuming that as a state has the power, by depriving its own citizens of the right to reside peacefully therein and to free ingress thereto and egress therefrom, it may, without violating the prohibitions of article 4 against discrimination, apply a like rule to citizens of other states, and hence engender, outside of article 4, a federal right. This must be so, since the proposition assumes that a state could, without violating the fundamental limitations of the Constitution, other than those of article 4,  2, enact legislation incompatible with its existence as a free government and destructive of the fundamental rights of its citizens, and, furthermore, because the premise upon which the proposition rests is state action and the existence of federal power to determine the repugnancy of such action to the Constitution, matters which, not being here involved, are not disputed.\n This leads us furthermore to point out that the case of Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, so much relied upon in the argument, is inapplicable, not only because it involved the validity of state action, but because the state statute considered in that case was held to directly burden the performance by the United States of its governmental functions and also to limit rights of the citizens growing out of such functions; and hence it also follows that the observation made in Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 97\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 14, to the effect that it had been held in the Crandall Case that the privilege of passing from state to state is an attribute of national citizenship, may here be put out of view as inapposite.\n With the object of confining our decision to the case before us, we say that nothing we have stated must be considered as implying a want of power in the United States to restrain acts which, although involving ingress or \n\n[254 U.S. 281, 300]\n\u00a0\n egress into or from a state, have for their direct and necessary effect an interference with the performance of duties which it is incumbent upon the United States to discharge, as illustrated in the Crandall Case, supra.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CLARKE dissents. \n\n\n\n","177":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. NORTHERN PAC. RY. CO.(1920)\nNo. 88\nArgued: Decided: December 6, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 251, 252]\n\u00a0\n Assistant Attorney General Adams, for the United States.\n Messrs. D. F. Lyons and Charles W. Bunn, both of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Northern Pacific Railway Company owns and uses in interstate commerce a terminal railroad along the water front of Duluth extending from Rice's Point to Furnace, a distance of 4 miles. It was sued in the District Court of the United States for the District of Minnesota for violating the Safety Appliance Act1 by operating over the whole of this road, in September, 1916, two transfer trains, without complying with the requirement that 85 per cent. of the train brakes be coupled so as to be under engine control. One train consisted of a locomotive and 48 cars; the other, of a locomotive and 40 cars. The company contended that the provision of the Safety Appliance Act did not control the operation, because this terminal road was not part of a main line; that neither passenger nor freight trains, through or local, moved on it; that on it trains are not operated by time-tables, train \n\n[254 U.S. 251, 253]\n\u00a0\n orders, or timecards, nor is the use of the track controlled by block signals; that on it no train has right of way over another; but that there the single operating rule applies which requires all trains to move at such speed that they can be stopped at vision, and that trains are under the yardmaster's orders. The company's contention was sustained by the District Court which directed a verdict for defendant; and the judgment entered thereon was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. 225 Fed. 655, 167 C. C. A. 31. The case comes here on writ of certiorari. \n249 U.S. 597\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 388.\n These additional facts are material: The road for a distance of a mile at the beginning and for less at the end is single track. It crosses at grade two streets, on one of which run street cars. It crosses at grade, at five places in all, lines of three independent railroad companies which run freight trains to piers situated between Rice's Point and Furnace. One of these companies also runs passenger trains across defendant's tracks. In addition, two other independent companies use, under the usual traffic right agreement, about a mile of this railroad as a part of their freight lines to piers situated between Rice's Point and Furnace. These 4 miles of railroad owned by the Northern Pacific are not used by it for switching or assembling cars. The switching, assembling, and classification of cars for its through and local freight is done in the Rice's Point yard, where there are 55 tracks, each 4,000 feet long, and at Furnace, where there are 15 tracks, cars are also switched and assembled. At Berwind and Boston, two intermediate points, where there are respectively 9 and 6 tracks, cars are frequently set out or picked up by transfer trains. The transfer trains here in question appear to have run solid between Rice's Point and Furnace. Trains are run by the Northern Pacific on this line at a speed varying from 3 to 18 miles an hour. \n\n[254 U.S. 251, 254]\n\u00a0\n The company contends that the rule applied in United States v. Erie Railroad Co., \n237 U.S. 402\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 621, United States v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co., \n237 U.S. 410\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 634, and Louisville & Jeffersonville Bridge Co. v. United States, \n249 U.S. 534\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 355,2 is not applicable, because here, unlike those cases, no part of the trains' journey was performed on a track used as part of the main line of the Northern Pacific system. If use of the road as part of a main line were essential in order that operations on it be controlled by the Safety Appliance Act, the requirement would be satisfied in this case by the fact that two independent companies use the road for freight trains under air control and that the passenger trains of another company cross it. 'Not only were these [the defendant's] trains subject to the hazards which that provision was intended to avoid or minimize, but unless their engineers were able readily and quickly to check or control their movements they were a serious menace to the safety of other trains which the statute was equally designed to protect.' United States v. Chicago, etc., Ry., supra. But there is nothing in the act which limits the application of the provision here in question to operations on main line tracks. The requirement that train brakes shall be coupled so as to be under engine control is in terms (32 Stat. 943) applicable to 'all trains ... used on any railroad engaged in interstate commerce.' It is admitted that this railroad is engaged in interstate commerce; and the cases cited show that transfer trains, like those here involved, are 'trains' within the meaning of the act. A moving locomotive with cars attached is without the provision of the act only when it is not a train; as where the operation is that of switching, classifying and assembling cars within railroad yards for the purpose of making \n\n[254 U.S. 251, 255]\n\u00a0\n up trains. Congress has not imposed upon courts applying the act any duty to weigh the dangers incident to particular operations; and we have no occasion to consider the special dangers incident to operating trains under the conditions here presented.\n The judgment of the United States Circuit Court of Apppeals is\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act March 2, 1893, c. 196,  1, 27 Stat. 531 (Comp.

Ct. 956; United States v. Hill, \n248 U.S. 420\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 143. The statute makes no distinction between different modes of transportation and we think it was intended to include them all, that being \n\n[252 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n the natural import of its words. Had Congress intended to confine it to transportation by railroads and other common carriers it well may be assumed that other words appropriate to the expression of that intention would have been used. And it also may be assumed that Congress foresaw that if the statute were thus confined it could be so readily and extensively evaded by the use of automobiles, autotrucks and other private vehicles that it would not be of much practical benefit. See Kirmeyer v. Kansas, \n236 U.S. 568\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 419. At all events we perceive no reason for rejecting the natural import of its words and holdings that it was confined to transportation for hire or by public carriers.\n The published decisions show that a number of the federal courts have regarded the statute as embracing transportation by automobile, and have applied it in cases where the transportation was personal and private, as here. Ex parte Westbrook (D. C.) 250 Fed. 636; Malcolm v. United States, 256 Fed. 363, 167 C. C. A. 533; Jones v. United States (C. C. A.) 259 Fed. 104; Berryman v. United States (C. C. A.) 259 Fed. 208.\n That the liquor was intended for the personal use of the person transporting it is not material, so long as it was not for any of the purposes specially excepted. This was settled in United States v. Hill, supra.\n We conclude that the District Court erred in construing the statute and sustaining the demurrer.\n Judgment reversed.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE (dissenting.)\n The indictment in this case charges that the defendant, being in the City of Cheyenne, Wyoming, 'bought, paid for and owned' five quarts of whisky and thereafter, in his own automobile, driven by himself, transported it into the City of Denver, Colorado, intending to there devote it to his own personal use. Colorado prohibited the manu facture \n\n[252 U.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n and sale therein of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. The court decides that this liquor was unlawfully 'transported in interstate commerce,' from Wyoming into Colorado within the meaning of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1917 (39 Stat. 1069).\n With this conclusion I cannot agree.\n By early (Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 193) and by recent decisions (Second Employers' Liability Cases, \n223 \nU.S. 1, 46\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 169, 38 L. R. A. [N. S.] 44) of this court and by the latest authoritative disctionaries, interstate commerce, in the constitutional sens, is defined to mean commercial, business, intercourse- including the transportation of passengers and property-carried on between the inhabitants of two or more of the United States,-especially (we are dealing here with property) the exchange, buying or selling of commodities, of merchandise, on a large scale between the inhabitants of different states. The liquor involved in this case, after it was purchased and while it was being held for the personal use of the defendant, was, certainly, withdrawn from trade or commerce as thus defined-it was no longer in the channels of commerce, of trade or of business of any kind-and when it was carried by its owner, for his personal use, across a state line, in my judgment it was not moved or transported in interstate commerce, within the scope of the Act of Congress relied upon or of any legislation which Congress had the constitutional power to enact with respect to it at the time the Reed Amendment was approved. The grant of power to Congress is over Commerce,-not over isolated movements of small amounts of private property, by private persons for their personal use.\n I think the Hill Case, \n248 U.S. 420\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 143, was wrongly decided and that the judgment of the District Court in this case should be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","179":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. STANDARD BREWERY(1920)\nNo. 458\nArgued: December 11, 1919Decided: January 5, 1920\n\n\n\n\n\n[251 U.S. 210, 211]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson and Mr. Solicitor General King, of Atlanta, Ga., for the United States.\n\n\n[251 U.S. 210, 214]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William L. Marbury, of Baltimore, Md., for defendant in error Standard Brewing Co.\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These causes are here under the Criminal Appeals Act of March 2, 1907, c. 2564, 34 Stat. 1246 (Comp. St.  1704), and require the construction of the so-called 'War-Time Prohibition \n\n[251 U.S. 210, 215]\n\u00a0\n Act' of November 21, 1918, c. 212, 40 Stat. 1045, 1046, 1047\n\n\n In No. 458 the Standard Brewing Company was indicted for unlawfully using certain grains, cereals, fruit, and other food products on the 4th of June 1919, in the manufacture and production of beer for beverage purposes which, it is charged, contained as much as one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol by both weight and volume. In No. 474 the American Brewing Company was indicted for the like use on the 26th day of June, 1919, of certain grains, cereals and food products in the manufacture and production of beer containing a like percentage of alcohol.\n In the indictment in No. 474 it was charged that at the time of the alleged offense the termination of demobolization had not been determined and proclaimed by the President.\n In each case a demurrer was sustained by the District Court.\n Before considering the construction of of that portion of the act involved in these cases it will be helpful to give a short history of the preceding legislation that let up to it. The Food Control Act of August 10, 1917, 40 Stat. c. 53, pp. 276, 282, authorized the President to prescribe and give public notice of limitations, regulations, or prohibitions respecting the use of foods, fruits, food materials or feed, in the production of malt or vinous liquors for beverage purposes, including regulations for the reduction of the alcoholic content of any such malt or vinous liquor, in order to assure an adequate and continuous supply of food, and promote the national security and defense. Whenever notice should be given and remain unrevoked no person, after a reasonable time prescribed in such notice, could use any food, fruits, food materials or feeds in the production of malt or vinous liquors, or import any such liquors except under license and in compliance with lawfully prescribed rules and regulations. Under the \n\n[251 U.S. 210, 216]\n\u00a0\n authority thus conferred, the President issued various proclamations. On December 8, 1917, he issued one (40 Stat. 1728, Comp. St. 1918,  3115 1\/8 l, note), forbidding the production of all malt liquor, except ale and porter, containing more than 2.75 per cent. of alcohol by weight. On September 16, 1918, he issued a second proclamation (40 Stat. 1848), prohibiting after December 1, 1918, the production of malt liquors, including near beer, for beverage purposes, whether or not such malt liquors contained alcohol. On January 30, 1919, he issued a third proclamation (40 Stat. 1930), which modified the others to the extent of permitting the use of grain in the manufacture of nonintoxicating beverages, it being recited therein that the prohibition of the use of grain in the manufacture of such beverages had been found no longer essential in order to assure an adequate and continuous supply of food. And on March 4, 1919, he issued a fourth proclamation (40 Stat. 1937) amending his proclamation of September 16, 1918, so as to prohibit the production only of intoxicating malt liquors for beverage purposes.\n It thus appears that the President, acting under the act of August 10, 1917, has reduced the prohibition of the use of food materials so that now it is limited to the manufacture of such liquors as are in fact intoxicating.\n In the light of all this action we come to consider the proper construction of so much of the act of November 21, 1918, as is here involved, which provides:\n'That after June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war, and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, for the purpose of conserving the man power of the nation, and to increase efficiency in the production of arms, munitions, ships, food, and clothing for the army and navy, it shall be unlawful to sell for \n\n[251 U.S. 210, 217]\n\u00a0\n beverage purposes any distilled spirits, and during said time no distilled spirits held in bond shall be removed therefrom for beverage purposes except for export. After May first, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and therafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, no grains, cereals, fruit, or other food product shall be used in the manufacture or production of beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor for beverage purposes. After June thirtieth, nineteen hundred and nineteen, until the conclusion of the present war and thereafter until the termination of demobilization, the date of which shall be determined and proclaimed by the President of the United States, no beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquor shall be sold for beverage purposes except for export.'\n\n Nothing is better settled than that in the construction of a law its meaning must first be sought in the language employed. If that be plain, it is the duty of the courts to enforce the law as written, provided it be within the constitutional authority of the legislative body which passed it. Lake County v. Rollins, \n130 \nU.S. 662, 670\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 651; Bate Refrigerating Co. v. Sulzberger, \n157 \nU.S. 1, 33\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 508; United States v. Bank, \n234 \nU.S. 245, 258\n, 34 S. Sup. Ct. 846; Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470, 485\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 192, L. R. A. 1917F, 502, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 1168. Looking to the act we find these are its declared purposes: (1) To conserve the man power of the nation; (2) to increase efficiency in the production of arms, munitions ships, and food and clothing for the army and navy. To these ends it is made illegal to sell distilled spirits for beverage purposes or to remove the same from bond for such purposes except for export. And after May 1, 1919, until the conclusion of the war, and until demobilization is proclaimed by the President, no grains, cereals, fruit, or other food products are permitted to be used in the manufacture or production of \n\n[251 U.S. 210, 218]\n\u00a0\n beer, wine or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors for beverage purposes.\n The prohibitions extend to the use of food products for making 'beer, wine, or other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors for beverage purposes.' These provisions are of plain import and are alimed only at intoxicating beverages. It is elementary that all of the words used in a legislative act are to be given force and meaning, Market Co. v. Hoffman, \n101 U.S. 112\n, 115; and of course the qualifying words 'other intoxicating' in this act cannot be rejected. It is not to be assumed that Congress had no purpose in inserting them or that it did so without intending that they should be given due force and effect. The government insists that the intention was to include beer and wine whether intoxicating or not. If so the use of this phraseology was quite superfluous, and it would have been enough to have written the act without the qualifying words.\n This court had occasion to deal with a question very similar in character in the case of the United States v. United Verde Copper Co., \n196 U.S. 207\n, 25 Sup. Ct. 222, where an act permitted the use of timber on the public lands for building, agricultural, mining and other domestic purposes, and held that we could not disregard the use of the word 'other' notwithstanding the contention that it should be eliminated from the statute in order to ascertain the true meaning. So here, we think it clear that the framers of the statute intentionally used the phrase 'other intoxicating' as relating to and defining the immediately preceding designation of beer and wine.\n'As a matter of ordinary construction, where several words are followed by a general expression as here, which is as much applicable to the first and other words as to the last, that expression is not limited to the last, but applies to all.' Lord Bramwell in Great Western Railway Co. v. Railway Company, L. R. 9 App. Cas. 787, 808. \n\n[251 U.S. 210, 219]\n\u00a0\n The declared purpose of Congress was to conserve the nation's man power and increase efficiency in producing war essentials; and it accordingly undertook to prohibit the manufacture of intoxicating liquors whose use might interfere with the consummation of that purpose. Other provisions of the act lend support to this view. The sale and withdrawal from bond of distilled spirits (always intoxicating) were declared unlawful after June 30, 1919-their manufacture had already been prohibited. The sale of beer, wine and other intoxicating malt or vinous liquors was prohibited after the same date and the importation of all such liquors and also of distilled liquors was made immediately unlawful. The President was empowered at once to establish zones about coal mines, manufactories, shipbuilding plants, etc., and 'to prohibit the sale, manufacture or distribution of intoxicating liquors in such zones.'\n\n The fact that the Treasury Department may have declared taxable under many revenue acts all beer containing one-half of 1 per centum of alcohol is not important. Such rulings did not turn upon the intoxicating character of the liquid, but upon classification for taxation controlled by other considerations. A liquid may be designated as beer and subjected to taxation although clearly nonintoxicating.\n'The question whether a fermented malt liquor is intoxicating or nonintoxicating is immaterial under the internal revenue laws, although it may be a very material question under the prohibitory laws of a state or under local ordinances.' T. D. 804.\n\n As to the insistence that the Internal Revenue Department has determined that a beverage containing one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol should be regarded as intoxicating within the intendment of the act before us little need be said. Nothing in the act remits the determination of that question to the decision of the revenue officers of the government. While entitled to respect, \n\n[251 U.S. 210, 220]\n\u00a0\n as such decisions are, they cannot enlarge the meaning of a statute enacted by Congress. Administrative rulings cannot add to the terms of an act of Congress and make conduct criminal which such laws leave untouched. Waite v. Macy, \n246 U.S. 606\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 395; United States v. George, \n228 \nU.S. 14, 25\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 412; United States v. United Verde Copper Co., \n196 \nU.S. 207, 215\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 222.\n Furthermore, we must remember, in considering an act of Congress, that a construction which might render it unconstitutional is to be avoided. We said in United States v. Jin Fuey Moy, \n241 \nU.S. 394, 401\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 658, 659 (60 L. Ed. 1061, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 854):\n'A statute must be construed, if fairly posible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional, but also grave doubts upon that score.'\n\n See, also United States v. D. & H. Co., \n213 U.S. 366\n, 29 Sup. Ct. 527.\n We held in Hamilton, Collector v. Kentucky Distillery & Warehouse Co., \n251 U.S. 146\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 106, 64 L. Ed. --, decided December 15, 1919, that the war power of Congress, as applied to the situation outlined in the opinion in that case, enabled it to prohibit the sale of intoxicating liquor for beverage purposes. But the question was neither made nor decided as to whether Congress could prohibit even in time of war the manufacture and sale of non intoxicating beverages.\n An indictment must charge each and every element of an offense, Evans v. United States, \n153 \nU.S. 584, 587\n, 14 S. Sup. Ct. 934. We cannot say, as a matter of law, that a beverage containing not more than one-half of 1 per cent. of alcohol is intoxicating, and as neither indictment so charges it follows that the courts below in each of the cases correctly construed the act of Congress, and the judgments are\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","180":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNDERWOOD TYPEWRITER CO. v. CHAMBERLAIN(1920)\nNo. 215\nArgued: Decided: November 15, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 113, 114]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Arthur M. Marsh, of Bridgeport, Conn., and Arthur L. Shipman, of Hartford, Conn., for plaintiff in error.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. James E. Cooper, of New Britain, Conn., and Hugh M. Alcorn, of Hartford, Conn., for defendant in error. \n\n[254 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by the Underwood Typewriter Company, a Delaware corporation, in the superior court for the county of Hartford, Conn., to recover the amount of a tax assessed upon it by the latter state and paid under protest. The company contended that as applied to it the taxing act violated rights guaranteed by the federal Constitution. The constitutional questions involved were reserved by that court for consideration and advice by the Supreme Court of Errors. The answers to these questions being favorable to the state (94 Conn. 47, 108 Atl. 154), judgment was entered by the superior court, confirming the validity of the tax. The case comes here on writ of error to that court.\n Connecticut established in 1915 a comprehensive system of taxation, applicable alike to all foreign and domestic corporations carrying on business within the state. This system prescribes practically the only method by which such corporations are taxed, other than the general property tax to which all property located within the state, whether the owner be a resident or a nonresident, an individual or a corporation, is subject. The act divides business corporations into four classes, and the several classes are taxed by somewhat different methods. The fourth class, 'Miscellaneous Corporations,' includes, among others, manufacturing and trading companies, and with these alone are we concerned here. Upon their net income earned during the preceding year from business carried on within the state a tax of 2 per cent. is imposed annually. The amount of the net income is ascertained by reference to the income come upon which the corporation \n\n[254 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n is required to pay a tax to the United States. If the company carries on business also outside the state of Connecticut, the proportion of its net income earned from business carried on within the state is ascertained by apportionment in the following manner: The corporation is required to state in its annual return to the tax commissioner from what general source its profits are principally derived. If the company's net profits are derived principally from ownership, sale, or rental of real property, or from the sale or use of tangible personal property, the tax is imposed on such proportion of the whole net income as the fair cash value of the real and the tangible personal property within the state bears to the fair cash value of all the real and tangible personal property of the company. If the net profits of the company are derived principally from intangible property, the tax is imposed upon such proportion of the whole net income as the gross receipts within the state bear to the total gross receipts of the company. A corporation aggrieved because of a tax assessed upon it may, after paying the tax, apply for relief to the superior court for the county of Hartford. There it may show cause why it is not subject to the tax, or why the tax should have been less. If the whole tax assessed is found by the court to be proper, it enters judgment confirming the same. If the tax is found to be for any reason unauthorized in whole or in part, the court enters judgment for the company in the amount with interest which it is entitled to recover; and the state treasurer is directed to pay the same. The decision of the superior court is subject to review by the Supreme Court of Errors as in other cases. Laws of 1915, c. 292, pt. IV.  19-29; Underwood Typewriter Co. v. Chamberlain, 92 Conn. 199, 102 Atl. 600.\n The Underwood Typewriter Company is engaged in the business of manufacturing typewriters and kindred articles; in selling its product, and also certain accessories and supplies, which it purchases; and in repairing and \n\n[254 U.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n renting such machines. Its main office is in New York City. All its manufacturing is done in Connecticut. It has branch offices in other states for the sale, lease, and repair of machines and the sale of supplies, and it has one such branch office in Connecticut. All articles made by it-and some which it purchases-are stored in Connecticut until shipped direct to the branch offices, purchasers, or lessees. In its return to the tax commissioner of Connecticut, made in 1916 under the above law, the company declared that its net profits during the preceding year had been derived principally from tangible personal property; that these profits amounted to $1,336,586.13; that the fair cash value of the real estate and tangible personal property in Connecticut was $2,977,827. 67, and the fair cash value of the real estate and tangible personal property outside that state was $3,343,155.11. The proportion of the real estate and tangible personal property within the state was thus 47 per cent. The tax commissioner apportioned that percentage of the net profits, namely $629,668.50, as having been earned from the business done within the state, and assessed thereon a tax of $12,593.37, being at the rate of 2 per cent. The company, having paid the tax under protest, brought this action in the superior court for the county of Hartford to recover the whole amount.\n First. It is contended that the tax burdens interstate commerce, and hence is void, under section 8 of article 1 of the federal Constitution. Payment of the tax is not made a condition precedent to the right of the corporation to carry on business, including interstate business. Its enforcement is left to the ordinary means of collecting taxes. Saint Louis S. W. Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 364\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99; Atlantic & Pacific Telegraph Co. v. Philadelphia, 190, U. S. 160, 163, 23 Sup. Ct. 817. The statute is, therefore, not open to the objection that it compels the company to pay for the privileges of engaging in interstate commerce. A \n\n[254 U.S. 113, 120]\n\u00a0\n tax is not obnoxious to the commerce clause merely because imposed upon property used in interstate commerce, even if it takes the form of a tax for the privilege of exercising its franchise within the state. Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Adams, \n155 \nU.S. 688, 695\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 268. This tax is based upon the net profits earned within the state. That a tax measured by net profits is valid, although these profits may have been derived in part, or indeed mainly, from interstate commerce, is settled. U. S. Glue Co. v. Oak Creek, \n247 U.S. 321\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 499, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 748; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 57\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 221; compare Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 U.S. 165\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 432. Whether it be deemed a property tax or a franchise tax, it is not obnoxious to the commerce clause.\n Second. It is contended that the tax violates the Fourteenth Amendment because, directly or indirectly, it is imposed on income arising from business conducted beyond the boundaries of the state. In considering this objection we may lay on one side the question whether this is an excise tax, purporting to be measured by the income accruing from business within the state, or a direct tax upon that income; for 'this argument, upon analysis, resolves itself into a mere question of definitions, and has no legitimate bearing upon any question raised under the federal Constitution.' Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37, 55\n, 40 S. Sup. Ct. 221, 226 ( 64 L. Ed. 445). In support of its objection that business outside the state is taxed, plaintiff rests solely upon the showing that of its net profits $1,293,643.95 was received in other states and $42,942.18 in Connecticut, while under the method of apportionment of net income required by the statute 47 per cent. of its net income is attributable to operations in Connecticut. But this showing wholly fails to sustain the objection. The profits of the corporation were largely earned by a series of transactions beginning with manufacture in Connecticut and ending with sale in other states. In this it was typical of a large part of the manufacturing business conducted in the state. The legislature, in \n\n[254 U.S. 113, 121]\n\u00a0\n attempting to put upon this business its fair share of the burden of taxation, was faced with the impossibility of allocating specifically the profits earned by the processes conducted within its borders. It, therefore, adopted a method of apportionment which, for all that appears in this record, reached, and was meant to reach, only the profits earned within the state. 'The plaintiff's argument on this branch of the case,' as stated by the Supreme Court of Errors, 'carries the burden of showing that 47 per cent. of its net income is not reasonably attributable, for purposes of taxation, to the manufacture of products from the sale of which 80 per cent. of its gross earnings was derived after paying manufacturing costs.' The corporation has not even attempted to show this; and for aught that appears the percentage of net profits earned in Connecticut may have been much larger than 47 per cent. There is, consequently, nothing in this record to show that the method of apportionment adopted by the state was inherently arbitrary,1 or that its application to this corporation produced an unreasonable result.\n We have no occasion to consider whether the rule prescribed, if applied under different conditions, might be obnoxious to the Constitution. Adams Express Co. v. Ohio, \n166 \nU.S. 185, 222\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 604. Nor need we consider the contention, made on behalf of the state, that the statute is necessarily valid, because the prescribed rule of apportionment is not rigid, and provision is made for rectifying by proceedings in the superior court any injustice resulting from its application. \n\n[254 U.S. 113, 122]\n\u00a0\n Third. It is stated in the brief, doubtless inadvertently, that the assignment of errors includes the objection that the tax was void under the Fourteenth Amendment also on the ground that the company, a foreign corporation, had made large permanent investments in Connecticut before the statute of 1915 was enacted. No such error appears to have been specifically assigned, and the objection was not pressed in brief or oral argument. It is clearly unsound. To the facts presented here the principle discussed in Southern Railway Co. v. Greene, \n216 \nU.S. 400, 414\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 287, 17 Ann. Cas. 1247, has no application.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Massachusetts, 125, U. S. 530, 552, 8 Sup. Ct. 961; Pittsburg, etc., Railway Co. v.

Howard Mansfield and Franklin Grady, both of New York City, for appellee.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 148, 150]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice DAY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A suit was brought in the Court of Claims by the Holland-American Line to recover from the United States for the cost of the maintenance and medical care furnished by the United States for certain aliens brought by the plaintiff to this country on the steamers of its line which it had been required to pay.\n The petition sets forth that the United States immigration officials temporarily detained some aliens in hospitals because they were alleged to be suffering from temporary illness, or accompanied aliens who were so suffering, and subsequently permitted them to enter the country. The aliens were detained and subsequently admitted under the act of Congress known as the Immigration Act, passed February 20, 1907 (Comp. St.  4242 et seq.). It is stated that the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and the Commissioner General of Immigration, and their subordinates, claiming to act under the authority of the Immigration Act, rendered to the petitioner from month to month bills for the hospital treatment and maintenance of the aliens so detained and subsequently admitted. Certain regulations of the Commissioner General of Immigration are cited; and it is alleged that the United States officials threatened that, if the bills were not paid, thereafter all aliens so brought to this country would be held on board ship until their application for admission to the United States should be finally adjudicated. It is set forth that on all vessels arriving in the port of New York there were aliens who were temporarily detained and subsequently admitted; that detention on board ship would have delayed the sailing of petitioner's vessels from periods varying from a few days to several weeks. The threats were actually carried out, at least in one instance, and if vessels were so detained the result would have been not merely great inconvenience and financial loss to the petitioner, \n\n[254 U.S. 148, 151]\n\u00a0\n but a complete disruption of oceanic commerce in the port of New York and the United States. 'Consequently, the petitioner paid, under duress and involuntarily, the bills, when rendered.'\n It is alleged that the exaction of such payments of the petitioner, and the making of such threats were entirely without warrant of law; that the Immigration Act provides that, where a suitable building is used for the detention and examination of aliens, the immigration officials shall there take charge of such aliens and the transportation companies shall be relieved of the responsibility for their detention thereafter; that there was in the port of New York a suitable building for the detention and examination of aliens; that the Immigration Act required petitioner to pay the United States $4 for each alien entering the Unites States on its vessels; that the aliens whose hospital and maintenance expense bills were rendered to and paid by the petitioner, were detained and examined and subsequently admitted to the United States pursuant to the requirements of the Immigration Act; that special appropriations have been made for all expenses of the enforcement of the laws regulating the immigration of aliens into the United States, so that there has always been an available fund in the United States Treasury for the payment of the expenses of regulating the immigration of aliens into the United States, including the hospital bills referred to above.\n Petitioner recites disagreement, as to such charges between the Secretary of Commerce and Labor and the steamship companies transporting aliens to the United States, and sets forth that an action was brought by the United States in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the petitioner to recover hospital charges for aliens brought to the port of New York and temporarily detained and subsequently admitted. A judgment in favor of the company was \n\n[254 U.S. 148, 152]\n\u00a0\n subsequently reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and was there affirmed. See 212 Fed. 116, 128 C. C. A. 632, affirmed by an equally divided court, \n235 U.S. 686\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 203.\n It is further alleged that the exaction from the claimant of the above-mentioned hospital charges under duress was in violation of its rights and privileges secured to petitioner as a subject of the kingdom of the Netherlands under the Constitution of the United States, by the treaties between the United States and the kingdom of the Netherlands and the laws of the United States; that the amounts thus unlawfully exacted from the claimant were remitted to the Commissioner of Immigration at the port of New York as required by him.\n There being no demurrer, plea, answer, counterclaim, set-off, claim of damages, demand, or defense in the premises on the part of the United States, the Court of Claims directed a general traverse under the rules of the court, and afterwards made findings of fact, and substantially following the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, supra, held the United States liable for the payments exacted.\n As to the claim that the plaintiff had bound itself by contract to pay these charges, the court held that the claimant was coerced into making the contract by threats of the defendant which would have destroyed the plaintiff's business, if ever executed.\n The government contends that the claim thus presented was one sounding in tort, and, consequently, not within the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims, and that the petition should have been dismissed.\n The jurisdiction of the Court of Claims rests upon section 145 of the Judicial Code (Comp. St.  1136\n\n[254 U.S. 148, 1]\n\u00a0\n), re-enactment of the Tucker Act of March 3, 1887 (24 Stat. 505). The jurisdiction conferred includes:\n'All claims (except for pensions) founded upon the Constitution of the United States or any law of Congress, \n\n[254 U.S. 148, 153]\n\u00a0\n upon any regulation of an executive department, upon any contract, expressed or implied, with the government of the United States, or for damages, liquidated or unliquidated, in cases not sounding in tort, in respect of which claims the party would be entitled to redress against the United States either in a court of law, equity, or admiralty if the United States were suable.'\n\n We think that the statement of the substance of the petitioner's claim, as above set forth, shows that it rested upon payments alleged to have been made under duress because of the wrongful and tortious acts of officials of the United States government acting without authority of law in coercing the claimant to pay the sums demanded.\n In many decisions of this court it has been held that by the provisions of the Tucker Act the government did not subject itself to liability for the torts or wrongful acts of its officers. Gibbons v. United States, 8 Wall. 269; Morgan v. United States, 14 Wall. 531; Hill v. United States, \n149 U.S. 593\n, 13 Sup. Ct. 1011; Schillinger v. United States, \n155 U.S. 163\n, 15 Sup. Ct. 85; United States v. Buffalo Pitts Co., \n234 U.S. 228\n, 34 Sup. Ct. 840; Tempel v. United States, \n248 U.S. 121\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 56; Ball Engineering Co. v. White Co., \n250 U.S. 46\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 393.\n The appellee relies upon and quotes certain expressions found in the opinion delivered in Dooley v. United States, \n182 U.S. 222\n, 21 Sup. Ct. 762. In Basso v. United States, \n239 U.S. 602\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 226, suit was brought in the Court of Claims for the illegal arrest and imprisonment of the claimant upon a charge of having imported goods from the United States into Porto Rico without having made entry of the same under an act of Congress which the appellant alleged was not in force in Porto Rico. It was alleged that the court was without jurisdiction, and that therefore the trial, conviction, and sentence of imprisonment deprived him of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Constitution. The United States filed a general \n\n[254 U.S. 148, 154]\n\u00a0\n traverse of the petition, and subsequently moved to dismiss upon the ground that the court had no jurisdiction as the action sounded in tort. This motion was sustained in the Court of Claims, and an appeal taken to this court. Speaking of the contention of the appellant that the Court of Claims had jurisdiction, this court said:\n'He, however, contends that the Court of Claims has jurisdiction under the Tucker Act over claims ex delicto founded upon the Constitution of the United States. And this, he further contends, is supported by the recent decisions of this court, and relies especially upon Dooley v. United States, \n182 U.S. 222\n.\n\n'But that case did not overrule Schillinger v. United States, \n155 U.S. 163\n, which, counsel says, holds directly contrary to his contention and that he has not the ingenuity to suggest how the court can now decide the case at bar in appellant's favor without at least by implication overruling the Schillinger Case. We are not disposed to overrule the case, either directly or by implication. ...\n\n'The Dooley Case and cases subsequent to it which are relied upon by the appellant concerned the exaction of duties or taxes by the United States or its officers or property taken by the government for public purposes. In such cases jurisdiction in the Court of Claims for the recovery of the duties and taxes or for the value of the property taken was declared.\n\n'In the case at bar (assuming as true all that is charged) there was a wrong inflicted, if a wrong can be said to have been inflicted by the sentence of a court legally constituted after judgment upon issues openly framed by the opposing parties both of fact and the applicable law, whether that law was sections 2865 and 3082 of the Revised Statutes or the Constitution of the United States. But, conceding that a wrong was inflicted through these judicial forms, the case nevertheless is of different character from the Dooley \n\n[254 U.S. 148, 155]\n\u00a0\n CASE, AS WAS ALSO THE SCHILLINGER CASE. thE latter case passed uPon the jurisdiction of the Court of Claims in actions founded on tort and declared the general principle to be, based on a policy by imposed necessity, that governments are not liable (\n155 U.S. 167\n) 'for unauthorized wrongs inflicted on the citizen by their officers, though occurring while engaged in the discharge of official duties.' And it was further said (page 168): 'Congress has wisely reserved to itself the right to give or withhold relief where the claim is founded on wrongful proceedings of an officer of the government.' Gibbons v. United States, 8 Wall. 269, 275; Morgan v. United States, 14 Wall. 531, 534.'\n\n The principle, reaffirmed in the case just quoted, is applicable here, for the reason that the claim presented sounded in tort, and was in substance an action to recover for the wrongful acts of the United States officials in compelling the claimant to pay under duress and without authority of law the sums sued for. Following the well-established construction of the Tucker Act, as declared in many cases in this court, we think that the Court of Claims should have dismissed the petition because it presented a claim not within its jurisdiction. The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed, and the cause remanded to that court, with instructions to dismiss the petition.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","182":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v. NORTH AMERICAN TRANSPORTATION & TRADING CO.(1920)\nNo. 319\nArgued: April 30, 1920Decided: June 1, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 330, 331]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Burt E. Barlow and A. R. Serven, both of Washington, D. C., for North American Transportation & Trading Co.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought by the North American Transportation & Trading Company in the Court of Claims on December 7, 1906. The petitioner seeks to recover the \n\n[253 U.S. 330, 332]\n\u00a0\n value of a placer mining claim situated on the public land near Nome, Alaska, which is alleged to have been taken by the government on December 8, 1900, and also compensation for use and occupation thereof after that date. Ownership of the property by the company and the physical taking and continued possession of it by the government were not controverted. The lower court found, also, that about July 1, 1900, Gen. Randall, United States Army, commanding the Department of Alaska took possession, as a site for an army post, of a large tract of public land which included the mining claim. The company yielded possession of the part occupied by it being unable to withstand his authority, but at the same time it demanded compensation, which Gen. Randall promised would be paid. Use of the site for an army post was thereafter recommended by him to the Secretary of War. Pursuant to this recommendation, the President issued on December 8, 1908, an order by which the tract was reserved from sale and set aside for military purposes; and on December 20, 1908, the Secretary of War announced it as a public reservation, for the present under the control of the War Department. The tract has been used as an army post continuously since possession was first taken by Gen. Randall. The buildings erected thereon are situated on that portion of the land which had been the company's placer claim; so that at no time since Gen. Randall took possession of the land has the company been able to operate its claim or do any further mining work thereon.\n The government contended that, if on the facts there was a legal taking or other act entitling petitioner to recover compensation, the cause of action had accrued more than six years prior to the commencement of this suit, and that therefore under section 156 of the Judicial Code ( Comp. St.  1147) the petition should be dismissed. The Court of Claims found that the company's property was taken within the \n\n[253 U.S. 330, 333]\n\u00a0\n six years-that is, on December 8, 1900-and that its then reasonable value was $23,800. It entered judgment for that amount. 53 Ct. Cl. 424. Both parties appealed-the government, on the ground that the right of recovery, if any, was barred; the company, on the ground that no compensation was allowed for the use and occupation between the date of the taking and the date of entry of judgment.\n First. When the government, without instituting condemnation proceedings, appropriates for a public use under legislative authority private property to which it asserts no title, it impliedly promises to pay therefor. United States v. Great Falls Manufacturing Co., \n112 U.S. 645\n, 5 Sup. Ct. 306; United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 462\n, 465 S., 23 Sup. Ct. 349; United States v. Kelly, \n243 U.S. 316\n, 37 Sup. Ct. 380; United States v. Cress, \n243 \nU.S. 316, 329\n, 37 S. Sup. Ct. 380. But, although Congress may have conferred upon the Executive Department power to take land for a given purpose, the government will not be deemed to have so appropriated private property, merely because some officer thereafter takes possession of it with a view to effectuating the general purpose of Congress. See Ball Engineering Co. v. J. G. White & Co., \n250 U.S. 46\n, 54-57, 39 Sup. Ct. 393. In order that the government shall be liable it must appear that the officer who has physically taken possession of the property was duly authorized so to do, either directly by Congress or by the official upon whom Congress conferred the power.\n The Acts of March 3, 1899, c. 423, 30 Stat. 1064, 1070, and of May 26, 1900, c. 586, 31 Stat. 205, 213, making appropriations for barracks and quarters for troops, furnish sufficient authorization from Congress to take land for such purposes, so that the difficulty encountered by the claimant in Hooe v. United States, \n218 U.S. 322\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 85, does o t exist here. But the power granted by those acts was conferred upon the Secretary of War. Act Aug. 1, 1888, c. 728,  1, 25 Stat. 357 (Comp. St.  6909); Act Aug. 18, 1890, c. 797,  1, 26 Stat. 316 ( Comp. St.  6911). It was for him to determine whether \n\n[253 U.S. 330, 334]\n\u00a0\n the army post should be established and what land should be taken therefor. Compare Nahant v. United States, 136 Fed. 273, 70 C. C. A. 641, 69 L. R. A. 723; Id., 153 Fed. 520, 82 C. C. A. 470; (C. C.) United States v. Certain Lands in Narragansett, R. I., 145 Fed. 654. Power to take possession of the company's mining claim was not vested by law in Gen. Randall; and the Secretary of War had not, so far as appears, either authorized it or approved it before December 8, 1900. It was only after the President reserved from sale and set aside for military purposes the large tract of land in which the company's mining claim was included that the Secretary of War took action which may be deemed an approval or ratification of what Gen. Randall had done. What he had done before that date having been without authority, and hence tortious, created no liability on the part of the government. Higo v. United States, \n194 \nU.S. 315, 323\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 727. Since the cause of action arose after December 7, 1900, this suit was not barred by section 156 of the Judicial Code.\n The suggestion is made that, as the President's order reserved the land 'subject to any legal rights which may exist to any land within its limits,' the Secretary's action thereafter was not a taking of the mining claim. But this clause and the reference to it in the announcement made by the Secretary must, in view of the circumstances, have meant merely that the right to compensation of the company and of any others was preserved. Furthermorre, the suggestion, if sound, would not aid the government; it would result, at most, in slightly postponing the date of the legal taking. For the continued holding possession of the land after the announcement of the Secretary of War and the erection of buildings thereon by his authority was such an appropriation as would, in any event, give the right of action against the government.\n Second. The company contends that it should receive, in addition to the value of the property at the time of the taking, compensation for the occupation and use \n\n[253 U.S. 330, 335]\n\u00a0\n thereof from that date to the date of the judgment-a period of nearly 20 years, during which the company was deprived of the use of its property. This contention is based upon the decisions of many state courts that, upon the taking of private property for public uses, the owner is entitled to recover, besides its value at the time of the taking, interest thereon from the date on which he was deprived of its use to the date of payment. \n1\n In a number of cases in the lower federal courts, also, the landowner has been permitted to recover interest from the time of the taking; but in each such case a statute had provided in some form that the condemnation should be conducted according to the laws of the state in which the land was situated, and under the law of the state interest was recoverable. United States v. Engeman (D. C.) 46 Fed. 898; Town of Hingham v. United States, 161 Fed. 295, 300, 88 C. C. A. 341, 15 Ann. Cas. 105; United States v. Sargent, 162 Fed. 81, 89 C. C. A. 81; United States v. First National Bank (D. C.) 250 Fed. 299, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 36; United States v. Rogers, 257 Fed. 397, 168 C. C. A 437; United States v. Highsmith, 257 Fed. 401, 168 C. C. A. 441. These conformity provisions, which relate only to the laws of states, can have no application to lands in Alaska; nor can they affect proceedings brought in the Court of Claims.\n The right to bring this suit against the United States in the Court of Claims is not founded upon the Fifth Amendment (Schillinger v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 163, 168\n, 15 S. Sup. Ct. 85; Basso v. United States, \n239 U.S. 602\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 226), but upon the existence of an implied contract entered int by the United States ( Langford v. United States, \n101 U.S. 341\n; Bigby v. United States, \n188 U.S. 400\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 468; Tempel v. United States, \n248 \nU.S. 121, 129\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 56; United States v. Great Falls Mfg. Co., supra; United States v. Lynah, supra); and the contract which is implied is to pay the value of property as of the date of the taking (Bauman v. Ross, \n\n[253 U.S. 330, 336]\n\u00a0\n \n167 \nU.S. 548, 587\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 966; United States v. Honolulu Plantation Co., 122 Fed. 581, 585, 58 C. C. A. 279; Burt v. Merchants' Insurance Co., 115 Mass. 1, 14). Interest may not be added, because section 177 of the Judicial Code, re-enacting section 1091 of the Revised Statutes (Comp. St.  1168), declares that:\n'No interest shall be allowed on any claim up to the time of the rendition of judgment thereon by the Court of Claims, unless upon a contract expressly stipulating for the payment of interest.'\n\n See Tillson v. United States, \n100 U.S. 43\n.\n Congress, in thus denying to the court power to award interest, adopted the common-law rule that delay or default in payment (upon which, in the absence of express agreement, the right to recover interest rests), cannot be attributed to the sovereign. United States v. North Carolina, \n136 \nU.S. 211, 216\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 920. That rule had theretofore been uniformly applied in our executive departments except where statutes provided otherwise. United States v. Sherman, \n98 U.S. 565\n, 567-568. So rigorously is the rule applied that, in the adjustment of mutual claims between an individual and the government, the latter has been held entitled to interest on its credits although relieved from the payment of interest on the charges against it. United States v. Verdier, \n164 \nU.S. 213, 218\n, 219 S., 17 Sup. Ct. 42. This denial of interest, like the refusal to tax costs against the United States in favor of the prevailing party (Stanley v. Schwalby, \n162 \nU.S. 255, 272\n, 16 S. Sup. Ct. 754; Pine River Logging Co. v. United States, \n186 \nU.S. 279, 296\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 920), and the refusal to hold the United States liable for torts committed by its officers and agents in the ordinary course of business (Crozier v. Krupp, \n224 U.S. 290\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 488), are hardships from which, with rate exceptions (William Cramp & Sons, etc., v. Curtis Turbine Co., \n246 U.S. 28\n, 40-41, 38 Sup. Ct. 271), Congress has been unwilling to relieve those who either voluntarily deal with the government or are otherwise affected by its acts.\n The company argues that interest is allowed in condemnation proceedings, not qua interest for default or \n\n[253 U.S. 330, 337]\n\u00a0\n delay in paying the value, but as the measure of compensation for the use and occupation during the period which precedes the passing of the title ( see Klages v. Terminal Co., 160 Pa. 386, 28 Atl. 862), and that collection of an amount, measured by interest, is not prohibited either by the statute limiting the powers of the Court of Claims or by the common-law rule which exempts the sovereign from liability to pay interest (United States v. New York, \n160 \nU.S. 598, 622\n, 10 S. Sup. Ct. 402). This may be the theory on which interest should be allowed in compensation proceedings;2 and it may be that, even in the absence of the conformity provision referred to above, interest could be collected as a part of the just compensation in condemnation proceedings brought by the government. For, as suggested in United States v. Sargent, supra, such a proceeding is not a suit by the landowner to collect a claim against the United States, but an adversary proceeding in which the owner is the defendant and which the government institutes in order to secure title to land. Mason City & Ft. Dodge R. R. Co. v. Boynton, \n204 U.S. 570\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 321. On the other hand, this suit brought in the Court of Claims is a very different proceeding. It is a action of contract to recover money which the United States is assumed to have promised to pay; and the assumed promise was to pay the value at the time of the taking. The suit is in effect an action on two counts-one for the value of the mining claim; the other for use and occupation after December 8, 1900, at the rate of $7,500 per year. If the company had brought the suit immediately after the taking, it clearly could not have recovered any amount for use and occupation; for a plaintiff suing in contract \n\n[253 U.S. 330, 338]\n\u00a0\n can recover only on a cause of action existing at the time the suit was brought. The loss to the company of the use of $23,800, which is found to be the value of the mining claim when it was taken nearly 20 years ago, must be deemed to be due in part to its delay in instituting the suit, and in part to the delays of litigation, for which it may have been largely responsible. But as, in either event, the loss of the use of the money results from the failure to collect sooner a claim held to have accrued when the company's property was taken, that which the company seeks to recover is, in substance, interest, and that Congress has denied to the Court of Claims power to allow.\n Furthermore, if it is not interest which the company seeks, the facts found fail to supply the basis on which any claim in addition to that for the value of the property should rest. The petition states that the United States is indebted to claimant in addition to the $100,000, alleged to be the value of the property, the further sum of $7,500 per annum for the use and occupancy thereof from December 8, 1900. Except for this allegation, the company did not, so far as appears, make any request of any kind in the court below in respect to an allowance for use and occupation. The court does not mention the subject in the opinion and it is not referred to in the application for an appeal.\n In Shoemaker v. United States, \n147 \nU.S. 282, 321\n, 13 S. Sup. Ct. 361, and Bauman v. Ross, \n167 \nU.S. 548, 598\n, 17 S. Sup. Ct. 966, to which both counsel refer, the point here decided was not involved, since the court held that under the express terms of the acts there in question the United States were not entitled to possession of the land until the damages had been assessed and actually paid.\n The judgment below is\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See cases collected in 15 Cyc. pp. 930, 931, and in 10 R.

NORTHERN FIRE & MARINE INS CO.(1920)\nNo. 96\nArgued: Decided: December 13, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 348, 349]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Rome G. Brown, of Minneapolis, Minn., for Vallely.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n Mr. N. C. Young, of Fargo, N. D., for Insurance Co.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Insurance Company was adjudged an involuntary bankrupt May 3, 1917, upon petition of its creditors. The petition averred the corporate capacity of the company under the laws of North Dakota, and that it had been 'engaged in the business of insuring property against loss by fire, hail,' etc. Process was duly issued and served, and the company making default, an order of adjudication was entered against it. No appeal was taken from the order. The administration of the estate proceeded in due course, claims presented, assets collected and reduced to money, payments made to protect equities, and suits brought by the trustee in his official capacity. In the matters of the estate the trustee frequently conferred with the president and secretary of the bankrupt and received from them co- operation, assistance and information without question of the validity of the adjudication. Considerable moneys were paid out and expenses incurred by the trustee.\n After the above course of administration, and on December 18, 1917, the company by its attorneys filed a motion in the District Court to vacate the adjudication as null and void, and to dismiss the proceedings, upon the ground that it appeared that the company was an insurance \n\n[254 U.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n corporation and that the court was, therefore, without jurisdiction. The motion was sustained and an order entered vacating the adjudication and dismissing the petition of the creditors on authority of section 4b of the Bankruptcy Act as amended by the Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 839 [Comp. St.  9588]), which provides that--\n'Any moneyed, business, or commercial corporation, except a municipal, railroad, insurance, or banking corporation ... may be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt upon default or an impartial trial, and shall be subject to the provisions and entitled to the benefits of this act.'\n\n The trustee filed a petition to revise the order of the District Court in a matter of law in the Circuit Court of Appeals, and the latter court certifies that it is indispensable to the determination of the case, and to the end that the court may properly discharge its duty, desires instruction upon the following questions:\n'1. Is a petition to revise in matter of law under section 24b of the Bankruptcy Act the proper remedy to review an order of an inferior court of bankruptcy vacating an adjudication and dismissing the bankruptcy proceeding for want of jurisdiction upon the motion of the bankrupt after the expiration of the time for appeal, he having neither contested the involuntary petition against him nor appealing from the adjudication?\n\n'2. Where it appears from the averments of a petition in involuntary bankruptcy that the person proceeded against is an insurance corporation and therefore within the exceptions of section 4b of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 839), is there such an absence of jurisdiction in the court of bankruptcy that its adjudication, rendered upon due service of process and default, and not appealed from, should be vacated and the proceeding be dismissed upon the motion of the bankrupt after the time for appeal has expired?\n\n'3. Where an insurance corporation adjudged bankrupt \n\n[254 U.S. 348, 353]\n\u00a0\n in an involuntary proceeding after the passage of the amendatory Act of June 25, 1910 (36 Stat. 839), upon due service of process and default, does not appeal from the adjudication, but acquiesces therein and aids the trustee in the performance of his duties in administering the estate, may it be estopped from thereafter questioning the validity of the adjudication and the power of the court and the trustee to proceed?'\n\n Of the construction of the statute there can be no controversy; what answer shall be made to the questions turns on other considerations, turns on the effect of the conduct of the company as an estoppel. That it has such effect is contended by the trustee, and there is an express concession that if objection had been made the company would have been entitled to a dismissal of the petition. It is, however, insisted that it is settled 'that an erroneous adjudication against an exempt corporation, whether made by default or upon a contest or trial before the bankruptcy court, can be attacked only by appeal, writ of error, or prompt motion to vacate,' and that section 4 does not relate to the jurisdiction of the court over the subject-matter. 'It does not, therefore,' is the further contention, 'create or limit jurisdiction of the court with respect to its power to consider and pass upon the merits of the petition,' and that 'the valid exercise of jurisdiction does not depend upon the correctness of the decision.' And again, if the court in the exercise of its jurisdictional power, 'reached a wrong conclusion, the judgment is not void, it is merely error to be corrected on appeal or by motion to vacate, timely made, but as long as it stands it is binding on every one.' There is plausibility in the propositions taken in their generality, but there are opposing ones. Courts are constituted by authority and they cannot beyond the power delegated to them. If they act beyond that authority, and certainly in contravention of it, their judgments and orders are regarded as nullities. They are \n\n[254 U.S. 348, 354]\n\u00a0\n not voidable, but simply void, and this even prior to reversal. Elliott v. Peirsol, 1 Pet. 328, 340; Old Wayne Life Ass'n v. McDonough, \n204 U.S. 8\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 236.\n Which of the propositions shall prevail in a given case connot be dogmatically asserted, and cases of their consideration and application can be cited against each other. There is such citation in the pending case. Plaintiff in error cites, among others, McCormick v. Sullivant, 10 Wheat. 192; Des Moines Navigation Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., \n123 U.S. 552\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 217; First National Bank v. Klug, \n186 U.S. 202\n, 22 Sup. Ct. 899\n\n\n McCormick v. Sullivant involved the effect of diversity of citizenship, and it was decided that an absence of its allegation did not impeach the judgment rendered in the case and preclude its being conclusive upon the parties. And it was said (as it has often been said) that the courts of the United States are 'of limited jurisdiction, but not inferior courts, in the technical sense of those words, whose judgments taken alone, are to be disregarded. If the jurisdiction be not alleged in the proceedings, their judgments and decrees are erroneous, and may, upon writ of error, or appeal, be reversed for that cause. But they are not absolute nullities.'\n In Des Moines Navigation Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., \n123 U.S. 552\n, 8 Sup. Ct. 217, there came up to be considered also the effect of a prior adjudication as dependent upon an allegation of diversity of citizenship, and the ruling in McCormack v. Sullivant was affirmed.\n The immediate comment on these cases is that the courts had jurisdiction of their subject-matter and necessarily power to pass upon the fact (diversity of citizenship) upon which that jurisdiction depended in the given case. The subject-matter of the suit was not withheld from them by explicit provision of the law which was their sole warrant of power.\n First National Bank v. Klug is nearer to the \n\n[254 U.S. 348, 355]\n\u00a0\n question in the case at bar. It was a case in bankruptcy. The Act of July 1, 1898 (30 Stat. 544), provided that 'any natural person, except a wage- earner or a person engaged chiefly in farming or the tillage of the soil' might 'be adjudged an involuntary bankrupt upon default or an impartial trial' and should 'be subject to the provisions and entitled to the benefits' of the act.\n A petition in involuntary bankruptcy was filed against Klug and a trial was had upon the issue, whether he was 'engaged chiefly in farming' within the meaning of the act, and the jury having found accordingly, the District Court entered a judgment dismissing the petition. The question of the jurisdiction was certified to this court and it was held that the 'District Court had and exercised jurisdiction.' This further was said:\n'The conclusion was, it is true, that Klug could not be adjudged a bankrupt, but the court had jurisdiction to so determine, and its jurisdiction over the subject-matter was not and could not be questioned'-citing Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 \nU.S. 15, 25\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 269; Smith v. McKay, \n161 U.S. 355\n, 16 Sup. Ct. 490.\n\n It will be observed, therefore, that the act of 1898, made jurisdiction depend upon an inquiry of fact and necessarily jurisdiction was conferred to make the inquiry, and pronounce judgment according to its result. The case, therefore, is not pertinent to, or authority upon, the case at bar. The Act of June 25, 1910, which covers the present proceeding is peremptory in its prohibition. It excludes, by section 4, insurance corporations from the benefits of voluntary bankruptcy, and by subdivision 'b' prohibits them from being adjudged involuntary bankrupts. The effect of these provisions is that there is no statute of bankruptcy as to the excepted corporations, and necessarily there is no power in the District Court to include them. In other words, the policy of the law is to leave the relation and remedies of 'municipal, railroad, insurance, \n\n[254 U.S. 348, 356]\n\u00a0\n or banking' corporations to their creditors and their creditors to them, to other provisions of law. It is easy to see in what disorder a different policy would result. We may use for illustration a municipal corporation. Its creditors may be enterprising, its officers acquiescent or indifferent. Can, threfore, the allegations of the former and the default of the latter confer jurisdiction on the District Court to entertain a petition in bankruptcy against the corporation and render a decree therein, and, if not, why not? If consent can confirm jurisdiction, why not initially confer jurisdiction? It is not necessary to point out the disorder that would hence result and the difficulties that the officers of a bankrupt court would encounter in such situation. The legislative power thought care against the possibility of it was necessary, and in that care associated insurance corporations. For a court to extend the act to corporations of either kind is to enact a law, not to execute one.\n The first question concerns procedure only, and should be answered in the affirmative. First National Bank v. Klug, supra; Matter of Loving, \n224 U.S. 183\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 446.\n The second and third questions concern the merits and are respectively answered in the affirmative and negative.\n So ordered. \n\n\n\n","184":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALLACE v. HINES(1920)\nNo. 683\nArgued: April 21, 1920Decided: May 3, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[253 U.S. 66, 67]\n\u00a0\n Mr. F. E. Packard, of Bismarck, N. D., for appellants.\n Mr. E. Marvin Underwood, of Washington, D.C., for appellee Hines.\n Mr. Charles W. Bunn, of St. Paul, Minn., for appellees railway companies.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from an order of three judges restraining the defendants, the appellants, from taking steps to enforce taxes imposed by an act of North Dakota, approved March 7, 1919, (c. 222,) until the further order of the Court. The plaintiff railroads are corporations of other States with lines extending into North Dakota. The defendants are the State Tax Commissioner, the State Treasurer, the State Auditor, the Attorney General and the Secretary of State for North Dakota. As the tax is made a first lien upon all the property of the plaintiff railroads in the State and thus puts a cloud upon their title, and as delay in payment is visited with considerable penalties, there is jurisdiction in equity unless there is an adequate remedy at law against the State, to which the tax is to be paid. Shaffer v. Carter (March 1, 1920) \n252 U.S. 37\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 221; Gaar, Scott & Co. v. Shannon, \n223 \nU.S. 468, 472\n, 32 S. Sup. Ct. 236. The only ground for supposing that there is such a remedy is a provision that 'an action respecting the title to property, or arising upon contract may be brought in the district court against the \n\n[253 U.S. 66, 68]\n\u00a0\n State the same as against a private person.' Compiled Laws, N. D. 1913,  8175. This case does not arie upon contract except in the purely artificial sense that some claims for money alleged to have been obtained wrongfully might have been enforced at common law by an action of assumpsit. Nothing could be more remote from an actual contract than the wrongful extortion of money by threats, and we ought not to leave the plaintiffs to a speculation upon what the State Court might say if an action at law were brought. Union Pacific R. R. Co. v. Weld County, \n247 U.S. 282\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 510\n\n\n We quote the tax law in full. \n1\n It will be seen that it \n\n[253 U.S. 66, 69]\n\u00a0\n purports to be a special excise tax upon doing business in the State. As the law is administered, the tax commissioner fixes the value of the total property of each railroad by the total value of its stocks and bonds and assesses the proportion of this value that the main track mileage in North Dakota bears to the main track of the whole line. But on the allegations of the bill which is all that we have before us, the circumstances are such as to make that mode of assessment indefensible. North Dakota is a State of plains, very different from the other States, and the cost of the roads there was much less than it was in mountainous regions that the roads had to traverse. The State is mainly agricultural. Its markets are outside its boundaries and most of the distributing centers from which it purchases also are outside. It naturally follows that the great and very valuable terminals of the roads are in other States. So looking only to the physical track the injustice of assuming the value to be evenly distributed according to main track mileage is plain. But that is not all.\n The only reason for allowing a State to look beyond its borders when it taxes the property of foreign corporations is that it may get the true value of the things within it, when they are part of an organic system of wide extent, that gives them a value above what they otherwise would possess. The purpose is not to expose the heel of the system to a mortal dart-not, in other words, to open to taxation what is not within the State. Therefore no property of such an interstate road situated elsewhere can be taken into account unless it can be seen in some plain and fairly intelligible way that it adds to the value of the road and the rights exercised in the State. Hence the \n\n[253 U.S. 66, 70]\n\u00a0\n possession of bonds secured by mortgage of lands in other States, or of a land-grant in another State or of other property that adds to the riches of the corporation but does not affect the North Dakota part of the road is no sufficient ground for the increase of the tax-whatever it may be- whether a tax on property, or, as here, an excise upon doing business in the State. St. Louis Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Arkansas, \n235 \nU.S. 350, 364\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 99. In this case, it is alleged, the tax commissioner's valuation included items of the kind described to very large amounts. The foregoing considerations justify the preliminary injunction that was granted against what would appear to be an unwarranted interference with interstate commerce and a taking of property without due process of law. Fargo v. Hart, \n193 U.S. 490\n, 24 Sup. Ct. 498; Union Tank Line Co. v. Wright, \n249 \nU.S. 275, 282\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 276.\n The Attorney General of the State in his very candid argument suggested that if the mode adopted by the tax commissioner were open to objections the statute might be construed to give him an election as to the method of distribution, and that he should take gross earnings, or, if more easily ascertainable, the property or mileage basis of distribution. As we are dealing only with a preliminary injunction we confine our consideration to a general view of the mode actually followed, and upon that we are of opinion that the decree should be affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] (2) Every corporation, joint-stock company or association, now or hereafter organized under the law of any other state, the United States or a fr eign country, and engaged in business in the state during the previous calendar year, shall pay annually a special excise tax with respect to the carrying on or doing business in the state by such corporation, joint-stock company or association, equivalent to 50 cents for each $1,000.00 of the capital actually invested in the transaction of business in the state: Provided, that in the case of a corporation engaged in business partly within and partly without the state, investment within the state shall be held to mean that proportion of its entire stock and bond issues which its business within the state bears to its total business within and without the state, and where such business within the state is not otherwise more easily and certainly separable from such entire business within and without the state, business within the state shall be held to mean such proportion of the entire business within and without the state, as the property of such corporation within the state bears to its entire property employed in such business both within and without the state; provided, that in the case of a railroad, telephone, telegraph, car or freight-line, express company or other common carrier, or a gas, light, power or heating company, having lines that enter into, extend out of or across the state, property within the state shall be held to mean that proportion of the entire property of such corporation engaged in such business which its mileage within the state bears to its entire mileage within and without the state. The amount of such annual tax shall in all cases be computed on the basis of the average amount of capital so invested during the preceding calendar year: Provided, that for the purpose of this tax an exemption of $10,000.00 from the amount of capital invested in the state shall be allowed: Provided, further, that this exemption shall be allowed only if such corporation, joint-stock company or association furnish to the Tax Commissioner all the information necessary to its computation. \n\n\n\n\n","185":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWALLS v. MIDLAND CARBON CO.(1920)\nNo. 219\nArgued: October 13, 1920Decided: December 13, 1920\n\n\n\n\n[254 U.S. 300, 301]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry E. Lutz, of Denver, Colo., for appellants.\n Messrs. John W. Lacey, of Cheyenne, Wyo., and Reid L. Carr, or New York City, for appellees.\n\n\n[254 U.S. 300, 309]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The complainants are corporations of Delaware and have their places of business in that state.\n The defendants are officers of Wyoming, being respectively, its Attorney General, prosecuting officer of Big Horn county, and the Governor of the state.\n It is alleged that jurisdiction of the District Court depends upon diversity of citizenship and the Constitution of the United States; the Constitution being violated by an act of the Legislature of the state. Chapter 125 of the Session Laws of 1919\n\n\n The object of the suit is to restrain defendants, and each of them, from enforcing or attempting to enforce the legislation.\n It is declared by the act, which is attacked, that its purpose is 'the conservation of natural gas.' The first section is as follows:\n'The use, consumption or burning of natural gas taken or drawn from any natural gas well or wells, or borings from which natural gas is produced for the products where such natural gas is burned, consumed or otherwise wasted without the heat therein contained being fully and actually applied and utilized for other manufacturing purposes or domestic purposes is hereby declared to be a wasteful and extravagant use of natural gas and shall be unlawful when such gas well or source of supply is located within ten miles of any incorporated town or industrial plant.'\n\n Section 2 prohibits the use, sale, or other distribution of \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 310]\n\u00a0\n natural gas, the product of any well owned, leased, or managed by any person for the purpose of manufacturing or producing carbon or other resultant products from the burning or consumption of such gas, without the heat therein being fully and actually utilized for other manufacturing purposes or domestic purposes. Violations are made misdemeanors.\n The grounds of contention against the act are set forth in very voluminous pleadings, supplemented by a number of affidavits. But only a brief summary of them is necessary to present the question involved, which is, stated broadly, that the act transcends the police power of the state, its purpose and effect being not to regulate and conserve natural gas, but to prohibit its use, and make a discrimination between owners having equal rights, and thereby violates article 1,  10, of the Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment thereof.\n Prior to the enactment of the statute, the Midland Company had erected a factory for the manufacture of carbon black, which factory is located about 1 1\/2 miles from the town of Cowley, Big Horn county, at an expenditure of $375,000. It is equipped for the manufacture of such carbon black, and can be used for no other purpose, and there is produced from it approximately 13,000 pounds of that article daily, which is sufficient for the manufacture of 117,000 pounds of printing ink. From the gas consumed to make the carbon black, there is first extracted approximately 1,600 gallons per day of high-gravity gasoline.\n The uses of carbon black are enumerated, and it is alleged that no form of it possessing the same properties and the wide variety of uses can be commercially manufactured from any material or substance other than natural gas.\n The origin of the industry and the uses of its product are variously detailed, and it is alleged that the company's \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 311]\n\u00a0\n factory is so conducted as to permit no waste, that the best known processes and appliances are employed, and that the operation of the gasoline absorption plant and the recovery of gasoline from the gas supplied by the wells would be impossible if the carbon plant should cease to be operated, for the reason that the gas cannot be sold to other users in that locality in sufficient quantities to render the extraction of gasoline therefrom commercially profitable.\n The Occidental Oil & Gas Company owns the land upon which are located the gas wells constituting the principal source of supply to the plant and carbon factory of the Midland Company. It, the Occidental Oil & Gas Company, also constructed, owns, and operates the pipe line by which the gas is conveyed to the factory, and delivers it to the factory, receiving from the Eastern Fuel Company, which owns and operates the gasoline extraction plant, a royalty of one-half of the gasoline extracted therefrom. The Oil Company also owns mineral leases covering 1,200 acres of proved gas territory within 10 miles of Cowley. Its business is an integral and inseparable part of that of the Midland Carbon Company, and all of its investments have been made in view of the carbon business.\n In the construction of its pipe line it expended $65,000, and in the purchase of lands upon which the wells are located, a sum exceeding $30, 000. Other gas lands are alleged to have been purchased and leased prior to the enactment of the law.\n There are other allegations asserting the use of the gas and its products, and that such use is not a waste of the gas. Various ways in which the law violates complainants' rights under the Constitution of the United States are detailed; that under the guise of regulation the restrictions of the act are so framed as to abolish, ruin, and destroy complainants' business, while leaving it open to others to engage in carbon manufacture, without saving the gasoline; \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 312]\n\u00a0\n that the penalties imposed by the act are harsh, unreasonable, and confiscatory; and that a dispute of its legality would impose a penalty of $ 1,000 for each separate daily violation of it. Other injuries are alleged.\n As already said, affidavits made by representatives of various trades and industries, displaying the qualities of carbon black and its uses, are attached to the bill. Other affidavits express the detriment, in the opinion of the affiants, of any restriction or regulation of the production of it; and others, from asserted experts, exhibit the source of the gas and the process of manufacture from it of carbon black, and that in its manufacture heat is necessarily evolved, but that as soon as any attempt is made to transform the heat into any other form of energy, such as light or mechanical power, an enormous, but inevitable, loss of heat results.\n An injunction is prayed, interlocutory and permanent, restraining defendants from enforcing the act.\n Upon the bill (it is verified), exhibits, and affidavits, it was ordered that the application for interlocutory injunction be heard by three judges, and that in the meanwhile a temporary restraining order be granted, upon filing a bond in the sum of $1,000.\n The answer, in its admissions, denials, and independent averments, asserts waste of the gas by complainants' gas factory and processes, the depletion of the wells and their product, from which it is estimated that within three years all of the wells will have been utterly and completely depleted, and the depletion will relate, not only to the wells furnishing gas for the manufacture of carbon black, but will likewise relate to the entire region and vicinity.\n And it is alleged that by preventing the use of the gas for the manufacture of carbon black, the towns of Lovell and Cowley and all industrial plants therein will be afforded a supply of gas for all domestic and industrial purposes for a period of 30 years. \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 313]\n\u00a0\n The vice attributed to the act by complainants is denied, and a benefit and virtue asserted for it.\n It is prayed that the bill be dismissed, and the restraining order be dissolved. The answer is verified.\n A motion to dissolve the temporary restraining order was made, which was supported by affidavits, and opposed by others.\n The affidavits are too long to quote. Those on the part of defendants represent the interest of the city of Lovell and other towns, and the necessity to their industries, if there are to be any, of a natural gas from the wells with which this case is concerned, and represent a depletion of the gas supply by the use made of the gas by complainants. Figures are given. Particulars are stated in one affidavit, and for a review of what are deemed the important tests and elements of judgment of the conditions which existed and would succeed the present practice it is said:\n'In conclusion, assuming that the present consumption of gas from this sand is 15,000,000 cubic feet per day (as I have been reliably informed), and that the decrease in pressure for the last year has been 150 pounds, and knowing that the present pressure is approximately 200 pounds, it is a simple problem in mathematics to ascertain the future life of the field. In other words, at the present rate of decrease in pressure, the field will be exhausted in 16 months, and there will be no pressure to force the gas out of the sand. On the same basis of reasoning there are approximately 1,200, 000,000 cubic feet left in the sand, and the present consumption is 5, 500,000,000 cubic feet per year.'\n\n The court sustained the application for temporary injunction.\n The question in the case is, as we have said, whether the legislation of Wyoming is a valid exercise of the police power of the state, and brings into comparison the limits of the power as against the asserted rights of property, \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 314]\n\u00a0\n whether it, the legislation, is a legal conservation of the natural resources of the state, or an arbitrary interference with private rights. Contentions of this kind have been before this court in other cases, and their discussions and decisions have materiality here. We mean, not discussions or decisions on the police power in the abstract or generality, but discussions and decisions involving conditions and principles pertinent to the present case.\n It will be observed that the act under review does not prohibit the use of natural gas absolutely. It prohibits, or to use its words, declares it to be a 'wasteful and extravagant use of the gas when it is burned or consumed without the heat therein contained being fully and actually applied and utilized for either manufacturing or domestic purposes.' But not even that unlimitedly, but only when the 'gas well or source of supply is located within 10 miles of any incorporated town or industrial plant.' Such is the prohibition upon the user or consumer. There is a prohibition upon the owner or lessee of wells within the designated distance from a town or industrial plant to sell or dispose of the gas, except under the specified conditions, 'for the purpose of manufacturing carbon or other resultant products.'\n There are two elements, therefore, to be considered: (1) The distance of the wells from an incorporated town or industrial plant; (2) the element of heat utilization for manufacturing or domestic purposes. These elements are the determining ones in the accusations against the law. The first is the basis of the discrimination charged against it; the second is the basis of the charge that the law deprives the companies of their property by the ruin of their business and capital investments, and impairs the obligations of pre-existing contracts.\n In Bacon v. Walker, \n204 U.S. 314\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 290, a statute of Idaho was considered which made it unlawful, with consequent liability to damages, 'for any person owning or having \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 315]\n\u00a0\n charge of sheep to herd the same, or permit them to be herded on the land or possessory claims of other persons, or to herd the same or permit them to graze within two miles of the dwelling house of the owner or owners of said possessory claim.' The statute was sustained as a lawful exercise of the police power of the state against the assertion of the right of one citizen to use the public domain as much as another citizen, and that to impose damages upon him for the exercise of the right deprived him of his property without due process of law, and besides arbitrarily discriminated between sheep grazing and the grazing of other kinds of stock. We there said in substance that, the power of regulation existing, the imposition of some limit to a right, when its exercise would impinge upon the equal right of another, was the exercise of legislative power, and that the circumstances which induced it could not be pronounced illegal 'on surmise or on the barren letter of the statute.' And we said, further, that where equal rights existed the state has an interest in their accommodation. Pertinent cases were cited, and the exclusion from grazing within two miles of the possessory claim of another was decided to be legal, that 'the selection of some limit is a legislative power,' and that it was 'only against the abuse of the power, if at all, that the courts could interpose.' The mere distance expressed nothing.\n The case, and those it cites, are authority for the position that a state may consider the relation of rights and accommodate their coexistence, and, in the interest of the community, limit one that others may be enjoyed. Of this Ohio Oil Co. v. Indiana, \n177 U.S. 190\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 576, is especially illustrative and pertinent, and conducts naturally to the consideration of the second proposition; that is, to the element of heat utilization.\n The suit was by the state, and was based upon a statute which was directed against and prohibited one having \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 316]\n\u00a0\n possession or control of any natural gas or oil well to permit the flow of gas or oil from any such well to escape into the open air for a longer period than two days after the gas or oil had been struck. From the standpoint of the law, to do so was a waste of gas. A right against the statute was set up, based upon the asserted or implied postulate that the owner of the land owned all beneath the surface and all that could be brought to the surface within the lines of the land. The postulate was rejected, upon the ground of the nature of the gas, the capability of its flow from place to place, the common right to domestic and industrial use of it, and the power of the state to regulate and conserve such right.\n The Oil Company contended, as owner of the land (it was the lessee) and producer of the oil, that it had expended many thousands of dollars in purchasing and equipping machinery for the sole purpose of raising and producing oil, it not being engaged in producing or transporting natural gas, and that it used the gas as 'power, force, and agency' to raise the oil to the surface of the ground, and that such was 'the usual, natural, and ordinary method of saving oil in such cases,' and, further, that no machinery or process of any kind had been devised by which the oil could be produced and saved otherwise, and by forbidding it, the company's business would be destroyed and the state deprived of the use and profits of the oil which was of vastly more value than the gas, and it was asserted that no more gas was permitted to escape than was consistent with the due operation of the well with the highest skill. It was hence urged against the act that it deprived of property without due process of law and denied to the Oil Company the equal protection of the laws. The answer was adjudged by the Supreme Court of the state not to constitute a defense. The adjudication was sustained by this court. We said, citing a case, 'possession of the land is not necessarily possession \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 317]\n\u00a0\n of the gas,' and again, on the authority of cases, 'that the property of the owner of lands in oil and gas is not absolute until it is actually in his grasp, and brought to the surface.' It was decided, however, that before that event occurs, indeed in prevention of it, the state may interpose its power to prevent a waste or disproportionate use of either oil or gas by a particular owner, in order to conserve the equal right of other owners and advance the public interest; and in support of this power of regulation a similarity between natural gas and other subsurface minerals was rejected. 'True it is,' it was said, 'oil and gas, like other minerals, are situated beneath the surface of the earth; but, except for this point of similarity, in many other respects they greatly differ. They have no fixed situs under a particular portion of the earth's surface within the area where they obtain. They have the power, as it were, of self-transmission.' Necessarily, therefore, it was adjudged that their use by one owner of the surface affected the use of other owners, and an excessive use by one diminished the use by others, and a similarity of other minerals, as we have seen, was rejected, and the analogy between oil and gas and animals ferae naturae was declared. It was hence decided that the power of the state 'can be manifested for the purpose of protecting all the collective owners, by securing a just distribution to arise from the enjoyment by them of their privilege to reduce to possession, and to reach the like end by preventing waste.'\n To the contention that oil could not be taken at a profit by one who made no use of the gas, it was replied that such fact 'went, not to the power to make regulations, but to their wisdom.' And this can be said of the contention, in the case at bar, that one element is more valuable than another; that carbon black is more valuable than the gas from which it is extracted.\n It will be observed that the basic principle of the Indiana statute is the same as the basic principle of the \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 318]\n\u00a0\n Wyoming statute; that is, the power of regulation dependent upon the natures of oil and gas, and that the absolute dominion of the surface of the land is not an unlimited dominion over them.\n The case was cited in Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 U.S. 61\n, 31 Sup. Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160, to defeat a suit brought to restrain the officers of the state of New York from enforcing against the gas company a staute which made it unlawful to pump from wells or otherwise draw by artificial appliances that class of mineral waters holding in solution carbonic acid gas, or producing an unnatural flow of such gas 'for the purpose of extracting, collecting, compressing, liquefying, or vending such gas as a commodity otherwise than in conjunction with the mineral water and the other mineral ingredients with which it was associated.'\n The company alleged that the gas could be lifted to the surface only by means of pumps or other artificial appliances, and that many other landowners in Saratoga Springs had like wells which were operated in a like way with a like purpose. The utility of the gas was alleged, and a property right asserted, which the statute, it was further alleged, deprived of, in violation of the Constitution of the United States.\n A demurrer was sustained to the bill; therefore its averments were admitted. The basis of the contention of the offense of the statute against the Constitution of the United States explicitly was that the company, being the owner of the land owned, had power and authority over all beneath the land's surface that it could reduce to possession. This was the same postulate, it will be observed, that was asserted in Oil Co. v. Indiana. It was rejected upon the authority of that case. We, however, said: 'Were the question an open one, we should still solve it in the same way.'\n May the principle and its justification be extended to the Wyoming statute? The statute of Wyoming (we \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 319]\n\u00a0\n repeat it to have it immediately before our eyes) declares it to be a 'wasteful and extravagant use of natural gas' to use, consume, or burn it when taken or drawn from any gas well or wells or borings 'for the products, where such natural gas is burned without the heat therein contained being fully and actually applied and utilized for other manufacturing purposes or domestic purposes.' The declaration of illegality, however, only applies when the 'gas or source of supply is located within 10 miles of any incorporated town or industrial plant.' Section 2 explicitly mentions carbon black as within the illegality of the law, and as this case concerns its production we may accept its production as a test of the companies' case.\n Of the range of the utility of carbon black there can be no controversy, and to this fact the companies give an especial emphasis in their averments, supplementary affidavits, and argument. The fact, however, is but of incidental importance. The determining consideration is the power of the state over, and its regulation of, a property in which others besides the companies may have rights, and in which the state has an interest to adjust and preserve; natural gas being one of the resources of the state. And in this consideration it is more important to consider, not for what a particular owner uses the gas, but the proportion of his use to that of others, or, it may be, the prevention of use by others; and the striking fact is presented by the companies' averments that by the processes and devices employed by them there is only obtained from each 1, 000 cubic feet of natural gas consumed 1 3\/4 pounds of carbon black and two-tenths of a gallon of high-gravity gasoline. To this averment the defendants add that every 1,000 cubic feet of gas contains from 33 to 40 pounds of carbon, and therefore 'that the inefficiency of the process used by the complainants is very high, ranging only from 2.8 per cent. to 4.6 per cent.' It is the further assertion \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 320]\n\u00a0\n of defendants that the companies are utilizing and withdrawing from the earth gas at the rate of approximately 10,000,000 cubic feet per day and that the same can never be replaced or restored.\n To these averments we may add the affidavits. There is something in them, but not enough to reduce the importance of the facts averred. Those on the part of the companies are directed to a great extent to the value of carbon black and its use, and the detriment or disaster of the discontinuance or even reduction of its manufacture; and the explicit assertion is that it is absolutely impossible to utilize the heat generated as an incident to its manufacture. A comparison is made with other fuels, and the affidavits are explicit in statement that the requirement that the heat contained in them must be 'fully and actually applied and utilized' (to use the words of the Wyoming statute) is not only unreasonable, but impossible. Figures are given, not only of gas engines, but of oil, air, and steam engines. This is dwelt on at great length, and it is declared that it is absolutely impossible to utilize heat generated as an incident to the manufacture of carbon black; and it is said:\n'If the true test of the waste of gas or any other fuel is whether or not the heat therein contained is fully utilized, it would follow that practically every industrial use of fuel must be characterized as wasteful.'\n\n There is also testimony, from those familiar with the geological formations and the production of natural gas in Wyoming, that there are very extensive deposits underlying 10 counties, and that their development has scarcely more than commenced, and that their potential capacity far exceeds the capacity of the wells now drilled. Further, that the aggregate capacity of the existing wells exceeds 650,000,000 cubic feet per day, and that this production could be largely augmented, if the demands for natural gas in the state warranted. \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 321]\n\u00a0\n Opposing affidavits set forth the needs of the towns, present and prospective, and of industries other than carbon black, and that the wells of the companies are drilled into the same sand in which the wells of the Lovell Gas & Electric Company, an industry which furnishes gas and electricity to the town of Lovell, are drilled. The sand is a free, flowing sand; that is, one in which the gas has free access from one part of the field to the other. Consequently the gas pressure would be approximately the same at all the wells drilled into it. With the operation of the wells of the companies came a diminution of pressure, and--\n'if the present consumption of gas continues for another year, there will not be sufficient gas in this field in the particular sand in question to supply even the domestic uses of the town of Lovell.'\n\n And it is affirmed that the plant of the Midland Gas Company consists of about 90 separate buildings constructed of sheet iron and steel, in such a way that they can be moved more readily than almost any other character of construction, and were evidently designed with the idea of portability in mind, and at the present rate of consumption of the gas they will have to be moved, in any event, within a year. Corroborating figures of the supply and consumption are given, and it is said that if the wells now driven be allowed to flow at their full capacity they will be entirely exhausted in 90 days. The proof of this is said to be that the use of 15,000,000 cubic feet per day of gas produced within the last 18 months has caused a loss of 57 per cent. of the available gas in the producing sand. In contrast, it is estimated that, if the gas consumed at the carbon plant was conserved, the supply available for domestic and industrial use in the towns of Lovell and Cowley would last for a period of 10 years.\n There is speculation as to other basins of deposits of gas and its utility for industries, but which cannot be undertaken against the depletion by the production of carbon \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 322]\n\u00a0\n black. The process to make the latter is said to be simple, and is similar to holding a cold plate over an old-fashioned gas jet. In fact, it is said, the process used by the Midland Carbon Company is merely an incomplete combustion of gases in an insufficient amount of air; the flames from the different jets practically touching cast iron channel plates, which are suspended over the flames and are moved backward and forward at a very slow rate of speed. The carbon is scraped off the plates into hoppers and carried to the packing houses by conveyors. All of this is mechanical.\n It is testified (by an engineer of the Bureau of Mines in the Interior Department, who had made a study of the making of carbon black) that the efficiency of the carbon black industry is very low; that the largest yield of which affiant had any knowledge did not exceed 1 1\/2 pounds per 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas, though it is a well known and chemically ascertained fact that 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas contains approximately from 33 to 45 pounds of carbon.\n The companies replied with affidavits of opposing tendency, and made comparisons of the money value of carbon black with the money value of natural gas; the former being the more valuable. And there is contradiction of the asserted lower pressure of the wells and the tendency to the depletion of the gas, and assertion that other forms of industry can well use coal for fuel.\n The affidavits (which we have presented necessarily in barest outline ), whether they may be regarded as presenting issues of fact or of judgment, exhibit the conditions which may have moved the policy and legislation of the state. Manifestly, conceding a power to the state of regulation, a comparison of the value of the industries and a judgment upon them as affecting the state, was for it to make. Such comparison may, therefore, be put aside. It may be, as it is deposed, that 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas converted into gasoline and carbon black may \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 323]\n\u00a0\n be sold much higher than can be obtained from the same amount of gas sold for fuel purposes, but it does not follow from that fact that the state may not consider, and direct its legislation by the consideration that ( and we take the averment of the companies) 1,000 cubic feet of natural gas is consumed to produce 1 3\/4 pounds of carbon black and about two-tenths of a gallon of gasoline. That it may so consider depends upon the question whether its statute is within the principle of the statutes passed on in Oil Co. v. Indiana and Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co. By reverting to these cases it will be immediately observed that the power of regulation over natural gas is possessed by a state, and in the first case ( Oil Co. v. Indiana) it was exercised to prohibit the employment of the gas as a means or agency in the production of oil against an asserted right of property in the ownership of the land upon which the oil was produced, and therefore of the oil and gas as incidents of such ownership, and which could be used in such manner and quantity as the landowner might choose.\n In the Lindsley Case the power of the state was exerted to prohibit the owner of the surface from pumping on his own land, water charged with gas. This was but an exertion, it was said, to preserve from depletion the subterranean supply common to him and other owners, and that the statute, therefore, was not unconstitutional as depriving owners of their property without due process of law. Oil Co. v. Indiana, as we have pointed out, was cited as a precedent, and its principle applied. The case at bar is, we think, within that principle; in other words, the power is exerted to prohibit an extravagant, or wasteful, or disproportionate use of the natural gas of the state.\n We have seen that the method of production by natural gas is like holding a cold plate over a candle, or, as it is expressed by a witness, it can only be produced 'by combustion and the impinging of the flame on the metallic surface'; \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 324]\n\u00a0\n and there is great disproportion between the gas and the product, and necessarily there was presented to the judgment and policy of the state a comparison of utilities, which involved as well the preservation of the natural resources of the state and the equal participation in them by the people of the state; and the duration of this utility was for the consideration of the state, and we do not think that the state was required by the Constitution of the United States to stand idly by while these resources were disproportionately used, or used in such way that tended to their depletion, having no power of interference.\n The cited cases determine otherwise, and that as the state of Indiana could prevent the exhaustive use of gas in the production of oil, and as the state of New York could prevent the owner of land from using artificial means to obtain the carbonated waters under his land, the State of Wyoming has the same power to prevent the use of natural gas in the production of carbon black, the tendency of which is (it may be the inevitable effect of which is) the exhaustion of the supply of natural gas and the consequent detriment of other uses.\n It may be said, however, indeed, is said, that the purpose of the act or its effect is a discrimination between producers of carbon black; those 10 miles from a town or industrial plant not being within its provisions. We think the classification is justified by the case of Bacon v. Walker, supra, and indeed by the principles which determine classification.\n To the contention that the statute is not one of conservation, because carbon black factories are permitted if 10 miles distant from a town or industrial plant, the immediate answer is that it is for the state to determine, not only if any conservation be necessary, but the degree of it, and certainly the companies cannot complain if the state has not exerted its full power.\n As we have seen many affidavits were addressed to the \n\n[254 U.S. 300, 325]\n\u00a0\n impossibility of complying with the statute; that is, of utilizing the heat of natural gas to the extent of the words of the statute. We say to the extent of the words of the statute, because we think the statute must be construed with reference to the facts of nature and their possibilities, and that all that was intended by the words employed was to require a practical and possible use of the heat, as in other fuels, and by the existing instrumentalities, and if this should be done it was a legal use of the gas-was an application and utilization of the heat contained in it. The statute was only intended to prevent the selection of a product whose production tended, and according to some of the affidavits, whose inevitable effect was, to exhaust the supply of gas in a very little while.\n The decree granting the interlocutory injunction is reversed, and the case remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, and Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS dissent. \n\n\n\n","186":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWARD v.

Glaze, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for petitioners.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a proceeding by and on behalf of Coleman J. Ward and sixty- six other Indians to recover moneys alleged to have been coercively collected from them by Love county, Oklahoma, as taxes on their allotments, which under the laws and Constitution of the United States were nontaxable. The county commissioners disallowed the claim and the claimants appealed to the district court of the county. There the claimants' petition was challenged by a demurrer, which was overruled \n\n[253 U.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n and the county elected not to plead further. A judgment for the claimants followed, and this was reversed by the Supreme Court. Board of Comr's of Love County v. Ward, 173 Pac. 1050. The case is here on writ of certiorari. \n248 U.S. 556\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 12.\n The claimants, who were members of the Choctaw Tribe and wards of the United States, received their al otments out of the tribal domain under a congressional enactment of 1898, which subjected the right of alienation to certain restrictions and provided that 'the lands allotted shall be nontaxable while the title remains in the original allottee, but not to exceed twenty-one years from date of patent.' Chapter 517, 30 Stat. 507. In the act of 1906, enabling Oklahoma to become a state, Congress made it plain that no impairment of the rights of property pertaining to the Indians was intended, chapter 3335,  1, 34 Stat. 267; and the state included in its Constitution a provision exempting from taxation 'such property as may be exempt by reason of treaty stipulations, existing between the Indians and the United States government, or by federal laws, during the force and effect of such treaties or federal laws.' Article 10 ,  6. Afterwards Congress, by an act of 1908, removed the restrictions on alienation as to certain classes of allottees, including the present claimants, and declared that all land from which the restrictions were removed 'shall be subject to taxation, ... as though it were the property of other persons than allottees.' Chapter 199,  1, 4, 35 Stat. 312.\n Following the last enactment the officers of Love and other counties began to tax the allotted lands from which restrictions on alienation were removed, and this met with pronounced opposition on the part of the Indian allottees, who insisted, as they had been advised, that the tax exemption was a vested property right which could not be abrogated or destroyed consistently with the Constitution of the United States. Suits were begun in the state courts to maintain the exemption and enjoin the \n\n[253 U.S. 17, 20]\n\u00a0\n threatened taxation, one of the suits being prosecuted by some 8,000 allottees against the officers of Love and other counties. The suits were resisted, and the state courts, being of opinion that the exemption had been repealed by Congress, sustained the power to tax. English v. Richardson, 28 Okl. 408, 114 Pac. 710; Gleason v. Wood, 28 Okl. 502, 114 Pac. 703; Choate v. Trapp, 28 Okl. 517, 114 Pac. 709. The cases were then brought here, and this court held that the exemption was a vested property right which Congress could not repeal consistently with the Fifth Amendment, that it was binding on the taxing authorities in Oklahoma, and that the state courts had erred in refusing to enjoin them from taxing the lands. Choate v. Trapp, \n224 U.S. 665\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 565; Gleason v. Wood, \n224 U.S. 679\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 571; English v. Richardson, \n224 U.S. 680\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 571.\n While those suits were pending the officers of Love county, with full knowledge of the suits, and being defendants in one, proceeded with the taxation of the allotments, demanded of these claimants that the taxes on their lands be paid to the county, threatened to advertise and sell the lands unless the taxes were paid, did advertise and sell other lands similarly situated, and caused these claimants to believe that their lands would be sold if the taxes were not paid. So, to prevent such a sale and to avoid the imposition of a penalty of eighteen per cent., for which the local statute provided, these claimants paid the taxes. They protested and objected at the time that the taxes were invalid, and the county officers knew that all the allottees were pressing the objection in the pending suits.\n As a conclusion from these facts the claimants asserted that the taxes were collected by Love county by coercive means, that their collection was in violation of a right arising out of a law of Congress and protected by the Constitution of the United States, and that the county was accordingly bound to repay the moneys thus collected. The total amount claimed is $7,833.35, aside from interest. \n\n[253 U.S. 17, 21]\n\u00a0\n Such, in substance, was the case presented by the petition, which also described each tract that was taxed, named the allottee from whom the taxes were collected and stated the amount and date of eachp ayment.\n In reversing the judgment which the district court had given for the claimants the Supreme Court held, first, that the taxes were not collected by coercive means, but were paid voluntarily, and could not be recovered back as there as there was no statutory authority therefor; and, secondly, that there was no statute making the county liable for taxes collected and then paid over to the state and municipal bodies other than the county- which it was assumed was true of a portion of these taxes-and that the petition did not show how much of the taxes was retained by the county, or how much paid over to the state and other municipal bodies, and therefore it could not be the basis of any judgment against the county.\n The county challenges our jurisdiction by a motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari and by way of supporting the motion insists that the Supreme Court put its judgment entirely on independent nonfederal grounds which were broad enough to sustain the judgment.\n As these claimants had not disposed of their allotments and twenty- one years had not elapsed since the date of the patents, it is certain that the lands were nontaxable. This was settled in Choate v. Trapp, supra, and the other cases decided with it; and it also was settled in those cases that the exemption was a vested property right arising out of a law of Congress and protected by the Constitution of the United States. This being so, the state and all its agencies and political subdivisions were bound to give effect to the exemption. It operated as a direct restraint on Love county, no matter what was said in local statutes. The county did not respect it, but, on the contrary, assessed the lands allotted to these claimants, placed them on the county tax roll, and there charged them with taxes like \n\n[253 U.S. 17, 22]\n\u00a0\n other property. If a portion of the taxes was to go to the state and other municipal bodies after collection-which we assume was the case-it still was the county that charged the taxes against these lands and proceeded to collect them. Payment of all the taxes was demanded by the county, all all were paid to it in the circumstances already narrated.\n We accept so much of the Supreme Court's decision as held that, if the payment was voluntary, the moneys could not be recovered back in the absence of a permissive statute, and that there was no such statute. But we are unable to accept its decision in other respects.\n The right to the exemption was a federal right, and was specially set up and claimed as such in the petition. Whether the right was denied, or not given due recognition, by the Supreme Court is a question as to which the claimants were entitled to invoke our judgment, and this they have done in the appropriate way. It therefore is within our province to inquire not only whether the right was denied in express terms, but also whether it was denied in substance and effect, as by putting forward nonfederal grounds of decision that were without any fair or substantial support.

Indiana, \n194 \nU.S. 579, 589\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 767. Witht his qualification, it is true that a judgment of a state court, which is put on \n\n[253 U.S. 17, 23]\n\u00a0\n independent nonfederal grounds broad enough to sustain it, cannot be reviewed by us. But the qualification is a material one and cannot be disregarded without neglecting or renouncing a jurisdiction conferred by law and designed to protect and maintain the supremacy of the Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof.\n The facts set forth in the petition, all of which were admitted by the demurrer whereon the county elected to stand, make it plain, as we think, that the finding or decision that the taxes were paid voluntarily was without any fair or substantial support. The claimants were Indians just emerging from a state of dependency and wardship. Through the pending suits and otherwise they were objecting and protesting that the taxation of their lands was forbidden by a law of Congress. But, notwithstanding this, the county demanded that the taxes be paid, and by threatening to sell the lands of these claimants and actually selling other lands similarly situated made it appear to the claimants that they must choose between paying the taxes and losing their lands. To prevent a sale and to avoid the imposition of a penalty of eighteen per cent. they yielded to the county's demand and paid the taxes, protesting and objecting at the time that the same were illegal. The moneys thus collected were obtained by coercive means-by compulsion. The county and its officers reasonably could not have regarded it otherwise; much less the Indian claimants.

Ct. 5; Oceanic Steam Navigation Co. v. Stranahan, \n214 \nU.S. 320, 329\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 671. The county places some reliance on Lamborn v. County Commissioners, \n97 U.S. 181\n, and Railroad v. Commissioners, \n98 U.S. 541\n; but those cases are quite distinguishable in their facts, and some of the \n\n[253 U.S. 17, 24]\n\u00a0\n general observations therein to which the county invites attention must be taken as modified by the later cases just cited.\n As the payment was not voluntary, but made under compulsion, no statutory authority was essential to enable or require the county to refund the money. It is a well-settled rule that 'money got through imposition' may be recovered back; and, as this court has said on several occasions, 'the obligation to do justice rests upon all persons, natural and artificial, and if a county obtains the money or property of others without authority, the law, independent of any statute, will compel restitution or compensation.' Marsh v. Fulton County, 10 Wall. 676, 684 ( 19 L. Ed. 1040); City of Louisiana v. Wood, \n102 \nU.S. 294, 298\n, 299 S.; Chapman v. County of Douglas, \n107 \nU.S. 348, 355\n, 2 S. Sup. Ct. 62. To say that the county could collect these unlawful taxes by coercive means and not incur any obligation to pay them back is nothing short of saying that it could take or appropriate the property of these Indian allottees arbitrarily and without due process of law. Of course this would be in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment, which binds the county as an agency of the state.\n If it be true, as the Supreme Court assumed, that a portion of the taxes was paid over, after collection, to the state and other municipal bodies, we regard it as certain that this did not alter the county's liability to the claimants. The county had no right to collect the money, and it took the same with notice that the rights of all who were to share in the taxes were disputed by these claimants and were being contested in the pending suits. In these circumstances it o uld not lessen its liability by paying over a portion of the money to others whose rights it knew were disputed and were no better than its own.

In legal contemplation it received the money for the use and benefit of the claimants and should respond to them accordingly. \n\n[253 U.S. 17, 25]\n\u00a0\n The county calls attention to the fact that in the demurrer to the petition the statute of limitation (probably meaning section 1570, Rev. Laws 1910) was relied on. This point was not discussed by the Supreme Court and we are not concerned with it beyond observing that when the case is remanded it will be open to that court to deal with the point as to the whole claim or any item in it as any valid local law in force when the claim was filed may require.\n Motion to dismiss denied.\n Judgment reversed. \n\n\n\n","187":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWATSON v.

The Tax Law also provides ( article 10) for an inheritance or transfer tax, which varies, among other things, according to the relationship of the beneficiary to the decedent. By section 221-b, added by Laws of 1917, c. 700,  2, an additional tax equal to 5 per cent. of the appraised value of the investment is imposed on the transfer of investments held by the decedent at his death, on which neither the general property tax nor the stamp tax above described has been paid during a fixed period prior thereto, provided that the estate is larger than the exemptions to relatives and charities.\n Watson, a resident of New York City, held, at his death in 1917, certain bonds on which neither the general property tax nor the stamp tax had been paid. The transfer tax appraiser, appointed by the Surrogate's Court, reported that there was payable by the executors in respect to those bonds the additional transfer tax prescribed by the act of 1917. The surrogate (In re Watson's Estate, 104 Misc. Rep. 212, 172 N. Y. Supp. 29) disallowed the tax on the ground that the statute violated the state Constitution, and his decision was affirmed by the Appeal \n\n[254 U.S. 122, 124]\n\u00a0\n late Division of the Supreme Court (In re Watson's Estate, 186 App. Div. 48, 174 N. Y. Supp. 19). The Court of Appeals of New York held that the act violated neither the state nor the federal Constitution (In re Watson's Estate, 226 N. Y. 384, 123 N. E. 758), and the case comes here on writ of error. The contention is that the tax imposed denies to Watson's estate equal protection of the laws.\n The occasion and the purpose of the statute are shown by the Court of Appeals. An owner of investments is not required either to list them for assessment locally under the general property tax law or to present them for stamping under the investment tax law. Whether the investments of a resident are taxed during his life depends either upon his own will or upon the vigilance and discretion of the local assessors. This condition led to loss of revenue by the state and to inequality in taxation among its citizens. To remedy both evils this additional transfer tax was imposed upon investments of a decedent which had wholly escaped taxation. It is insisted that the tax is discriminatory, because under it other property of the same kind bequeathed to persons standing in the same relationship to the decedent will not be taxed. But the power to classify for purposes of taxation is fully established. The executors admit, as they must, that a classification is reasonable, if made with respect to the kind of property transferred, or to the amount or value of property transferred, or to the relationship of the transferees, or to the character of the transferee, for instance, as engaged in charity. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 300\n, 18 S. Sup. Ct. 594; Billings v. Illinois, \n188 U.S. 97\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 272; Campbell v. California, \n200 U.S. 87\n, 26 Sup. Ct. 182. But their list does not exhaust the possibilities of legal classification. See Beers v. Glynn, \n211 \nU.S. 477, 484\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 186; Keeney v. New York, \n22 U.S. 525\n, 32 Sup. Ct. 105, 38 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1139; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 U.S. 525\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 2. Compare New York v. Reardon, \n204 U.S. 152\n, 27 Sup. Ct. 188, 9 Ann. Cas. 736. Any classification is permissible which has a reasonable relation to some permitted end of governmental action. It \n\n[254 U.S. 122, 125]\n\u00a0\n is not necessary, as the plaintiff in error seems to contend, that the basis of the classification must be deducible from the nature of the things classified-here the right to receive property by devolution. It is enough, for instance, if the classification is reasonably founded in 'the purposes and policy of taxation.' Pacific Express Co. v. Seibert, \n142 \nU.S. 339, 354\n, 12 S. Sup. Ct. 250; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730, 732\n, 23 S. Sup. Ct. 401; Clement National Bank v. Vermont, \n231 U.S. 120\n, 136-137, 34 Sup. Ct. 31; Farmers' Bank v. Minnesota, \n232 U.S. 519\n, 529-530, 34 Sup. Ct. 354. And what classification could be more reasonable than to distinguish, in imposing an inheritance or transfer tax, between property which had during the decedent's life borne its fair share of the tax burden and that which had not?1\n It does not follow, as is also argued, that the act in question imposes a property tax, merely because its existence may induce owners of investments to present them for taxation under the investment tax law. Nor is it to be deemed a law imposing a penalty merely because the decedent's estate may under it be required to pay more in taxes than the deceased would have paid if he had presented his property for taxation under the investment tax law. Whether this additional transfer tax would be obnoxious to the Fourteenth Amendment, if it could be deemed a property tax or a penalty, we have no occasion to consider.\n The judgment of the Surrogate's Court, entered on the remittitur from the Court of Appeals of New York, is\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Connecticut (Gen. Stat. 1918,  1190) and Louisiana (Constitution 1898, arts. 235, 236; Act 45 of 1904) also impose a special inheritance tax on the transfer of property which has not borne its share of taxation during a period prior to the owner's death. The latter statute has been frequently before the courts. Succession of Mathias Levy, 115 La. 377, 385, 39 South. 37, 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 1180, 5 Ann. Cas. 871, affirmed Cahen v.

Friedman, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice PITNEY delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Upon his voluntary petition, filed in February, 1916, J. Herbert Weidhorn was adjudged a bankrupt, and the \n\n[253 U.S. 268, 269]\n\u00a0\n District Court referred the case to a referee under General Order XII(1), \n172 U.S. 657\n, 18 Sup. Ct. vi. Thereafter the trustee in bankruptcy addressed to andf iled with the referee a bill in equity against the bankrupt's brother, Leo Weidhorn (the present petitioner), and the Boston Storage Warehouse Company, alleging that certain chattel mortgages, or bills of sale in the nature of mortgages, made by the bankrupt to Leo more than four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, and under which, prior to the filing of the petition, possession of the chattels had passed to the mortgagee and the Storage Warehouse Company, were invalid because made in fraud of creditors, and seeking to set them aside under the statute of Elizabeth and the Bankruptcy Act,  70e (Comp. St.  9654), and recover the chattels or the proceeds thereof for the bankrupt estate. Defendant Leo Weidhorn promptly objected to the jurisdiction of the referee, and afterwards answered to the merits. The referee overruled the jurisdictional objection, proceeded to hear the merits, and entered a final decree in favor of the trustee. On review the District Court, considering the jurisdictional question only, vacated the decree and dismissed the bill upon the ground that the referee exceeded his powers under the order of reference. In re Weidhorn, 243 Fed. 756. The trustee petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals to revise the decree under section 24b; and that court, deeming that the District Court had erred in holding that the referee acted without jurisdiction, reversed its decree dismissing the bill and remanded the cause for further proceedings, including a review of the merits. 253 Fed. 28, 165 C. C. A. 48. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n248 U.S. 555\n, 39 Sup. Ct. 11.\n It is assigned for error that the Circuit Court of Appeals ought not to have entertained the petition to revise under section 24b (Comp. St.  9608); the contention being that since the decree complained of was made in a plenary suit the exclusive remedy was by appeal under section 24a. Had the District Court sustained the jurisdiction and passed upon the merits the \n\n[253 U.S. 268, 270]\n\u00a0\n point would be well taken, as the court thereby would have determined a 'controversy arising in bankruptcy proceedings.' Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works, \n194 \nU.S. 296, 300\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 690, 691 (48 L. Ed. 986). But since the decision turned upon a mere question of law as to whether the referee had authority to hear and determine the controversy-in effect a question of procedure-it properly was reviewable by petition to revise under section 24b. Louisville Trust Co. v. Comingor, \n184 \nU.S. 18, 26\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 293; Schweer v. Brown, \n195 \nU.S. 171, 172\n, 25 S. Sup. Ct. 15; First Nat. Bank v.

A. 252.\n Did the referee exceed the authority and jurisdiction conferred upon him by the Bankruptcy Act and the general order of reference?\n The following provisions of the act are pertinent: By section 1(7), Comp. St.  9585:\n\"Court' shall mean the court of bankruptcy in which the proceedings are pending, and may include the referee.'\n\n By section 18g (section 9602):\n'If the judge is absent from the district, or the division of the district in which the petition is filed at the time of the filing, the clerk shall forthwith refer the case to the referee.'\n\n Section 22 (section 9606) provides that after a person has been adjudged a bankrupt the judge may make a reference to the referee either generally or specially with limited authority to act or to consider and report, and 'may, at any time, for the convenience of parties or for cause, transfer a case from one referee to another.' By section 36 (section 9620):\n'Referees shall take the same oath of office as that prescribed for judges of United States courts.'\n\n And by section 38a (section 9622):\n'Referees respectively are hereby invested, subject always to a review by the judge, within the limits of their districts as established from time to time, with jurs diction to ... (4) perform such part of the duties, except as to questions arising out of the applications of bankrupts for compositions or discharges, as are by this act conferred on courts of bankruptcy and \n\n[253 U.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n as shall be prescribed by rules or orders of the courts of bankruptcy of their respecitive districts, except as herein otherwise provided.'\n\n These provisions make it clear that the referee is not in any sense a separate court, nor endowed with any independent judicial authority, and is merely an officer of the court of bankruptcy, having no power except as conferred by the order of reference-reading this, of course, in the light of the act; and that his judicial functions, however important, are subject always to the review of the bankruptcy court.\n In the general orders established by this court pursuant to the act, under XII(1) provision is made for an order referring a case to a referee:\n'And thereafter all the proceedings, except such as are required by the act or by these general orders to be had before the judge, shall be had before the referee.' \n172 U.S. 657\n, 18 Sup. Ct. vi.\n\n The question is whether the present suit brought by the trustee in bankruptcy against petitioner was a 'proceeding' within the meaning of this provision. We cannot concur in the view of the District Court that this question is governed by the distinction between 'proceedings in bankruptcy' and 'controversies at law and in equity arising in bankruptcy proceedings,' as these terms are employed in sections 23, 24a, 24b, and 25a (Comp. St.  9607-9609); there may be controversies arising in the course of bankruptcy proceedings that are so far connected with those proceedings as to be in effect a part of them and capable of summary disposition by the referee under the general order of reference, although because of their nature or because involving a distinct and separable issue they may be reviewable, under the sections cited, by appeal rather than by petition to revise. Hewit v. Berlin Machine Works, \n194 \nU.S. 296, 300\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 690; Knapp v. Milwaukee Trust Co., \n216 \nU.S. 545, 553\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 412.\n Thus, if the property were in the custody of the bankruptcy court or its officer, any controversy raised by an \n\n[253 U.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n adverse claimant setting up a title to or lien upon it might be determined on summary proceedings in the bankruptcy court, and would fall within the jurisdiction of the referee. White v. Schloerb, \n178 \nU.S. 542, 546\n, 20 S. Sup. Ct. 1007; Mueller v. Nugent, \n184 \nU.S. 1, 13\n, 22 S. Sup. Ct. 269.\n But in the present instance the controversy related to property not in possession or control of the court or of the bankrupt or any one representing him at the time of petition filed, and not in the court's custody at the time of the controversy, but in the actual possession of the bankrupt's brother under an adverse claim of ownership based upon conveyances made more than four months before the institution of the proceedings in bankruptcy. In order to set aside these conveyances and subject the property to the administration of the court of bankruptcy a plenary suit was necessary (Babbitt v. Dutcher, \n216 \nU.S. 102, 113\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 372, 17 Ann. Cas. 969), and such was the nature of the one that was instituted.\n Under the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 as originally passed, an independent suit of this character could not be brought in the District Court in bankruptcy 'unless by consent of the proposed defendant.' Act July 1, 1898, c. 541,  23b, 30 Stat. 544, 552; Bardes v. Hawarden Bank, \n178 U.S. 524\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 1000. Whether under Act Feb. 5, 1903, c. 487, 32 Stat. 797, 798, 800, amending sections 23b and 70e, a suit for the recovery of property fraudulently transferred by the bankrupt could be brought in a court of bankruptcy without the consent of defendant was a question left undetermined in Harris v. First National Bank, \n216 \nU.S. 382, 385\n, 30 S. Sup. Ct. 296, but answered in the negatv e in Wood v. A. Wilbert's Sons Shingle & Lumber Co., \n226 \nU.S. 384, 389\n, 33 S. Sup. Ct. 125. By Act June 25, 1910, c. 412,  7, 36 Stat. 838, 840, section 23b was further amended so as to confer jurisdiction upon the courts of bankruptcy without consent of the proposed defendant in suits for the recovery of property under section 70e. The present suit, being of this nature, might have been brought in the District Court, or \n\n[253 U.S. 268, 273]\n\u00a0\n it might have been brought in a state court having concurrent jurisdiction under section 70e as amended.\n We find nothing in the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act that makes it necessary or reasonable to extend the authority and jurisdiction of the referee beyond the ordinary administrative proceedings in bankruptcy and such controversial matters as arise therein and are in effect a part thereof, or to extend the authority of the referee under the general reference so as to include jurisdiction over an independent and plenary suit such as the one under consideration. The provisions of the act, as well as the title of his office, indicate that the referee is to exercise powers not equal to or co-ordinate with those of the court or judge, but subordinate thereto, and he becomes 'the court' only by virtue of the order of reference. In the General Orders the word 'proceedings' occurs frequently, but never in a sense to include a plenary suit. On the other hand, 'proceedings in equity' and 'proceedings at law' are specially dealt with in General Order XXXVII, 18 Sup. Ct. x.\n The practice is not uniform; we have found no decision by a Circuit Court of Appeals upon the point; and the decisions of the district courts are conflicting. A referee's opinion in In re Murphy (1900) 3 Am. Bankr. Rep. 499, 505, upholds his jurisdiction over a plenary proceeding by the trustee to set aside a preferential transfer of property to a creditor. In In re Shults & Mark (referee's opinion) 11 Am. Bankr. Rep. 690, a special form of reference having been adopted by the District Court, it was held that jurisdiction was conferred upon the referee over proceedings under section 60b to recover property preferentially transferred and under section 67e to recover property fraudulently transferred. In In re Steuer ( D. C. Mass.) 104 Fed. 976, 980, a plenary suit to avoid a preference was heard before the referee without objection, and upon petition to review his action the District Court, with some hesitation, directed that a decree issue 'as if made originally by the judge, and \n\n[253 U.S. 268, 274]\n\u00a0\n not simply as an affirmance of the decree of the referee.' In In re Scherber (D. C. Mass.) 131 Fed. 121, 124, it was found unnecessary to determine whether the referee could proceed over objection to take jurisdiction of a plenary suit to recover a preference. Views adverse to the jurisdiction of the referee in an independent proceeding to avoid a transfer were expressed in In re Walsh Brothers (D. C. Iowa) 163 Fed. 352; In re Carlile (D. C. N. C.) 199 Fed. 612, 615, 616; In re Ballou (D. C. Ky .) 215 Fed. 810, 813, 814; and In re Overholzer (referee's opinion) 23 Am. Bankr. Rep. 10.\n The point appears to have been overlooked in Studley v. Boylston Nat. Bank, 200 Fed. 249, 118 C. C. A. 435; Id., \n229 \nU.S. 523, 525\n, 526 S., 33 Sup. Ct. 806. Other cases cited throw no useful light upon the question.\n Reviewing the entire matter, we conclude that under the language of the Bankruptcy Act and of the general orders in bankruptcy a referee, by virtue of a general reference under order XII(1), has not jurisdiction over a plenary suit in equity brought by the trustee in bankruptcy against a third payty to set aside a fraudulent transfer or conveyance under section 70e, and affecting property not in the custody or control of the court of bankruptcy.\n Decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, and decree of the District Court affirmed. \n\n\n\n","189":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWELLS BROS CO. OF NEW YORK v. U S(1920)\nNo. 75\nArgued: Decided: November 8, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. A. R. Serven and Burt E. Barlow, both of Washington, D. C., for appellant.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Davis, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice CLARKE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal from a judgment of the Court of Claims, sustaining a general demurrer to and dismissing the amended petition. \n\n[254 U.S. 83, 84]\n\u00a0\n The allegations of this amended petition, admitted by the demurrer and essential to be considered, are:\n The appellant, a corporation organized under the laws of New York, and engaged in the general building and construction business, entered into a written contract with the United States for the construction of a post office and courthouse building in New Orleans, dated September 30, 1909, for which it was to be paid $817,000, but its bond for performance was not approved until 9 days later, on October 9; on the day after the contract was signed the United States 'ordered and directed' appellant to delay ordering limestone (as specified in the contract) for the exterior of the street fronts of the building 'for the reason, as stated, that a change was contemplated in said exterior face stonework, which would require an additional appropriation by Congress'; the appellant assented to a delay of two weeks only, but, although protesting that further delay would result in its damage, it refrained from purchasing limestone until August 19, 1910, when, the required appropriation by Congress having been obtained, a supplemental agreement was entered into by the parties to the contract, by which marble was substituted for limestone for the street fronts of the building, the compensation of the appellant was increased $ 210,500, and the time for completion of the building was extended from April 1, 1911, to February 5, 1912; during this delay the contractor proceeded with other work under the contract, and prior to August 19, 1910, it had completed all the required excavation, foundation, and structural steel work; after the 'modification and addition of August 19, 1910, to the contract work' the appellant so proceeded with the performance of the contract that by February 1, 1912, the building was substantially completed except the interior partitions, and thereupon the United States, again over the protest of appellant, 'ordered and directed' a delay, which continued to August \n\n[254 U.S. 83, 85]\n\u00a0\n 24, 1912, until congressional legislation was obtained authorizing the parcel post, whereupon the plans for the interior arrangements of the building were adapted to that service and the building was completed.\n The claim is wholly for damages occasioned by the two delays thus described, and the question for decision is whether the terms of the contract authorized the government to require such delays without becoming liable to the contractor for damages which may have been caused to it thereby.\n The contract involved contains this provision:\n'It is further covenanted and agreed that the United States shall have the right of suspending the whole or any part of the work herein contracted to be done, whenever in the opinion of the architects of the building, or of the supervising architect, it may be necessary for the purpose or advantage of the work, and upon such occasion or occasions the contractor shall, without expense to the United States, properly cover over, secure and protect such of the work as may be liable to sustain injury from the weather, or otherwise, and for all such suspensions the contractor shall be allowed one day additional to the time herein stated for each and every day of such delay so caused in the completion of the work, the same to be ascertained by the supervising architect; and a similar allowance of extra time will be made for such other delays as the supervising architect may find to have been caused by the United States, provided that a written claim therefor is presented by the contractor within ten days of the occurrence of such delays; provided, further, that no claim shall be made or allowed to the contractor for any damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the United States.'\n\n The contract further declares that the contractor--\n'will make any omissions from, additions to or changes in the work or material herein provided for whenever \n\n[254 U.S. 83, 86]\n\u00a0\n required by said first party ... and that no claim for damages on account of such changes or for anticipated profits shall be made or allowed.'\n\n It would be difficult to select language giving larger discretion to the United States to suspend the performance 'of the whole or any part of the work' contracted for, or to change the work or materials, than that here used. The provision for the protection of the work shows that long interruptions were contemplated with a compensating extension of time for performance provided for, and it is admitted that, eight days before its bond was approved and it became bound, the appellant received its first order to delay, for the reason that 'a change was contemplated in said exterior stonework which would require an additional appropriation by Congress.'\n Such a delay as was thus ordered was certain to be an indefinite and very probably a long-continued one; but the appellant, experienced contractor that it was, did not hesitate to submit to it by permitting the approval of its bond, which rendered its obligation under the contract complete, more than a week after notice had been received of the order. Thus, with much the longest delay complained of ordered and actually entered upon, the appellant consented to be bound by the language quoted, which vested such comprehensive discretion over the work in the government. That this confidence of the contractor was not misplaced is shown by the fact that this first delay resulted in the substitution of marble for limestone for the street fronts of the building and in a supplemental agreement by which it received additional payments, aggregating $210,500, and an extension of ten months for the completion of the work.\n In addition to all this it must be noted that the first paragraph above quoted, concludes with this independent proviso:\n'Provided further, that no claim shall be made or allowed \n\n[254 U.S. 83, 87]\n\u00a0\n to the contractor for any damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the United States.'\n\n Here is a plain and unrestricted covenant on the part of the contractor, comprehensive as words can make it, that it will not make any claim against the government 'for any damages which may arise out of any delay caused by the United States' in the performance of the contract, and this is emphasized by being immediately coupled with a declaration by the government that if such a claim should be made it would not be allowed.\n Such language disassociated as it is from provisions relating to 'omissions from,' the making of 'additions to or changes in,' the work to be done, or 'material' to be used, cannot be treated as meaningless and futile and read out of the contract. Given its plain meaning it is fatal to the appellant's claim.\n Men who take $1,000,000 contracts for government buildings are neither unsophisticated nor careless. Inexperience and inattention are more likely to be found in other parties to such contracts than the contractors, and the presumption is obvious and strong that the men signing such a contract as we have here protected themselves against such delays as are complained of by the higher price exacted for the work.\n We are dealing with a written contract, plain and comprehensive in its terms and the case is clearly ruled in principle by Day v. United States, \n245 \nU.S. 159, 161\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 57, Carnegie Steel Co. v. United States, \n240 \nU.S. 156, 164\n, 165 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 342, Dermott v. Jones, 2 Wall. 1, 7, and Chouteau v.

Whittingham, all of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas Fite Paine, of Aberdeen, Miss., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Oscar G. Taylor, an express messenger of Wells Fargo & Co. a common carrier by express, received substantial \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 177]\n\u00a0\n personal injuries through the derailment of an express car in which he was working, and which was part of a passenger train moving over the railroad of the St. Louis & San Francisco Railroad Company in the state of Mississippi-the derailment resulting from negligence on the part of the railroad company and its employes. To recover for these injuries Taylor brought an action against the railroad company in the circuit court of Monroe county, Mississippi, and obtained a judgment for $4,000, which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state without an opinion. See St. Louis & S. F. Ry. Co. v. Taylor, 58 South. 485.\n In his declaration in that case Taylor explained and justified his presence on the train and in the express car by alleging that he was then in the employ of the express company as its messenger and in the course of that employment was in charge of express matter which the railroad company was transporting for the express company, that this transportation was in pursuance of a contract between the two companies, and that under the contract the express car was furnished by the railroad company and he, as the express company's messenger, was permitted to accompany the express matter carried therein.\n While the declaration said nothing more about the nature or terms of that contract, it is important here to have them in mind. The contract shows that it was intended to, and did, cover all express business on and over the railroad company's road, both within and without the state of Mississippi, for a specified period, including the day when Taylor was injured. It gave to the express company the exclusive privilege of conducting an express business on and over the railroad and obligated the railroad company to refrain from conducting an express business. There were provisions whereby the railroad company agreed (a) to transport by suitable cars, to be provided by it and attached to its passenger trains, all express matter of the express company and the messengers accompanying the \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 178]\n\u00a0\n same; (b) to light and warm the cars and equip them with necessary conveniences; and (c) to permit portions of its station houses to be used by the express company for the reception, safe keeping and delivery of express matter. And there were other provisions whereby the express company agreed (a) to make stated payments-usually a percentage of the gross earnings-for the facilities furnished and service rendered by the railroad company; (b) to assume all risks, losses and damages to its own property, express matter and valuable packages transported under the contract; (c) to assume all risk and damage to its agents and employes while engaged in its business on the trains or property of the railroad company; and (d) to indemnify and hold harmless the railroad company in respect of all claims for damages suffered by such agents and employes while so engaged.\n There was also a contract between Taylor and the express company, spoken of as a messenger's agreement, wherein-following a recital that he had full knowledge of the service required and the conditions on which the railroad company would permit messengers to accompany express matter on its trains, and that with such knowledge he was desirous of becoming a messenger of the express company-it was stipulated, as a term or condition of his employment, that neither the express company nor the railroad company should under any circumstances or in any case be liable for any injury which he might receive while on the railroad company's trains as such messenger, whether caused by negligence of the railroad company or otherwise, and that he would assume all and every risk incident to such employment, from whatever cause arising.\n Promptly after Taylor sued the railroad company in the circuit court of Monroe county, and before the case was brought to trial, the express company presented to that court in that cause a petition wherein it set out the contracts just described and asked to be made a party defendant. \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 179]\n\u00a0\n To this the railroad company assented, but Taylor evidently objected and the petition was denied. The railroad company by its answer and evidence sought to avail itself of the stipulation in the messenger's agreement, in connection with those in the other contract, but the court ruled against it and Taylor obtained the judgment before mentioned.\n What has been recited will conduce to a right understanding of another suit the decree in which we are now to review.\n The suit is in equity and was brought by the express company against Taylor in the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Mississippi. The federal jurisdiction rests on diversity of citizenship-the express company being a corporation and citizen of Colorado, and Taylor a citizen of Mississippi residing in the Northern district. The bill, with a supplement and amendment, proceeds on the theory that, in suing the railroad company and obtaining a judgment against it, which as between that company and the express company must be paid by the latter as stipulated in their contract. Taylor not only violated the messenger's agreement, but perpetrated a legal fraud on the express company; that the judgment is therefore one which in equity and good conscience he has no right to enforce; that if he be permitted to enforce it the express company will be without any effective remedy in that he has no property which can be reached by legal process (a fact which is both alleged and proved); and that the express company, which was not a party to that case, and has not been in any wise negligent or at fault, is in equity and good conscience entitled to have the messenger's agreement respected and to demand that the claims embraced in the inequitable judgment be relinquished and the enforcement of the judgment enjoined. The prayer conforms to that theory and is in substance that Taylor be required specifically to perform \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 180]\n\u00a0\n and carry out the messenger's agreement, to execute a sufficient release of all claims on account of the injuries received, and to abstain from enforcing the judgment. General relief also is prayed.\n Taylor challenged the bill by a demurrer, which was overruled, and after a hearing in due course the express company prevailed. On appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals that decree was reversed and the suit remanded because in that court's opinion the bill did not show that Taylor was not in the employ of the railroad company or that he was solely in the employ of the express company. Taylor v. Wells Fargo & Co., 220 Fed. 796, 136 C. C. A. 402. After the mandate was received, Taylor conceiving that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals fully disposed of the merits and was final, requested the District Court to enter a decree dismissing the bill, and the express company requested leave to amend the bill by correcting the defect pointed out by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Taylor's request was denied and that of the express company was granted. The bill was accordingly amended so as to show that Taylor was not in the employ of the railroad company, but was on the train solely in virtue of his employment by the express company, and that in his declaration in the action against the railroad company he did not claim or allege any employment by that company, but, on the contrary, claimed and alleged that it permitted him to be on the train because he was accompanying the express matter as the express company's employe. Taylor then filed a new answer, and on a further hearing a decree for the express company was entered. By it the District Court found that the allegations of the bill, with its supplement and amendment, were all true; declared that the institution of the action against the railroad company and its prosecution to judgment constituted a violation of the messenger's agreement and a legal fraud on the express company; directed Taylor to carry out and perform the messenger's \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 181]\n\u00a0\n agreement and to execute, within a fixed time, an appropriate instrument releasing the express company and the railroad company from all claims for damages on account of his injuries; and enjoined him from collecting or attempting to collect the judgment against the railroad company. On a further appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals that decree was reversed with directions to dismiss the bill. Taylor v. Wells Fargo & Co., 249 Fed. 109, 161 C. C. A. 161. A writ of certiorari was then granted by this court, \n247 U.S. 515\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 581\n\n\n On the second appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals put its decision entirely on the ground that the express company was a 'common carrier by railroad' within the meaning of the Employers' Liability Act of April 22, 1908, c. 149, 35 Stat. 65 (Comp. St.  8657-8665), and therefore under section 5 of the act (section 8661) the messenger's agreement was void. Taylor advanced that and other grounds in asking a reversal, but the court did not discuss the other grounds. All are pressed on our attention, and we take them up in what seems the natural order.\n\n 1. \nIt is urged that the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals on the first appeal was final in that it disposed of all questions in the suit and left nothing open to the District Court but to dismiss the bill. Had this been so, the Circuit Court of Appeals on the second appeal hardly would have failed to enforce its prior decision. But that decision did not go as far as is claimed. It turned on the sufficiency of the bill, and on that alone. The District Court had held the bill sufficient when challenged by a demurrer. The Circuit Court of Appeals held it insufficient, and for that reason reversed the decree and remanded the suit. Had the District Court taken that view when acting on the demurrer, it undoubtedly could, and probably would, have allowed an amendment curing the defect. Could it not equally allow the amendment after the Circuit Court of Appeals pointed out the defect and remanded the suit? It, of course, was bound to give effect to the decision and \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 182]\n\u00a0\n mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals; but that court did not order the bill dismissed nor give any direction even impliedly making against the amendment. All that was disposed of was the matter of the sufficiency of the bill. And recognition of this is found in the last opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals, where it is said that the first reversal was 'based upon the insufficiency of the pleadings.' We think the decision on the first appeal was not final and that the District Court was left free, in the exercise of its discretion, to permit the amendment. Equity Rules Nos. 19 and 28 (32 Sup. Ct. xxiii, xxvi); In re Sanford Fork and Tool Co., \n160 \nU.S. 247, 258\n, 259 S., 16 Sup. Ct. 291; Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Hill, \n193 \nU.S. 551, 553\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 538; Smith v. Adams, \n130 \nU.S. 167, 177\n, 9 S. Sup. Ct. 566. It appears that in denying a petition for a rehearing on the first appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals refused to direct the allowance of the amendment; but this signifies nothing more than that no occasion was perceived for controlling the District Court's discretion in the matter.\n\n 2. \nSection 265, Judicial Code, formerly section 720, Rev. Stat. (Comp. St.  1242), provides that--\n'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a state, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.'\n\n And this is relied on as showing that the District Court could not entertain the suit. That court held the provision not applicable, and the Circuit Court of Appeals said nothing on the subject on either appeal, possibly because in a similar case it had held the provision without application.\n Is the suit one to stay proceedings in a state court in the sense of that provision? If it is, the District Court erred in not dismissing the bill on that ground. Haines v. Carpenter, \n91 U.S. 254\n; Dial v. Reynolds, \n96 U.S. 340\n; United States v. Parkhurst- Davis Co., \n176 U.S. 317\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 423. If it is not, the court rightly entertained the suit and proceeded to an adjudication of the merits, for the citizenship of the \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 183]\n\u00a0\n parties and the amount in controversy were within the jurisdictional requirements.\n The provision has been in force more than a century and often has been considered by this court. As the decisions show, it is intended to give effect to a familiar rule of comity and like that rule is limited in its field of operation. Within that field it tends to prevent unseemly interference with the orderly disposal of litigation in the state courts and is salutary; but to carry it beyond that field would materially hamper the federal courts in the discharge of duties otherwise plainly cast upon them by the Constitution and the laws of Congress, which of course is not contemplated. As with many other statutory provisions, this one is designed to be in accord with, and not antagonistic to, our dual system of courts. In recognition of this it has come to be settled by repeated decisions and in actual practice that, where the elements of federal and equity jurisdiction are present, the provision does not prevent the federal courts from enjoining the institution in the state courts of proceedings to enforce local statutes which are repugnant to the Constitution of the United States (Ex parte Young, \n209 U.S. 123\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 441, 13 L. R. A. [N. S.] 932, 14 Ann. Cas. 764; Truax v. Raich, \n239 U.S. 33\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 7, L. R. A. 1916D, 545, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 283; Missouri v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. R. Co., \n241 \nU.S. 533, 538\n, 543 S., 36 Sup. Ct. 715), or prevent them from maintaining and protecting their own jurisdiction, properly acquired and still subsisting, by enjoining attempts to frustrate, defeat or impair it through proceedings in the state courts (French v. Hay, 22 Wall. 250, note; Julian v. Central Trust Co., \n193 \nU.S. 93, 112\n, 24 S. Sup. Ct. 399; Chesapeake & Ohio Ry. Co. v. McCabe, \n213 \nU.S. 207, 219\n, 29 S. Sup. Ct. 430; Looney v. Eastern Texas R. R. Co ., \n247 \nU.S. 214, 221\n, 38 S. Sup. Ct. 460), or prevent them from depriving a party, by means of an injunction, of the benefit of a judgment obtained in a state court in circumstances where its enforcement will be contrary to recognized principles of equity and the standards of good conscience (Marshall v. Holmes, \n141 U.S. 589\n, 12 Sup. Ct. 62; Ex parte Simon, \n208 U.S. 144\n, 28 Sup. Ct. 238; \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 184]\n\u00a0\n Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., \n236 U.S. 115\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 255; Public Service Co. v. Corboy, \n250 \nU.S. 153, 160\n, 39 S. Sup. Ct. 440; National Surety Co. v. State Bank of Humboldt, 120 Fed. 593, 56 C. C. A. 657, 61 L. R. A. 394).\n Marshall v. Holmes, just cited, was a suit in equity to enjoin one who had obtained judgments in a state court from enforcing them, that relief being sought on the ground that they were secured by fraud which was not discovered until after they were rendered; and the question distinctly presented was whether the suit was one which the Circuit Court of the United States could entertain and decide, the requisite diversity of citizenship and amount in dispute being present. This court-after adverting to prior decisions stating the familiar doctrine that 'any fact which clearly proves it to be against conscience to execute a judgment, and of which the injured party could not have availed himself in a court of law, or of which he might have availed himself at law, but was prevented by fraud or accident, unmixed with any fault or negligence in himself or its agents, will justify an application to a court of chancery,' and also showing that such a suit is not one to review or revise the action of the court rendering the judgment, but is a new and independent suit for equitable relief-answered the question by saying:\n'These authorities would seem to place beyond question the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court to take cognizance of the present suit, which is none the less an original, independent suit, because it relates to judgments obtained in the court of another jurisdiction. While it cannot require the state court itself to set aside or vacate the judgments in question, it may, as between the parties before it, if the facts justify such relief, adjudge that Mayer shall not enjoy the inequitable advantage obtained by his judgments. A decree to that effect would operate directly upon him, and would not contravene that provision of the statute prohibiting a court of the United States from granting a writ of injunction to stay proceedings in a \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 185]\n\u00a0\n state court. It would simply take from him the benefit of judgments obtained by fraud.'\n\n Simon v. Southern Ry. Co., supra, was a suit in a Circuit Court of the United States to enjoin the enforcement of a judgment in a state court on the ground that it was obtained by fraud and without notice, and the defendant invoked the provision in section 265. The Circuit Court took jurisdiction and awarded the relief sought. That decision was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals and on a further appeal was sustained by this court. At that time this court considered the provision in the light of its origin and purpose, reviewed the prior decisions and in an extended opinion having the approval of the entire court reaffirmed the ruling in Marshall v. Holmes.\n National Surety Co. v. State Bank of Humboldt, supra, was a suit in a federal court to obtain like relief in respect of a judgment in a state court on the ground that through a mistake of a public officer, for which he alone was responsible, the judgment had been rendered without opportunity for putting in a defense, and this when there was one which was both meritorious and complete. The suit was not brought by the judgment defendant, but by one who was obligated to pay the judgment if it was enforced. The bill was dismissed because of the provision now relied on; but that decision was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals in a well-considered opinion wherein it was said that in cases otherwise within the jurisdictional statute 'the Circuit Courts of the United States have the same jurisdiction and power to enjoin a judgment plaintiff from enforcing an unconscionable judgment of a state court, which has been procured through fraud, accident, or mistake, that they have to restrain him from collecting a like judgment of a federal court'; that the bill presented a new and justiciable case which had not been presented to nor decided by the state court and did not 'fall under the ban of the section of the statute under consideration'; and \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 186]\n\u00a0\n that--\n'In this case all these facts concur-the judgment which it is against conscience to allow to be used to extort money that is not owing from a defendant remediless at law, the complete meritorious defense to the claime on which this judgment is based, the fact that the defendant in the judgment was prevented from availing itself of its defense to the cause of action by an unavoidable accident, and the absence of any negligence of the defendant or of its agents. These facts appeal with compelling force to the conscience of a chancellor. They have been presented to a court to which the Constitution and the acts of Congress have granted the power, and upon which they have imposed the duty, to grant the relief to which the complainants are equitably entitled; and the decree which dismissed their bill must be reversed.'\n\n Without pursuing the subject further, we hold that the present suit is not one to stay proceedings in a state court in the sense of section 265.\n\n 3. \nDoes the Employers' Liability Act affect the validity of the messenger's agreement?\n The act provides that 'every common carrier by railroad' shall be liable in damages for the injury or death of any of its employes occurring while it is engaged and he is employed in interstate commerce and resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of its officers, agents or employes, or from any defect or insufficiency, due to its negligence, 'in its cars, engines, appliances, machinery, track, roadbed,' etc.; and in section 5 it declares that any contract whereby a common carrier exempts itself from 'any liability created by this act' shall to that extent be void.\n In his declaration in the state court Taylor did not claim that he was in the employ of the railroad company, and his judgment was not obtained on that theory. Here it is shown with certainty that he was not in that company's employ. True he urges that the contract between the two \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 187]\n\u00a0\n companies shows a coproprietorship or sort of partnership between them which made him an employe of both; but the contract discloses no basis for the claim or for distinguishing his case from that of the Pullman porter recently before us. Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R. Co., \n237 U.S. 84\n, 35 Sup. Ct. 491. Here the businesses of the companies concerned were quite as distinct in point of control and otherwise as they were there. That here the railroad company provided the express car is not material, for it is measurably equalized by other differences. In both cases the railroad company provided the motive power and the train operatives. The messenger here, like the porter there, was on the train as an employe, not of the railroad company, but of another by whom he was employed, directed and paid, and at whose will he was to continue in service or be discharged.\n As respects the express company, it appears not merely that Taylor was in its employ, but also that the injuries were received while it was engaged and he was employed in interstate commerce; and so the question is presented whether the act embraces a common carrier by express which neither owns nor operates a railroad, but uses and pays for railroad transportation in the manner before shown. The District Court answered the question in the negative and the Circuit Court of Appeals in the affirmative. A negative answer also has been given in a like situation by the Court of Errors and Appeals of New Jersey (Higgins v. Erie R. R. Co., 89 N. J. Law, 629, 99 Atl. 98), and a recent decision by the Supreme Court of Minnesota makes persuasively for that view (State ex rel. v. District Court, 142 Minn. 410, 172 N. W. 310).\n In our opinion the words 'common carrier by railroad,' as used in the act, mean one who operates a railroad as a means of carrying for the public-that is to say, a railroad company acting as a common carrier. This view not only is in accord with the ordinary acceptation of the words, \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 188]\n\u00a0\n but is enforced by the mention of cars, engines, track, roadbed, and other property pertaining to a going railroad (see Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, \n244 U.S. 205\n, 212-213, 37 Sup. Ct. 524, L. R. A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900); by the obvious reference in the latter part of sections 3 and 4 to statutes requiring engines and cars to be equipped with automatic couplers, standard drawbars and other appliances intended to promote the safety of railroad employes (see San Antonio & Aransas Pass Ry. Co. v. Wagner, \n241 \nU.S. 476, 484\n, 36 S. Sup. Ct. 626); by the use of similar words in closely related acts which apply only to carriers operating railroads (27 Stat. 531, c. 196 [Comp. St.   8605-8612]; 35 Stat. 476, c. 225 [Comp. St.  8624-8629]; 36 Stat. 350, c. 208 [Comp. St.  8642-8647]); and by the fact that similar words in the original Interstate Commerce Act had been construed as including carriers operating railroads but not express companies doing business as here shown ( Burton Stock Car Co. v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. R. Co., 1 Interst. Com. Com'n R. 349; United States v. Morsman [D. C.] 42 Fed. 448; Southern Indiana Express Co. v. United States Express Co. [C. C.] 88 Fed. 659, 662; Id., 92 Fed. 1022, 35 C. C. A. 172). And see American Express Co. v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 522, 531\n, 534 S., 29 Sup. Ct. 315.\n As Taylor was not an employe of the railroad company and the express company was not within the Employers' Liability Act, it follows that the act has no bearing on the liability of either company or on the validity of the messenger's agreement.\n\n 4. \nThere being no statute regulating the subject, it is settled by the decisions of this court, and is recognized in other jurisdictions that the messenger's agreement was a valid and binding contract whereby Taylor agreed to assume all risk of injury incident to his employment, from whatever cause arising, assented to the contractual arrangement between the two companies in respect of such injuries, and became obligated to the express company to refrain from asserting any liability against it or the railroad company on account of any such injuries. Express Cases, \n117 U.S. 1\n, 6 Sup. Ct. 542, 628; Baltimore & Ohio Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Voigt, \n176 U.S. 498\n, 20 Sup. Ct. 385, and cases cited; Santa Fe, \n\n[254 U.S. 175, 189]\n\u00a0\n etc., Ry. Co. v. Grant Bros. Construction Co., \n228 U.S. 177\n, 33 Sup. Ct. 474; Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. R.

Co., 229 Fed. 373, 143 C. C. A. 493. In violation of that agreement he wrongfully sought and obtained a judgment against the railroad company, which as between the two companies the express company is bound to pay. The judgment was obtained in an action to which that company was not a party and wherein it could not be heard. He is financially irresponsible and if the judgment is collected the express company, which has not been in any wise negligent or at fault, will be remediless. In these circumstances, that company is entitled in equity and good conscience, as is shown by the cases before cited, to a decree holding him to his agreement and depriving him of his present inequitable advantage, and to that end enjoining him from collecting the judgment.\n It follows that the decree of the District Court was right and that the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in reversing it.\n Decree reversed. \n\n\n\n","191":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TEL. CO. v. SPEIGHT(1920)\nNo. 241\nArgued: October 12, 1920Decided: October 25, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Rush Taggart, of New York City, Charles W. Tillett, of Charlotte, N. C., and Francis R. Stark, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Murray Allen, of Raleign, N. C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit brought in a state court by the respondent against the petitioner, the Telegraph Company, to recover \n\n[254 U.S. 17, 18]\n\u00a0\n for mental suffering caused by a mistake in delivering a telegraphic message. The message handed to the defendant was 'Father died this morning. Funeral tomorrow, 10:10 a. m.,' and was dated January 24. As delivered to the plaintiff on January 24 it was dated January 23 and thus caused her to fail to attend the funeral which otherwise she would have done. The message was from Greenville, North Carolina, to Rosemary in the same State and was transmitted from Greenville through Richmond, Virginia, and Norfolk, to Roanoke Rapids, the delivery point for Rosemary. This seems to have been the route ordinarily used by the Company for years, and the Company defends on the ground that the message was sent in interstate commerce, and that therefore a suit could not be maintained for mental suffering alone. Southern Express Co. v. Byers, \n240 U.S. 612\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 410, L. R. A. 1917A, 197. The jury found that the message was sent out of North Carolina into Virginia for the purpose of fraudulently evading liability under the law of North Carolina and gave the plaintiff a verdict. The presiding judge then set the verdict aside 'as a matter of law' and ordered a nonsuit. But on appeal the Supreme Court of the State set aside the nonsuit and directed that a judgment be entered on the verdict.\n We are of opinion that the judge presiding at the trial was right and that the Supreme Court was wrong. Even if there had been any duty on the part of the Telegraph Company to confine the transmission to North Carolina, it did not do so. The transmission of a message through two states is interstate commerce as a matter of fact. Hanley v. Kansas City Southern Ry. Co., \n187 U.S. 617\n, 23 Sup. Ct. 214. The fact must be tested by the actual transaction. Kirmeyer v. Kansas, \n236 \nU.S. 568, 572\n, 35 S. Sup. Ct. 419.\n As the line was arranged and had been arranged for many years, ever since Roanoke Rapids had been an independent office, Richmond was the relay point from \n\n[254 U.S. 17, 19]\n\u00a0\n Greenville to the latter place. The message went through Weldon, North Carolina, and was telegraphed back from Richmond, as Weldon business also was. It would have been possible, physically, to send direct from Weldon but would have required a rearrangement of the wires and more operators. The course adopted was more convenient and less expensive for the Company and there was nothing to show motives except the facts. As things were, the message was sent in the quickest way. The court below did not rely primarily upon the finding of the jury as to the purpose of the arrangement but held that when as here the termini were in the same State the business was intrastate unless it was necessary to cross the territory of another State in order to reach the final point. This, as we have said, is not the law. It did however lay down that the burden was on the Company to show that what was done 'was not done to evade the jurisdiction of the State.' If the motive were material, as to which we express no opinion, this again is a mistake. The burden was on the plaintiff to make out her case. Moreover the motive would not have made the business intrastate. If the mode of transmission adopted had been unreasonable as against the plaintiff, a different question would arise, but in that case the liability, if it existed, would not be a liability for an intrastate transaction that never took place but for the unwarranted conduct and the resulting loss.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice PITNEY concurs in the result. \n\n\n\n","192":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH CO. v. BOEGLI(1920)\nNo. 83\nArgued: Decided: January 12, 1920\n\n\n\n Messrs. Rush Taggart and Francis Raymond Stark, both of New York City, Samuel O. Pickens, Charles W. Moores, and Robert Franklin Davidson, all of Indianapolis, Ind., for plaintiff in error.\n Mr. Arthur W. Parry, of Ft. Wayne, Ind., for defendant in error.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Telegraph Company challenged the right to subject it to a penalty fixed by a law of Indiana for failure to deliver promptly in that state a telegram sent there from a point in Illinois, on the ground that the Act of Congress of June 18, 1910 (36 Stat. 539, 545, c. 309), amending the Act to Regulate Commerce (Act Feb. 4, 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379), had deprived the state of all power in the premises. The court conceding that if the act of Congress \n\n[251 U.S. 315, 316]\n\u00a0\n dealt with the subject the state statute would be inoperative, imposed the penalty on the ground that the act of 1910 did not extend to that field. The correctness of this conclusion is the one controversy with which the arguments are concerned.\n The proposition that the act of 1910 must be narrowly construed so as to preserve the reserved power of the state over the subject in hand, although it is admitted that that power is in its nature federal and may be exercised by the state only because of nonaction by Congress, is obviously too conflicting and unsound to require further notice. We therefore consider the statute in the light of its text and, if there be ambiguity, of its context, in order to give effect to the intent of Congress as manifested in its enactment.\n As the result of doing so, we are of opinion that the provisions of the statute bringing telegraph companies under the Act to Regulate Commerce as well as placing them under the administrative control of the Interstate Commerce Commission so clearly establish the purpose of Congress to subject such companies to a uniform national rule as to cause it to be certain that there was no room thereafter for the exercise by the several states of power to regulate, by penalizing the negligent failure to deliver promptly, an interstate telegram and that the court below erred therefore in imposing the penalty fixed by the state statute.\n We do not pursue the subject further since the effect of the act of 1910 in taking possession of the field was recently determined in exact accordance with the conclusion we have just stated. Postal Telegraph Cable Co. v. Warren-Godwin Lumber Co., \n251 U.S. 27\n, 40 Sup. Ct. 69, 64 L. Ed . --. That case, indeed, was concerned only with the operation, after the passage of the act of 1910, of a state statute rendering illegal a clause of a contract for sending an interstate telegram limiting the amount of recovery under the conditions stated in case of an unrepeated message; but the \n\n[251 U.S. 315, 317]\n\u00a0\n ruling that the effect of the act of 1910 was to exclude the possibility thereafter of applying the state law was rested, not alone upon the special provisions of the act of 1910 relating to unrepeated messages, but upon the necessary effect of the general provisions of that act bringing telegraph companies under the control of the Interstate Commerce Act. The contention as to the continuance of state power here made is therefore adversely foreclosed. Indeed, in the previous case the principal authorities here relied upon to sustain the continued right to exert state power after the passage of the act of 1910 were disapproved and various decisions of state courts of last resort to the contrary, one or more dealing with the subject now in hand, were approvingly cited.\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. \n\n\n\n","193":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH CO. v.

A judgment was recevered against the telegraph company in the District Court, which was affirmed in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 248 Fed. 656, 160 C. C. A. 556. The case is here upon writ of certiorari.\n Upon stipulation the case was tried in the District Court without a jury, and the court made findings from which it appears: On March 16, 1907, W. C. Pitt and W. T. Campbell entered into a contract with Hastings and Lange for the sale of 625,000 shares of the capital stock of the Kennedy Consolidated Gold Mining Company. In this contract it was stipulated that Pitt and Campbell agreed to sell and deliver to Hastings and Lange, who agreed to buy, take, and receive from them, 625,000 shares of the Kennedy Consolidated Gold Mining Company, upon the following terms and conditions: First. The total price to be paid for the shares of stock to be $75,000 in gold coin of the United States payable $7,500 on the execution of the agreement; $11,250 on or before the 1st day of May, 1907; and the like sum on or before the 5th of July, 1907, the 5th of September, 1907, the 5th of November, 1907, the 5th of January, 1908, and the 5th of March, 1908. It was agreed that immediately upon payment of the first-named sum Pitt and Campbell would deposit in escrow in and with the Lyon County Bank, of Yerington, Nev., certificates of stock indorsed in blank representing in the aggregate 625,00 shares of the capital stock of the mining company, and would thereupon enter into an escrow agreement with Hastings and Lange and the bank, under which agreement the bank should hold the shares of stock to be delivered to Hastings and Lange upon the payment by them of the final sum provided for, and the bank was constituted the agent of Pitt and Campbell for the purpose of receiving the payments \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 105]\n\u00a0\n under the agreement, and it was further agreed that in event of default by Hastings and Lange the bank should be authorized, under the terms of such deposit in escrow, to deliver all the shares of stock so deposited with it to Pitt and Campbell, and all payments theretofore made by Hastings and Lange should be forfeited to Pitt and Campbell, and that thereupon all rights of each of the parties should forever cease and terminate. Hastings and Lange paid to Pitt and Campbell the initial sum of $7,500, and Pitt and Campbell deposited in escrow with the Lyon County Bank certificates of stock representing 625,000 shares of the stock of the mining company properly indorsed, and the bank received said certificates in escrow and held the same in accordance with the contract. After the execution of the contract Hastings and Lange arranged with the bank to treat drafts that they might send it in partial payment as gold coin, and to pay the amount of such drafts in gold coin to Pitt and Campbell under said contract; that for the purpose of making the payment mentioned in the contract which became due on or before May 1, 1907, Hastings and Lange on April 27, 1907, sent by mail from Oakland, Cal., to the Lyon County Bank, at Yerington, Nev., a draft for the sum of $11,250 United States gold coin, payable to the order of the bank; that the draft was received by the bank at Yerington, Nev., on April 30, 1907, some time between 8:30 a. m., the time the bank opened for business, and 9 o'clock a. m. of that day; that on April 29, 1907, before the message hereinafter mentioned was delivered to the telegraph company, Hastings and Lange were informed and believed that the stock of the mining company was of little or no value, and upon obtaining such information they determined to make no further payments on their contract with Pitt and Campbell, and to abandon their rights in and to said stock, and to withdraw from the transaction with Pitt and Campbell. It is further found \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 106]\n\u00a0\n that on the evening of April 29, 1907, plaintiffs called at the office of the defendant in Oakland, Cal., and requested the agent in charge to telegraph the Lyon County Bank at Yerington, Nev., as follows:\n'Oakland, April 29, 1907\n\n\n\n'Lyon County Bank, Yerington, Nevada.\n\n'Draft mailed you Saturday under mistake. Do not pay any sum to Pitt and Campbell. Return draft. Letter follows.\n\n'Hastings and Lange.'\n\n Hastings and Lange stated to the agent of the telegraph company that it was necessary that the message be delivered to the bank before banking hours on the following morning, that is, before it opened for business on the 30th day of April, 1907, and desired to know of the agent in what manner they could be absolutely assured that the message would be so delivered, stating to the agent that they had a contract for the purchase of certain shares of stock of a mining company, and that payment under the contract was required to be made by them on or before May 1, 1907, to Pitt and Campbell through the bank, and that in default thereof the contract to purchase the stock would by its terms be forfeited, and the right of the parties thereto would cease and terminate; that for the purpose of making the payment they had mailed to the bank a certain bank draft in the sum of $ 11,250; that in the ordinary course of the mail between the city of Oakland, Cal., and the town of Yerington, Nev., the same would be delivered to the bank on the following morning, that is to say, during the forenoon of April 30, 1907; that since mailing the draft they had learned facts touching the value of the stock which had determind them to make no further payments and to forfeit the contract and all money by them paid thereunder; that they were seeking \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 107]\n\u00a0\n by the message to intercept payment by the bank on account of the contract through said Pitt and Campbell; and that unless such message were transmitted, and delivered immediately to the bank before banking hours on April 30, 1907, it would receive the draft and make payment of the amount thereof to Pitt and Campbell, in which event the amount would be wholly lost to them, as they did not intend to continue under their contract, having learned that the stock was of little or no value. It was further found that thereupon the agent represented that the telegraph company would insure the immediate delivery of the message to the bank at Yerington if plaintiffs would pay the sum of $1.45, which sum was in excess of the company's regular charge. Plaintiff accepted the proposal, and paid the sum to the agent. In the presence of the plaintiffs the agent thereupon wrote upon the message, immediately below the date thereof, the words, 'Deliver immediately,' transmission to the town of Yerington for immediate transmission to the town of Yerington for immediately delivery to the bank and agreed to immediately transmit and immediately deliver it to the bank for the plaintiffs, and assured the plaintiffs of such immediate transmission and immediate delivery thereof. The sum of $1.45 was in excess of the defendant's regular charge and usual toll; the usual charge for an unrepeated message being 98 cents, and for a repeated message the sum of $1.47. The message was written upon a blank form of the telegraph company, which is set forth in the findings.\n It is further found that neither Hastings nor Lange read the printed matter on the blank, nor was either of them cognizant of the terms and conditions written thereon; the message was not repeated in the manner provided in the stipulations on the blank; that the regular course of communication by telegraph between Oakland, Cal., and Yerington, Nev., was by the lines of the Western Union Telegraph Company to Wabuska, Nev., which \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 108]\n\u00a0\n was the terminus of the telegraph company's lines for Yerington messages, and that in order to transmit telegrams beyond Wabuska it was necessary that they be transmitted from that point over the telephone line of the electric company to Yerington; that each of the companies received all messages offered it by the other company for further transmission, subject to the stipulations on telegraphic blanks, each company having and charging their separate toll; that the offices of the electric company and the telegraph company were both maintained in the Southern Pacific Railway Company station at Wabuska, and that the telephone instrument of the electric company was within a few feet of the telegraphic instruments of the telegraph company; that at the time the Southern Pacific Railroad Company employed an agent at Wabuska to attend to its railway business, and that by an arrangement between the railroad company and the telegraph company said agent was employed to attend to the telegraph business of the telegraph company at Wabuska; that by agreement between the railroad company and the electric company the agent of the railroad company was at the same time employed by the electric company to handle the telephone business of the electric company; that there was a regular stage line open between Yerington Wabuska in April and May, 1907; that the distance between Yerington and Wabuska was approximately 11 miles, and could be traversed in the stage in about 1 1\/2 hours.\n It is found that the telegraph company did not promptly, upon the receipt of the message on the evening of April 29, 1907, transmit it to the town of Wabuska, Nev.; that the defendant did not promptly deliver the message to the electric company for further transmission over its telephone line to Wabuska, Nev., but, on the contrary, defendant wholly failed and neglected \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 109]\n\u00a0\n to transmit th message to Wabuska until May 2, 1907, and wholly failed and neglected to deliver it to the electric company until May 2, 1907; that the delay in the transmission of the message occurred wholly on the lines of the telegraph company, and was caused by that company, and did not occur on the lines of the telephone of the Yerington Electric Company.\n It is further found that, if the telegraph company had proceeded with reasonable promptness to transmit and deliver the message to the bank, the same would have reached Yerington before the bank had received the draft mailed to it as aforesaid, and it would not have placed the amount represented thereby to the credit of Pitt and Campbell, or either of them, or paid any amount thereon; that by reason of the gross negligence of the telegraph company the message was not delivered to the bank until May 2, 1907, between the hours of 8:30 and 9 a. m.; that the bank had received the draft, and thereafter, on April 30, had paid over the amount thereof in gold coin to Pitt and Campbell pursuant to the terms of the contract between the plaintiffs and Pitt and Campbell on account of the payment to be made on or before May 1, 1907, and had given credit to Hastings and Lange for the amount of said payment, all of which was done without any knowledge of said message or the determination of Hastings and Lange to recall said draft; that Hastings and Lange did not make any further payments on the purchase price of said shares of stock, but abandoned the contract with Pitt and Campbell and forfeited and lost all moneys paid thereon.\n It was found that the 625,000 shares of stock of the Kennedy Consolidated Gold Mining Company have been at all times, and since and including April 29, 1907, practically valueless.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held: (1) That the contract was an option terminable by the buyers' failure to \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 110]\n\u00a0\n make the payments required; (2) the oral agreement for the transmission of the message was a binding agreement upon the Western Union Telegraph Company; (3) that under the circumstances the telegraph company was guilty of gross negligence in failing to transmit and deliver the message. The court thereupon affirmed the judgment of the District Court for the amount of the payment, adding interest.\n In our view of the case it is unnecessary to consider the correctness of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals as to the binding obligaion of the oral contract made with the agent of the telegraph company, or the question of negligence of the company in the transmission and delivery of the message. The right of Hastings and Lange to recover was based upon the theory that the contract was an option terminable by the act of the buyer in failing to make the payment on the contract, which payment, it is found, would not have been made had the message been promptly delivered. An option is a privilege given by the owner of property to another to buy the property at his election. It secures the privilege to buy and is not of itself a purchase. The owner does not sell his property; he gives to another the right to buy at his election.\n What, then, is the nature of this agreement? It contains the positive undertaking of the owner to sell and the purchaser to buy 625,000 shares of stock upon terms which are named. Upon the first payment being made, the certificates are to be deposited with the bank in escrow, to be delivered when the final payment agreed upon is made, and in event of default in payment the bank is authorized to deliver the shares of stock to Pitt and Campbell, and all payments are to be forfeited, and the rights of the parties to cease and determine. We are of opinion that this is far more than a mere option to purchase, terminable at the will of the purchaser upon failure \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 111]\n\u00a0\n to make the payments required. The agreement contains positive provisions binding the owner to sell and the purchaser to buy upon the terms of the instrument. It is true the stock is to be deposited with the bank in escrow, and it is authorized to dl iver the same to Pitt and Campbell upon default in payment. The findings do not show whether Pitt and Campbell took back the stock upon default of subsequent payments. There was no understanding that Pitt and Campbell should take back the stock when the payments were not made, and no agreement which put it in the power of the purchasers to relieve themselves of the obligations of their contract by failing to keep up the payments. The right of Pitt and Campbell to receive the stock from the bank and end the contract was stipulated; it was a provision inserted for their benefit, of which they might avail themselves at their election.\n In our opinion Stewart v. Griffith, \n217 U.S. 323\n, 30 Sup. Ct. 528, 19 Ann. Cas. 639, is controlling upon this point. In that case there was a sale of land, and the purchaser by the terms of the agreement paid $500 as part of the purchase price. It was provided that in case of nonpayment of the balance of the first half of the purchase price on November 7, 1907, the $500 paid on the contract was to be forfeited, and the contract of sale and conveyance was to be null and void and of no effect. The contention was that the defendant was free to withdraw from the contract if he chose to lose the $500. But this court held, after considering the terms of the contract, that the $500 was part of the purchase price to be paid; that the land was described as being sold; and that in view of such stipulations, the purchaser had bound himself to take the land. As to the provision for the forfeiture of the $500, and the stipulation that the contract should become null and void upon nonpayment of the remainder of the purchase price, this court said:\n'The condition plainly is for the benefit of \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 112]\n\u00a0\n the vendor and hardly less plainly for his benefit alone, except so far as it may have fixed a time when Stewart might have called for performance if he had chosen to do so, which he did not. This being so, the word 'void' means voidable at the vendor's election and the condition may be insisted upon or waived at his choice. Insurance Co. v. Norton, \n96 U.S. 234\n; Oakes v. Manufacturers' Insurance Co., 135 Mass. 248, 249; Titus v. Glen Falls Insurance Co., 81 N. Y. 410, 419.'\n\n The condition in the contract in Stewart v. Griffith that nonpayment should render the contract null and void is the equivalent of the stipulation in the present agreement, much relied upon by the respondent, that upon nonpayment of the stipulated sums the rights of each of said parties should cease and determine. We think the attempted distinction between Stewart v. Griffith and the instant case is untenable.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reinforced its conclusion that the contract was an option by stating that it was usual to sell mining property under privileges of purchase, and, when investigation showed that the property was not valuable, to terminate such options by forfeiting the sums paid therefor, and declining to make future payments. It is true that undeveloped mining property is often sold under option agreements. See 3 Lindley on Mines,  859. But there is nothing to show that this contract was dependent upon the development of the mining property. The written agreement contains a positive undertaking to sell, upon the one part, and, upon the other part, to buy shares of the mining stock. Whether the shares sold constituted all the shares of the company does not appear. Nor is the relative proportion of those sold to the whole amount of the stock anywhere shown. The fact that the contract contains a privilege of ending it at the election of the vendor for nonpayment of the sum stipulated does not convert it into an option terminable \n\n[253 U.S. 101, 113]\n\u00a0\n by the purchasers at their will. Stewart v. Griffith, supra.\n As the recovery of the amount paid, with interest, as adjudged in the Circuit Court of Appeals, is founded upon its conclusion that the contract was an option, and the damages the amount paid and forfeited by the failure to stop the payment of the r aft, and as we are not able to accept that view of the contract, it follows that the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals must be reversed, and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity to this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","194":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWHITE v.

C. A. 569. The judgment of the Court of Appeals reversed that of the District Court, the latter court having remanded respondent to the custody of the Commissioner for deportation.\n The evidence establishes the fact that respondent entered the United States as a merchant and was such at a fixed place of bui ness for at least a year before his departure for China and that his stay in China was intended to be temporary. He hence contends that the Commissioner, as representing the executive branch of the government, had no authority to determine that his original entry was unlawful. This contention the District Court ruled against and the Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of, and constitutes the question in the case. The Circuit Court of Appeals, by Circuit Judge Morrow, passing upon it said:\n'The acting Secretary of Labor in approving the decision of the Commissioner of Immigration did so upon the ground that 'the original entry of this man [respondent] was obtained by fraud,' but this was not the question submitted to the Commissioner of Immigration or to the Secretary of Labor for \n\n[253 U.S. 90, 92]\n\u00a0\n decision. The question was not whether the applicant was legally admitted in 1896-1897 or 1906. The question was whether he had been a merchant in the United States at least one year before his departure from the United States in 1912. Chin Fong v. Backus, \n241 U.S. 1\n-5, 36 Sup. Ct. 490.'\n\n And upon that question it was decided that--\n'The evidence was all one way, establishing beyond controversy all of the facts required by the statute and the rule of the Department of Labor.'\n\n The conclusion was that the Commissioner did not consider this evidence or pass upon it, but deciding that appellee's original entry was fraudulent, ordered his deportation. In other words, it was held that the Commissioner ignored the question presented to him and the evidence pertaining to it, reviewed and reversed the judgment of another time and tribunal, took away the right that had been exercised under it and which gave the assurance that respondent could go to China and return again. The order of deportation was, therefore, declared to be void. For this the court cited the case of Chin Fong v. Backus, supra, \n241 U.S. 1\n, 36 Sup. Ct. 490, and the various statutes applicable to the exclusion of Chinese persons from entry into the United States. 22 Stat. 58 (Comp. St.  4290-4302, 4359); 23 Stat. 115 (Comp. St.  4290 et seq.); 25 Stat. 476 (Comp. St.  4306-4314); 31 Stat. 1093 (Comp. St.  4332- 4334); and the Act of Nov. 3, 1893, 28 Stat. 7 (Comp. St.  4320, 4324).\n In the case of United States v. Woo Jan, \n245 U.S. 552\n, 38 Sup. Ct. 207, we had occasion to consider the difference between the situation of a Chinese person in the United States, and one seeking to enter it; and held that the former was entitled to a judicial inquiry and determination of his rights, and that the latter was subject to executive action and decision. We think the distinction is applicable here, and that one who has been in the United States and has departed from it with the intention of returning, is entitled under existing legislation to have his right to do so judicially investigated with 'its assurances and sanctions,' \n\n[253 U.S. 90, 93]\n\u00a0\n as contrasted with the discretion which may prompt or the latitude of judgment which may be exercised in executive action.\n And such is the provision of the Act of November 3, 1893 (28 Stat. 7). It is there provided that a Chinaman who applies for admission into the United States on the ground that he was formerly engaged therein as a merchant, must establish the fact by two credible witnesses, other than Chinese, that he was such at least one year before his departure from the United States, and had not engaged during such year in any manual labor except what was necessary in the conduct of his business.\n The government appeals against the explicit words of the provision to the purpose of the exclusion laws, which is, it is said, to keep the country free from undesirable Chinese, or, if they fraudulently enter, to expel them, and it is insisted that it would be a perfunctory execution of the purpose to let one in who may be immediately put out again. That intention it is urged, should not be ascribed to the laws, and in emphasis, it  said, 'such a legislative absurdity is unthinkable.' But this overlooks the difference in the security of judicial over administrative action, to which we have adverted, and which this court has declared, and in the present case, the right that had been adjudged and had been exercised in reliance upon the adjudication.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWORTH BROS CO. v.

Wintersteen, of Philadelphia, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Assistant Attorney General Frierson, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ is directed to the judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals affirming a judgment of the District Court for Lederer, to whom we shall refer as the collector, \n\n[251 U.S. 507, 508]\n\u00a0\n in an action by petitioner to recover from him the sum of $74,857.07 exacted as a tax under section 301 of the Munition Manufacturer's Tax Act of September 8, 1916, 39 Stat. 756, 781, (Comp. St.  6336 1\/4 b), and paid by petitioner under protest.\n A detail of the imposition of the tax and the protest of its payment are unnecessary to give. The other facts were stipulated and it appears from the stipulation that during the taxable year 1916 petitioner made the steel for and did the forging on certain shell bodies under an order from the Midvale Steel Company, to enable the latter company to carry out a contract which it had with the government of France for certain explosive shells. The steel was made and the forging done by petitioner in accordance with specifications required by the French government, which specifications were attached to the order from the Midvale Steel Company to petitioner.\n Inspectors employed by the French government inspected the work done by petitioner, testing the steel and examining the forgings as they passed through petitioner's hands. 'Up to the time when the blooms of steel were sliced partly through into billets, the right of inspection was exercised by the French inspector in chief, only whenever he desired to exercise it.' Some forgings were rejected, and those that were passed were so marked by the inspector. This was done in accordance with an understanding between petitioner and the Midvale Steel Company.\n The profits upon which the tax was claimed in this case was imposed were derived solely from the sale of the above-mentioned forgings.\n The Munitions Tax Act provides (section 301, 39 Stat. c. 463, p. 781):\n'That every person manufacturing' certain articles and 'shells' 'or any part of the articles mentioned ... shall pay for each taxable year, in addition to the income tax imposed by title I, an excise tax of twelve and one-half per centum upon the entire net \n\n[251 U.S. 507, 509]\n\u00a0\n profits actually received or accrued for said year from the sale or disposition of such articles manufactured within the United States.'\n\n The question is the simple and direct one whether a shell forging under the stipulation and evidence is 'any part of a shell' within the meaning of the law. The argument of petitioner in support of a negative answer is very diffuse, pressing considerations which we do not think are relevant.\n A shell is a definite article, constituted of materials of a e rtain kind and quality, assembled and fitted and finished so as to be adequate for its destructive purposes. Is not every element (we use the word for want of a better) in the aggregation or composition or amalgamation ( whichever it is) of a shell, a part of it? It not, what is it? And what is the test to distinguish a part from not a part? We use the negative, as an antithetic word does not occur to us to express that something necessary to constitute a thing is not a part of it. Petitioner surmounts the difficulty by contending that the law by its words 'any part' of any of the 'shells' implies a substantially finished part, as related to the whole structure and to the purpose it is intended to subserve. 'Otherwise,' counsel say 'the word [part] loses all precision and becomes equivalent to the words 'ingredient' or 'material composing or making up.\" And to sustain this view they take us to the dictionaries and to an enumeration of the processes to which the material must be subjected to make a forging, and those afterwards to prepare it for a shell. In this enumeration letters of the alphabet are used of which 'A, B, C, and H represent stages of development of the material prior to delivery' to the Midvale Company, and 'D, E, F, G. H. I, and K represent stages of development by Midvale after delivery to it.' It is quite obvious of course as counsel declare, that the forgings were 'not shells, since a shell is a composite structure of several parts.' But \n\n[251 U.S. 507, 510]\n\u00a0\n counsel go farther and say that the forgings were 'not parts of shells in any practical and legal sense because their development was so far short- 80 per cent.-of the point where they could be related to or combined with any other component of the shell structure, that they could not satisfy any fair meaning of the shell body unit as entering into the composite shell as a whole.' We give counsel's words because we fear that by paraphrasing them we might not correctly represent their meaning and contention.\n We reject the contention. Congress did not intend to subject its legislation to such artificialities and make it depend upon distinctions so refined as to make a part of a shell not the taxable 'part' of the law. Besides petitioner understates its work. It did not deliver raw material to the Midvale Company. Certain processes had been performed on the material giving it a shape adapted to its destination. It was made cylindrical, hollow, with one end closed. It was rough, it is true, but an advance upon the raw material.\n The progressive processes need not be enumerated. The lower courts have enumerated them and the Court of Appeals describing them said that the 'steps' 'six in all,' were progressive advances toward the chemical constituents, the shape and dimensions required by and essential to, the manufacture of shells in compliance with the contract.' And the court distinguished the effect of the steps. With the fourth, it was said, the inspection by the French government began; the fifth took the fiuid metal [ the result of the second step] from the possibility of use for general commercial purposes and by a forging process restricted the steel to the field of use for shells. By the sixth step this forging 'was drawn to a length, and to an inside and outside diameter which enabled the Midvale Company to carry forward its 29 progressive steps, which the 6' of \n\n[251 U.S. 507, 511]\n\u00a0\n petitioner 'were required to complete the manufactured shell of the contract.'\n'Manifestly,' as counsel for the collector says, 'the shell body was not completely manufactured by either of the companies which were engaged in its production,' but 'by the two acting together.'
