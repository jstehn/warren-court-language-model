CITY OF BALTIMORE(1833)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1833\n\n\n ERROR to the Court of Appeals for the Western Shore of the state of Maryland. This case was instituted by the plaintiff in error, against the city of Baltimore, under its corporate title of 'The Mayor and City Council of Baltimore,' to recover damages for injuries to the wharf- property of the plaintiff, arising from the acts of the corporation. Craig & Barron, of whom the plaintiff was survivor, were owners of an extensive and highly productive wharf, in the eastern section of Baltimore, enjoying, at the period of their purchase of it, the deepest water in the harbor. The city, in the asserted exercise of its corporate authority over the harbor, the paving of streets, and regulating grades for paving, and over the health of Baltimore, diverted from their accustomed and natural course, certain streams of water which flow from the range of hills bordering the city, and diverted them, partly by adopting new grades of streets, and partly by the necessary results of paving, and partly by mounds, \n\n[32 U.S. 243, 244]\n\u00a0\n embankments and other artificial means, purposely adapted to bend the course of the water to the wharf in question. These streams becoming very full and violent in rains, carried down with them from the hills and the soil over which they ran, large masses of sand and earth, which they deposited along, and widely in front of the wharf of the plaintiff. The alleged consequence was, that the water was rendered so shallow that it ceased to be useful for vessels of an important burden, lost its income, and became of little or no value as a wharf. This injury was asserted to have been inflicted by a series of ordinances of the corporation, between the years 1815 and 1821; and that the evil was progressive; and that it was active and increasing even at the institution of this suit in 1822.\n At the trial of the cause, in the Baltimore county court, the plaintiff gave evidence tending to prove the original and natural course of the streams, the various works of the corporation, from time to time, to turn them in the direction of this wharf, and the ruinous consequences of these measures to the interests of the plaintiff. It was not asserted by the defendants, that any compensation for the injury was ever made or proffered; but they justified under the authority they deduced from the charter of the city, granted by the legislature of Maryland, and under several acts of the legislature conferring powers on the corporation, in regard to the grading and paving of streets, the regulation of the harbor and its waters, and to the health of the city. They also denied, that the plaintiff had shown any cause of action in the declaration, asserting that the injury complained of was a matter of public nuisance, and not of special or individual grievance in the eye of the law. This latter ground was taken on exception, and was also urged as a reason for a motion in arrest of judgment. On all points, the decision of Baltimore county court was against the defendants, and a verdict for $4500 was rendered for the plaintiff. An appeal was taken to the court of appeals, which reversed the judgment of Baltimore county court, and did not remand the case to that court for a further trial. From this judgment, the defendant in the court of appeals prosecuted a writ of error to this court. \n\n[32 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n The counsel for the plaintiff presented the following points: The plaintiff in error will contend, that apart from the legislative sanctions of the state of Maryland, and the acts of the corporation of Baltimore, holding out special encouragement and protection to interests in wharves constructed on the shores of the Patapsco river, and particularly of the wharf erected by Craig and the plaintiff, Barron; the right and profit of wharfage, and use of the water at the wharf, for the objects of navigation, was a vested interest and incorporeal hereditament, inviolable even by the state, except on just compensation for the privation; but the act of assembly and the ordinance of the city are relied on as enforcing the claim to the undisturbed enjoyment of the right.\n This right was interfered with, and the benefit of this property taken away from the plaintiff, by the corporation, avowedly, as the defence showed, for public use; for an object of public interest-the benefit more immediately of the community of Baltimore, the individuals, part of the population of Maryland, known by the corporate title of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore. The 'inhabitants' of Baltimore are thus incorporated by the acts of 1796, ch. 68. As a corporation, they are made liable to be sued, and authorized to sue, to acquire and hold and dispose of property and, within the scope of the powers conferred by the charter, are allowed to pass ordinance and legislative acts, which it is declared by the charter, shall have the same effect as acts of assembly, and be operative, provided they be not repugnant to the laws of the state, or the constitution of the state, or of the United States. The plaintiff will contend accordingly:\n\n 1. \nThat the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore, though viewed even as a municipal corporation, is liable for tort and actual misfeasance; and that it is a tort, and would be so, even in the state, acting in her immediate sovereignty, to deprive a citizen of his property, though for public uses, without indemnification; that regarding the corporation as acting with the delegated power of the state, the act complained of is not the less an actionable tort.\n\n 2. \nThat this is the case of an authority exercised under a \n\n[32 U.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n state; the corporation appealing to the legislative acts of Maryland for the discretional power which it has exercised. 3. That this exercise of authority was repugnant to the constitution of the United States, contravening the fifth article of the amendments to the constitution, which declares that 'private property shall not be taken for public use, without just compensation;' the plaintiff contending, that this article declares principles which regulate the legislation of the states, for the protection of the people in each and all the states, regarded as citizens of the United States, or as inhabitants subject to the laws of the Union. 4. That under the evidence, prayers and pleadings in the case, the constitutionality of this authority exercised under the state, must have been drawn in question, and that this court has appellate jurisdiction of the point, from the judgment of the court of appeals of Maryland, the highest court of that state; that point being the essential ground of the plaintiff's pretention, in opposition to the power and discussion of the corporation. 5. That this court, in such appellate cognisance, is not confined to the establishment of an abstract point of construction, but is empowered to pass upon the right or title of either party; and may, therefore, determine all points incidental or preliminary to the question of title, and necessary in the course to that inquiry; that consequently, the question is for this court's determination, whether the declaration avers actionable matter, or whether the complaint is only of a public nuisance; and on that head, the plaintiff will contend, that special damage is fully shown here, within the principle of the cases where an individual injury resulting from a public nuisance is deemed actionable; the wrong being merely public only so long as the law suffered in the particular case is no more than all members of the community suffer. Upon these views, the plaintiff contends, that the judgment of the court of appeals ought to be reversed. The counsel for the plaintiff in error, Mr. Mayer, on the suggestion of the court, confined the argument to the question whether, under the amendment to the constitution, the court had jurisdiction of the case. \n\n[32 U.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n The counsel for the defendants in error, Taney and Scott, were stopped by the court.\n\n MARSHALL, Ch. J., delivered the opinion of the court.\n The judgment brought up by this writ of error having been rendered by the court of a state, this tribunal can exercise no jurisdiction over it, unless it be shown to come within the provisions of the 25th section of the judiciary act. The plaintiff in error contends, that it comes within that clause in the fifth amendment to the constitution, which inhibits the taking of private property for public use, without just compensation. He insists, that this amendment being in favor of the liberty of the citizen, ought to be so construed as to restrain the legislative power of a state, as well as that of the United States. If this proposition be untrue, the court can take no jurisdiction of the cause.\n The question thus presented is, we think, of great importance, but not of much difficulty. The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves, for their own government, and not for the government of the individual states. Each state established a constitution for itself, and in that constitution, provided such limitations and restrictions on the powers of its particular government, as its judgment dictated. The people of the United States framed such a government for the United States as they supposed best adapted to their situation and best calculated to promote their interests. The powers they conferred on this government were to be exercised by itself; and the limitations on power, if expressed in general terms, are naturally, and, we think, necessarily, applicable to the government created by the instrument. They are limitations of power granted in the instrument itself; not of distinct governments, framed by different persons and for different purposes.\n If these propositions be correct, the fifth amendment must be understood as restraining the power of the general government, not as applicable to the states. In their several constitutions, they have imposed such restrictions on their respective \n\n[32 U.S. 243, 248]\n\u00a0\n governments, as their own wisdom suggested; such as they deemed most proper for themselves. It is a subject on which they judge exclusively, and with which others interfere no further than they are supposed to have a common interest.\n The counsel for the plaintiff in error insists, that the constitution was intended to secure the people of the several states against the undue exercise of power by their respective state governments; as well as against that which might be attempted by their general government. It support of this argument he relies on the inhibitions contained in the tenth section of the first article. We think, that section affords a strong, if not a conclusive, argument in support of the opinion already indicated by the court. The preceding section contains restrictions which are obviously intended for the exclusive purpose of restraining the exercise of power by the departments of the general government. Some of them use language applicable only to congress; others are expressed in general terms. The third clause, for example, declares, that 'no bill of attainder or ex post facto law shall be passed.' No language can be more general; yet the demonstration is complete, that it applies solely to the government of the United States. In addition to the general arguments furnished by the instrument itself, some of which have been already suggested, the succeeding section, the avowed purpose of which is to restrain state legislation, contains in terms the very prohibition. It declares, that 'no state shall pass any bill of attainder or ex post facto law.' This provision, then, of the ninth section, however comprehensive its language, contains no restriction on state legislation.\n The ninth section having enumerated, in the nature of a bill of rights, the limitations intended to be imposed on the powers of the general government, the tenth proceeds to enumerate those which were to operate on the state legislatures. These restrictions are brought together in the same section, and are by express words applied to the states. 'No state shall enter into any treaty,' &c. Perceiving, that in a constitution framed by the people of the United States, for the government of all, no limitation of the action of government on \n\n[32 U.S. 243, 249]\n\u00a0\n the people would apply to the state government, unless expressed in terms, the restrictions contained in the tenth section are in direct words so applied to the states.\n It is worthy of remark, too, that these inhibitions generally restrain state legislation on subjects intrusted to the general government, or in which the people of all the states feel an interest. A state is forbidden to enter into any treaty, alliance or confederation. If these compacts are with foreign nations, they interfere with the treaty-making power, which is conferred entirely on the general government; if with each other, for political purposes, they can scarcely fail to interfere with the general purpose and intent of the constitution. To grant letters of marque and reprisal, would lead directly to war; the power of declaring which is expressly given to congress. To coin money is also the exercise of a power conferred on congress. It would be tedious to recapitulate the several limitations on the powers of the states which are contained in this section. They will be found, generally, to restrain state legislation on subjects intrusted to the government of the Union, in which the citizens of all the states are interested. In these alone, were the whole people concerned. The question of their application to states is not left to construction. It is averred in positive words.\n If the original constitution, in the ninth and tenth sections of the first article, draws this plain and marked line of discrimination between the limitations it imposes on the powers of the general government, and on those of the state; if, in every inhibition intended to act on state power, words are employed, which directly express that intent; some strong reason must be assigned for departing from this safe and judicious course, in framing the amendments, before that departure can be assumed. We search in vain for that reason.\n Had the people of the several states, or any of them, required changes in their constitutions; had they required additional safe-guards to liberty from the apprehended encroachments of their particular governments; the remedy was in their own hands, and could have been applied by themselves. A \n\n[32 U.S. 243, 250]\n\u00a0\n convention could have been assembled by the discontented state, and the required improvements could have been made by itself. The unwieldy and cumbrous machinery of procuring a recommendation from two-thirds of congress, and the assent of three-fourths of their sister states, could never have occurred to any human being, as a mode of doing that which might be effected by the state itself. Had the framers of these amendments intended them to be limitations on the powers of the state governments, they would have imitated the framers of the original constitution, and have expressed that intention. Had congress engaged in the extraordinary occupation of improving the constitutions of the several states, by affording the people additional protection from the exercise of power by their own governments, in matters which concerned themselves alone, they would have declared this purpose in plain and intelligible language.\n But it is universally understood, it is a part of the history of the day, that the great revolution which established the constitution of the United States, was not effected without immense opposition. Serious fears were extensively entertained, that those powers which the patriot statesmen, who then watched over the interests of our country, deemed essential to union, and to the attainment of those unvaluable objects for which union was sought, might be exercised in a manner dangerous to liberty. In almost every convention by which the constitution was adopted, amendments to guard against the abuse of power were recommended. These amendments demanded security against the apprehended encroachments of the general government-not against those of the local governments. In compliance with a sentiment thus generally expressed, to quiet fears thus extensively entertained, amendments were proposed by the required majority in congress, and adopted by the states. These amendments contain no expression indicating an intention to apply them to the state governments. This court cannot so apply them.\n We are of opinion, that the provision in the fifth amendment to the constitution, declaring that private property shall not be taken for public use, without just compensation, is intended solely as a limitation on the exercise of power by the \n\n[32 U.S. 243, 251]\n\u00a0\n government of the United States, and is not applicable to the legislation of the states. We are, therefore, of opinion, that there is no repugnancy between the several acts of the general assembly of Maryland, given in evidence by the defendants at the trial of this cause, in the court of that state, and the constitution of the United States. This court, therefore, has no jurisdiction of the cause, and it is dismissed.\n THIS cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the record from the court of appeals for the western shore of the state of Maryland, and was argued by counsel: On consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this court, that there is no repugnancy between the several acts of the general assembly of Maryland, given in evidence by the defendants at the trial of this cause in the court of that state, and the constitution of the United States; whereupon, it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that this writ of error be and the same is hereby dismissed, for the want of jurisdiction. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Livingston v.

Craig v. Kline, 65 Penn. St. 399. The decisions upon the legislation under the 14th amendment to the constitutions, are worthy of the most careful consideration in this regard. It was determined at an early day (1869), that this amendment did not execute itself, but required legislation on the part of congress. Griffin's Case, Chase's Dec. 364. And this led to the passage of the civil rights act of the 1st March 1875 (18 U. S. Stat. 395). Under the 4th section of this act, it has been determined, that the amendment not only gave the privileges of citizenship to the colored race, but denied to any state the power to withhold from them the equal protection of the laws, and invested congress with power to enforce its provisions; consequently, that a state law which denied to them the right of serving as jurors, though qualified in other respects, was a violation of the constitution. Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 U.S. 303\n. And that an indictment will lie against a state officer, for excluding persons of color from the jury list. Ex parte Virginia, Id. 339. A \n state law confining the selection of jurors to persons possessing the qualifications of electors, was enlarged in its operation, by the 15th amendment, so as to embrace persons of the negro race. Neal v. Delaware, \n103 U.S. 370\n. But the prohibitions of the 14th amendment have exclusive reference to state action; it is the state which is prohibited from denying to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws; the federal statute was intended to protect the colored race against state action, and against that alone. Virginia v. Rives, \n100 U.S. 313\n; Neal v. Delaware, 103 Id. 370; Bush v. Kentucky, 107 Id. 110. And as a consequence of this doctrine, it has been determined, that the first and second sections of the civil rights act, which forbid the denial to persons of color of equal accommodations in inns, public conveyances and places of amusement, are unconstitutional, as not within the power of congress. United States v. Washington, 4 Woods 349; United States v. Stanley, \n109 U.S. 3\n. Judge BRADLEY there says, 'the implication of a power to legislate in this manner is based upon the assumption, that if the \n states are forbidden to legislate or act in a particular way, on a particular subject, and power is conferred upon congress to enforce the prohibition, this gives congress power to legislate generally upon that subject, and not merely power to provide means of redress against such state legislation or action. This assumption is certainly unsound. It is repugnant to the 10th amendment to the constitution, which declares, that powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states, respectively, or to the people.' A state law which prohibits a white person and a negro from living together in concubinage is not unconstitutional, though it prescribes penalties more severe, than if both were of the same race. Pace v. Alabama, \n106 U.S. 538\n. Neither does the amendment prevent a state from establishing one system of law, in one portion \n of its territory, and another system, in another portion. Missouri v. Lewis, \n101 U.S. 22\n. The 15th amendment does not confer upon the negro the right of suffrage; but it secures him from discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise, on account of race, color, &c., United States v. Reise, \n92 U.S. 214\n. The right to vote comes from the states; but the right of exemption from the prohibited discrimination comes from the United States; the first has not been granted or secured by the constitution, but the last has been.

If the court should be of opinion that, notwithstanding this amendment, jurisdiction could be entertained in a suit in the admiralty against a state, he asked that a citation in the nature of admiralty process, or such other proceedings in the case, as the court should deem proper, should be awarded against the state of Georgia, returnable to the next term of this court.\n The libel stated, that the libellant, Juan Madrazzo, was a \n\n[32 U.S. 627, 628]\n\u00a0\n subject of the king of Spain; that about the 2d of July 1817, a vessel called the Isabelita, owned by him, with all the documents on board to show her ownership and character, cleared out from the city of Havana, for the coast of Africa, with a cargo of merchandise, his property, to trade there, exclusively on Spanish account, for a cargo of slaves, to be conveyed to the said city, there to be disposed of for his sole account, property and risk. On the coast of Africa, the vessel took on board, purchased with the said merchandise, one hundred and twelve slaves, and on her return-voyage towards Havana, about the first of October 1817, she was captured by a piratical or insurgent cruiser, under the commission of one Aury, or some other revolutionary flag of the revolted colonies of Spain, not then recognised as an independent government, nor in any manner authorized to act as a belligerent power, by the laws or consent of nations. The capturing vessel was called the Successor, commanded by one Moore, an American citizen, and was fitted out at Baltimore, and in the river Severn, in the state of Maryland, for the purpose of carrying on hostilities against the property and subjects of the king of Spain, with whom the United States then were and still are at peace; wherefore, the said capture of the vessel was illegal, piratical and felonious.\n The Isabelita and her cargo were carried by the Successor into the port of Fernandina, in the island of Amelia, at that time a colony of Spain, but usurped by the pretended patriots or revolutionists affecting the rights of sovereignty, and a separate station as a revolted independent government, but in truth composed of a band of adventurers, chiefly American citizens, united principally by the hope of plunder, and not acknowledged as an independent government for any civil or national purpose. There, the Isabelita and her cargo were condemned as lawful prize to the illegally commissioned piratical vessel, the Successor, by a tribunal pretending to exercise admiralty jurisdiction, under the usurped and assumed government of the place.\n The vessel was afterwards restored to the libellant by a decree of the district court of the United States for the district of South Carolina, exercising jurisdiction as a court of admiralty, upon a libel filed for restitution on behalf of the libellant; the proceedings in that case were invoked and referred to. The \n\n[32 U.S. 627, 629]\n\u00a0\n slaves, the cargo of the Isabelita, were sold under the illegal decree pronounced at Fernandina, and by one William Bowen, the purchaser, were conveyed to the Creek nation, where, at a place called 'the United States Agency,' within the limits of the said nation, they were, to the number of ninety-five, seized and taken possession of by an officer of the United States, and brought within the limits and district of Georgia. These ninety-five slaves were subsequently delivered over to the government of the state of Georgia, on pretence that they had been illegally imported or introduced into the United States, contrary to an act of congress, and in compliance with an act of the assembly of the state of Georgia to carry the same into effect. A part of the slaves were sold by the government of Georgia, or its officers or agents, without any form of trial or judgment, as directed by the said act of assembly; and the proceeds thereof, to the amount of $40,000, paid into the treasury of the state of Georgia. The residue of the slaves, twenty-seven or thirty in number, remained in the possession of the state or its officers, or had been converted to or disposed of by the state, for its own use; or wrongfully delivered to some persons not entitled to the same, and contrary to the will of the libellant. The slaves, or the proceeds of those sold, could not rightfully become the property of the state of Georgia, by virtue of the piractical capture, seizure or cendemnation, or by the unlawful acts of the pretended purchaser of the same; but the same remained the property of the libellant.\n The libel further stated, that the governor of the state of Georgia, on the 20th of May 1820, on the pretence that the said negroes had been illegally transported to the Creek nation, and unlawfully imported into the United States from some foreign place, with intent to hold them to service and labor, filed a libel in the district court of the United States for the district of Georgia, alleging the unlawful importation, and that a demand of them had been made by the society for the colonization of free people of color in Africa; which the governor alleged he was desirous of complying with, if authorized to do so by a decree of the court. No specification was made of the number of the slaves, and no mention was made of the illegal seizure and \n\n[32 U.S. 627, 630]\n\u00a0\n sale of the slaves, in the information, or of the payment of the $40,000 into the treasury of the state of Georgia.\n The libel further stated, that William Bowen, who had purchased the slaves, the cargo of the Isabelita, put in a claim for the whole of the said slaves, on the 7th November 1820; alleging that they were his property, and were not intended to be introduced into the United States, but had been carried into the Creek nation for safety, with the intention to remove them to West Florida, a colony of Spain; the truth of which allegation the libellant admitted. The libellant, hearing of the proceedings in the district court of Georgia, filed a libel claiming the slaves; and the district court dismissed the claim of William Bowen and of the libellant, and decreed in favor of the governor of Georgia. That decree, on appeal to the circuit court of the United States was reversed; the claims of the state of Georgia and of William Bowen were dismissed; and that court decreed that the said slaves should be restored to the libellant, Juan Madrazzo, together with the proceeds of them, sold and paid into the treasury of the state of Georgia. From this decree, the governor of Georgia, on behalf of the state, appealed to this court.\n From the district court of the United States of Georgia, a warrant of arrest, upon the libel of this libellant was issued; but the execution being prevented or evaded by the government and officers of the state of Georgia, the same was never served. A monition was also issued, and served on the governor and treasurer of the state of Georgia.\n The libel proceeded to state the proceedings in the circuit court of the sixth circuit, in which it was ordered, that it should be held a sufficient execution of the warrant, if the governor of Georgia should sign an acknowledgment that the slaves were held by him, subject to the jurisdiction of the court; upon which, on the 15th of May 1823, John Clark, the governor of Georgia, signed a paper, filed in the court on the 24th December 1823, by which he acknowledged, that the governor of Georgia held the negroes levied on by virtue of sundry executions by the sheriff of Baldwin county, 'subject to the order of the circuit court of the United States for the district of Georgia, after the claim of the said sheriff, or prior thereto, if \n\n[32 U.S. 627, 631]\n\u00a0\n the claim in the circuit court shall be adjudged to have priority of the proceeding in the state court.'\n The libel stated, that the executions referred to had been levied on the slaves, as the property of William Bowen and the proceedings in the case showed that the same did not belong to him. That the libellant relied on the stipulation entered into by the governor of Georgia, by which the jurisdiction of the circuit court of the United States was admitted; and he proceeded to prosecute his appeal in the circuit court, in which no exception to its jurisdiction in the case was suggested or moved. In the circuit court, the rights of the libellant were established; the illegal outfit of the Successor was fully proved; and every other matter shown, to entitle him, as a Spanish subject, to the restitution of his plundered property. From the decree of the circuit court, appeals were entered to the supreme court of the United States.\n The libel then stated the proceedings in the cases in the supreme court, of January term 1828, as the same are reported in 1 Pet. 110, &c., and complained that the jurisdiction of the supreme court, in the case, was denied by the governor of Georgia, on behalf of the state, in direct violation of the stipulation entered into by him, consenting to, and acknowledging the said jurisdiction; by which the said court were prevented proceeding to give a decree or judgment in the case. That by reason of the proceedings aforesaid, and of other acts of the state of Georgia, her officers and agents, which the libel alleged to have been tortious, and by the sale and dispersion of the slaves, the libellant was prevented seizing or identifying his property; he was without remedy or redress, unless this court will cause the state of Georgia to do him right in the premises.\n Wherefore, the libellant prayed the court to award admiralty process against the state of Georgia, to be issued and served as the court might direct, citing the said state of Georgia, as well as all others concerned, to show cause why the proceeds of the said slaves, paid into the treasury of the said state, should not be paid over to the libellant; the slaves remaining in the possession of the state restored to him; a just and reasonable compensation decreed to him for the slaves, converted to her own \n\n[32 U.S. 627, 632]\n\u00a0\n use, or otherwise taken by the state; and such other damages allowed to him, as the owner of the slaves, as the court might think proper, against the state of Georgia, &c.\n\n MARSHALL, Ch. J., delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is not a case where the property is in custody of a court of admiralty, or brought within its jurisdiction, and in the possession of any private person; it is not, therefore, one for the exercise of that jurisdiction. It is mere personal suit against a state, to recover proceeds in its possession, and in such a case, no private person has a right to commence an original suit in this court against a state. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEX PARTE WATKINS(1833)\nNo. 40\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1833\n\n\n\n\n[32 U.S. 568, 569]\n\u00a0\n TOBIAS WATKINS, by Mr. Brent, his counsel, presented a petition to the court, setting forth that at the term of the circuit court of the district of Columbia, holden for the county of Washington, on the first Monday of May 1829, certain presentments and indictments were found against him, upon three of which indictments trials were had and verdicts passed against him, and judgments on such verdicts respectively were pronounced by the court, purporting to condemn him to certain terms of imprisonment, and also to the payment of certain pecuniary fines and costs, for the supposed offences therein. For the nature of those proceedings, the petitioner referred to the exemplifications filed in this court, with an application made to the court at January term 1830. (3 Pet. 193.)\n The petition stated, that immediately after the rendition of such judgments, and in pretended execution of the same, on the 14th day of August 1829, he, the petitioner, was committed to the common jail of the county of Washington, and there remained, until the terms of imprisonment imposed by the several judgments had expired, the same having expired on the 14th day of May 1830; and that ever since that time, he had been, and still was detained in the criminal apartment of the prison, under the color and pretence of authority, not only of the judgments, but of three certain writs issued on the 16th day of February 1830, by the clerk of the circuit court of Washington county, by special orders of the district- attorney of the United States for the district of Columbia, as he had been informed and believed, at the request and by direction of the president of the United States. That he was illegally detained in prison by the authority of the said writs, as he was well advised; and averred, that they give no authority for his commitment and detention, having been not only illegally and oppressively issued, but he had been by them deprived of the privilege secured to him by the laws of the land, to be released from imprisonment, on the ground of his insolvency, and being unable to pay his debts. \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 570]\n\u00a0\n The writs gave no authority for his present detention and imprisonment, for a longer period than the first Monday in May 1830; since which time, even admitting the writs to have been legally issued, his imprisonment had been illegal and oppressive, and without any authority whatever. That the fines were excessive, and as such, contrary to the laws of the land, as he was, at the time they were imposed, and ever since had been, unable to pay the same, and it was not the law of the land that a citizen should be confined for life for fines which he could not pay. He had been refused the benefit of the insolvent laws, and if relief could not be obtained from this court, from his inability to pay the fines, he would be confined for life.\n The petition prayed 'the benefit of the writ of habeas corpus, to be directed to the marshal of the district of Columbia, in whose custody, as keeper of said jail, your petitioner is, commanding him to bring before your honors the body of your petitioner, together with the cause of his commitment, and especially commanding him to return with said writ, the record of the proceedings upon said indictments, with the judgments thereupon, and the several writs under the supposed authority of which your petitioner is now detained, as aforesaid, in a criminal apartment of said jail, by the supposed authority, and in virtue of said several writs.' The court granted a rule to show cause, returnable on a subsequent day of the term.\n The case was argued by Brent and Coxe, for the relator; and by Taney, Attorney-General, for the United States.\n\n STORY, Justice, delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is an application to the court to award a writ of habeas corpus to bring up the body of Tobias Watkins, a prisoner asserted to be illegally confined in the common jail of Washington county, in the district of Columbia, under process of execution issued from the circuit court of the United States for the same district. A rule was served upon the attorney-general, to show cause why the application should not be granted; and the cause has been fully argued upon the return of that \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 571]\n\u00a0\n rule. It is admitted, that all the facts existing in the case have been laid before the court, exactly as they would appear, if the habeas corpus had been duly awarded and returned; so that the judgment which the court are called upon to pronounce, is precisely that, which ought to be pronounced upon a full hearing upon the return to the writ of habeas corpus, and it has accordingly been so argued at the bar.\n The material facts are as follows: Watkins was tried at the May term of the circuit court 1829, upon three several indictments found against him at that term, for certain offences against the United States; and being found guilty, was, upon each indictment, sentenced to imprisonment for three calendar months, and to pay certain fines, to wit, on one indictment $2000, on another, $750, and on a third, $300, with costs of prosecution. There is no award in either of the judgments, that the prisoner stand committed until the sentence be performed. Under these sentences, Watkins was immediately committed to jail by the then marshal of the district; and upon the expiration of his office, which was after the term of imprisonment was exhausted, and the appointment of a successor, he was delivered over, in jail, with other prisoners, to his successor; and he has ever since been detained in custody. The terms of imprisonment awarded by the judgments expired on the 14th of May 1830.\n On the 3d day of September 1829, the district-attorney sued forth three several writs of fieri facias, to levy the aforesaid fines; upon which due return was made by the marshal of nulla bona. Upon the 16th of February 1830, the district-attorney sued forth three several writs of capias ad satisfaciendum against Watkins, to levy the same fines, which were all returnable to the then next May term of the circuit court. By these precepts, the marshal is commanded to take Watkins, and him safely keep, so that he have his body before the circuit court, on the first Monday of May then next, to satisfy unto the United States the fine, costs and charges. No return was made to the circuit court, by the marshal, according to the exigency of these writs; and nothing further appears upon the records and proceedings of the court, until the 10th day of January 1833, when the late marshal of the district made a return \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 572]\n\u00a0\n to each capias ad satisfaciendum as follows: 'Cepi-delivered over to my successor in office.'\n Upon this state of the facts, several question have arisen and been argued at the bar; and one, which is preliminary in its nature, at the suggestion of the court. This is, whether, under the circumstances of the case, the court possessed jurisdiction to award the writ. And upon full consideration, we are of opinion, that the court do possess jurisdiction. The question turns upon this, whether it is an exercise of original or appellate jurisdiction. If it be the former, then, as the present is not one of the cases, in which the constitution allows this court to exercise original jurisdiction, the writ must be denied. Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137. If the latter, then it may be awarded, since the judiciary act of 1789, ch. 20,  14, has clearly authorized the court to issue it. This was decided in United States v. Hamilton, 3 Dall. 17; Ex parte Bollman and Swartwout, 4 Cranch 75; and Ex parte Kearney, 7 Wheat. 38. The doubt was, whether, in the actual case before the court, the jurisdiction sought to be exercised was not original, since it brought in question, not the validity of the original process of capias ad satisfaciendum, but the present right of detainer of the prisoner under it. Upon further reflection, however, the doubt has been removed.\n The award of the capias ad satisfaciendum must be considered as the act of the circuit court, it being judicial process, issuing under the authority of the court. The party is in custody under that process. He is then in custody, in contemplation of law, under the award of process by the court. Whether he is rightfully so, is the very question now to be decided. If the court should, upon the hearing, decide, that the capias ad satisfaciendum justifies the present detainer, and should remand the prisoner, it would clearly be an exercise of appellate jurisdiction; for it would be a revision and confirmation of the act of the court below. But the jurisdiction of the court can never depend upon its decision upon the merits of a case brought before it; but upon its right to hear and decide it at all. In Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, it was said, that it is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 573]\n\u00a0\n revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\n Tried by this criterion, the case before us comes in an appellate form, for it seeks to revise the acts of the circuit court. In Ex parte Bollman and Swartwout, 4 Cranch 75, the prisoners were in custody under an order of commitment of the circuit court; and it was held, that an award of a writ of habeas corpus by the supreme court was an exercise of appellate jurisdiction. On that occasion, the court said: 'So far as the case of Marbury v. Madison has distinguished between original and appellate jurisdiction, that which the court is asked to exercise, is clearly appellate. Is is the revision of a decision of an inferior court, which a citizen has been committed to jail.' Ex parte Hamilton, 3 Dall. 17, was a commitment under a warrant by a district judge; and the supreme court awarded a writ of habeas corpus to revise the decision, and admitted the party to bail. In Ex parte Burford, 3 Cranch 448, the prisoner was in custody under a commitment by the circuit court, for want of giving a recognisance for his good behavior, as awarded by the court. The supreme court relieved him on a writ of habeas corpus. In all these cases, the issuing of the writ was treated as an exercise of appellate jurisdiction; and it could make no difference in the right of the court to entertain jurisdiction, whether the proceedings of the court below were annulled or confirmed. Considering then, as we do, that we are but revising the effect of the process awarded by the circuit court, under which the prisoner is detained, we cannot say, that it is the exercise of an original jurisdiction.\n The grounds principally relied on to entitle the prisoner to be discharged are: 1st. That the fines imposed upon him are excessive, and contrary to the eighth amendment of the constitution; which declares, that excessive fines shall not be enforced. 2d. That the prisoner could not be detained in jail on the capias ad satisfaciendum, longer than the return- day of the process; and he should then have been brought into the circuit court, and committed by order of the court to the custody of the marshal for payment of the fine; otherwise by the laws of Maryland (which is the law of this part of the district), he was entitled to his discharge.\n The first point may be very shortly disposed of. The \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 574]\n\u00a0\n eighth amendment is addressed to courts of the United States exercising criminal jurisdiction, and is doubtless mandatory to them and a limitation upon their discretion. But this court has no appellate jurisdiction to revise the sentences of inferior courts in criminal cases; and cannot, even if the excess of the fine were apparent on the record, reverse the sentence. And it may be added, that if this court possessed such a jurisdiction, there is nothing on the record in this case, which establishes that at the time of passing judgment the present fines were, in fact, or were shown to the circuit court to be, excessive. This objection may, therefore, be dismissed.\n The other ground is of far more importance and difficulty. At the common law, whenever a fine and imprisonment constitute a part of the judgment upon a conviction in a criminal case, the judgment, if the party is in court, is, that he be committed to jail in execution of the sentence, and until the fine is paid. If he is not then in court, a special writ of capias pro fine issues against him; the exigency of which is, that his body be taken and committed to jail, until the fine is paid. \n3\n Unless such a committitur be awarded, he cannot be detained in jail, in execution of the sentence. It is the warrant of the jailer, authorizing the detention of the prisoner. No capias ad satisfaciendum, in the form appropriate to civil cases, where the exigency of the writ is to take the body of the party and him safely keep, so that the sheriff have his body before the court at the return-day of the process with the writ, is ever issued or issuable. If, therefore, the present case were to be tried by the common law, the process of capias ad satisfaciendum, under which the prisoner is detained, would be wholly insufficient to justify his detention.\n Let us see, then, how the case stands upon the laws of Maryland, by which, indeed, it is to be governed. The act of Maryland of the 20th of April 1777, ch. 6, which seems specially applicable to the recovery of pecuniary fines and forfeitures fixed by statute, declares, that if such fines and forfeitures shall be recovered by indictment, the court may either commit the offender to the public jail, till payment to the sheriff, or \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 575]\n\u00a0\n order execution to levy the same on the offender's lands, goods or chattels. This act is not supposed to have any application to the present case. The act of 20th of April 1777, ch. 13, for the more speedy and effectual recovery of common-law fines and forfeited recognisances, provides, that where any fine shall be enforced by any court of record, for any common-law offence, on any person, it shall be lawful for the attorney-general, or either of his deputies, to order a writ of capias ad satisfaciendum, or a writ of fieri facias, to be issued for the recovery of the sum due thereon, on which writs such proceedings shall and may be had, as in cases where similar writs are issued on judgments obtained in personal suits. It may be here stated, that writs of capias ad satisfaciendum in Maryland are the same in substance in their exigency as those prescribed in the common law. In another section of the act ( 4), there is a proviso, that nothing therein contained shall be construed to extend to prevent the several courts, as they might heretofore lawfully do, from committing any person from the non-payment of any fine, if they shall deem it expedient so to do. This proviso completely establishes the antecedent practice in Maryland to have been like that at the common law, to commit the offender for payment of the fine, and leaves it at the discretion of the court to order it in any future case. By necessary implication, it affirms, that without such order, the offender is not detainable in jail for the fine.\n Then came the act of 24th of December 1795, ch. 74, which, after reciting that doubts had arisen as to the issuing of a capias ad satisfaciendum for the recovery of fines and forfeitures, provides, that it shall be lawful for the attorney-general and his deputies, ex officio, and they are hereby directed and required, on application of he sheriff of the county, to order writs of capias ad satisfaciendum to be issued for the recovery of all fines and forfeitures. Another section of the act declares it to be the duty of the sheriffs to return the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum to the courts to which they are returnable, at the term succeeding the issuing of the same; and wherever the sheriff shall make return, that he has taken the body of the party, he shall be obliged either to acknowledge in open court the receipt of the amount of the fine or forfeiture, or to produce \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 576]\n\u00a0\n the body of the party to the court, to which the said writ shall be returned; and in default thereof, the court, upon motion of the attorney- general, or his deputy, shall order judgment against the sheriff for the amount of costs.\n There is a prior act of the 25th of December 1789, ch. 42, which, after reciting that plaintiffs are often willing to grant indulgence to defendants arrested on writs of capias ad satisfaciendum, but doubts have arisen, whether such indulgence can be granted, without depriving the plaintiffs of the benefits of any further execution, provides, that in case of an arrest of the defendants on any capias ad satisfaciendum, if the plaintiffs, with the consent of the defendants, shall elect not to call the execution during the term, at which it is returnable, the plaintiff may afterwards proceed against the defendant by a new execution. This statute has reference to the practice then existing in Maryland, for the sheriff, upon the return-day of the capias ad satisfaciendum, to produce the body of the defendant, if arrested, and for the plaintiff then to pray him to be committed. Although, in its terms, it applies to civil suits only; yet from its recognising the course of practice in Maryland, it has a material bearing upon the present controversy; for the act of 1777 expressly declares, that on writs of capias ad satisfaciendum for fines, such proceedings shall be had as in cases, where similar suits of capias ad satisfaciendum are issued in personal suits. And, certainly, it is in entire conformity with the exigency of the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum, which commands the sheriff, at the return-day, to bring the party, if arrested, into court. Whether the practice under the capias ad satisfaciendum in England is different, so that the party may be detained in jail by the sheriff, after the return-day, without producing his body in court, and a committitur thereon awarded by the court, it is not material to inquire; since of there be any discrepancy, the Maryland practice must govern. The cases of Christie v. Goldsborough, 1 Har. & McHen. 543, and West v. Hayland, 3 Har. & Johns. 200, go strongly to affirm the practice; and the latter certainly leads to the conclusion, that if a party is arrested and brought into court on the return-day, and is not then prayed in commitment, he is no longer to be detained in custody. At least, that \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 577]\n\u00a0\n case decides, that a new capias ad satisfaciendum may issue against him, which presupposes that he is not then deemed in custody upon the old one. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n But the terms of the act of 1795, ch. 74 (as has been already seen), expressly require the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum for a fine to be returned into court on the return-day; and the fine either acknowledged to be paid, or the body of the party produced; otherwise, judgment may be entered up against the sheriff for the amount. It is clearly then his duty to produce the body. It is the very exigency of the writ; and when produced, the sheriff has performed the whole duty required by the precept. If the attorney-general wishes him to be committed, he is entitled to pray a commitment to be made by the court. If he does not pray it, it is difficult to perceive, upon what ground it can be maintained, that the party is any longer to be detained in the custody of the sheriff. The latter has no power to arrest the party, or to detain him, except according to the exigency of the writ; and he has discharged himself of his whole duty, when he has produced the body in court. His precept, in its terms, authorizes no detainer beyond the return-day. Upon what ground, then, can the court infer it?\n If resort be had to the practice, as certified to us by the clerks of the Maryland courts, it is in perfect coincidence with the natural construction of the terms of the act. They assert the uniform practice upon writs of capias ad satisfaciendum in criminal cases to be, to bring the party into court, and then to award a committitur. No instance is shown, in which a party has ever been held in custody after the return- term, upon such a capias ad satisfaciendum, without a committitur. Such a uniform course of practice, is, of itself, very cogent evidence of the law. The practice in this district is not shown to be different. If it has not invariably conformed to that of Maryland, it seems to have conformed to it, in almost all cases. The only two cases produced to the contrary are, where the return was 'cepi, in jail;' and the circumstances of these particular cases \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 578]\n\u00a0\n are unknown. The parties may have been already in jail on execution, or under other sentences.\n And independent of the plain import of the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum, there may be sound reasons for requiring the body to be produced in court. The capias ad satisfaciendum may have issued irregularly: the party may have paid the fine; he may have received a pardon, subsequently to its award; or he may have other matters to urge against a commitment. The remark of the court in Turner v. Walker, 3 Gill & Johns. 377, 385, upon an analogous writ, is very applicable here. 'It is proper and necessary,' say the court, 'to the security of the defendant, that it should be returned in term time, in order that he may have a day in court to protect his rights.' Indeed, as the statute and the precept of the process both require this course, it is incumbent upon those, who contend that it may be dispensed with, or is unnecessary, to show some ground of authority or principle upon which the argument can be maintained. We have not been able to find any.\n It has been said, that where the party convicted is already in custody, when the sentence is passed, the party is to be deemed in custody until the fine is paid, without any award of a commitment in the sentence, or the issuing of any capias ad satisfaciendum. We know of no authority justifying this position, either at the common law or under the laws of Maryland. On the contrary, the act of Maryland of 1777, ch. 13, plainly allows a discretion in the court to commit or not to commit, for the fine. The omission to award a commitment, or a part of the sentence, is manifestly an exercise of such a discretion. Unless a committitur be awarded, which can only be when the party is in court,5 there must, as has been seen, be a capias pro fine, by the common law, and by the laws of Maryland a capias ad satisfaciendum, to justify his arrest and detention.\n The capias ad satisfaciendum then, in this case, was properly awarded. It was a necessary process to recover the fine. The difficulty is, that no return was ever made to the court, at the return-day, by the marshal, nor indeed, until long after the \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 579]\n\u00a0\n marshal's office had expired. Watkins was never brought into court, nor committed by the order of the court. He is now held in jail, and has, ever since the return-term, been held in jail, solely upon the capias ad satisfaciendum, which became functus officio after the return-day. He might have been arrested and detained in jail, if he had not been previously in custody, until the return-day; but his detention afterwards, was not, in our judgment, justified by the process. In every view which we have been enabled to take of the case, we cannot find any principle or authority to justify his detention. Doubtless, the detention has been in entire good faith, under a mistake of the law. But this cannot vary the results. We are accordingly of opinion, that the writ of habeas corpus ought to issue, as prayed for.\n\n JOHNSON, Justice. (Dissenting.)\n This case presents two questions, one of jurisdiction; and the other on the right to relief, if we assume jurisdiction. My opinion on the first has been so strong in the negative, that I have taken little pains to investigate the second; but I will give a brief exposition of my views on both.\n On the first, I have though that it need but be stated to be decided. The prisoner is in custody of a capias ad satisfaciendum issuing out of the circuit court of this district. He has been convicted of a crime, a fine has been inflicted, and this writ has been issued to recover it, as he was not required by the sentence to remain in custody until the fine was paid. It is not questioned, that the process was legally issued, conformable to the laws Maryland, nor contended, that any ground whatever exists for discharging the prisoner; except first, the excessive character of the fine, which ground this court has now decided against; and secondly, that upon which he is now to be discharged, to wit, that he was not, on the return-day of the writ, brought into court and there formally recommitted to the marshal, to be detained until the fine was paid.\n Now, it does appear to me, that it is impossible to avoid being trussed on one horn or the other of the dilemma, with which the case was met by the attorney-general. Is this court called upon to relieve the prisoner against an act of the court, or an act of \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 580]\n\u00a0\n the officers of the court? If of the court, then what act has the court done, or omitted to do, to the prejudice of the defendant? The cause of complaint is, that it has not committed him to the custody of the marshal; but the custody of the marshal is the very injury that we are now called upon to redress. Is the omission to do that which, by the terms of this application, it is acknowledged, would have legally and effectually deprived him of his liberty, a matter for him to complain of? or for us to relieve him from? But suppose, it is a cause of complaint, that the court has erred in not doing an act which it was never called upon to do; then, have they not erred in a criminal cause? And is it not, therefore, acknowledged to be beyond the limits of our appellate jurisdiction?\n But the truth is, and it is impossible to controvert it, that the complaint is, and the relief sought is, against the marshal, for a detention without authority. The court committed no error in issuing the process, under which the arrest was made; and if, as is now established, the process has lost its efficiency, and is no longer a justification for detaining the prisoner; it is not under the process of the court that he is detained, but without it, and therefore, false imprisonment in the officer. Why did not the prisoner present this motion to the court that issued the process? to the court whose officer the marshal is, quoad hoc? The reason is obvious; had the court refused to discharge him, and this application then been made here, the appeal would have been too palpably in a case of criminal jurisdiction. And yet, in that event only, would he have found a pretext for claiming of this court redress against an act of that court. At present, there is no act of that court for this court to revise; for it not giving the order of commitment could be tortured into such an act, then the answer is, there never was a motion made to grant such an order; and if holding him in custody under process, or pretext of process, issuing out of that court, can be considered as a subject of revision here, then is the court unaffected by the error; since, in terms, the motion here admits their process to have long since expired, in the marshal's hands; and surely the court is not reponsible for anything done under color of its process, but for which the process gives no authority.\n The truth is, that this is a direct interference, by means of \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 581]\n\u00a0\n the writ now moved for, between a court of the United States, and the executive officer of that court; and upon the principles of this decision, I see no reason why we may not next be called upon to issue the same writ to our Ultima Thule, the mouth of the Oregon, to bring up a prisoner under a capias ad satisfaciendum, in order to examine whether he has paid the debt or not. Is this appellate jurisdiction? or is it the proper employment of this tribunal?\n This all grows out of the case of Hamilton; a case in which the question was not decided, and a case which, if any one will examine the report of it, he will pronounce of very little authority. Then followed the case of Bollman and Swartwout, professing obedience to that of Hamilton; but a case which occurred in the midst of great public excitement. Next came those of Burford and Kearney, et similes multi; and finally this, which is a distinct augury, in my humble opinion, of the conclusions to which we are finally to be led by precedent. I have always opposed the progress of this exercise of jurisdiction, and will oppose it as long as a hope remains to arrest it.\n On the second point, I will make but a few remarks. I have never doubted, that under the writ of capias ad satisfaciendum, by the common law, the sheriff may not only take, but detain the defendant, until he was legally discharged; or that for the purpose of authorizing a detention in his own custody, a commitment to the sheriff was unheard of. On the page of the book quoted by defendant's counsel, to maintain the contrary doctrine, which precedes the page quoted, will be found an entry, that explains in what cases the committitur is resorted to in England. It is true, that this writ was its return-day; and that it, in terms, requires the production of the defendant's body on that day; but practically, this exigency of the writ has received this construction: 'that he have him ready to produce on that day, if so required by the plaintiff.' Blackstone says, vol. 3, p. 415, 'if he does not on that day make satisfaction, he must remain in custody until he does.' And in the case of Hopkins v. Plomer, 2 W. Bl. 1048, the court gives, in express terms, that version to the writ. 'It is the sheriff's duty, say the court, to obey the writ, and the writ commands him to take the defendant and him safely keep, so that he may have him ready to satisfy the plaintiff.'\n What figure \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 582]\n\u00a0\n would a sheriff make, in England, if to an action for escape, he were to plead that he took the defendant and brought him into court on the day, &c ., in the literal language of the exigency of the writ? No one would dream of justifying his not detaining the prisoner for want of a committitur. But it is insisted, that the common law has undergone a change under the laws and practice of Maryland.\n I have seen no statute of Maryland which, either in terms or by inference, makes a committitur to himself necessary to justify a sheriff in detaining has prisoner under a capias ad satisfaciendum. It is true, that, by a very humane and judicious provision, the laws of Maryland have permitted the plaintiff to indulge the defendant in execution, without losing his debt; and from this, the practice might naturally grow up to bring the defendant into court to await the will of the plaintiff; and the court have very properly decided, omitting the motion to remand him, did not deprive the plaintiff of his second execution; but I look in vain for any decision going to establish that the sheriff would have been liable for false imprisonment, had he taken the prisoner back to jail, without a commitment.\n This has been sought to be supplied by a reference to the clerks of the Maryland courts to establish a practice to that effect; but I protest against such means of getting at the law of a case, especially, as to a practice of which those clerks are called to testify subsequent in date to the separation from Maryland. But I have looked into the evidence thus procured, and, even if legal, I look in vain for any evidence to support the doctrine; most of them speak doubtingly, or decline speaking at all, and the sum and substance of the certificates of the whole, amount to no more than this, that if the sheriff brings the body into court, the court will, on motion, order a commitment. But this is not the point we are called upon to decide; we are called upon to decide that, without such commitment, it would be false imprisonment in the sheriff to resume the custody of the defendant. In this district, I think, there has been positive evidence, furnished by the defendant himself, of the exercise of a discretion in the marshal, whether to bring the person of the prisoner into court or not; and therein, perhaps, to consult the feelings of the individual. I allude to those two instances in which the return was 'cepi, and \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 583]\n\u00a0\n defendant in jail.' We may imagine some possible ground for lessening the pressure of these two instances; but certainly the case, as exhibited to us, furnishes no such ground. I am opposed to the order now made.\n\n McLEAN, Justice, dissented, on the ground, that where a defendant had been committed by the marshal on a capias ad satisfaciendum, before the return-day of the writ, it is not the practice, either in this district, or in the stated of Maryland, as he understood it, to bring up the defendant, that he may be prayed in commitment: but that it is the practice, under the construction of the Maryland law, where a defendant has been arrested on a capias ad satisfaciendum, and permitted to go to large until the return-day of the writ, to bring his body into court on such day, that it may be prayed in commitment.\n On consideration of the petition filed in this case in behalf of the petitioner, and of the arguments of counsel as well for the United States, as for the petitioner, thereupon had, it is the opinion of this court, that the writ of habeas corpus ought to issue as prayed for. Whereupon, it is considered, ordered and adjudged by this court, that a writ of habeas corpus be forthwith issued, directed to the marshal of the United States for the district of Columbia, commanding him to have the body of the said Tobias, with the day and cause of his caption and detention, immediately after the receipt of the writ, to do, receive and submit to all and singular those things which the court shall consider concerning him in this behalf, and to have then and there the said writ with his doings thereon.\n To the writ of habeas corpus the marshal of the district of Columbia made the following return:\n Henry Ashton, Esq., marshal of the United States for the district of Columbia, having read in open court and filed the following writ, together with his return thereon, viz: 'United States of America, ss. The president of the United States, to the marshal of the United States for the district of Columbia, greeting: You are hereby commanded that you have the body of Tobias Watkins, detained under your custody, as it is \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 584]\n\u00a0\n said, under a safe and secure conduct, together with the day and cause of his caption and detention, by whatsoever name he shall be called in the same, before the supreme court of the United States, now sitting in the capitol of the United States in the city of Washington, being the present seat of the national government, immediately after the receipt of this writ, to do, receive and submit to all and singular those things which the said supreme court shall then and there consider concerning him in this behalf, and have then and there this writ with your doings thereon. Witness, &c.'\n Return of the marshal.-'To the honorable the judges of the supreme court of the United States. The marshal of the district of Columbia in obedience to the writ of habeas corpus issued by the authority of your honors, now produces into your honorable court the body of Tobias Watkins, who has been in his custody ever since he came into office, delivered over to him by his predecessor, Tench Ringgold, in jail; he stating that he had been held in his custody by virtue of three writs of capias ad satisfaciendum at the suit of the United States, and by virtue of a writ of capias ad respondendum, at the suit of one William Cox, upon which said last-mentioned writ he, the said Watkins, had been prayed into commitment by the said Cox, and had been ordered into commitment by the honorable judges of the circuit court of the United States for the district of Columbia, sitting for Washington county, by whose authority all the said writs had been issued. That being satisfied of the correctness of the representations of his said predecessor, he continued to detain the said Watkins in custody, without any complaint or allegation of any illegality or wrong in the said confinement, until the rule was moved for in your honorable court, at its present term, at the instance of said Wakins, for cause to be shown by the attorney-general of the United States why a writ of habeas corpus should not be granted to bring the said Watkins before your honors, together with the cause of his detention. He further shows to your honors, that since the said rule was moved for, the writ of Cox, as aforesaid, has been dismissed; and from that time to the time of his receiving the said writ of habeas corpus, he held him in custody by virtue only of the three writs of capias ad satisfaciendum at the suit of the United States, considering it improper to discharge him, \n\n[32 U.S. 568, 585]\n\u00a0\n pending the deliberations of your honors upon the legality or illegality of his detention under and by virtue of those writs last mentioned.'\n ON consideration whereof, and after due deliberation thereupon had, it is now here considered, ordered, and adjudged by this court, in this behalf, that the said prisoner, Tobias Watkins, be and he is hereby discharged from confinement under the said several three writs of capias ad satisfaciendum at the suit of the United States, in the said return of the marshal mentioned.\n After the discharge of Mr. Watkins, by this order of the court, on the 19th day of February 1833, he was, on the same day, arrested and confined by the marshal of the district of Columbia, under three several writs of capias ad satisfaciendum issued on the same judgments, under which he had been previcusly detained in prison. These writs were dated on the 19th of February 1833, and were issued by order of the district- attorney of the United States for the district of Columbia; and were returnable at the next term of the circuit court of the district. A petition for a writ of habeas corpus, setting forth this arrest and his imprisonment under it, was presented by Mr. Watkins; and a rule on the attorney-general was, on motion, granted, to show cause why the same should not issue.\n After argument of this rule, by Coxe and Brent, for the relator; and by Taney, the Attorney-General of the United States, and by Key, the attorney of the United States for the district of Columbia, the rule was discharged: 'The court being equally divided in opinion, as to the question whether this court ought to award a writ of habeas corpus, as prayed in the case by the petitioner.' \n6\n\u00a0\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See notes to Bollman's Case, 4 Cranch 75; and Kearney's Case, 7 Wheat. 38. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] See s. c. 4 Cr.

MOORE(1833)\nNo. 44\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1833\n\n\n Error to the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In the circuit court, the plaintiffs in error instituted an ejectment for a tract of land, in the county of Franklin, in the state of Pennsylvania. They showed title to the land, as the heirs of John Nicholson, who was seised of the same, at the time of his death, under a warrant, survey and return of survey, and payment of the purchase-money to the state.\n The title of the defendants was regularly derived from a sale of the lands of John Nicholson, made under authority of the state of Pennsylvania, towards satisfying the lien claimed by the state, for the debts due by John Nicholson, arising from his defalcation as the comptroller-general of the state. The constitutionality and validity of that lien were denied by the plaintiffs.\n On the 13th of April 1782, John Nicholson was, by an act of the legislature of Pennsylvania, appointed comptroller-general of the state, and was intrusted with large powers for the collection of the debts due to the state, the settlement of public accounts, and the management of the funds of the state. Mr. Nicholson acted as comptroller for twelve years, during which time he was impeached, tried and acquitted. He, afterwards, on the 19th of April 1794, resigned the office.\n By accounts stated, on the 19th of November 1796, large \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 470]\n\u00a0\n balances were found to be due by Mr. Nicholson to the state of Pennsylvania. On an account, No. 1, headed, 'Dr., John Nicholson, account in continental certificates with the state of Pennsylvania, Cr.,' the balance was $51,209.22; and on another account, No. 2, headed 'Dr., John Nicholson, account, three per cent. stock, in account with the state of Pennsylvania, Cr.,' the balance was stated to be $63,731.06. The original accounts were given in evidence, on the trial in the circuit court, and also counterparts of them, signed by the respective officers, upon which were indorsements, one in the handwriting of Mr. Nicholson, the other in that of his counsel, in a suit instituted against him for the recovery of the debts due to the state.\n A suit was commenced in the supreme court of Pennsylvania, by the state, against John Nicholson, to September term 1793, for the loss sustained by the state on certain certificates, which it was alleged he had improperly subscribed; and a verdict was obtained against him, on the 18th of December 1795, for 4208l. 8s. 10d. No execution was ever issued on this judgment.\n To September term 1795, another suit was instituted by the state of Pennsylvania against John Nicholson, being an action of trover for certain continental certificates and funded stock of the United States. Judgment was entered in this suit, on the 20th of March 1797, on the following agreement, signed by the attorney-general of the state, and by the counsel for the defendant.\n'21st of March 1797: By agreement filed, the judgment is for the sum of $100,390.89, rating the stock as follows, six per cent. at sixteen shillings and nine pence in the pound; three per cent. at ten shillings; militia certificates at fifty per cent.; and that, in the set-off, the defendant be allowed three months to point out any errors, to the satisfaction of the comptroller and register-general, such errors to be deducted from the sum for which \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 471]\n\u00a0\n judgment shall be entered. Certificates and receipts to be credited also, with the charges of the funded debt. Errors against the commonwealth, if any, also to be corrected. The sum for which judgment is now entered, to be altered by the subsequent calculation of the comptroller-general alone. Supreme court costs, taxed at $35.35.'\n\n Executions were issued on the judgment, in the year 1798, and afterwards, in 1803, to many counties in the state, and proceedings to condemn the lands of the defendant took place. Between the 8th of March 1796, when the first settlement of the accounts of John Nicholson was made, and the 21st of March 1797, when the state judgment was entered, many judgments were obtained by the private creditors of Mr. Nicholson, which remained unsatisfied on the records. On some of these judgments, executions were issued and levies made on the real estate of the defendant, prior to the executions levied by the state on the same lands. Mr. Nicholson was arrested, under executions by private creditors, and died in prison, in December 1800. His heirs were then minors, and they all left the state, prior to 1804.\n The legislature of Pennsylvania passed, at different periods, laws for the settlement of accounts, and the collection of debts due to the state. By an act passed on the 18th of February 1785, it was provided, 'that the settlement of any public account by the comptroller, and confirmation thereof by the supreme executive council, whereby any balance of sum of money shall be found due from any person to the commonwealth, shall be deemed and adjudged to be a lien on all the real estate of such person, throughout this state, in the same manner as if judgment had been given in favor of the commonwealth, against such person, for such debt, in the supreme court; and if, after an appeal from the said settlement of accounts by, or award of, the said comptroller-general, and confirmation thereof by the supreme executive council, the said settlement shall be donfirmed, the said supreme court shall award interest thereon, from the date of the confirmation of the said settlement of account, by the supreme executive council, and costs to be paid by the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 472]\n\u00a0\n appellees.' By the sixth section of this act, if the governor is dissatisfied with a settlement, or of opinion, that a legal discussion will tend to the furtherance of justice, he may direct a suit, which shall be proceeded in as in other civil actions. By an act passed 1st of April 1790, the office of register-general having been created, all accounts were first to be settled by bim, and afterwards examined by the comptroller-general, and then transmitted to the executive council for its approbation. And by the fifth section, all settlements, under this act, shall have the same force and effect, and be subject to the same appeal as those made formerly by the comptroller-general. After the passage of these acts, the constitution of the state was changed, and the executive power was vested in a governor, instead of the executive council. On the 14th of January 1791, an act was passed, by which all duties directed to be done by the president and executive council, shall be done by the governor. This act was limited to the end of the session.\n On the 13th April 1791, the act of 1st April 1790, was continued to the end of the then session; but with a proviso, that in all cases where accounts examined and settled by the comptroller and register, or either of them, have heretofore been referred to the executive authority, to be by it approved and allowed, or rejected, the same shall only in future be referred to the governor, when the comptroller and register shall differ in opinion; but in all cases where they agree, only the balances due on each account shall be certified by the said comptroller and register to the governor, who shall thereupon proceed in like manner, as if the said accounts had been referred to him according to the former laws on the subject; and provided always, that in all cases when the party or parties shall not be satisfied with the settlement of the accounts by the comptroller and register, or when there shall be reason to suppose, that justice has not been done to the commonwealth, the governor may and shall, in like manner, and upon the same conditions as heretofore, allow appeals, or cause suits to be instituted, as the case may require. By the act of 28th March 1792, this law was continued until the end of the next session. By two other acts, it is continued to the end of the session of 1793-94. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 473]\n\u00a0\n An act was passed, 22d April 1794, reciting, that under the old constitution, acts were passed, vesting powers in the executive council or president, and that it was expedient such powers should be vested in the governor, which enacts, 'that in all cases where, by the laws of the commonwealth, the supreme executive council, or the president or vice- president thereof, is mentioned as having power and authority to carry the same into effect, the governor for the time being shall be deemed and taken to be in the place and stead of the same supreme executive council, or the president or the vice-president thereof, and shall have and exercise all the powers in them, or any or either of them, vested, unless such powers have been, and are by law, vested in some other officer or officers, person or persons, or shall be inconsistent with the provisions contained in the existing constitution of the commonwealth. By this act, all accounts are in the first instance to be submitted to the register, who shall adjust and send them to the comptroller, who, if he approve the settlement, shall return the same to the register. But if he disapprove, and they cannot agree, shall transmit the same to the governor, who shall decide: Provided, that in all cases where the parties shall be dissatisfied with the settlement of their accounts, an appeal shall be allowed.\n On the 31st of March 1806, an act was passed by the legislature of Pennsylvania, entitled 'an act for the more speedy and effectual collection of certain debts due to this commonwealth.' The following is a summary of the first ten sections of that act.  1. Commissioners appointed, with powers to procure copies of deeds and other writings, relating to the real estate of John Nicholson.  2. The commissioners to receive, on application, copies of all necessary papers, from the land- officers, without fees.  3. To ascertain, as near as may be, the quality and extent of the estate of John Nicholson in each county, subject to the lien of the commonwealth.  4. To average the demand of the commonwealth on the several estates subject to the lien, and make report to the governor, who shall cause the same to be sold, &c.; on the payment of the sum assessed on any particular estate by any person claiming an interest therein, the commissioners empowered to convey to such persons the estate or lien thereon.  5.\n When the commissioners shall \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 474]\n\u00a0\n be authorized to compromise with individuals, or the managers of land- companies.  6. In what cases, the commissioners may purchase in the property for the use of the state. 4th, 5th and 6th sections repealed and supplied.  7. Commissioners to take oath or affirmation for the faithful discharge of their duties.  8. Their compensation.  9. Empowered to recover, by due course of law, books and papers, &c.  10. Commissioners of the several counties prohibited from selling any of the lands of John Nicholson for taxes.\n  11. And be it further enacted, that in any case where the said John Nicholson, in his lifetime, had or held lands in partnership, or in common with any other person or persons, the said commissioners, or a majority of them, are hereby authorized to cause partition to be made of the said land, by writ of otherwise, in order to ascertain the respective interests of the said part-owners, as well as the separate interest of the said John Nicholson, and if it shall be necessary to make said partition by writ, in case of disagreement between the parties, the said commissioners or a majority of them, shall be made parties to such writ, either plaintiffs or defendants, and such partition, so made, shall be as available in law, as if the same had been made by the said John Nicholson in his lifetime; and the costs thereof shall be paid equally by the parties, as in other cases, and the said commissioners shall be allowed for their part of such costs in the settlement of their accounts.\n Further legislating on this subject, on the 19th of March 1807, an act was passed, entitled, 'A supplement to an act, entitled 'an act for the more speedy and effectual collection of certain debts due to this commonwealth.\"\n  1. Be it enacted, that the commissioners appointed under the act to which this is a supplement, shall make report of their proceedings to the governor, who, on approbation thereof, shall issue one or more process to the said commissioners, commanding them, or a majority of them, to sell such lands or interest in lands, as the said commissioners may specify in their report as the property of the late J. Nicholson; and in all cases of sales to be \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 475]\n\u00a0\n made by the commissioners, or a majority of them, at least twenty days' notice shall be given of the time and place of sale, by advertisement in the newspaper printed in the county where the lands respectively lie, if any be there printed, and if not, in the newspaper printed nearest to such county, and also in two papers printed in the city of Philadelphia: Provided, that nothing contained in this section shall operate to abridge the powers of compromise vested in the said commissioners by the fourth section of this act.\n  2. In all cases of sales under this act, the purchaser or purchasers shall pay the amount of the purchase-money into the state treasury, and the payment of no part of the purchase-money shall be deferred for a longer time than four years, and whenever any part shall be deferred for any length of time within that period, which is hereby referred to the discretion of the commissioners, or a majority of them, immediately superintending any sale, such deferred payments shall carry interest from the time of the sale, and shall be secured by bonds given by the purchaser or purchasers, with surety, approved by the commissioners, or a majority of them as aforesaid, payable to the treasurer of the commonwealth, and delivered to the said commissioners, or a majority of them, at the time of sale, and the said commissioners, or a majority of them, shall, on the receipt of the bonds aforesaid, deliver to every purchaser a certificate of the property sold to him, the time and place of sale and the bonds received, and shall also deliver into the hands of the treasurer, within two months from the time of sale, all bonds received for or on account of such sales, and within the same time, make a particular return into the office of the secretary of the commonwealth, to the process of the governor, of the quantity of land sold, the situation thereof, the price at which it was sold, and how paid or secured, which said process and return shall be carefully registered and filed by the said secretary, who is hereby required, upon the application of any purchaser or purchasers, or any person on his or their hehalf, on production of the certificate aforesaid, and the treasurer's receipt for the consideration of the purchase, to make and execute a deed or deeds to the purchaser or purchasers, for the property sold to him or them, as and for such estate as the said John Nicholson had or held the same at the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 476]\n\u00a0\n time of the commencement of the liens of the commonwealth against the estate of the said John Nicholson, which said conveyances, or copies of the records thereof, shall be prima facie evidence of the grantee's title: Provided, that the respective bodies or tracts of land sold under this act shall be subject to the payment of the purchase money thereof.\n  3. The said commissioners, or a majority of them, are hereby authorized and empowered to expose any body of lands late the property of the said John Nicholson, late deceased, which are subject to the lien of the commonwealth, to sale, under and by virtue of the process to be issued by the governor as aforesaid, either in gross or by separate tracts, as to them, or a majority of them, may appear most advisable.\n  4. The said commissioners, or a majority of them, shall have full power to settle, by compromise or otherwise, with any person or persons who in any manner may allege title to any of the lands late the property of the aforesaid John Nicholson, deceased, on such terms as to them may appear most eligible, and their proceedings therein shall be final and conclusive on the commonwealth; and upon any compromise made with any person or persons, the said commissioners, or a majority of them, at the request of the party, and upon his or their paying the consideration-money into the state treasury, or securing the payment of the same, may and shall execute and deliver an assignment, under their hands and seals, of so much of the liens of this commonwealth against the estate of the late John Nicholson, as may be equivalent to the consideration paid or secured to be paid as aforesaid by such party, and from the date of such assignment, the whole amount thereof shall be principal, bearing legal interest, and the holder or holders of such assignments, or his or their assigns may, at any time, proceed upon the liens of this commonwealth, to sell the lands which may constitute the subject of such compromise.\n  5. If the commissioners, or a majority of them, should be of opinion, that it would be more to the advantage of the commonwealth, to purchase any of the property to be offered to sale under this act, for the use of the commonwealth, than to suffer the same to be sold for a sum less than the estimated value thereof, they, or a majority of them, are hereby empowered so to do; and in this, as in cases of sales to individuals, the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 477]\n\u00a0\n commissioners are enjoined to make a special return into the office of the secretary, who shall, as in other cases, register the return, which shall vest in the commonwealth all the title to the property so purchased, which the said John Nicholson had therein, at the date of the commonwealth's liens, and the lands so purchased shall be disposed of in such manner as shall hereafter be directed by law: Provided, that no purchase, either directly or indirectly, shall be made in behalf of the commissioners aforesaid, in their own right, nor shall any of the property of John Nicholson be vested in them otherwise than as in trust for the commonwealth. The succeeding sections have no application to the questions in this case.\n The court charged the jury: 1. That the accounts between John Nicholson, and the commonwealth, or some of them, were so settled and adjusted, that the balances or sums of money, thereby found due to the commonwealth, were good and valid liens on all the real estate of John Nicholson, throughout the state of Pennsylvania. 2. That the judgments rendered by the supreme court of the state, in favor of the commonwealth, against John Nicholson, also constituted good and valid liens upon all his real estate throughout the state. That the several acts of the general assembly of Pennsylvania, passed on the 31st of March 1806, and on the 19th of March 1807, are not repugnant to, nor in violation of the constitution of the United States, or of Pennsylvania; but that they are good and valid laws, and a rightful exercise of the powers of the legislature of Pennsylvania; that the whole law of the case is, therefore, in favor of the defendants.\n The defendants were purchasers of the land for which this suit was instituted, under the provisions of these laws.\n The case was tried in October 1828, and a verdict and judgment, under the charge of the court, were rendered for the defendants. \n1\n The plaintiffs excepted to the charge of the court, \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 478]\n\u00a0\n on the points stated at large in the arguments, and in the opinion of the court. Exceptions were also taken during the trial to the ruling of the court in matters of evidence, which also sufficiently appear in the arguments of counsel, and the opinion of this court.\n The case was argued by C. J. Ingersoll, with whom also was Taney, for the plaintiff; and by Binney and Sergeant, for the defendants.\n C. J. Ingersoll, for the plaintiffs.-By the agreement under which this case was tried, both plaintiffs and defendants claim under Nicholson, whose title is admitted, unless divested by the alleged lien and proceedings of the state which create the defendants's title.\n For the plaintiffs, it will be submitted, first, that the acts of assembly in question are unconstitutional; secondly, that the state had no lien; and thirdly, that the court erred in ruling certain points of evidence.\n\n 1. \nThe question of constitutionality. By their act of the 13th of April 1782, the legislature of Pennsylvania conferred on Nicholson extraordinary powers and dnties, judicial and executive, as well as fiscal, by appointing him comptroller-general. 2 Dall. Laws 44; 2 Sm. Laws 19. After twelve years' service in that office, he was accused of misdemeanor, impeached, tried and acquitted; but resigned the 11th of April 1794. Much precipitate and passionate legislation ensued, with a view of recovering certain debts which he was charged with owing the commonwealth; continued by various provisions through a period of fourteen years. The final acts of 1806 and 1807 ordered confiscation of his large real estates, comprehending several millions of acres throughout the state, worth more than twenty times enough to pay all its alleged demands, and all his private creditors; but unconstitutionally sacrificed by commissioners appointed by these acts, at their arbitrary sales, contrary to the due course of law, and uncontrolled by any court of justice, by proceedings altogether extra-judicial; these large estates produced probably little more than paid the commissioners' charges. The same acts \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 479]\n\u00a0\n also order Nicholson's papers to be seized, wherever met with, and secured in public office; private and official, they have all been in the state's exclusive keeping ever since. Thus stripped, spoiled by the state of all his possessions and titles, character and credit, and imprisoned by private creditors, but resolved not to surrender estates which he knew were much more than sufficient to satisfy his debts, always denying that he was in debt to the state at all, Nicholson languished, till he died in jail, the 2d of December 1800. His widow and minor children went into exile from Pennsylvania; nor was it till lately that they had the means or the courage to seek judicial redress.\n As soon as Nicholson was out of office, an act of assembly of 20th April 1794 (3 Dall. Laws 790), made provision for the settlement of his accounts; but neither this act, nor that of 1792 appointing him to office, asserts any lien on his estate. This was done by the 12th section of the act of 13th February 1785 (2 Dall. Laws 251), which declares, that the settlement of any public account by the comptroller-general, and confirmation thereof by the supreme executive council, whereby any balance or sum of money shall be found due from any person to the commonwealth, shall be deemed and adjudged to be a lien on all the real estate of such person throughout this state; in the same manner as if judgment had been given in favor of the commonwealth, against such person for such debt, in the supreme court.\n The state is supposed to set up three liens against Nicholson: 1. A fiscal lien by treasury settlement. 2. Judicial lien by judgment in the supreme court. 3. A posthumous lien by operation of law, on Nicholson's death, insolvent, as is charged. Whether, as the act of 1782, appointing Nicholson comptroller-general, creates no lien, that of 1785 could superadd such liability to the original contract between him and the state, will not be made a distinct point; but without waiving, after thus suggesting it, left for the determination of the court.\n The act of the 31st of March 1806 (8 Bioren's Laws 166) though entitled an act \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 480]\n\u00a0\n for the more speedy and certain collection of certain debts due to the commonwealth, is confined to the debts claimed of Nicholson alone. It assumes such debts, without specifying sum, date or any other particular. It also assumes, what is called the lien, without specifying whether fiscal or judicial, or when it accrued. The lien thus assumed, for a debt thus unexplained, is extra-judicially put in force; for though by the fourth section, the sheriffs are appointed to sell the lands, and directed to do so according to due course of law; yet their mandates issue from the governor instead of any court of justice, and the whole proceedings are subject to no judicial control whatever. The supplemental act of the 19th March 1807 (8 Bioren's Laws 208) removes every vestige of judicial proceeding and control. The sheriff's agency is dispensed with. Nothing is said of due course of law; but the commissioners appointed by the act are arbitrarily to realise the avails of the lands, without the agency or control of any court or officer of justice.\n Granting the state lien to be, what the act of 1785 declares, like a judgment, may it be thus enforced? The state contends, that these acts of assembly do but accelerate and invigorate the remedy, by provision for putting the lien in force. The plaintiffs insist, that they violate the right. It would be as lawful for the party state to enforce its lien by military power. The state's argument, if it prove anything, proves too much; for it maintains that this lien might be enforced by any means whatever. The plaintiffs submit, that, whatever the proceedings be, however the due course of law may be changed, it cannot be dispensed with. The proceeding must be judicial. Though the state has not specified what lien it relies upon, yet the ninth section of the act of 1807, by assuming the 20th December 1797, as the date, sufficiently proves that its reliance was on the fiscal lien by treasury settlement of that date. Granting either lien, fiscal or judicial, the plaintiffs insist, that it can be only realized by judicial execution. The debtor party cannot be deprived of redress by due course of law, for any complaint he may make. Unquestionably, he is so, by these acts. Their provisions are superfluous; the same power that can enact, may dispense with them; they are the mere machinery of confiscation. If they are \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 481]\n\u00a0\n constitutional acts, the same power might have dispensed with that machinery, and enacted by one simple provision, that the lands of Nicholson belong to the state. Nor was this machinery even designed for his benefit, but merely to sell the lands, profitably, for the advantage of the state. Due course of law, as that phrase has been understood ever since Magna Charta, means the ancient and established course of law, the established course of judicial proceedings. 2 Inst. 60, 61; 1 Bl. Com. 138- 9. It may be said, that Coke, in the passage referred to, means criminal law; but this court put no such limitation on the phrase, but understand it to mean all judicial proceedings whatever, in the case of the Bank of Columbia v. Okely, 4 Wheat. 244.\n There were three contracts between the state and Nicholson: 1. That, by the acts of 1782 and 1785, appointing him controller-general, and fixing his liability in case of indebtedness, which was to be a lien like a judgment in the supreme court: 2. That, by the warrant for the land, which was a grant which estops the state from resuming it: 3. By the agreement for judgment entered in open court. By each and all of these contracts, the state bound itself to abide by a lien, after the manner of a judgment; that is, an incumbrance to be judicially realized according to the common process used in due course of law, issuing from a court of justice always open to the complaints of all parties. This is the vital principle of all the three contracts; to be under the jurisdiction of a court of law, empowered to redress any complaints.\n The 12th section of the act of 1785 is express, that the lien shall be in the same manner as a judgment in the supreme court; in other words, that it shall be like a judgment, which is an incumbrance, by itself inoperative, until put in action by the execution which crowns it. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 23. Execution is necessary for the perfection of judgment, and consequently, indispensable for the beneficial exercise of jurisdiction. It is putting the sentence of the law in force. 3 Bl. Com. 412. In like manner, the agreement confessing judgment, ex vi termini, imports liability to judicial execution; not executive, arbitrary, or contrary to the usual course of judicial process. It may be said, that the language of the act of 1785, giving a lien like a judgment in the supreme \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 482]\n\u00a0\n court, means nothing more than an incumbrance co-extensive with every county in the state. But this interpretation was rejected in the circuit court, for the obvious reason, that a prior paragraph of the same section of the act provides in terms for that purpose, which, therefore, would not be repeated. Both the fiscal and judicial lines are but executory, jus ad rem, not in re, requiring other process to execute them. There is a right to lien, but not to execution. The obnoxious acts give execution; not such as follows judgment in due course of law, but extraordinary, arbitrary, executive, extra-judicial, and therefore, unconstitutional, execution of the lien.\n Such laws, it is submitted: 1. Impair the obligation of contracts, contrary to  10, art. 1, of the constitution of the United States, and they impair contracts, contrary to  17, art. 9, of the constitution of Pennsylvania: for these acts, by contravening the latter constitution, avoid all the difficulties into which this court was thrown by the alleged distinction between a contract and the obligation of a contract. 12 Wheat. 239-42, 256-9. 2. They take property and apply it to public use, without just compensation, contrary to  10, art. 9, of the constitution of Pennsylvania. 3. They deprive of remedy by due course of law for injury done, contrary to  11, art. 9, of the constitution of Pennsylvania. 4. They violate the right of security in person and papers from unreasonable searches and seizures, contrary to  8, art. 9, of the constitution of Pennsylvania, and the fourth amendment of the constitution of the United States. 5. They violate the right of trial by jury, contrary to  6, art. 9, of the constitution of Pennsylvania, and the seventh amendment of the constitution of the United States. Lastly. They violate the fundamental principle of social and political campact, which withholds from a body politic, as from all its individual members, the power to judge in its own cause, and enact exceptive laws, in particular instances, in derogation of the common law.\n Thus the obnoxious acts violate, 1st, universal law or common justice; 2d, the constitutional or organic law of this \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 483]\n\u00a0\n federal union of the states; 3d, the constitutional or organic law of the state of Pennsylvania. In other words, they violate natural, federal and municipal law.\n The state rests on a lien, in the same manner as if judgment were given in the supreme court. Manner comes from manier, to handle or execute. It is the way of executing. To be taken in the manner, is to be caught in the execution of an offence. The circuit court considered this phrase a mere pleonasm. But that would violate the first rule of interpretation, which is to give every word of a law, more especially, to every substantive phrase, some meaning. The phrase in question boviously means a lien like a judgment. The mere word lien would do so by itself; that is to say, a binding but inert incumbrance, to be realized by further and final process. According to the argument of the charge itself, the intention was, to make the debt secure by the lien, the settlement being conclusive evidence of the debt, but to be recovered and collected in the ordinary way of a suit, judgment and execution. No attempt was made, during ten years, from 1796 to 1806, to enforce the lien. But the judicial lien was proceeded upon in the manner of a judgment by judicial execution. There were, however, numerous individual executions forestalling it. Whereupon, the acts of 1806 and 1807 undertook to realize the fiscal lien, because it proceded the individual executions.\n That a state may be a party to a contract with another state, or a corporation, or one or more individuals, and dealt with accordingly in courts of justice, is the established and familiar law of this country. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 132; New Jersey v. Wilson, 7 Ibid. 166; Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 92; Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514; Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 197. It is also as well settled, that a contract is a compact or agreement between two or more parties, whether communities or individuals, either executed or executory. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 136; Green v. Biddle, 8 Wheat. 92; Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Ibid. 297; Farmers' and Mechanics' Bank of Pennsylvania v. Smith, 6 Ibid. 132; Serg. Const. Law 352; Crittenden v. Jones, 5 Hall's Law Journ. 520; Vanhorn v. Dorrance, 2 Dall. 304; Dash v. Van Kleeck, \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 484]\n\u00a0\n 7 Johns. 490; Pickett's Case, 5 Pick. 65. To be sure, it must be a contract concerning property, not a mere civil contract, such as that of marriage. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 637, 644, 682. But even to forbear is as much a contract as to affirm; and it has been decided, that acquiescence makes a contract. Western University of Pennsylvania v. Robinson, 12 S. & R. 29. Contracts are constructive as well as specific. Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 317. Each party acquires a right in the other's promises, whether express or understood. Etymologically, contract means any agreement that draws two or more together. In common understanding, it means any bargain. In law, it means any agreement, on good consideration, to do or forbear any lawful act. 1 Com. on Cont. 1; Powell on Cont. 234; 2 Bl. Com. 442. According to the civil law, it is an agreement which gives an action to compel performance. Wood's Institutes of Civil Law 206; 1 Rutherforth 204, ch. 13; Grotius, lib. 2, ch. 12; Paley, vol. 1, ch. 6, p. 145. Existing law, whether statute, common or customary, affecting a contract in its obligation, construction or discharge, is always part of a contract, though not expressed to be so. Camfranque v. Burnell, 1 W. C. C. 341; Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 291. All usages are no more than constructive contracts. The whole common law is little else; the land-titles of Pennsylvania by warrant and survey also. Nicholson contracted with the state that his lands should be bound by a lien; the state contracted with him that the lien should be like a judgment. Such was the contract by the act of 1785, by the warrant of 1794, and by the judgment of 1797. All these were agreements for valuable consideration, concerning private property, like the contracts held sacred and not allowed to be impaired in the various cases before cited. If land is granted by a state, its legislative power is incompetent to annul the grant. United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 738.\n Such being the contract, and the law of contracts, without provision in this instance for enforcing it, may that be done extra-judicially? Such enforcement could not have been in Nicholson's contemplation, when he entered into the contract; nor will the law impute to him an anticipation of any unusual, much less extra-judicial execution. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 485]\n\u00a0\n There is a class of laws which are extraordinary, exceptive, and prepotent from the necessity of things; such as laws of revenue, limitation, insolvency, usury, divorce and the like. Perhaps, all contracts for public office are of this class, so far as respects official salaries; though it is not altogether certain, that by the act of 1785 the state could reduce the salary given to the comptroller-general by the act of 1782. This principle is questioned by Chief Justice MARSHALL in the Darmouth College Case, 4 Wheat. 694. For argument's sake, we can afford to concede, with out endangering Nicholson's case, that the state, by subsequent acts might increase his duties, and reduce his salary. But the lien on his private estate could not be affected, without his consent, nor otherwise enforced than as originally agreed.\n It is very clear, that the acts in question impair the contract, if there was one. To impair, etymologically from impar, is to render unequal, to make worse; and unquestionably, these acts rendered Nicholson's estate worse. According to adjudications, whatever prejudices the validity, construction, duration, mode of discharge, or even evidence, of an agreement, in any manner or degree, impairs the contract. Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 256, 257. Any law which lessens the original obligation impairs it. Ibid. 337. The state will insist on state necessity and state power, its eminent domain. The question is, whether any necessity will justify the exercise of extra-judicial power to enforce a contract which stipulated for the due course of law to enforce it? The acts in question, though rapacious, exceptive, arbitrary, unjust, impolitic and odious, may nevertheless be constitutional. But suppose, a private creditor to have got such a law enacted for the collection of his lien debts, would not the enormity of that law flash conviction of its unconstitutionality? The state must show its superior power, on the tyrant's plea of state necessity, to enact such a law. Yet it is against this very power, dreadful in states, but never to be apprehended from individuals, that the constitutional provisions were intended to guard states, that are not omnipotent even in the regulation of their revenue laws, but restrained by constitutional barrier. Laws of escheat, taxation, attachment, revenue, and the like, though summary, and contrary to the course of common law, for the more speedy and effectual recovery of certain claims, yet are always general in their \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 486]\n\u00a0\n operation, uniform in their provisions, and subject to judicial control. It is not intended to deny the power of states to modify remedies. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 197, 200. The power to alter the modes of proceedings in suits at common law includes the execution of their judgments; Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 47; and a general superintendence over them is within the judicial province. But even an act of limitation, barring passed decisions, would be void. Society v. Wheeler, 2 Gallis. 141. An act annulling a judgment would be void. Dash v. Van Kleeck, 7 Johns. 490. And in the same case, it is said by Judge THOMPSON, that after the judgment of a court, legislation is incompetent to impose new rules of law. 7 Johns. 496. The distinction between remedy and right so equally divided the judges of this court, in the case of Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, that it would be hazardous to attempt to define it. But even Messrs. Clay, Livingston, and the other gentlemen who argued that case in contradiction to the argument now submitted, concede, that all the sovereign power of states can be executed only by general, impartial and prospective legislation, not affecting vested rights or past transactions. The extinction of the despotic and iniquitous principle of retrospective legislation was the great object of the constitution; and the supposed distinction between right and remedy is often without foundation, as for instance, a law forbidding the institution of an action, though it seems to act on the remedy, annuls the right. The meaning of the term obligation, is well explained by a recent French author of great authority-Toullier on the Civil Law, vol. 1, p. 84. If a state, undertaking to modify a particular law, in effect extinguishes the obligation, this would be an abuse of power, 12 Wheat. 352; nor does power to vary the remedy imply power to impair the obligation. Of this leading but contradictory case, it may be said: 1. That all its argument and illustrations are distinguishable from Nicholson's case, because they look to laws that are general and not exceptive: 2. All the judges agree that ex post facto laws which abolish judicial action are unconstitutional: and 3. That even general laws, such as acts of limitation, are unconstitutional if they impair prior contracts. The cases of Fletcher v. Peck, The Dartmouth College, Sturges v. Crowninshield, and Ogden v. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 487]\n\u00a0\n Saunders, are, in principle, supporters of the argument now submitted.\n Remedy, as defined by lexicographers, means, literally, to cure. Blackstone speaks of the remedial part of a law. 1 Bl. Com. 55. Right means just claim to anything. Thus, in the language of the law, remedy is always used metaphorically. And the acts in question are not remedial: for they do not cure; they rather affect the right to judicial process, which they take away. Nicholson's contract provides, that the process against him should be judicial, or rather that there should be no proceeding against him but by process. The act of 1785 gives lien, without providing how it should be enforced. Liens are always enforced by process. But the obnoxious acts, instead of supplying a defect of process, abrogate all process whatever, and substitute a commission which is equivalent to confiscation. They might as well have ordered the governor or the militia to seize the lands, or have opened a land-office to sell them. Granting that the acts in question are even remedial, yet they are void, because the abolish judicial remedy. Perhaps, the legislature might erect new tribunals for the more speedy and effectual recovery of the debts said to be due by Nicholson. But they could not erect a tribunal to proceed extra- judicially. Should a state be so insane, says Chief Justice MARSHALL, 12 Wheat. 351, as to shut its courts, would this annihilation of remedy annihilate the obligation of the contract? Granted, that by general legislation, the usual modes of process may be altered or abolished. But the power of a state to modify remedies, does not authorize the substitution to extra-judicial proceedings, instead of due course of law, even by general provision. Suppose the state has judgment against an individual, could an act of assembly authorize the courts of justice to dispense with all the established modes of proceeding, and to realize the debt by arbitrary execution? The proceedings in question are wholly unlike the established law of Pennsylvania. The act of 1700 (1 Smith's Laws 7), carefully regulates the methods of execution; and the arbitration act of 1806,  11 (4 Ibid. 329), carefully conforms to the provisions of the act of 1700. Courts-martial, prevotal courts, and all special commissions to try even criminals, at \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 488]\n\u00a0\n least, profess to proceed judicially, even though they differ from common law. It can hardly be said, that the acts in question are revenue laws. But if even they were, the summary process authorized by acts of congress, for the more speedy and effectual collection of the national income is uniformly and thoroughly judicial in its character. Act of 15th May 1820,  4 (3 U. S. Stat. 595). Such was also the old revenue system; Act of the 9th July 1798,  16 (1 Ibid. 587). Such was the system of the late war taxation; Act of 1815,  33 (3 Ibid. 177). Such are all the tax laws of the state of Pennsylvania. It is believed, that no instance can be cited of a stretch of legislative power by vigor, beyond the law, occurring in any of the United States, such as the acts in question.\n Nor are they countenanced by any adjudication. The case of Stoddart v. Smith, 5 Binn. 355, on which the circuit court relied, was that of a prior and a general act, not interfering with any judicial proceeding. Such also was the case of Emerick v. Harris, 1 Binn. 416, sustaining the arbitration law, on the ground, that though it postpones, it does not take away the trial by jury. In the Bank of Columbia v. Okely, 4 Wheat. 235, a prior and a general law authorizing the bank to issue summary executions against its debtors was sanctioned by this court, on the principle, that such was part of the original contract. This case is fully explained by Chief Justice MARSHALL, in Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 342. The Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, determined, that a state may tax a bank which it had chartered, because the state power of taxation is part of the original contract. Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Ibid. 280, decides, that a general act, authorizing commissioners to settle all disputes in one county, is not unconstitutional. But, in the opinion of the court, pronounced in that case, it is said, that, even recording and limitation acts, though within the discretion of the legislature, may be so unreasonably enacted, as to require a judicial check. The difference is plain between this New York and this Rhode Island case, and the case in question; but, the very circumstance of their being contested, proves with what extreme jealousy all exceptive and ex post facto laws are viewed in courts of justice. There are several \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 489]\n\u00a0\n cases in the Pennsylvania reports which may be referred to as countenancing the acts against Nicholson; but upon examination every one of them will be found distinguishable. Underwood v. Lilly, 10 Serg. & Rawle 97; Bambaugh v. Bambaugh, 11 Ibid. 192; Barnet v. Barnet, 15 Ibid. 72. By posterior act, the legislature might have raised an administrator to Nicholson's estate, without requiring security, as usual; might have directed the sheriff to sell, dispensing with the ordinary methods and stages of execution; might have substituted the governor's warrant for the judicial writ of execution. But, however the process might have been changed, it could not be annulled. The contract required judicial proceeding, and could be satisfied with none other. Whenever an individual enters into a contract, he assents to abide by the administration of justice common to the jurisprudence of his country, but to none other. 12 Wheat. 285.\n It is thus supposed to be established: 1st. That there were the contracts of 1785, 1794 and 1797. 2d. That they were impaired. 3d. By extra-judicial enforcement.\n In connection with this position it will be convenient to consider the last; to wit, that the acts in question violate the fundamental principles of universal justice. The first and great adjudication on this subject, is Vanhorne v. Dorrance, 2 Dall. 304, which determines, that a party state cannot by legislation alter its contracts; that it is not competent for the legislature of such state, to judge of the necessity of altering such contracts; that no state can take away private property, by special and individual legislation; nor when private property is taken, by even general legislation, can the legislature settle the compensation to be allowed, which must be referred to the impartial umpirage of the judiciary. There is an implied contract between every state and every individual citizen of it, that all laws contrary to natural reason or justice, are void. The English cases on this subject are collected in 1 Kent's Com. 420.\n In England, where there is no written constitution, acts of parliament, contrary to natural equity, such as make one a judge in his own cause, are void. Day v. Savadge, Hob. 87. Now, there is no difference between the case of the individual and that of the state, except that as the state is much more formidable, a multo fortiori, should the judiciary prevent its \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 490]\n\u00a0\n attempts to judge in its own cause. No government of laws is authorized to enact exceptional provisions, striking at one citizen or one family, and depriving them of the benefit of the law common to all the rest. The sovereign people commit no such trust to a legislature. A legislature would be the most dangerous of all despotisms, if it may single out an individual, as in this instance, post factum and post mortem, depriving his family of the law common to all the rest of the community, but closing the courts of justice against that family alone. The first principle of the social compact is, that no one of its members shall do himself justice, but seek it through the public authority with which its dispensation is deposited: hence the maxim, that every citizen is under the safeguard of the law; Toullier, vol. 1, p. 168; and is it not the worst conceivable violation of this principle, for the society in its dispute with an individual to undertake to regulate it itself, without suffering the interposition of the judiciary? The state, on this occasion, in fact, proceeded not in its sovereign capacity, but as a common creditor, and usurped all the powers legislative, judiciary and executive, which in every well-regulated government are always kept distinct. It is high time, to restore the true sense, according to the plain language of the constitution, prohibiting all ex post facto legislation, instead of confining it to criminal cases, as has been generally done, owing to an early but total misapprehension of the law. The provision against ex post facto laws is twice repeated by the constitution of the United States; first, to prohibit congress, and secondly, the several states, from the enactment of such laws. It is also in the constitution of Pennsylvania; the restriction on congress obviously embraces both criminal and civil cases; bills of attainder being used for the one, and ex post facto laws for the other. The clause restricting the states expressly comprehends all ex post facto laws, as well as any bill of attainder. And the context shows that that this clause is dealing with unlimited prohibition. The states surrender the whole power, without reserve. The constitution establishes the general principle of the inviolability of contracts. Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 312. The universal law was so, before the constitution, which is but declaratory of it. 12 Wheat. 303-4; Federalist, No. 44. What right then has any judicial magistrate to put upon these provisions of the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 491]\n\u00a0\n constitution a limitation not to be found in either the letter or the spirit? The mischievous influence of Blackstone's unsupported dictum, for which no authority can be vouched, but which is contrary to all English law, suggested the ill-considered notion of judicial interpolation that has gained ground in this country. Legislation cannot be retroactive, for then it becomes adjudication. To regulate the past is judicial, to regulate the future is legislative. Toullier, vol. 1,  1, p. 18. It is a first principle of the jurisprudence of all free people, having written constitutions, that legislation must be prospective and general, not retrospective or individuated. 1 Toullier, 96; Montesq. Esp. de Loix, liv. 11, ch. 6; liv. 6, ch. 5. A Turkish firman, or Russian ukase, by which a community or individual determines and executes his own cause, without judicial intervention, would be contrary to the general sense of mankind.\n The instances of laws which are void, as against common right, mentioned in the case Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 388, are laws punishing innocent actions, violating existing laws, impairing private contracts, making a person judge in his own cause, taking property from one and giving it to another: authority to make such laws is not among the powers intrusted to legislatures. They cannot revoke their own grants. Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch 45; United States v. Arrendondo, 6 Pet. 728. Even a constitutional power, unreasonably exercised, this court has declared would be void. Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Pet. 280. Whether an act of legislation must be contrary to the constitution as well as first principles, and whether all ex post facto legislation of the states is void, are questions upon which the federal judges have not been perfectly agreed. Judge CHASE affirms these positions; Judge IREDELL denies them, in Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 388-9; Judge PATERSON'S argument, in Vanhorne v. Dorrance, strongly implies his agreement with Judge CHASE, with whom Chief Justice MARSHALL agrees; indeed, it appears to be the judgment of the court, in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch. 132-3, 135. It is denied by Judge WASHINGTON, in Beach v. Woodhull, Pet. C. C. 6; and in Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 413: yet he appears, in principle, to acknowledge it in Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 266-7. In Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 143, Judge JOHNSON strenously asserts, that the constitution of the United States forbids all \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 492]\n\u00a0\n ex post facto legislation civil as well as criminal; as he does again in 12 Wheat. 286, and in his elaborate note in 2 Pet. 416. The same ground is most ably occupied by the supreme court of New York in Dash v. Van Kleeck, 7 Johns. 493, 501, 509; and in Stoddard v. Smith, 5 Binn. 370, Judge BRACKENRIDGE says, that the notion of confining ex post facto to criminal laws, is merely American. Certainly, such is not the language of the constitution, nor the spirit, the reason, or the policy. At least, when states are parties to a contract, they ought not to be permitted to enact ex post facto laws concerning it. The supreme court of Massachusetts, in a late case, have added an able argument to their judgment against it. Picquet's Case, 5 Pick. 65.\n The acts in question take private property, and apply it to public use, without just compensation; and for injury thus inflicted, they refuse remedy according to the due course of law. It is the common law of all nations, that private property cannot be taken by an act of state, without individual consent or judicial umpirage. Vanhorne v. Dorrance, 2 Dall. 314; Picquet's Case, 5 Pick. 65; Pickering v. Rutty, 1 Serg. & Rawle 511; Hallam's Constitutional History 36. In France, the charter requires idemnity to be paid, before the property is taken. In no country, it is submitted, can even a tax be imposed upon one individual alone.\n The acts violate the right of trial by jury; any process to enforce the lien would have called in the heirs, who might have pleaded payment, release or satisfaction, which would have been tried by jury. The court had power, and it is every day's practice, to direct issues to try facts, after judgment. Wherever there is a court of chancery, that might have interposed. But in Pennsylvania, there is no such court, though its principles are recognised and administered. Pollard v. Shaffer, 1 Dall. 214; Ebert v. Wood, 1 Binn. 217; Murray v. Williamson, 3 Ibid. 135; Jordan v. Cooper, 3 Serg. & Rawle 578. The charge denies that there was any fact to try, or that Nicholson's property suffered for want of jury trial. But it is submitted, that the state might have been compelled to prove, as a fact, how much Nicholson remained indebted, if anything. Legal representatives, creditors, terre-tenants, might have applied to the courts, on motion, to question the lumping sales, arbitrary compromises, compulsory \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 493]\n\u00a0\n partitions, extravagant charges, and other impositions which are inflicted by the obnoxious acts. The heirs of Nicholson contend, that, on a full settlement of accounts, he owes her nothing. Yet all his estates were confiscated, without satisfying her alleged demand, though it is said, that there was no question to try, nor any injustice to complain of.\n By his contract with the state, Nicholson was entitled, not merely to judicial enforcement of the lien, but to the established methods of execution. The common law, vouchsafing land from execution, was repealed in Pennsylvania, as early as 1705, by a statute which makes may careful and tender provisions to protect debtors from harsh and hasty proceedings. This long-established law is familiar and dear to the people of that state, and must have been contemplated by both parties when this lien was arranged. 1 Dall. Laws 67; 1 Smith's Laws 57. Every execution, it is expressly provided, shall be like the English elegit. Inquisition and condemnation are indispensable. The charge calls this a boon which the state might revoke at pleasure, and asks who suffered for the want of it in this instance? If it is in the contract, that question does not meet the difficulty, though it is easily answered. Nicholson's family and creditors, and the state, all suffered by its extra-judicial confiscation of his lands. If, instead of being sacrificed at commissioners' sales, they had been sold by due course of law, with all his benignant delays and methods of execution, with opportunity of applying to court to regulate them, and of writ of error to the highest court, there was property enough to have paid all that the state or private creditors demanded of Nicholson, and to have left a principality for his family.\n Sales in mass, and not by parcels, as these acts require, are contrary to the established practice of Pennsylvania. Rowley v. Webb, 1 Binn. 61; Ryerson v. Nicholson, 2 Yeates 516. By the acts in question, the commissioners were empowered to average, compromise, seize and sell all the lands, at any sacrifice, buy at their own sales, compel partition, seize all Nicholson's private papers, wherever found; the asylum company are compelled to give up his shares, and the commissioners are stimulated by a bounty of ten per cent. on all the confiscations. An act of legislation assumes that an individual \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 494]\n\u00a0\n is indebted, assumes a lien for the debt, decrees confiscation of all his estates, enacts a title to purchasers, and forbids all judicial revision. The second section of the act of 1807 declares, that the proceedings, thus consummated, shall be but prima facie evidence of the grantee's title. It is a title by forfeiture, the infirmity of which is acknowledged by the very fact of its creation, which invites judicial ascertainment. But that act excluding all direct means of such ascertainment, none other is left but such as the present action, to determine collaterally the validity of the acts of assembly, thus shown to be unconstitutional and void.\n\n 2. \nIt is denied, that the state had any lien against Nicholson, or that he was indebted to it at all; to prove which, his family relied on the treasury books and the following acts of assembly, to show that this accounts remained unsettled when he died in the year 1800, viz: Act of 20th of April 1794, 3 Dall. Laws 700; Act of 4th April 1796,  12, 4 Ibid. 66; Act of 5th April 1797,  1, 8, Ibid. 175; Act of 4th April 1798,  1, 6, Ibid. 268; Act of 11th April 1799,  4, 7, Ibid. 488. Notwithstanding these provisions, those of the acts of 1782 and 1785, and the exclusive keeping of all Nicholson's papers, of which the state possessed itself, there never was a legal settlement of his accounts, which remain open on the treasury books to this day, and no one can tell upon what settlement the state relies, whether fiscal of judicial. The first judgment of the state, entered the 18th December 1795, was obtained in a suit brought before Nicholson was out of office, in which no execution ever issued, and which expired for want of revival. The fiscal settlements, dated in 1796, are all on stock balances, carried to new accounts, without any settlement in money, as the law requires. They are, therefore, but liquidations of particular accounts, and not a balance of all the respective demands between the parties, struck in money. The agreement of attorneys, by which the judgment was confessed in 1797, stipulates for future settlements, which precludes the idea of actual settlement. The question then is, whether, and how, the state got the lien which it assumed?\n Lien is a privilege strictissimi juris, a preference, hold or \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 495]\n\u00a0\n incumbrance, in the nature of a judgment, not favored in law, nor to be extended by construction. It is dormant, cautionary, and incapable of activity, till put in force by another impulse. It is not specific like a mortgage, jus in re, but general, merely ad rem. It does not levy, dispossess or put in possession, and has none of the properties of execution. Gibbs v. Gibbs, 1 Dall. 371; Blaine v. The Ship Charles Carter, 4 Cranch 332; Thelusson v. Smith, 2 Wheat. 396; Conard v. Atlantic Insurance Company, 1 Pet. 442. Liens, being in derogation of common law, are to be construed strictly, and enforced literally. With respect to them, form is substance. The 12th section of the act of 1785, 2 Dall. 251, requires, that in order to constitute a lien, there must be: 1. debt; 2. settlement; 3. by the proper officers; 4. in the prescribed manner; 5. with notice to the debtor; 6. the whole of whose accounts must be settled; 7. and the balance struck in current money; 8. that balance reported to the executive; 9. and entered at large in the treasury books. Not one of these requisites can be shown in the alleged settlement.\n The difficulty the plaintiffs have to contend with here, is not construction of the various provisions of the acts of assembly, which all speak a clear and satisfactory language, but an adverse decision of the supreme court of the state in the case of Smith v. Nicholson, 4 Yeates 6, which decision the circuit court adopted as right in itself, and binding the judgment of the court, even though wrong. It was an abstract question, stated and submitted by agreement of parties, to which the legal representatives of Nicholson were not a party; nor was it determined in the highest court of the state, which, at the time of that decision, was the high court of errors and appeals, since abolished. It would not, therefore, be binding, even in the courts of the state: Bevan v. Taylor, 7 Serg. & Rawle 401. In a controversy between a state and one of its citizens, a court of that state should not deprive him of the benefit of the revision of the supreme court of the United States, provided the case be such as to give the latter jurisdiction. If the laws in question should be deemed invalid by this court, it cannot surrender its judgment to that of the state court. The series of its adjudications on this subject is as follows: McKeen v. Delancy, 5 Cranch 32; Mutual Assurance Society v. Watts's Executors, 1 Wheat. 290; Shipp v. Miller, 2 Ibid. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 496]\n\u00a0\n 325; Thatcher v. Powell, 6 Ibid. 127; Elmendorf v. Taylor, 10 Ibid. 159; Jackson v. Chew, 12 Ibid. 162; Inglis v. Trustees of the Sailor's Snug Harbour, 3 Pet. 127; Henderson v. Griffin, 5 Ibid. 155; Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Ibid. 264; Tayloe v. Thompson, Ibid, 358; Hinde v. Vattier, Ibid. 401; Ross v. McLung, 6 Ibid. 283; Green v. Neal, Ibid. 291.\n The principles to be extracted from all these cases are, that they are binding only when they establish general rules of property, perhaps, of evidence, adjudged in the highest state courts, and being, like the common law or acts of assembly, uniform and universal in their operation. But though binding, they are not conclusive; this court is to examine and judge for itself. If the courts of the United States surrender their judgment to those of the states, it is a concession of vast amount. Respect is due, uniformity is desirable; but submission would take from the courts of the United States their supremacy and usefulness. Even state legislation has never been suffered to change the practice of the federal courts. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1. The case of Smith v. Nicholson not having been adjudged by the highest court of the state, not establishing any general rule of property or of evidence, and not adjudging the question presented by this case, is, therefore, not a binding authority. In that case, the question of settlement was taken for granted, together with that of notice; and all the other positions contested in this case, except whether the govervor's sanction is indispensable to him. The general construction and operation of the act of 1785, in connection with all the other acts of assembly which tend to explain it as now submitted, was never presented.\n If, notwithstanding these views, this court should uphold the lien, it becomes necessary to inquire, whether it had not expired, before the acts of 1806 and 1807 assumed its existence. The judgment of 1795 expired in 1802, for want of scire facias to revive it. The judgment of 1797 is inconsistent with the fiscal lien of 1796; for can there be two liens for the same debt? lien is a thing incompatible with another title, it is a single hold or incumbrance, excluding all other rights of other claimants, and all other claims of the same claimant, to the thing bound by the lien. A lien-claimant loses his lien, by \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 497]\n\u00a0\n letting go of it, for an instant, or by taking other security for the debt. Kauffelt v. Bower, 7 Serg. & Rawle 73; Cranston v. Philadelphia Insurance Company, 5 Binn. 540; Ramsay v. Allegre, 12 Wheat. 612; Collins v. Ongley, 3 Selw. N. P. 1163. There may be double security and several remedies, as bond and mortgage, or covenant and distress; Gordon v. Correy, 5 Binn. 552; Bantleon v. Smith, 2 Ibid. 146; but there cannot be two liens for the same thing. It is not a question of extinguishment, but of election. The state was bound to choose, and did choose, relying on the lien by the judgment of 1797, which gave a plain and adequate recourse, instead of the fiscal settlement of 1796, which was involved in doubt and difficulty. The fiscal lien never was set up, until several years after Nicholson's death, when it was found, that the lien of the judgment proved abortive. The only reliance was that judgment, and that was suspended or satisfied in law, by several of the executions under it; one of which was stayed by the plaintiff's order, another not executed by order of the comptroller- general of the state, and a third levied on real estate, which was subjected to inquisition, condemnation, and venditioni exponas, yet outstanding. The general rule of law and reason, under such circumstances, is, that the debt is discharged. Little v. Delancey, 5 Binn. 267. The whole liability is transferred to the sheriff.\n It may be, moreover, alleged, that the state has a lien by Nicholson's death insolvent. But first, there is no proof that he died insolvent; and secondly, if he did, all debts due to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania are postponed to all other debts, by the 14th section of the intestate act of 1794. 3 Dall. Laws 357; 3 Smith's Laws 145. The lien was but a debt, in which case, it has been settled by the courts of that state, that it must take its place after certain other debts. Moliere v. Noe, 4 Dall. 450; Scott v. Ramsay, 1 Binn. 221. There were many judgments and liens of individual creditors preceding those of the state, which by law out-rank it; and indeed it was to forestall those very creditors, when their advantages were ascertained, that the legislature recurred to the fiscal lien of 1796, which the acts of assembly assume.\n Lastly. There are four exceptions on points of evidence. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 498]\n\u00a0\n 1st. The journal of the house of representatives of Pennsylvania was offered, that the same sums and the same stock as claimed under the alleged fiscal lien were claimed in the action of trover. 2d. The same journal was offered, to show the report of a committee to the same effect. 3d. The appendix to another report of a committee was offered, to show that Nicholson's accounts were unsettled. All this testimony was rejected. Office registers, church registers, and parish registers are received in evidence as public documents made by disinterested persons. The books of any public corporation are evidence of its acts and proceedings. Owings v. Speed, 5 Wheat. 420; 2 Stark. Evid. 177. Why, then, are not the acts of the constituted authorities of a state evidence against it? The state took defence in this case; and can it be a well-founded objection, after several laws of the state were read in evidence, that the proceedings of committees of the legislature were not also evidence, because they had not become enactments? The case of Kelly v. Jackson, 6 Pet. 630, is supposed to settle this point.\n The ledger of the treasury was offered, to show that the accounts between the state and Nicholson remain unsettled, and rejected, on the ground, that the ledger is not a book of original entries, and that the accounts are incomplete. But as the state was defending its grantees, the defendants, proof from any book or account kept by the officers of the state, whether original or not, and however incomplete, would be good evidence against the state. The error in ruling this point must be imputed to a misapprehension that the ledger was offered by the state, instead of being offered against it.\n Binney, for the defendants in error, stated, that Mr. Sergeant and himself appeared in support of the judgment of the circuit court, by the appointment of the governor of Pennsylvania, under certain resolutions of the legislature. The case in that court was an ejectment by the heirs of John Nicholson, for two tracts of land in Franklin county, the title of which was admitted to be in them, unless divested by certain alleged liens and proceedings of the state of Pennsylvania. By agreement, the proceedings by the state were to be set up as a defence, and the question, whether the title of \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 499]\n\u00a0\n John Nicholson, and his heirs, was divested by them, was to be brought forward and submitted on its merits. The case, therefore, turned upon this defence, the history of which may be briefly stated.\n In March and December 1796, certain accounts between the state and John Nicholson were settled in the department of accounts, by which he was found a debtor to the state in large amounts. On these settlements, the state claimed to have a lien on John Nicholson's real estate throughout the commonwealth. In December 1795, and March 1797, the state obtained judgments against him for large sums. On these judgments, a similar lien was asserted. In 1806 and 1807, the legislature passed two acts, authorizing commissioners, under a warrant by the governor, to sell the lands of John Nicholson, in satisfaction of these liens. At sales under this process, the defendants bought and entered into possession, and continued in possession more than twenty-one years, without question, the youngest of the children of John Nicholson having been of age twelve years before the institution of the ejectment, and four of them having been of age at the time of the sales.\n The plaintiffs contended: 1. That none of the accounts were so settled as to have become valid liens. 2. That the judgments were not a lien. 3. That the acts of 1806 and 1807 were unconstitutional and void. The charge was on all the points to the contrary; and the opinion of the court was also adverse to the plaintiffs, in overruling certain matters offered in evidence, and to be hereafter noticed. The questions consequently are, whether there is error in the court's opinion, either in charge to the jury, or in rejection of the offered testimony?\n The acts of assembly of Pennsylvania which bear upon the subject, require to be more particularly stated. At all times, before as well as since the revolution, Pennsylvania has had a special tribunal for the settlement of public accounts concerning her revenue and expenditures. Prior to the act of the 13th of April 1782, this tribunal consisted of three auditors named by the assembly, whose certificate was conclusive, in an action against the debtor. Act of 1st March 1780,  5, McKean's Laws 287. On the 13th of \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 500]\n\u00a0\n April 1782, an act was passed to establish the comptroller-general's office. 2 Dall. Laws 44. In this office, all public accounts were to be settled, and then transmitted, with the vouchers, to the supreme executive council. If approved by the council, and a balance was found due by the state, a warrant was to be drawn by the president of the council upon the state treasurer. If a balance was found due to the state, it was made the duty of the comptroller-general to take the most effectual steps to recover it, by filing a certificate of the debt in the office of the prothonotary or clerk of the county court, and taking a warrant against the body, and distress against the goods, and if there were none, then a fieri facias against the debtor's lands. The act makes no express provision for non-approval of the settlement by the council. It gives neither appeal from the council, nor trial by jury to the debtor, and it does not make the settlement a lien. By this act, John Nicholson was appointed comptroller-general.\n On the 18th February 1785, an act was passed, entitled 'an act to give the benefit of trial by jury to the public officers of this state, and to other persons who shall be proceeded against in a summary manner by the comptroller-general of this state.' It allows an appeal by the debtor to the supreme court, within one month after notice of a settlement approved by council, upon his giving security, in the nature of special bail, to prosecute the appeal; and as a necessary counterpoise to the right of appeal, the 12th section enacts, 'that the settlement of any public account by the comptroller, and confirmation thereof by the supreme executive council, whereby any balance or sum of money shall be found due from any person to the commonwealth, shall be deemed and adjudged to be a lien on all the real estate of such person throughout this state, in the same manner as if judgment had been given in favor of the commonwealth against such person, for such debt, in the supreme court.' 2 Dall. Laws 247.\n The law of Pennsylvania thus remained until the 28th March 1789, when an act was passed 'for the appointment of a register-general, for the purpose of registering the accounts of this state.' 2 Dall. Laws 704. This act was the commencement of an effort to introduce into the accounting department, a check on the power of John \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 501]\n\u00a0\n Nicholson, of whom the assembly became jealous, and whom they had not they power to displace. It directed the comptroller-general to submit all accounts, before he settled the same, to the register-general, and to take his advice in making such settlements; but the act was defective in several points, and especially, in not requiring that the vouchers should be submitted, with the accounts. A supplement was passed on the 30th September 1789, 2 Dall. Laws 751, to remedy this defect; and it ordered the comptroller-general to state adjust and strike the balance, and to report his opinion, with the vouchers, to the register-general, and to take his advice, before final allowance. This act was defective, as well as the former, in making the office of the registergeneral merely advisory, without providing for a difference of opinion, or obliging the comptroller- general to follow the advice given, which it may be presumed, from what follows, that he showed no disposition to do.\n The act of 1st April 1790, 2 Dall. Laws 787, was then passed, which, as to all subsequent accounts, directed the register-general, in the first instance to examine, liquidate and adjust them, and afterwards to transmit them, with the vouchers, to the comptroller general, for his examination and approbation. If they agreed, the register was to transmit the account and vouchers, as before, to the council. As this act made the register- general the officer to settle public accounts, the fifth section enacted, that 'all such settlements of accounts shall have the like force and effect, and be subject to the like appeal at the instance of the party, as settlements heretofore made by the comptroller-general.\n The law stood thus, at the adoption of the present constitution of Pennsylvania, on the 2d September 1790, when a single executive having been substituted for the council, successive acts of 14th January, 13th April and 21st September 1791, 3 Dall. Laws 3, 73, 113, were passed, to give to the governor the power of performing all duties enjoined upon the council by former acts of assembly, and among others, that of revising and approving or disapproving the settlements of public accounts; but the last- mentioned act provides, that all future accounts, settled by the comptroller and register, or either of them, shall be referred to the governor for his approbation, only \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 502]\n\u00a0\n when they differ in opinion; and that in all cases where they agree, 'only the balances due on each account shall be certified to the governor, who shall thereupon proceed in like manner as if the said accounts respectively had been referred to him, according to the former laws upon the subject.' By this act, the governor was authorized 'in like manner and upon the same conditions as heretofore,' to allow appeals, or to cause suits to be instituted.\n On the 4th April 1792, a further act was passed, entitled 'an act to provide for the settlement of public accounts, and for other purposes therein mentioned.' It was, in the main, a condensation of the existing system of accounts. It repeated several provisions then in force, added others not material, and repealed 'so much of any former act as was thereby altered or supplied, and no more.' The second section enacted, that when accounts were finally settled, either by the comptroller-general and register-general, or, in case of their disagreement, by the governor, the comptroller and register were each to enter the same in suitable books, and upon such entry jointly to certify the balance, and the fund out of which it was payable, to the governor, who was to draw his warrant upon the treasurer for the amount. John Nicholson continued comptroller-general under this system, until the 11th April 1794, when he resigned his office.\n But one act in regard to the settlement of accounts remains to be noticed. It was passed on the 20th April 1795, and is entitled 'an act to provide for the settlement of the accounts of John Nicholson, late comptroller-general.' 3 Dall. Laws 790. It authorizes the comptroller- general to employ clerks in adjusting John Nicholson's accounts, and as often as the accounts, or such parts of them as are independent of other parts, have received his approbation, it requires him to transmit them to the register-general, to be proceeded on as is directed in case of other accounts. It further requires the comptroller and register to make separate reports to the next session, of their progress in the settlement of these accounts.\n In this state of the law, the three accounts which are in question were settled. The first was on the 3d and 8th March 1796, in which the comptroller-general preceded the register. This was during the next session of the legislature, after the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 503]\n\u00a0\n act of 20th April 1795. The second was on the 20th and 22d December 1796, in which the register preceded the comptroller. The third was on the 20th December 1796, in which both officers signed on the same day.\n I. The court charged the jury, 'that these accounts between John Nicholson and the commonwealth, or some of them, were so settled and adjusted, that the balances or sums of money thereby found due to the commonwealth, were good and valid liens on all the real estate of John Nicholson throughout the state of Pennsylvania.' This is a pure question of law, turning, 1st, on the accounts produced by the plaintiffs themselves, and 2d, on the acts of assembly already stated, and they will be examined in this order.\n\n 1. \nThe accounts produced. If any accounts settled by the register and comptroller-general have the lien attributed, it is supposed, that these have it. A few characteristics of them will be shown, and then the objections will be noticed. It is sufficient for the judgment, if some one of them had a lien. The court was not asked to say which of them, nor whether all had. It was, indeed, immaterial if any one of them had it; but it will be contended to have been the effect of each one of them. They were settled by the register and comptroller-general, with whom, by the acts of 4th April 1792, and 20th April 1795, this power was deposited; and they agreed. They were settled in due official order. If the act of 20th April 1795, is wholly inoperative, or if its operation continued beyond the session of 1795-96, still there are two accounts which are settled by these officers, in the proper order of precedence. If the register must examine first, he has so signed the account of 20th and 22d December 1796, and the court, in support of an official act, will intend that he first examined and signed that account which presents the same date to both signatures. If the comptroller must examine first, according to the act of 20th April 1795, he has so signed the account of 3d and 8th March, and it will be for the same reason intended that he signed and examined first the account of 20th December. If the act of 20th April 1795, only suspended the usual order \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 504]\n\u00a0\n on examination, until the end of the next session, which is its true construction, then all the accounts are settled in due order. The order, however, is immaterial, as both officers are empowered by law to perform the same acts, and both have performed them. They find a balance or sum of money due by John Nicholson to the commonwealth. The question is not, whether it is regularly due, but whether the settlement finds it to be due, of which there is no doubt. The clear meaning of the accounts, on their face, is, that there is a balance found due by John Nicholson to the commonwealth. The account settled is the 'settlement of an account.' Interpreted as all accounts should be, expressing in the short language of accounts a well-known meaning, they find John Nicholson a debtor to the commonwealth, in the sums necessary to balance the accounts. No court wants an interpreter to explain this. It is the plain and universally understood language of accounts; and what it means is no more a matter of disputable fact, than what the Arabic numerals in the columns mean. The account thus settled, is what the act means to describe as 'the settlement of an account whereby a balance shall be found due.' No other terms or finding can be necessary. The finding is the settlement, and the settlement is the account settled. The balance of each account is a sum of money with which he is charged, because the items of debit which exceed the credits, are sums of money, and the account is a money account in the lawful currency of the day of settlement, and not in the currency in which the certificates charged were themselves expressed. One of the accounts is, doubtless, in regard to continental certificates, but they are estimated and charged at a certain price, in the then money or currency of the country, according to the authority given to the accounting officer, by the act of 13th April 1782, to charge the value of public property and effects not accounted for. Continental certificates account, is merely a denomination of the particular account, to show the origin of charge and discharge. Merchandise account, stock account, funded-debt account, are not the less accounts in money, because they are so headed in the ledger. So, of account in continental certificates, or three per cent. stock account, which is the language of these settlements. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 505]\n\u00a0\n Whether they are charged at too high a rate or otherwise, is no question here. Finally, they are public accounts, and thus complete the description in the act of 1785.\n The objections to this view are the following. The balances were not certified to the governor, according to the act of 21st September 1791. The answers are: 1st. That this was unnecessary, when a balance was found due to the commonwealth. The object of the certificate was, that the governor might proceed in like manner as if the account had been referred to him according to former laws. The act of 13th April 1782,  2, is the only act which regulated the proceeding, namely, that when a balance was due by the state, the executive was to draw a warrant on the treasurer, and when due to the state, that the comptroller should take steps for speedy recovery. The act of September 1791, did not mean, that the comptroller and register should certify a balance to the governor, upon which he was to do nothing. 2d. If the certificate was ever necessary in such a case, it was not to give the lien. The certificate was first required by the act of September 1791; the lien is given by the act of 1785. The lien, if it attaches at all, does so immediately. There is no limitation of time to the certificate. If the omission to transmit it has any effect, it is merely to keep the appeal open, or to suspend the charge of interest. But there is no question here either as to appeal or interest. The lien is, and always has been, independent of both.\n The acts suppose but one settlement on which the lien is to arise, and here are several, and after all, there were still accounts unsettled between the parties. The answers are: 1st. That no act requires, or supposes all accounts to be settled at once, nor is it reasonable, unless they are dependent parts of the same account. The accounts in question purport, two out of three, to be independent accounts, and the third is but a continuation of one of the former, in consequence of a payment by the debtor, which changed the balance. 2d. Non constat, that were other accounts between the parties at that time. 3d. The act of 20th April 1795, authorized a separation of the accounts into independent parts. 4th. The lien, if it exists, belongs to \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 506]\n\u00a0\n the final settlement of an account, not to the settlement to a final account.\n The accounts were not entered in the books of the register and of the comptroller-general, according to the second section of the act of 4th April 1792. The answers are: 1st. That if necessary by law, it must be presumed they were so entered, as it was the duty of the officers, and it does not appear but that they performed it. 2d. The accounts, on their face, show that they were entered at the date of the settlement. The memorandum on the account of 20th December 1796, that it was not entered until June 1800, was shown by the evidence to be an interpolation by a stranger. 3d. The entry in the books is no part of the settlement, nor connected with it. The design of it was exclusively fiscal, to show the resources of the commonwealth, and her liabilities, by an index of her debts and credits.\n No notice of the intended settlement was given to the debtor. The answers are: 1st. That notice was not necessary by the act. It was made the duty of the debtor to submit his own account for settlement, and it is to be presumed that he did. 2d. If necessary, the presumption of law, after such a length of time, and nothing appearing to the contrary, is, that the officers did their duty. This presumption is made on the principle of quieting possession, of sustaining official acts, and of supposing that things which it would have been culpable to omit, were rightly done. Hillary v.

They bear date before the two settlements in December 1796, and were preparatory to them. Possession \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 507]\n\u00a0\n of these by John Nicholson and his counsel, which was in undisputed proof, was such evidence of notice, that being uncontradicted, the court was entitled to say to the jury, that they ought to suppose notice. It is not admitted, that the judge was asked to leave notice to the jury as a matter of fact.\n The settlements were merged in the judgment of March 1797, transit in rem judicatam. The answers are: 1st. It is not shown, that the judgment was for the same debt as the settlement, nor was the court asked to instruct the jury upon that hypothesis. This court will not infer a fact from the mere similarity of items, to involve the circuit court in error. 2d. The doctrine of extinguishment, as drawn from the principle transit in rem judicatam, applies only to the very cause of action in suit, and does not affect collateral securities or collateral concurrent remedies. The cause of action in that suit was not the settlement, nor the settled account, but the trover and conversion of certain certificates of stock. The settlement remains as it was, with all its incidents and securities. Had the cause of action been the debt due, it would not have altered the case. The settlement remained, and if a lien attended it, the lien also remained. A judgment without satisfaction is not an extinguishment of a collateral remedy for the same cause of action. Chipman v. Martin, 13 Johns. 240; Bantleon v. Smith, 2 Binn. 146; Day v. Seal, 14 Johns. 404; Gordon v. Correy, 5 Binn. 552; Houldebil v. Desanges, 2 Stark. 337; McCall v. Lenox, 9 Serg. & Rawle 302; Drake v. Mitchell, 3 East 258.\n The settlements were waived, by bringing tort for the stock, and the contract of the accounts cannot now be set up. The answers are, that the identity of the demands is not established by evidence; that if it were, it was the duty of the debtor to avail himself of the objection, by pleading the settlements. Not having done so, he is in the case of a defendant who suffers judgment both in tort and contract for the same thing. All he can object to, is double satisfaction, and that question does not arise. The judgment in trover is not a waiver of the settlement, because it is entirely consistent with it, both proceeding upon the ground of converting, or not accounting for, the public money. The conflict between tort and assumpsit springs from forms of action, and is entirely technical. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 508]\n\u00a0\n 2. These accounts then having been duly settled, and followed by a lien, as much as any accounts could be, the question arises, whether any accounts settled in 1796, agreeable to the acts of assembly then in force, were attended by a lien. A lien was, at one period, given to a settlement in the accounting department, beyond doubt. It has never been expressly repealed, nor has the law been expressly supplied or altered in this respect, so as to bring the 12th section of the act of 1785, within the repealing clause in the 11th section of the act of 1792. The question then is, whether the system of accounting has been so changed, as that the security intended and given by the act of 1785, has become impracticable and is lost. The objections to such a view of the law are not easily obviated. The lien was given as a counterpoise to the right of appeal. The act of 1785, is an act giving and regulating appeals and the lien; there is no other subject introduced into it. Now, the whole of the act, so far as it regards appeals, must be admitted to have continued in force, until after these settlements. An appeal continued to be the express right of the debtor, under every subsequent modification of the law, and yet the act of 1785 was the only act to regulate the subject, until the act of the 20th of March 1811. 5 Smith's Laws 228. The continuance of this part of the system is a powerful argument in favor of continuing the lien to the commonwealth, which alone reconciled the appeal with the public interest. The security of special bail was inadequate. The present accounting system of Pennsylvania, under the act of 1811, continues to connect appeal and lien together.\n The lien given by the act of 1785, belongs, moreover, to a settlement in 1796, by necessary implication, and also by express enactment.\n 1st. By implication. In 1782, the department of accounts consisted of the comptroller, with a power of revision in the executive. The comptroller alone settled; the executive did not settle. The comptroller pronounced the judgment; the council approved or disapproved, and in the former case, left the settlement in force as the judgment of the comptroller; this is the clear language of the act. The act of 1785 speaks in the same terms; the appeal is from the comptroller's settlement, from his award, and not from the council's confirmation. The act of March 1789, is to the same effect. Before \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 509]\n\u00a0\n the comptroller shall finally settle an account, in pursuance of former laws, he is to transmit it to the register; the comptroller then was deemed to settle the account finally. The acts of the 30th of September 1789, and 1st of April 1790, repeat the provision. Further, when we recur to the 12th section of the act of 1785, we perceive, that the lien is given to the settlement by the comptroller, confirmed by the council, but not to the confirmation of the council. It is given to the comptroller's settlement, perfected according to law. The virtue of the proceeding is in his settlement, sanctioned by the council, but not in the sanction of the council. In case of appeal, it is his settlement that is established by the court, and not the sentence of confirmation by the council. The lien is given to that adjudication which funds the balance to be due, namely, the settlement by the comptroller, and not to the confirmation by council, which does not find anything due, but only establishes the settlement. If we find, then, as we do, that the sanction of the governor, under the constitution of 1790, is substituted for that of the council, under the constitution of 1776, and afterwards, that in a certain event, which exists in this case, to wit, the approbation of another officer, the executive sanction is superseded, it follows by necessary implication, that the settlement, either with the substituted sanction, or with no sanction at all, is perfected to the same extent that was required by the act of 1785 to produce the lien. It is to be recollected, that the act of the 1st of April 1790, which makes the register-general the settling officer, declares, that all settlements by him shall have the like force and effect as settlements before that time made by the comptroller. If, therefore, a settlement by the comptroller, after the change in the constitution, and the substitution of another sanction for that of the governor, would have given the lien, a settlement by the register, approved by the comptroller, must do the same.\n 2d. By express enactment. The 11th section of the act of 4th of April 1792, by repealing no part of any former act, except such as is by that act altered or supplied, transfers all the efficacy of the acts of 1782, 1785, 1789, 1790 and 1791, to settlements under the act of 1792, which these were. The act does not alter or supply the provisions in regard either to appeal or lien. It alters certain accidents of the settlement, \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 510]\n\u00a0\n its form, and the order of its parts, and supplies new provisions for them; but it expressly retains all those acts, and parts of acts, which give force, effect and substance to it. These views are sustained by the general rules of interpretation, applied to several statutes in pari materia, and particularly, to affirmative statutes, made for the public security. They should be so contrued as to retain the benefit of that security, which was essential to the public, to which there is nothing repugnant in any part of the old system, and which has been expressly continued in the new. These statutes are to be taken into the construction of one another, and to be interpreted as if they were different sections of the same statute. Earl of Ailesbury v. Pattison, 1 Doug. 30; Wallis v. Hodson, Barnard, Ch. 276; Anon., Lofft 398; Foster's Case, 11 Co. 63; Chapman v. Pickersgill, 2 Wills. 146; New River Co. v. Graves, 2 Vern. 431; Eyston v. Studd, Plowd. 467; Yale v. King, 19 Vin. Abr. 517, Statutes, E. 6, 58; Plummer v. Wichcot, T. Jones 63; Thornby v. Fleetwood, 10 Mod. 118; Johnes v. Johnes, 3 Dow 15; Atcheson v. Everit, Cowp. 391.\n The suggestion that this lien was taken away by the intestate law of the 19th of April 1794, which, among creditors in equal degree, postpones the commonwealth to the last, is wholly without foundation. That act does not disturb any lien, except in the case of a sale by order of the orphans' court, and then, the court gives the lien-creditor his priority by distribution of the proceeds. Moliere v. Noe, 4 Dall. 450; Girard v. McDermot, 5 Serg. & Rawle 128.\n This court will, however, regard the charge of the circuit court on the first point, as to the lien of these accounts, or some of them, as sustained authoritatively by the decision of the supreme court of Pennsylvania. The case of Smith v. Nicholson, 4 Yeates 6, in the year 1803, judicially affirmed the lien of these accounts, that case having presented precisely the same issue of law, upon the same facts; and as it is a decision of the highest judicial tribunal of Pennsylvania, upon the interpretation of a statute of that state, this court will receive it as an authoritative exposition of the state law. The same interpretation was recognised and adopted by the same court, in the United States v. Nicholls, 4 Yeates 251, and it has been universally acquiesced in, with the exception of this \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 511]\n\u00a0\n suit, for thirty years. The state has legislated upon that basis; purchasers have bought and parted with their money in faith of it; the judgment-creditors of John Nicholson have, one and all, from that time, yielded their priority to the commonwealth; and it is only by this acquiescence, and the consequent omission to pursue their executions, that an acre of land, in Pennsylvania, has been left to his heirs, to raise the present question. To examine the arguments of either the counsel or the court, in the printed report of that case, and to weigh or sift the reasons, to ascertain whether they are unanswerable, or the best that could have been given, would be both invidious, and at variance with the law of this court, which adopts the state decision in such cases, not because it is abstractly right, but because it is the unreversed decision of the highest state court. Shipp v. Miller's Heir, 2 Wheat. 325; Jackson v. Chew, 12 Ibid. 168; Green v. Neal, 6 Pet. 291. 'A fixed and received construction of a statute by a state, in its own courts, makes a part of the statute law.'\n II. The charge that the judgments were liens throughout the state of Pennsylvania, was in accordance with the settled law of its courts. White v. Hamilton, 1 Yeates 183; Ralston v. Bell, 2 Dall. 158; Act of 5th March 1790, 2 Dall. Laws 771,  2; Act of 18th February 1785, Ibid. 221,  12. The law so remained until the act of 20th March 1799,  14. 3 Smith's Laws 358. The objections made in this court, that the defendants cannot have the benefit of these judgments in the deduction of title, because they are not referred to in the acts of 1806 and 1807, and because the liens were lost for want of a scire facias within five years, according to the act of April 1798, and further, because the largest judgment is interlocutory, are untenable. The acts of 1806 and 1807 speak of liens generally, embracing all liens for the debts of John Nicholson. The act of 1798 does not require a scire facias in such a case; executions had been issued. Young v. Taylor, 2 Binn. 218; Pennock v. Hart, 8 Serg. & Rawle 376. The object of the act was to protect purchasers, and, at most, other creditors; as to the judgmentdebtor and his heirs, the lien is perpetual. The judgment of 1797 was, in its terms, final and conclusive, unless errors should be shown within the time limited; and no such errors were ever shown. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 512]\n\u00a0\n III. The third point of the charge involves the validity of the acts of 1806 and 1807. The allegation that the statutes of Pennsylvania were, at the date of these acts, or at any time, designed to prostrate the constitution and the law, cannot receive the countenance of this court The fidelity both of her legislature and courts, to the constitution and the law, their intelligence in comprehending them, and their deference to the constitutional umpirage of this court, are, and uniformly have been, equal to those of any other state in the Union. In regard to the estates of John Nicholson, the act of 4th April 1805, P. L. 272, which authorizes the sale of the state lien and debts, to members of his own family, with a credit of ten years for payment of the amount, and which failed from the entire incompetency of those estates to furnish the security, is an evidence of unsurpassed tenderness to a public debtor, and irrefutable proof that the acts in question were not passed with that purpose of aggression upon either public law or private rights, which it has been the plaintiff's effort to establish as their motive.\n The consideration of the acts of 1806 and 1807 must be imperfect, unless it is connected with the state of circumstances at their enactment. The demands of the state had been established according to law, namely, by final settlement in the department of accounts, and by confession of the party, in the highest court of original jurisdiction in the state, with the fullest opportunity of trial by jury in both cases. The debtor was dead, and his heirs had removed to Louisiana; he had died in prison, and his estate was so desperately insolvent, that no administration was asked to it, until after the institution of this suit. His means, and the public money, by his misapplication of it, had been dissipated in land speculations through fifty counties, in every stage of title, from warrant and survey returned, to surveys unreturned and warrants unsurveyed. The whole was liable to be swept away, by sales for taxes, before successive executions, according to the course of the courts, could have gone through a tenth of the counties. The title was moreover so involved, that a sale by the sheriff, in the ordinary way, would not have raised the costs. Individuals and associations also, by such devices as shipwreck commonly brings into action, endeavored to conceal, for their own use, a portion of the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 513]\n\u00a0\n property that had been cast upon the strand, without regard to the legal claims of any one. The only hope of salvage consequently rested upon just such an interference as was authorized by these acts. Whether it was constitutional, is the question.\n The characteristics of both the acts are essentially the same. They are: 1st, To raise the money without sale, by compromise and transfer of the state lien. 2d, To prepare the way for beneficial sale, by investigating title, demanding, and by due course of law recovering, John Nicholson's papers from those who had no right to them, making partition in case of joint interest, and by staying sales for taxes. 3d, To sell under a warrant or writ by the governor, in the most beneficial way, upon credit, so much of the land as would raise the proportion of the lien-debt averaged upon the particular tract sold, after a longer public notice of sale than the general execution law required, and in certain cases, where the tract would not raise its proportion of the debt, to authorize a purchase by the commissioners for the commonwealth. The proceedings of the commissioners were to be under the sanction of an oath, and they received their compensation from the state, and not from the property of the debtor. In a word, the acts create a special authority to sell in satisfaction of liens for state debts, duly established according to law, with the fullest opportunity of trial by jury, upon appeal from the settlement, and in regard to the judgment, with a jury sworn at the bar to try the issue, when the defendant confessed the damages. His estate was liable, by the general law, to make this satisfaction; the acts leave him and his representatives the unimpaired right to contest the liens, in any and every way, in the courts of justice; and they have done it, in this case, without stint, and without receiving any answer except upon the merits of their allegations. If there was no lien, the defendants have no title. If the debt was paid or released, the purchaser is not protected by these acts, as a purchaser at sheriff's sale would be, under an execution upon a satisfied judgment. The debtor's remedy for any wrong done to him in the execution of the acts, is larger than if the sale had been made under the process of a court. It continues open for an unlimited time, may be set up collaterally in the investigation of any title \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 514]\n\u00a0\n conveyed under it, and has the benefit of a strict construction of the special authority conferred by the acts.\n The question gravely is, whether the legislative power of Pennsylvania is competent to the creation of such an authority, or whether it is restrained, by what is termed organic law, from creating a power of sale, to be exercised by anything but a court of justice. Such a position as the last denies to the legislature of Pennsylvania the least and humblest of legislative capacities. The practice of all the states, under their respective constitutions, is against the proposition. The whole subject of remedial process, and of remedial laws of every kind, is entirely within the competency of the legislature. The forms of writs, original and final, are varied at pleasure. Powers of sale, to assist or enforce vested rights, are created by them, every day, and in every way and manner that convenience requires-in commissioners to sell for taxes, in executors and administrators to sell for debts, in guardians, committees of lunatics, and trustees generally. The very power in question, to sell in satisfaction of a lien annexed to the settlement of a public account, is given by an act of congress, under no larger a charter than is possessed by the state of Pennsylvania. Act of 15th May 1820,  2 (3 U. S. Stat. 592). The adjudications are numerous, that when it is not an existing power in the courts, the legislature may create it; and that when it is, they may delegate it to another body; that as all legislative powers appertain to sovereignty, the choice of means to enforce existing rights belongs, in the absence of express by the constitution, entirely to the legislature, to select any they may deem appropriate. Stoddart v. Smith, 5 Binn. 355; Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 627; Estep v. Hutchman, 14 Serg. & Rawle 435; Rice v. Parkman, 16 Mass. 330; McCullough v. State of Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316; Fisher v. Blight, 2 Cranch 396.\n The matter of inquiry is, whether there is a constitutional restraint, and where it is? By the constitution of Pennsylvania, art. 1,  1, the whole legislative power of the commonwealth is vested in the general assembly. In the creation of tribunals for the exercise \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 515]\n\u00a0\n even of judicial powers, the legislature are under no restraint. They may place it where they please, and in themselves, if they see fit. 'The judicial power of this commonwealth shall be vested in a supreme court, &c ., and in such other courts as the legislature may from time to time establish.' Art. 5,  1. The power of the legislature to grant chancery powers to existing courts, or to create chancery courts, is without limitation. Besides the equity powers granted by the constitution to the supreme court and courts of common pleas, to perpetuate testimony, &c., 'the legislature shall vest in the said courts such other powers to grant relief in equity, as shall be found necessary, and may, from time to time, enlarge or diminish those powers, or vest them in such other courts as they shall judge proper, for the due administration of justice.' Art. 5,  6. The legislature, consequently, are not bound, in the erection of tribunals of any description, to prescribe to them the course of the common law, or the course of law, as distinguished from equity; nor are they bound to vest powers, either ministerial or judicial, in existing tribunals. The whole subject is open to the legislative body to do as it seems fit. What then may be extracted from the plaintiffs' argument, as objections to the acts of 1806, 1807?\n\n 1. \nIt is said to be the exercise of a judicial power by an extra- judicial tribunal. The answer is already given, that this, if true in fact, would not be an objection. If it be a judicial power, the tribunal to which it is granted is within the range of the legislative powers of the commonwealth, vested in the general assembly. If it is not a judicial power, the objection fails in fact. It is, indeed, not judicial, but ministerial, and simply remedial of an existing right. The power to compromise and transfer the state lien, if the former be judicial in its character, was not exercised in the present case, and never can be objected to by the heirs of Nicholson, because they cannot be affected by its exercise; it concerns the commonwealth and the transferree only. Whether judicial or not, and whether the constitution of Pennsylvania be unusually large in the grant of legislative powers or not, the objection has no weight. Cooper v. Telfair, 4 Dall. 14; Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 660; Jackson v. Griswold, 5 Johns. 142; \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 516]\n\u00a0\n Rice v. Parkman, 16 Mass. 330; Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 413.\n\n 2. \nIt is said to be ex post facto by its retrospective effect. It is not ex post facto. Laws of that character have relation to crimes. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 396; Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch 138; Commonwealth v. Lewis, 6 Binn. 271. If retrospective, that is not sufficient, there must be something more. There is no clause in the constitution of the state of Pennsylvania, or the United States, against retrospective laws. Such a clause would have struck the legislative power as with a palsy. As to remedies, all defects in existing cases would have been made incurable by it; and even as to rights, circumstantial defects might have been extensively fatal. Retrospective laws, enforcing vested rights, are among the most indispensable and beneficial acts of legislation. Ubi leges cum justitia restrospicere possent, the courts cannot avoid enforcing them. They have been repeatedly santioned, and their constitutional validity asserted. Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386; Bambaugh v. Bambaugh, 11 Serg. & Rawle 191; Holden v. James, 11 Mass. 396; Foster v. Essex Bank, 16 Ibid. 270; Mason v. Haile, 12 Wheat. 375; Tate v. Stooltzfoos, 16 Serg. & Rawle 35; Understood v. Lilly, 10 Ibid. 101; Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 413; Goshen v. Stonington, 4 Conn. 221; Mason v. Haile, 12 Wheat. 378; Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 200; Bank of Columbia v. Okely, Ibid. 205; Young v. Bank of Alexandria, 4 Cranch 397; Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 658. The retroaction of these acts, if any, was to authorize a special process of sale, which justice and the general law warranted, and to which the power of a general court of chancery would have been competent, without any act of the legislature. If the exercise of the authority divests any rights, it does so in favor of vested rights. A court of equity could have done the same thing. The objection then is, that the powers of a court of equity, which the legislature may create or grant to the utmost extent, and to any tribunal whatever, they cannot grant, in a partial degree, to commissioners, nor exercise it themselves.\n\n 3. \nIt is said to be a violation of the trial by jury. The \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 517]\n\u00a0\n acts deny nothing, but the inquisition upon the writ of fieri facias which compels a plaintiff to take an extent, if the rents and profits are found sufficient to pay in seven years. In regard to wild lands, however, like the tracts in question, they do not deny it, any more than the act of 1705. An inquisition is not necessary in such a case. 2 Dall. 77; 1 Yeates 427; 2 Binn. 91; 2 Yeates 150, 414. At the same time, the power of the legislature over such inquests, as part of the process, or to assist the court in the assessment of damages, is perfect and complete. They may restrict it, or abolish it altogether. It forms no part of the trial by jury, secured by the constitution, and can be repealed at pleasure. 'Trial by jury shall remain as heretofore.' The constitution does not say, that in all cases in which facts have been heretofore ascertained by a jury or inquest, they shall continue to be so, but that trial by jury shall remain. What is trial by jury? This language is taken from the English common law, known and used in the colonies, before the revolution. It is not a loose and vague expression, but of definite signification. It was not intended to bind the legislature to the old modes of ascertaining collateral facts, or for the determination of matter concerning which there is no judicial controversy, but to secure a great and wellknown mode of trial for the determination of an issue. Trial is the examination of the matter in issue. It supposes a suit, criminal or civil, an issue formed, and the reference of this issue for decision to some tribunal. It is the probation of the matter in issue, before judgment, and upon which judgment is to depend. Trial by jury, therefore, as one of the modes of trial known to the common law, is the probation of a matter of fact issue between parties, in a depending suit, before judgment; it is its probation, before that body, sometimes twelve in number, and in some actions more, to whom, according to the course of the law, the decision of issues in fact belonged, before the constitution, in proceedings according to the course of the common law. This is the trial by jury, the right to which is secured, and its great value is in the decision of issues in criminal causes. The clause has no reference to such a case as the present. The right of trial by jury, in its constitutional sense, Nicholson had, and did not choose to exercise or enjoy it. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 518]\n\u00a0\n 4. It is said to impair the obligation of a contract by the state with John Nicholson, and several contracts have been imagined. 1st. The contract is supposed to be implied in the words of the act of 1785, that the settlement shall be a lien, 'in the same manner as if judgment had been given in favor of the commonwealth,' namely, to be enforced in the same manner by process of execution from a court. The meaning of this clause of the act of 1785 may be, either that the lien shall be equally extensive over the state, or equally conclusive of the debt in favor of purchasers, or of the same character and effect as that of a judgment; but it cannot be, what the plaintiff supposes, because the thing concerning which the identity is enacted is the lien, and not the mode of enforcing it. The nature of the lien of a judgment as a general and not a specific lien, was well known in Pennsylvania, and the object of the clause was, to liken the lien of a settlement to that which was already known; the clause had no other object. 2d. A contract is supposed to be implied by the confession of judgment, that it shall be enforced only by execution. There is no warrant for any such implication; the contract of a judgment, or the obligation of the contract, is by the debtor to pay it; there is no contract or obligation in the creditor to obtain payment only in one way. He may obtain it through execution, or scire facias, or debt, or foreign attachment, or by bill in equity, or in any other way that the law allows at its date, or may subsequently allow. This suggestion, that the process to enforce a judgment is obligatory upon the creditors, in manner and form as it exists at the entry of the judgment, mistakes the creditor's right, for duties, and the duties of the debtor, for rights. 3d. A contract is supposed to be implied in the grant of the land by the state to Nicholson, that the state would not resume the grant, nor sell the land by any extra- judicial, public or arbitrary means. The state has not resumed the grant. The title of Nicholson is now the title of the defendant, not passing through the state, but transferred directy in satisfaction of debt, by the process of the law. The nature of that process, whether it should be the old or a new form, and whether enforced under the supervision of a court or of commissions, is within the competency of the legislature to decide. Unless every grant of land by the commonwealth \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 519]\n\u00a0\n is a contract for the perpetual continuance of all laws existing at its date, and for the introduction of no other, there is no weight in this objection. Contracts by the commonwealth, not to use the constitutional power belonging to it, are not to be implied in the rash and fanciful manner of these exceptions. They require the support of clear and plain expressions. Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 563; Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Ibid. 289.\n It is said, that the acts of 1806 and 1807 are partial laws, made by the state for its own benefit, by which it has decided the question of right in its own favor. This is a misapprehension. Every question of right was previously settled by an impartial tribunal; nothing remained but the remedy. If the state cannot devise a new remedy for its own rights, neither can it for those a private person. If the acts are bad, because the state is a party, the public interest must remain without protection, since the state must always be, to the same extent as now, a party to the legislation that protects them. As to partial legislation generally, there can be no reason for making a remedy larger than the mischief, and the legislature are the exclusive judges of the extent of any mischief that requires legislative aid. Whether an act should comprehend one case or a thousand depends solely on the pleasure of those, from whom alone the act is to proceed.\n Finally, it is supposed, that these acts violate those clauses of the Pennsylvania bill of rights which prohibit unreasonable seizures, and the taking of property, without the judgment of peers, or the law of the land. The answer to these is, that there is nothing seized or disposed of, but what the general immemorial law of the state has devoted to the payment of debts. The multiplicity of constitutional objections by which the plaintiff's argument has been distinguished, is probably owing to the difficulty of finding any one that possesses strength enough to stand by itself.\n The points of evidence may be briefly disposed of. The journals of the house exhibiting the paper No. 21, being a statement of debts due the commonwealth on the 1st January 1797; the report of the committee of ways and means of 24th March 1798; and the report of the same committee of 30th March 1799; being offered to prove that the accounts of the commonwealth \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 520]\n\u00a0\n and John Nicholson were not then finally settled, were properly rejected, because: 1. They were none of them competent evidence of the fact. If the question be, what the house has done, and if that be relevant, the journals are evidence, but not as to facts stated in any report, order or resolution. 1 Phil. Evid. 305, 323; Kelly v. Jackson, 6 Pet. 630; Titus Oates's Case, 4 State Trials The only exception is when the fact to be proved is an act of state, as the king's speech and answer . King v. Holt, 5 T.R. 445. 2. Because the fact was not relevant. Suppose, all the accounts not then finally settled, or suppose, the judgment and settlements to have been for the same cause, the title to the defendant was still good, because the debt and the lien remained until satisfaction. Ledger C was not evidence of itself, because it was not a book of original entries: it was a mere index, and an imperfect one too. Had it been an original book, it was offered too late, namely, after the defendants' evidence was closed. It was not introduced to rebut anything, and when that is not the case, the admission of additional evidence by the plaintiff, after the defendant has finished, is in the court's discretion. The refusal is not matter of exception. Conard v. Atlantic Ins. Co., 1 Pet. 451; Salmon v. Rance, 3 Serg. & Rawle 314; Frederick v. Gray, 10 Ibid. 182; Irish v. Smith, 8 Ibid. 573.\n Sergeant, on the same side (also for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ), argued as follows:-The title of the defendants is this. They claim under a public sale, fairly made on the 15th July 1807. The money was paid ($86.67 for 438 acres and 62 perches), and a deed duly made under authority of law, the 18th March 1808. The sale and the deed were of lands within the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. They were made under two laws duly passed by the representatives of the freemen of Pennsylvania. The one of these laws is dated the 31st of March 1806, the other, the 19th of March 1807. The title of the first of these acts is, 'an act for the more speedy and effectual collection of certain debts due to this commonwealth.' The second is a supplement. Under this spurchase, the title is regularly derived to the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 521]\n\u00a0\n defendants. They, and those under whom they claim, have been in possession, actual or constructive, ever since, that is for twenty-one years before suit, without question.\n The title of the plaintiffs is as follows. They claim to be the heirs of John Nicholson, and nothing else; they stand in the place of John Nicholson, with his right, whatever it is, and no more; they are neither creditors nor purchasers, nor have they any equity to add to the title that was in him. It is now to be seen, what this title is, which they rely upon, to overturn the laws, possession, deed and all. They have a warrant of the 24th of March 1794, for 400 acres. It was one of 513 warrants taken out by Mr. Nicholson for 203,560 acres, af fifty shillings a hundred. On the 14th of June 1794, he paid into bank $14,254 for the whole quantity, this tract included. With whose money it was that he paid, does not positively appear. But it is fully proved, that at the very time, he owed to the commonwealth more than $100,000 for money and securities abstracted from the funds committed to him as comptroller, in violation of his official trust. There can be no great merit in paying the commonwealth with her own money, or in making official misfeasance contribute to private aggrandisement. A survey was made in August 1794, and duly returned. No deed-poll is produced from the warrantee. It is useless, however, to scrutinize the title in its inception. By agreement between the plaintiffs and defendants (to which the commonwealth was no party), this is admitted. The title of John Nicholson, then, is warrant and survey, in 1794, and payment of exactly $24.67. This is the whole of the title. From 1794 to 1828, a period of thirty-four years, the history is a blank. No possession was taken; it is not pretended. No claim of ownership; it is out of the question. No contribution to the prosperity of the commonwealth. Not even a tax paid. In the meantime, what happens? By the common exertion and contribution of the state and her citizens, the public prosperity is promoted. These lands are cultivated, improved and settled, at a great expense of money and labor, giving them a value they had not before. Then, after thirty and more years, come the heirs to \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 522]\n\u00a0\n take the lands and improvements. There is a time for all things; being suffered to pass, there ought to be an end of claim. Of all that has been done, and all that was doing, the heirs had notice. Whatever has been done, has been done by or under public laws; a public law is notice to every body.\n But it is said, they were in another state, and were under the disability of infancy. As to the first, the answer is very obvious. Their being in another state, makes no difference, where the question is of lands in Pennsylvania. They are affected, wherever they may be, with notice of the legislation of Pennsylvania upon lands within her limits. Infancy makes no difference, where it is a question about charges upon land. This is an ancient common-law principle. 1 Inst. 380 b; 2 Ibid. 703. An infant's land may be sold under mortgage; it may be sold to pay debts; it may be sold to pay taxes. He is bound to take notice of public laws, unless expressly saved; in equity, he is bound, where he stands by and does not give notice of his rights. 9 Mod. 38; 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 489; 1 Bro. C. C. 353. A case like this would be a fraud upon every principle of equity. But the allegation of infancy is not founded in fact. The record shows that the eldest of the children of John Nicholson was of age, twenty- four years before the suit was brought, and the youngest living, fifteen years.\n Claiming, as they do, in right of their ancestor, it is but fit to say, that their ancestor had no property. He died insolvent, and he died in jail; that could not have happened in Pennsylvania, unless there were strong imputation of misconduct; so desperate were his affairs, that no administration was taken out; he was overwhelmed with judgments, as the record will show, for which no satisfaction could be had, and which, as well as his other debts, still remain unsatisfied; all that ever was in his name, would not now pay his debts. But these debts are in various ways affected by length of time; some are barried by the statute of limitations; in many, the securities are lost, the parties dead, or other changes have happened to destroy their activity, and to open a chance of getting the property without paying the debts. What a revolution it \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 523]\n\u00a0\n would be! We have heard of posthumous fame. This is a new mode of creating a posthumous fortune!\n Suppose, for a moment, it were John Nicholson himself. Could he be listened to, for a moment? The suggestion is too extravagant to be entertained. What property could his heirs derive from him? Looking at his history, as spread upon the record, it is not too much to say, it is impossible he should have had any. It is an abuse of terms, in defiance of such evidence, to talk of property derived from him. Such suits seem to be speculations upon human memory and the preservation of papers and records; they must be founded upon the calculation, that after a length of time, many things will be forgotten or lost, and what is known to be true, cannot be proved. The boldness of the undertaking is without a paralled in judicial history. The plaintiffs attempt to overturn (as will be seen in the sequel) eight acts of the legislature of Pennsylvania; three settlements of public accounts, made almost forty years ago; two solemn decisions of the supreme court of Pennsylvania; a judgment of the same court, and a deed made by the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. All this, too, by a new light, arising after twenty-five years of darkness, and against bond fide purchasers without notice. This court is called upon to exert a power of destroying, far transcending all former precedent. Single laws, and single acts, have been questioned; but this suit proposes a sort of general nullification of all that has been done for a third of a century.\n What is more particularly to be said, in answer to the claim set up by the plaintiff in error, may be presented under these heads, which will comprehend all the errors assigned in the charge. 1. That the commonwealth of Pennsylvania had liens upon the lands of John Nicholson, for a debt or debts owing to her. 2. That the acts of 1806 and 1807 were constitutional acts; and the proceedings under them, valid and effectual to enforce those liens, and recover the debts.\n I. The commonwealth had three liens. 1. By the settlements of March and December 1796. 2. By the judgments in the supreme court. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 524]\n\u00a0\n 3. By the fact that a debt was due to her from a person deceased, that is, John Nicholson; in other words, she acquired a lien by his death, if she had none before. It is immateral, what was the nature of the lien, provided there was a lien. The essence is, that a debt was due. Against those claiming as heirs, that, of itself, was sufficient.\n\n 1. \nThe commonwealth of Pennsylvania had a lien by the settlements of March and December 1796. Before examining the acts, I will law down some general principles, unquestionable in themselves, and applicable to the present case. 1. That in the management of her own fiscal concerns, Pennsylvania has the power of a sovereign and independent state. 2. That she has a right to make laws for the collection of her revenue, and for the settlement of accounts of public debtors and creditors. It is necessary for creditors, as well as for debtors, because the state is not suable, and they can only obtan payment by means of such laws. 3. That she has a right, for this purpose, to constitute such tribunals, and establish such modes of proceeding as she may think proper. That peculiar laws and peculiar proceedings are indispensable, and universally adopted, because the administration of the revenue of a state cannot be adequately managed, nor with the necessary dispatch, by the agency of the ordinary tribunals or the ordinary forms. And that this is not at all in derogation of the common law, which cannot properly be said to apply to it. It is done by the United States, and by every state in the Union. 4. That she has a right, from time to time, to alter these laws and proceedings, according to her own views of her own exigencies, as fully as the United States or any other state. 5. That persons accountable to the commonwealth, have no vested right in the particular provisions of accounting laws, which can interfere with this power of the state. The act of congress of the 15th of May 1820, is retrospective as well as prospective in its operation. The question mooted in 4 Wheat. 4, as to the right of reducing salary, has no bearing upon the present. 6. That the acts and proceedings of these special tribunals \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 525]\n\u00a0\n need not be according to the course of the common law, but must be according to the exigencies of the state. Such has been the practice from the earliest period of the commonwealth, allowing finally, on appeal or otherwise, a trial by jury, since 1785. 7. That the proceedings of such tribunals, however constituted, are entitled to respect; they are not to be collaterally questioned; and after a length of time, everything is to be presumed in their favor, as in favor of any other tribunal. Thompson v. Touline, 2 Pet. 157. 8. That where acts are done by accounting officers, according to law, they will produce their legal effect, without any regard to the intentions of the officers themselves. 9. That where the power of the commonwealth over this subject is exercised in part, the residue is not parted with or destroyed, but reserved in full force, to be executed in such mode as the legislature may think fit. In other words, the subsisting laws are not a contract with the office, or accountant, but are liable to be altered at the will of the legislature. Providence Bank v. Billings, 4 Pet. 514, 559-60, &c. This was the understanding and practice of the state, before the constitution; it has been so since; it is so with the United States, and every state in the Union. In relation to public dues, it must be so.\n With the benefit of these principles, then, let us proceed to the first inquiry, which may be examined under two heads. 1st. Were the settlements of March and December 1796, settlements according to law? 2d. If they were, did they constitute a lien?\n 1st. They profess to be settlements, and are made by the authorized and proper officers, using their official titles in the act. They are made in the usual office forms, and deposited in the proper office, where they have since remained, and whence they were brought to be given in evidence in this cause. They are duly certified, and were produced by the plaintiffs. They embrace subjects proper for settlement, and within the jurisdiction of the officers who made the settlements. They were made by officers, who had nothing to do with the accounts but to settle them. They were made thirty years ago. From that time to this, no further or other settlement has ever been made \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 526]\n\u00a0\n of these accounts. They have never been called in question but once-that was by a creditor, a single objection was made, and was authoritatively decided in their favor. So far, as to the accounts themselves; enough, certainly. But the evidence does not stop here. There is a mass of proof, besides, in the record, of irresistible force and weight. They were recognised and sanctioned, as settlements, by John Nicholson himself. The two accounts of the 19th of November 1796, proved to have been in his possession, one by his own indorsement, and the other by indorsement of his counsel, refer to them as settled accounts. These papers, it will be observed, are not themselves settled accounts. They were then in course of settlement, which was completed in the following month, by giving him credits against the balance of the former settlements. The first item in each is a debit for the balance of the account previously 'settled.' It is material to remark, that they came from amongst the private papers of Mr. Nicholson. They were there, for more than three years during his life, without disapprobation or objection. This is conclusive evidence of assent to what is contained in them; it would be so, at any time; still more is it so, after so great a lapse of years. It would be conclusive evidence against any one; a fortiori, is is conclusive against Mr. Nicholson, who had been so long comptroller, and was acquainted with the forms of office. He knew the precise import of the word 'settled.' One of them was received by him in 1796, the other, at least as early as the 21st of March 1797. This fact thus becomes an admission by John Nicholson himself, that there had been a settlement according to law.\n Again, if the argument on the other side be correct, these settlements were adopted, acted upon, and finally and conclusively agreed to, by the judgment in the supreme court in March 1797. The argument is, that the judgment was for the amount of these settlements. If so, it was upon the settlements, and affirmed them. Further, in the year 1803, one of these settlements was submitted to judicial investigation and decision in the supreme court of Pennsylvania. Smith v. Nicholson, 4 Yeates 6. It was decided upon. That decision has been the uncontroverted law of Pennsylvania for twenty-seven years. It has been the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 527]\n\u00a0\n foundation of repeated legislation by public laws, as a reference to the several acts of assembly upon this subject will show. The judiciary was first appealed to, and when the rights of the commonwealth had been judicially ascertained, and not before, laws were made to render those rights effectual. The course pursued was the opposite of that which has been imputed. The legislature did not exercise its power upon the question of right. There was no arbitrary assumption or exertion of authority, no interference with the exercise of judicial power, no invasion of the province of the judiciary, nothing which bears the most remote resemblance to seizure or confiscation of property. But when the courts had decided that the property was liable for the debts due to the commouwealth, that the settlements were a lien, then, and not till then, the legislature interposed (as it was rightfully bound to do), to devise the means of rendering the right effectual, to afford the needful remedy, to enforce the payment of a just debt out of the fund that was adjudged to be liable for it.\n The first act of the legislature upon the subject, is that already referred to, of the 4th of April 1805, entitled, 'an act for the more speedy and effectual recovery of debts, &c.' It authorizes the sale of all the commonwealth's liens so Blythe and Nicholson, and directs the payment out of the moneys of the commonwealth of the taxes on the 'lands of the late John Nicholson.' The act of the 4th of April 1805, appropriates $10, 000 for the payment of the taxes. The act of the 31st of March 1806 (one of those now in question) prohibits sales for taxes, and authorizes their payment out of the state treasury. The act of 19th of March 1807, asserts the lien. The act of 24th of March 1808, is a supplement to the act last mentioned, to give certain powers to those who purchase portions of the lien by way of compromise. The act of 28th of March 1814, is also a supplement, and prohibits sales for taxes. The act of 16th of March 1810, authorizes payment of taxes. And the act of 5th of February 1821, authorizes the issuing of process for the sale of land, in behalf of individuals named in it. Here, then, are eight public laws of the commonwealth, extending through a period of sixteen years, all assuming the existence of the settlement and lien, and providing for the potection and security of the property, as the fund for the payment \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 528]\n\u00a0\n of the debt. Public laws were suspended in their operation upon these lands; the taxes were paid out of the public treasury. Sales were made, purchases, compromises and releases. There has been a universal acquiescence, especially, by the numerous creditors of John Nicholson. But for this, the lands would long ago have been sold for debts or for taxes. It has been truly said, that it is owing to the interposition of the commonwealth alone, that there is anything now to dispute about or claim. This public fact has become extensively incorporated into land-titles throughout Pennsylvania. Improvements have been made upon the faith of it. Transfers of property have assumed it, to an extent not to be denied, but, according to a printed paper put forth on the part of the plaintiffs, embracing more than two millions of acres.\n Is it competent to the plaintiffs, at this time of day, to dispute the settlement? Can they be permitted, by such exceptions as are here presented to what was so long ago done, to disturb the titles thus derived under the laws of Pennsylvania? If there were not a paper or a witness, is there not ample evidence? Can they, who have lain by, now demand proof of what was done thirty-four years ago? To allow it, would encourage frauds, would destroy the security of property, and the peace of society. These are considerations of weight, and are estimated accordingly in the administration of justice. Chalmer v. Bradley, 1 Jac. & Walk. 63. More than time has now run to make a bar by statute. A mortgage would be barred in less time; a bond would be presumed paid. Almost anything would be presumed in support of a right. The presumption comes in the place of evidence which time has effected or destroyed, and to uphold that which has become so settled as to give assurance of itself, that it was originally fixed upon a sure foundation.\n But what are the objections to the settlements? Can they not be refuted, even without aid from the principles which have been adverted to? It is impossible to avoid remarking of them, that they are altogether unworthy to be associated with the great points professed to be aimed at in this case. They tend to degrade their companions, and bring them into suspicion. What are they? \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 529]\n\u00a0\n 1. That there was no notice given of the settlements of John Nicholson. The meaning of this objection must be, that there is no proof of notice. It may be answered, then, in the first place, that after such a length of time, it is not necessary; it will be presumed. In the next place, the settlement itself is sufficient. Either notice was required by the laws of Pennsylvania, or it was not; if it was not, there is an end of the matter; if it was, the presumption would be that the accounting officers did what the law required or them, at least, until the contrary appeared. In the Commonwealth v. Fitler, 12 Serg. & Rawle 277 (which was under a different law), the negative was proved. That, therefore, affords no rule in the present case. The whole accounting system of Pennsylvania is founded upon the act of 1782. That act contemplates settlement upon the accounts produced by the accountant. 2 Dall. Laws 45. He is, therefore, the actor, in general, and requires notice. But there is clear proof of notice in fact. The two papers before referred to, of November 1796, state the settlements to have been made, and no objection was ever taken to them, though John Nicholson lived for several years afterwards, and lived in the same city where the government was, and where the accounts were settled. It is quite incredible, that he had not notice. In addition to all this, the settlements were made under a public law of April 20th, 1795, 3 Dall. Laws 1790, specially directing the settlement of the accounts of John Nicholson. A public law is notice to every body. It is sufficient, however, for the present case, that no law required notice to be given.\n\n 2. \nThat these settlements were not 'entered' in the books of the accounting officers, as it is alleged was required by law. The meaning of this, as of the former objection, is that there was no proof of the entry. The first answer is, that there was proof. The plaintiffs themselves produced the settlements, and made them their own evidence, though they would have come in more properly on the part of the defendants. Both of them were accompanied by official certificates, by the proper officers, also given in evidence by the plaintiffs, that they were 'settled and entered.' \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 530]\n\u00a0\n Can they deny this, without any proof to the contrary? The fact is, they were entered. The next answer is equally decisive. The entry in the books in no part of the settlement. It is of the settlement, and after the settlement. The settlement is completed, and after being completed, is then entered, as having been made. Act of 4th April 1792, 3 Call. Laws 218. In case of appeal, the entry would not be till after the appeal. Was there no settlement in the meantime? Then, there could be no appeal, for the appeal is from the settlement. The settlement is final before appeal, but its enforcement is suspended by the appeal. The entry could not be made till the officers were ready to certify to the governor.\n\n 3. \nIt is objected, that these are not settlements of all the accounts of John Nicholson, and the officers were not authorized to settle in part. This objection is without any foundation in fact, for the books which it is supposed would prove it, are not in evidence. But let it be admitted, as it is probable, that there were other accounts. It may, perhaps, be inferred, that there were, from the various duties devolved upon him by different laws, and from the repeated appropriations for the expenses of investigating his accounts. Is the legal inference correct? Certainly not. There is no law which requires that a settlement should be of all accounts. On the contrary, the act of 20th of April 1795, 3 Dall. Laws 790, directs them to be settled, from time to time, in succession. This point also must be considered as having been decided in Smith v. Nicholson. In truth, the subjects of account were distinct and separate.\n\n 4. \nIt may be suggested, that upon a general settlement, the balance might have been in his favor, though upon these accounts, it was against him. But to this suggestion, of a mere possibility, there are several decisive answers. 1st. The nature and duties of his trusts were such as to make it impossible there should be a balance in his favor. He could not be in advance, the accounts arising from property intrusted to him. 2d. All the efforts to obtain a settlement were on the part of the commonwealth; no aid was given by the accountant; what was obtained, was extorted from him. Finally, the confession of judgment is an unequivocal admission. The whole \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 531]\n\u00a0\n inquiry, however, it will be seen, is immaterial to the present purpose. It is stated only to show that there is not the slightest ground for the suggestion of even the possibility of injustice in the part of the commonwealth towards Mr. Nicholson.\n\n 5. \nIt has been intimated, that the officers did not intend them to be settlements. Where such a notion could have been derived, it is difficult to conceive. For reasons already stated, it would be immaterial, what they intended, if they officially did what produced a certain legal consequence. But the fact that they did intend them to be settlements, is apparent; for the act of 20th April 1795, made it their duty to settle. Again, they have always been treated as settlements, by every department of the government; and, in addition, they were acknowledged by Mr. Nicholson himself to be such, as has already been shown. There are some other objections made. It is unnecessary to go through them in detail, as they have already been sufficiently answered.\n 2d. Did these settlements constitute a lien, and what was the nature of the lien? It can scarcely be necessary to consider this question upon original grounds, having been long ago decided by the supreme court of Pennsylvania. A short view, however, will suffice to show how well grounded that decision was. It may be premised, that the accounting laws of Pennsylvania are not in derogation of the common law, or of the usual course of proceeding. Neither can it be said, that they establish new powers, for the benefit of the party creating them, and direct their execution in an unusual manner. They are not, therefore, obnoxious to a construction of such strictness as has been suggested. They are not at all within the reason of Shipp v. Miller's Heirs, 2 Wheat. 325, as laws giving powers of forfeiture. They are remedial, not penal. They are laws for the settlement of public accounts, and for the payment of public creditors, as well as the collection of public dues. They are salutary and necessary. They are entitled to a fair construction.\n These laws are all to be considered, in the construction of any one of them. The act of 4th April 1792,  1, 3 Dall. Laws 222, contains a special repeal of so much of every former \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 532]\n\u00a0\n act as is thereby altered or supplied, and no more. Thus, the whole of the acts of assembly, from the 13th April 1782, to 4th April 1792, form one system, and are to be construed together. It may be said, then, in the first place, that the lien of the act of 1785 is nowhere expressly taken away. Neither is it anywhere expressly 'altered or supplied.' Is is done by implication? Assuredly not, as a moment's attention will discover. By the act of 1782, the comptroller's settlement was made conclusive, and summary process was authorized to be issued immediately, against the property and person of the debtor, not unlike that given by the law of the United States of the 15th May 1820. 2 Dall. Laws 44. The act of 1785 (Ibid. 247), was to give the benefit of trial by jury. For that purpose, the third section gave an appeal. The appeal, of course, suspended the issuing of process to enforce the settlement. In lieu of it, and to secure to the commonwealth the recovery of what might finally appear to be due, the 12th section gave the lien. The appeal and the lien, therefore, came into existence together, and the one was given precisely because the other was given. The natural conclusion would be, that they would continue together, the reason being the same for keeping them associated, as for originally associating them. The appeal continued throughout; therefore, the lien continued throughout. Such must have been the intention of the legislature. It cannot, with any propriety, be said to be oppressive or unjust; on the contrary, it is part of a system for the relief of the accountant, which, but for the lien, would not be consistent with a due regard for the security of the commonwealth.\n The only argument against the lien is founded upon that part of the 12th section which speaks of the executive council. The answer to it is an obvious one. By the 3d section, the approbation of the executive council was necessary to make a settlement. The powers of the executive council were transferred to the governor, and the concurrence or approbation of the governor ceased to be necessary after the act of the 21st September 1791, 3 Dall. Laws 113, except where there was a disagreement between the comptroller and the register, in which case, the governor was to decide between them. If they agreed, their settlement was effectual. To suppose, that the governor's interposition had any effect upon \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 533]\n\u00a0\n the question of lien, would lead to this absurdity, that where the accounting officers differed, the settlement would be a lien; where they agreed, it would not.\n But why should this question be argued? It has been judicially decided by the supreme court of Pennsylvania twenty-seven years ago, and is the settled law of the state. Smith v. Nicholson, 4 Yeates 6; United States v. Nicholls, Ibid. 251. Such a decision, upon acts of assembly of a state, in the state courts of the highest authority, has been repeatedly adjudged here to be conclusive evidence of the law of the state. Hinde v. Lessee of Vattier, 5 Pet. 393; Ross v. McLung, 6 Ibid. 283; 1 Conn. 159, in notes. It has been said, that the supreme court of Pennsylvania would not, themselves, be bound by their own decision, and to prove it, we are told that in Bevan v. Taylor, 7 Serg. & Rawle 397 (a case turning upon the construction of the intestate laws), they overruled Walker's Administrators v. Smith, 3 Yeates 480. But admitting this to be so, it is only necessary to say, that Smith v. Nicholson never has been overruled or questioned. It is the law of Pennsylvania now, whatever possibilities there may be as to the future. If it should hereafter be overruled, it will then cease to be authority, but not before. This, however, is not likely to happen. It is too deeply rooted, to be overturned without extensive mischief, an argument admitted by the supreme court of Pennsylvania to be of great weight in favor of supporting ancient decisions. 7 Serg. & Rawle 400. The nature of the lien is sufficiently explained by the words of the act of assembly. It extends to all the lands of the debtor throughout the commonwealth.\n The second lien of the state was under the judgment of the 21st March 1797, in the supreme court of Pennsylvania, for $110,000. This, like the lien by settlement, bound all the lands of Mr. Nicholson throughout the commonwealth. Such is conceded to have been the effect of judgments obtained in the supreme court of Pennsylvania, before the passing of the act of 1799.\n By the death of John Nicholson, the state had a lien, and still continues to have a lien, as a creditor, upon all his lands in Pennsylvania. The lands of a decedent are bound for his debts. Graff v. Smith, 1 Dall. 481; Morris v. Smith, 1 Yeates \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 534]\n\u00a0\n 238; 4 Dall. 119. In favor of purchasers, this lien is limited to seven years; against heirs, it is without limitation.\n It appears thus, upon reviewing the case, 1. That there was a debt, conclusively and finally ascertained to be due to the commonwealth. 2. That this debt was a lien upon the land. 3. That it was of the nature of that lien, to give a right to raise the money out of the land by sale. 4. That there was no process to effectuate this right. Could the legislature provide the remedy? That is really the only question that remains. The points above stated being all settled, was it or was it not competent to the legislature to devise the means of doing what every one must agree ought to be done? This brings us to the second general head of inquiry.\n II. Are the acts of 1806 and 1807 unconstitutional and void? As has been already seen, they are strictly and bond fide remedial acts, to enforce the payment of debts justly due, out of a fund admitted to be liable for their satisfaction; they had no other object or intention. They were to supply a defect of suitable process, so that the creditor might have justice done him, and that against a public accountant, whose debt was evidence of official delinquency. They have worked no injury to any one; the heir had nothing until the debts were paid. Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 629. The property was insufficient to pay even the debt due to the commonwealth, as a fair public sale has ascertained; there was nothing for the heir. Was the legislature incompetent to supply the process? Those who affirm a proposition so extravagant, ought to make it out very clearly. A constitution imposing a restriction so unreasonable, would require to be altered; it is against every notion of what is expedient and what is just. The right of a creditor is a perfect right; it is as strong as the right of property, and has as strong a claim to protection. To take away all remedies from the creditor would be unconstitutional; to withhold from him adequate remedies, is contrary to the spirit of our social compacts. How, then, can it be unconstitutional to give him an adequate remedy? There is a glaring contradiction in the hypothesis. Common sense is confounded by it. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 535]\n\u00a0\n The purpose being a lawful one, the legislature really and truly adopted the means which they thought necessary for its attainment. They did not confiscate the lands; they did not seize upon them; they simply devised a mode of selling them, so that out of the proceeds, the debt owing to the commonwealth might be paid. The objection, then (if any there be), is only to the mode. This is a very narrow ground indeed. It is, that the legislature, in the exercise of a discretion which belongs to them, did not select the mode which to others may seem most fit. This is neither more nor less than to deny to them all discretion in the use of means; to limit them, where their power is usually deemed to be the most unlimited. There is no doubt whatever, that the method of proceeding they adopted was in fact the best. But that is a discussion not to be entertained in a judicial investigation.\n Before proceeding to examine the particular objections which have been made to these laws, it is necessary to establish the test they are to be submitted to, by referring to certain well-settled principles of constitutional law.\n\n 1. \nIt may be stated, upon clear authority, that a question of conflict between a law of a state and the constitution of the state, is not a question of federal cognisance. The judiciary of the Union has a clear paramount authority in all cases where there is a question whether a state law is repugnant to the constitution of the United States. Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 380; Jackson v. Lamphire, 3 Ibid. 280. But a question between a state law and a state constitution, comes into this court only in its administration of the laws of the state. It will be guided, therefore, by state decisions; giving the law to the state tribunals in questions of federal cognisance, and receiving it from them, in questions properly of state cognisance. Judicial harmony is thus preserved.\n\n 2. \nThat the constitution having received a construction by legislative, executive and judicial action, and the acquiescence of the citizens for a long time, that construction will prevail in judgment, especially, if rights be founded upon it. Stuart v. Laird, 1 Cranch 292; McCullough v. State of Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316.\n\n 3. \nThat there must necessarily be a limit in time to the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 536]\n\u00a0\n right of individuals to question the constitutionality of a law, where, by so doing, they would injure others who have acted upon a received construction, or overturn what has been done.\n\n 4. \nThat it is incumbent upon those who would thus impeach a law plainly to show a plain violation of some express provision of the constitution, so that laying the constitution and the law side by side, there is a manifest incompatibility. 'It is a power of high responsibility, and not to be exercised but in cases free from doubt.' TILGHMAN, C. J., 3 Serg. & Rawle 73. 'The question whether a law be void for its repugnancy to the constitution, is a question which ought seldom, if ever, to be decided affirmatively in a doubtful case. The opposition between the constitution and the law should be such, that the judge feels a clear and strong conviction of their incompatibility with each other.' MARSHALL, C. J., 6 Cranch 128. 'Must plainly violate some express provision of the constitution.' WASHIGNTON, J., 2 Pet. 330. And as to all speculative objections, founded upon supposed general principles, they are entirely put aside by CHASE, J., in 4 Dall. 18. General principles in the constitution are not to be regarded as rules to fetter and control, but only as declaratory or directory.\n\n 5. \nThat where a power is given by the constitution, the choice of means for effectuating it belongs to the legislature. United States v. Fisher, 2 Cranch 358; McCullough v. State of Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316.\n\n 6. \nThat an act may be constitutional in some of its provisions and unconstitutional in others, and the latter will not hurt the former.\n\n 7. \nThat it may be unconstitutional against one person, and not against another, and the latter cannot avail himself of the privilege of the former. If the acts in question were objectionable against creditors ( as they certainly are not), they might be good against the heirs.\n It will be perceived, at once, how these principles meet and obviate every objection that has been made. Before proceeding to examine these objections in detail, try them by another very simple test. Is there anything in the constitution of the United States, or of the state of Pennsylvania, which says that a man's \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 537]\n\u00a0\n property shall not be sold for the payment of his just debts? Is there anything which says the legislature shall not be allowed to judge of the means? Wilkinson v. Leland, 2 Pet. 656-7, &c., is exactly to the contrary, and is to the very point of the present case.\n It is no objection, founded in the constitution, that laws are retrospective. The constitution itself is decisive of this. The express prohibition of ex post facto laws, meaning retrospective criminal laws, is an admission that retrospective civil laws may be made. Expressio unius exclusio est alterius. No well-digested constitution could contain such a prohibition. It may be conceded, that in general, they are against the principles of sound legislation; but occasions will sometimes occur, where they are necessary; these cases make exceptions. That retrospective laws are not, on that account, unconstitutional, has been repeatedly decided in Pennsylvania. Bambaugh v. Bambaugh, 11 Serg. & Rawle 191; Underwood v. Lilly, 10 Ibid. 97; Barnet v. Barnet, 15 Ibid. 72; and was decided in this court in Satterlee v. Matthewson, before referred too. But the laws now in question are in no sense retrospective; they are entirely prospective.\n Neither is it any objection that laws may seem to exercise judicial functions. Estep v. Hutchman, 14 Serg. & Rawle 435. The line is not so defined as to mark exactly in all cases the boundary between legislation and judgment. Nor is it any objection that they constitute new tribunals. The legislature have power to do so, by the constitution of Pennsylvania. Art. 5,  1.\n Objections are not to be listened to, which have no better foundation than a general charge of injustice, or an appeal to what is supposed to be a sort of prevailing complexion of the constitution. These are arguments to be addressed to the legislature, when they are enacting laws, perhaps, to the judiciary when expounding them, but never when called upon to declare such laws to be incompatible with the constitution. If ever admissible, however, they would be inapplicable in the present case, where nothing has been done but what is just in itself, and in conformity with the soundest principles of legislation.\n The specific constitutional objections made by the plaintiffs \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 538]\n\u00a0\n in error, are sufficiently numerous. But their weight is in no proportion to their number. They are only so many ciphers.\n\n 1. \nIt is said to be an infraction of  10, art. 1, of the constitution of the United States, and  17 of the bill of rights of Pennsylvania. The one prohibits the making of state laws impairing 'the obligation of contracts,' the other prohibits laws, 'impairing contracts.' They are in substance the same. A contract will not be implied, in order to render a law obnoxious to the constitutional prohibitions. Hart v. Lamphire, 3 Pet. 380. But here there is no contract, express or implied. The grant of the land, by warrant and survey, was no contract that it should not be liable for the debt of the owner; it was exactly the reverse. The grant made him the owner, with the power to alien, and subject to alienation by process of law. It was to him, his heirs and assigns. Land is liable for the debts of the owner, is bound by judgments, and may be sold for the payment of his creditors; this is an incident to ownership, not repugnant to it, but one of its legal consequences. There is no resumption of the grant, as in Fletcher v. Peck, but a confirmation of it. All this is fully and clearly explained in Satterlee v. Matthewson, 2 Pet. 413. The settlement is no contract, nor the lien arising from it. The latter is to operate 'in the same manner as a judgment,' that is, to bind in the same manner. It is in invitum, obtained by compulsion of law, and not deriving any of its efficacy from the agreement of the party. The means of enforcing it, too, are derived from the law, and may be varied by the legislative power. They are not limited to such as may be in use when the judgment is obtained. There was no restriction in the special entry of the judgment, except that which was expressed, namely, that Mr. Nicholson should have a limited time to point out errors. The time being expired, without error being alleged, the judgment stands for the whole amount for which it was confessed. These laws not only violate no contract-they are in execution of a contract. All public dues bind by contract; there is an implied assumpsit. The claim upon Mr. Nicholson was still stronger, being founded upon his official contract, as well \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 539]\n\u00a0\n as upon the contract arising from his applying the money and property of the commonwealth to his own use. There can be no necessity for saying more in reply to the second objection, than that the eighth section of the bill of rights of Pennsylvania, relates only to seizure and search, and here, there was neither seizure nor search. Both these words have an appropriate legal sense, well understood.\n\n 3. \nIt is said to violate the seventh article of the amendments to the constitution of the United States, and the sixth article of the bill of rights of Pennsylvania. If this amendment of the constitution of the United States were applicable to the states (as it is not), it would still be impossible to understand, how the present case could be brought within its words or meaning. It was no 'trial at common law.' The execution of a judgment was what was in question. The sixth article of the bill of rights of Pennsylvania says nothing more than this: 'trial by jury shall be as heretofore, and the right remain inviolate. Was it ever the practice to have trials after judgment? Were juries ever used in such cases before? An inquest to ascertain whether the rents and profits will pay in seven years, is not a jury, in the sense of this article. It owes its existence to an act of assembly, which the legislature may at any time repeal or alter; and, in addition, it never was necessary in a case like this, of vacant and unseated land (as the land in question was at the time of the sale), but only where lands are improved and yielded an income.\n\n 4. \nIt is said to contravene the fourth article of the bill of rights. The answer is manifest. That article applies only to criminal prosecutions. If otherwise, it has been literally complied with. Neither can it be said, with any propriety, that this property was taken for public use, without compensation. It was not taken at all, but sold for the payment of debts. There was no exercise of the right of eminent domain. There is want of precision in the argument which imputes to these acts as an objection, that they were made by the legislature in its own case. The debt was owing to the commonwealth. The commonwealth was the creditor, the entire body politic, made up of all the citizens of Pennsylvania. The legislature was only a branch of the government. That the legislation was about matters which concerned the commonwealth, \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 540]\n\u00a0\n can surely be no valid objection, for these are peculiarly the proper subjects of legislation. The members of the legislature are no more interested than any other citizen.\n In every aspect, therefore, in which the case can be reviewed, it appears that the proceedings of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania have been just, prudent, patient and intelligent, as well as entirely consistent with the constitutions of the Union and the state. The government in all its branches has done its duty, and has done no more. The proceedings have been right, in form and in substance. To have established this, is all that can be necessary to vindicate the commonwealth against every charge that has been made, and renders it superfluous to notice the terms in which they have been so repeatedly presented. They perish of themselves, when they are thus shown to be without foundation. The respect due to the source from which they proceed, cannot sustain them now, whatever claim to attention it may have given them, in the first instance, before they were examined. With them also fall the objections to be judgment of the court below upon the points here discussed, all of which have been embraced in the discussion.\n The exceptions to the opinion of the court below, upon questions of evidence, now assigned for error, have been fully considered.\n\n JOHNSON, Justice, delivered the opinion of the court.\n This case comes up by writ of error from the circuit court of the United States of Pennsylvania, in which the plaintiffs here, were plaintiffs there. The plaintiffs make title as heirs of John Nicholson, and the defendants, as purchasers under certain commissioners, constituted by a law of that state for the purpose of selling the landed estate of John Nicholson, in satisfaction of certain liens which the state asserted to hold on his lands. The plaintiffs controvert the validity of that sale: 1st. As violating the constitution of Pennsylvania. 2d. As violating the constitution of the United States. 3d. As inconsistent with the principles of private rights and natural justice, and therefore, void; though not to be brought within the description of a violation of any constitutional stipulation. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 541]\n\u00a0\n 1. To maintain the argument upon which the counsel for plaintiffs rely, to establish the unconstitutional character of the acts under which the sale was made to defendants; the plaintiffs' counsel commence with an effort to remove out of his way the liens, to satisfy which the legislature professes to pass the acts authorizing the same. It appears from the record, that at the time of passing the acts which constituted this board of commissioners, to wit, in 1806 and 1807, the state claimed to hold four liens upon the lands of John Nicholson. 1st. A judgment for special damages, amounting to 4208l. 8s., entered December 18th, 1795. 2d. A settled account of March 2d, 1796, for $58,429.24, afterwards reduced to $ 51,209.22. 3d. Another settled account of December 20th, 1796, for $63,727. 86. And 4th. A judgment confessed and entered March 21st, 1797, for $110, 390, with certain special matter attached to the confession, wholly immaterial to the present controversy. The evidence of dated and circumstances might seem to lead to the opinion, that the first judgment, or the consideration of it, was incorporated into the settlements, and that the judgment of 1797 covered the whole. But of this there is no sufficient evidence; and the several liens must, on the facts in proof, be considered, as they are exhibited on the record, as substantive and independent.\n By a law of Pennsylvania, of February 15th, 1785, settlements made by the comptroller, with certain prescribed formalities, are declared to be liens upon the real estate of the debtor, 'in the same manner as if judgment had been given in favor of the commonwealth against such person, for such debt, in the supreme court.' A right of appeal is given, if the debtor is dissatisfied, with injunction that the court shall give interest for the delay, if the appeal is not sustained; but unless such appeal is made and judgment against the debtor, there is no \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 542]\n\u00a0\n provision in the law of enforcing satisfaction of the lien, by sale or otherwise. It is made to be a dead weight upon the hands of both debtor and creditor, without the means of relieving the one or raising satisfaction for the other.\n A great proportion of the argument for plaintiffs, both here and below, was devoted to the effort to prove that the two settlements enumerated were not subsisting liens, at the time of passing the two acts of 1806 and 1807, under which the sale was made to the defendants. But from this, as a subject of adjudication, we feel relieved by the two decisions cited from the 4th volume of Yeates' reports; since it appears, that this very lien of the 3d of March 1796, has been sustained by a decision of the highest tribunal in that state, as long ago as 1803 (Smith v. Nicholson); and that again in 1805, this decision was considered and confirmed, and acted upon, in another case in which the several applications of the principles established in the first case came under consideration. United States v. Nicholls.\n Now, the relation in which our circuit courts stand to the states in which they respectively sit and act, is precisely that of their own courts; especially, when adjudicating on cases where state lands or state statutes come under adjudication. When we find principles distinctly settled by adjudications, and known and acted upon as the law of the land, we have no more right to question them, or deviate from them, than could be correctly exercised by their own tribunals.\n It is proper here to notice a relaxation of this principle, into which the court below seems to have been surprised; and in which the argument of counsel in this cause was calculated to induce this court to acquiesce. In the case first decided in the supreme court of Pennsylvania, to wit, that of Smith v. Nicholson, 4 Yeates 8, most of the arguments made use of in this cause, to get rid of the lien of the settlement, and particularly that of a repeal of the act of 1785, or a want of compliance with its requisitions, were pressed upon that court, and carefully examined and disposed of by the judges. But there have been a variety of other grounds taken in the court below in this cause, and again submitted to this court in argumemt, which do not appear from the report of that decision, to have been brought to the notice of the state court. Such were \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 543]\n\u00a0\n the want of notice of the settlement; the want of its being entered in the books of the accounting officer; the balance not being struck in dollars and cents; that the order of settlement was reversed; and as the plaintiffs' counsel proposed to establish by evidence, that it was not a final and conclusive adjustment of all the existing debits and credits between the parties. Into the examination of most of these arguments, the court below has entered with a view to estimating and repelling their sufficiency, to shake the settlement in which the lien of the settlements is claimed. But we cannot feel ourselves at liberty to pursue the same course; since it supposes the existence of a revising power, inconsistent with the authority of adjudications on which the validity of those liens must now be placed. The rule of law being once established by the highest tribunal of a state, courts which propose to administer the law as they find it, are ordinarily bound, in limine, to presume that, whether it appears from the reports or not, all the reasons which might have been urged, pro or con, upon the point under consideration, had been examined and disposed of judicially.\n It is next contended, that the judgment of March 1797, had absorbed or superseded the liens of the settled accounts. This ground they proposed to sustain, by giving in evidence the journals of the house of representatives of the commonwealth, exhibiting certain reports of the register-general and of the committee of ways and means, conducing to prove that this judgment was rendered for the identical cause of action on which the settlements were founded. This evidence was rejected by the court; and that rejection constitutes one of the causes of complaint on which relief is now sought here. But this court is satisfied, that, supposing the evidence of these journals sufficient to prove the identity, and in other respects unexceptionable, establishing that fact, would not have benefited the cause of the plaintiffs. On this point, there is an unavoidable inference to be drawn from the case of United States v. Nicholls; for in that case, the lien of a settlement of prior date, in favor of the state, was sustained against a subsequent mortgage to the United States; although, as the case shows, there was a judgment upon the same cause of action with the settlement, of a date subsequent to the mortgage to the United States, and obtained upon an appeal from the settlement. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 544]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Dallas, for the United States, argued, that this appeal suspended the lien; but no one seems to have imagined, that the judgment superseded or absorbed the settlement. If to this be added, what was asserted by defendants' counsel, and acquiesced in by the plaintiffs'; that by a settled law of Pennsylvania, a judgment in an action of debt upon a previous judgment, does not destroy the lien of the first judgment, it puts this question at rest.\n In approaching the acts of 1806 and 1807, we are then authorized in assuming, that at the time they were passed, the state held unsatisfied liens upon the lands of John Nicholson to a large amount, under the two settlements of 1776, without any legal means of raising the money by sale; and also judgments to a great amount, which, by reason of the death of Nicholson, and the want of a personal representative, they were equally precluded from all ordinary means of having satisfied. Thus circumstanced, the legislature passed those acts, the professed and unaffected and only object of which was, to raise, from the sale of John Nicholson's land, money sufficient to satisfy the liens of the state. In justice to the moral as well as legal and constitutional character of those laws, it is proper to give an outline of their provisions.\n It is obvious, from the evidence in the cause, that between the date of the settled accounts and the passing of those acts, great changes had taken place in the possession and property of the lands of John Nicholson. Whether in any or all the cases of such change of property, the tracts sold became discharged of the liens of the state or not, is not now the question; if they were, the holders were at liberty to assert their rights against the state. In this case, no such discharge is set up; the tract was one that had remained the property of Nicholson. There were then three interests to be regulated; first, that of the state; second, that of the persons in possession; and third, that of the heirs of Nicholson. That the state was not unmindful of the last, is distinctly shown, by the offer of compromise tendered to the family, before the act of 1806 was passed, and by adopting a mode of sale, calculated as much as possible to avoid throwing back the purchaser upon the heirs for damages, where sales had been made by their ancestor. Hence, the plan of the act of 1806 was this: first, to ascertain \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 545]\n\u00a0\n all the lands affected by lien throughout the state; then to assess each ratably, according to the amount of the debt, instead selling each and all as they could be discovered; at the same time, allowing a discretion in the commissioners, to compromise with persons claiming an interest in the lands, and to assign over an interest in the lien proportionate to the sum received upon such compromise; of course, obviating, so far, the necessity of a resort to a sale or to litigation.\n Here there was a general offer to all persons claiming an interest in these lands, of a release from the lien, upon paying the sum thus assessed ratably and according to value; and it was only when the offer was not accepted, or where no one claimed an interest, that the general power to sell came into exercise. Nor was it then to be exercised, until after a report made to the governor, and under process issuing from him; ample notice was required to be given of the sale, and a credit not exceeding four years allowed. It is true, that by the terms of these acts, the power of selling is extended to 'any body of lands, late the property of the said John Nicholson, deceased, which are subject to the lien of the commonwealth, under and by virtue of process to be issued by the governor, either in gross, or by separate tracts, as to them, or a majority of them, may appear most advisable;' but there is nothing which authorizes or requires the commissioners to sell all the lands of J. Nicholson, or an acre more than what is necessary to satisfy the liens; and so the words just recited import; since, after raising by sale enough to satisfy the liens, it could no longer be predicated of any of those lands that 'they are subject to the liens of the commonwealth,' in the language of the section which gives the power to sell. And it is true also, that the money is required to be paid by the purchasers into the treasury; but this is obviously a measure solely intended to secure the proceeds from again falling into dangerous hands; and if the power to sell be limited, by its very nature and terms, to the raising of enough to satisfy these liens, on what ground, can exception be taken to this precaution? How can it work an injury to heirs or creditors? to say nothing of a reasonable dependence upon the justice and good faith of the country to refund any surplus, supposing the commissioners were at liberty to raise a surplus by sale.\n Nor can any reasonable exception be taken to the \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 546]\n\u00a0\n discretionary power given to sell 'in gross, or by separate tracts;' when it is considered, how very possible it was, that sales might be effected in gross, when they could not be made in detail. Speculators might not be induced to adventure otherwise, and the separation of contiguous tracts might often destroy or diminish the value of each.\n After presenting this expose of the design and operation of these laws, we shall search in vain, in the constitution of the state or the United States, or even in the principles of common right, for any provision or principles to impugn them; and on this point, I am instructed to report it as the decision of this court, that the words used in the constitution of Pennsylvania, in declaring the extent of the powers of its legislature, are sufficiently comprehensive to embrace the powers exercised over the estate of Nicholson in the two acts under consideration, and that there are no restrictions, either express or implied, in that constitution, sufficient to control and limit the general terms of the grant of the legislative power, to the bounds which the plaintiffs would describe to it.\n For myself, individually, I must use the privilege of assigning the reasons which claim my concurrence in that opinion. The objection made to the exercise of this power is, that it is one of a judicial character, and could not exist in the legislature of a country having a constitution which distributes the powers of government into legislative, executive and judicial. I will not pause to examine the question, whether the subjection of property to the payment of judgments, be in fact a matter appertaining essentially to judicial power; or whether, after deciding that the debt is due, the judgment action does not cease, and all that follows is the exercise of legislative or executive power; another view of the subject will, in my opinion, dispose of this question.\n The power existing in every body politic, is an absolute despotism; in constituting a government, the body politic distributes that power as it pleases, and in the quantity it pleases, and imposes what checks it pleases upon its public functionaries. The natural distribution and the necessary distribution to individual security, is into legislative, executive and judicial; but it is obvious, that every community may make a perfect or imperfect separation and distribution of these powers, at its will. It has pleased Pennsylvania, in her constitution, \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 547]\n\u00a0\n to make what most jurists would pronounce an imperfect separation of those powers; she has not thought it necessary to make any imperative provision for incorporating the equity jurisdiction, in its full latitude, into her jurisprudence; and the consequence is, as it ever will be, that so far as her common-law courts are incapable of assuming and exercising that branch of jurisdiction, her legislature must often be called upon to pass laws which bear a close affinity to decrees in equity. Of that character are the acts of 1806 and 1807 under consideration. The relations in which the state and John Nicholson's estate stood to each other, presented a clear case for equitable relief; a lien on the one hand, and property to satisfy it on the other, but no common-law means of obtaining a sale. Thus circumstanced, is there anything in the constitution of Pennsylvania to prevent the passing of these laws?\n When it is intimated, that the separation of the primary powers of government is incomplete, under the constitution of Pennsylvania, it may be necessary to submit a few observations explanatory of the idea. It is true, that the separation of common law from equity jurisdiction is peculiar to Great Britain; no other of the states of the old world having adopted it. But it is equally true, that in no other of the states of the old world did the trial by jury constitute a part of their jurisprudence, and every practical lawyer knows, that to give jurisdiction to a court of equity, or to distinguish a case of equity jurisdiction from one of common law, under the British practice, the averment is indispensable that the complainant is remediless at law. When it is said, that the separation of common law from equity jurisdiction is peculiar to Great Britain, it must only be understood, that it is there exercised by distinct courts and under distinct forms. For, as an essential branch or exercise of judicial power, it is acknowledged to exist everywhere; nor is it possible for any one acquainted with its nature and character, and the remedies it affords for the assertion of rights or the punishment of wrongs, to doubt that the power to exercise it, and the means of exercising it, must exist somewhere; or the administration of justice will be embarrassed, if not incomplete. To administer it through the ordinary powers of a common-law court is impracticable; and hence, wherever there exists no provision \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 548]\n\u00a0\n in the jurisprudence of a country for its full exercise, the consequence must ever be, that after the common-law courts have ingrafted into their practice as much as can be there assumed, the legislature is compelled to exercise the rest; or else leave a large space for the appropriate field of judicial action unoccupied.\n A specimen of this will be found in the early legislation of the state of South Carolina, in which, before the establishment of a court of equity, laws are frequently found authorizing administrators or others to sell lands for the payment of debts, and for similar purposes. And it has been admitted in argument, that similar laws are of frequent occurrence in Pennsylvania. The provisions of the constitution of that state, on the subject of legislative and judicial power, are as follows. Art. 1,  1. 'The legislative power of this commonwealth shall be vested in a general assembly, which shall consist of a senate and house of representatives. Art. 4,  5. 'The judicial power of the commonwealth shall be vested in a supreme court, in courts of oyer and terminer and general jail delivery, in a court of common pleas, orphans' court, register's court, and a court of quarter sessions of the peace of each county, in justices of the peace, and in such other courts as the legislature may from time to time establish.' Art. 4,  1. 'The supreme court and the several courts of common pleas, shall, besides the powers heretofore usually exercised by them, have the powers of a court of chancery, so far as relates to the perpetuating of testimony, the obtaining of evidence from places not within the state, and the care of the persons and estates of those who are non compos mentis; and the legislature shall vest in the said courts such other powers to grant relief in equity as shall be necessary, and may, from time to time, enlarge or diminish those powers, or vest them in such other courts as they may judge proper for the due administration of justice.'\n It is clear, from these quotations, that the legislature possess all the legislative power that the body politic could confer, except so far as they are restricted by the instrument itself. It is really clear, that the constitution recognises the distinction between common-law and equity powers, and the existence of equity powers beyond what it has vested in the supreme court. \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 549]\n\u00a0\n But what provision has it made for the exercise of those powers? No other than this, that the legislature shall vest in the said courts such other powers to grant relief in equity as shall be found necessary. But where is the limitation prescribed to the legislature, in judging of the necessity of vesting such powers? They have not thought it necessary to invest their courts with such powers; and if the reason which influenced them in judging it unnecessary was, that they held themselves competent to afford the necessary relief, by the exercise of legislative power, where is the restriction in the constitution that controls them in thus extending or applying the powers with which they hold themselves to be constitutionally vested? They are sought in vain.\n Again, 'they may from time to time enlarge or diminish those powers, or vest them in such other courts as they shall judge proper, for the due administration of justice.' Now, they have, by the first section of the same article, the power to establish what courts they please; and suppose, they thought proper to have vested the whole equity jurisdiction, not specifically disposed of, in a board of commissioners, instead of vesting specific powers in such a board, where is the constitutional provision that inhibits such an act of legislation? The plaintiffs contend, that it is to be found in the bill of rights of that state, or in the constitution of the United States.\n Both those constitutions contain the provision against the violation of contracts; and the plaintiffs' counsel insists, that there were three contracts in existence between the state of Pennsylvania and John Nicholson, two of them express, and one implied. The first express contract he finds in the acts of 1782 and 1785; which, in giving the lien upon public accounts, declare, that they shall be liens 'in the same manner as if judgment had been given in the supreme court.' This he construes into a contract that they shall be enforced in the same manner as such a judgment, to wit, by judicial process; and then finds the violation of the contract, in the acts which provide for the raising of the money to satisfy those liens by the sale of the land, through this board of commissioners. But a single observation, we think, disposes of this exception; which is, that the lien of a judgment, of a mortgage, or any other lien, is a \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 550]\n\u00a0\n very different idea from that of the means by which the lien is to be enforced; the one is the right, the other is the remedy; the one constitutes the contract, and the other the remedy afforded by the policy of the country, where it is not provided by the terms of the contract, for enforcing or effecting the execution of it. The first is unchangeable, without a violation of right; the other may be subject to change, at the will of the government. And it may be further observed, in the present instance, that the reference to a judgment in the supreme court, is clearly descriptive or illustrative of the meaning of the legislature, with reference only to the binding efficacy of the lien given on these public accounts.\n The second express contract is found by the plaintiffs in the confession of judgment on the 21st March 1797; and the violation of this, also, is not enforcing it by judicial process. This is obviously an attempt to give the character of a contract to that which is nothing more than an obligation, or duty, or necessity imposed by the laws of society. The confession of a judgment does indeed create a contract; but it is only on the side of the defendant, who thus acknowledges or assumes upon himself a debt, which may be made the ground of an action. But on the side of the plaintiff, the necessity of resorting to certain means of enforcing that judgment, is not an obligation arising out of contract, but one imposed upon him by the laws of the country. Again, it may by answered, if there was in fact such a contract imputable to the state, the performance had become impossible by the act of God, and of the party himself, by his death; and by that confusion of his affairs, which prevented every one from assuming the character of his personal representative.\n We proceed to the third, or the implied contract; that which is deduced from the original grant of the land to John Nicholson. This sale, it is insisted, is inconsistent with that contract of grant; that it amounts in fact to a resumption of the land; and in connection with this, the point of inconsistency with the reason and nature of things, was argued and commended upon. The answer which the case there furnishes, we think is this: that subjecting the lands of a grantee to the payment of his debts, can never impair or contravene the rights derived to \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 551]\n\u00a0\n him under his grant, for in the very act, the full effect of the transfer of interest to him is recognised and asserted; because it is his, is the direct and only reason for subjecting it to his debts.\n But it is asserted, that in this case, the community sits in judgment in its own cause, when it affirms the debt to be due for which the land is subjected to sale, and then subjects the land to sale to satisfy its own decision thus rendered. This view of the acts of the state is clearly not to be substained by a reference to the facts of the case. As to the judgment of 1797, that is unquestionably a judicial act; and as to the settled accounts, the lien is there created by the act of men who, quoad hoc, were acting in a judicial character; and their decision being subjected to an appeal to the ordinary, or rather the highest of the tribunals of the country, gives to those settlements a decided judicial character; and were it otherwise, how else are the interests of the state to be protected? The body politic has its claims upon the constituted authorities, as well as individuals; and if the plaintiffs' course of reasoning could be permitted to prevail, it would then follow, that provision might be made for collecting the debts of every one else, but those of the state must go unpaid, whenever legislative aid became necessary to both. This would be pushing the reason and nature of things beyond the limits of natural justice.\n It is next contended, that the acts of 1806 and 1807 are unconstitutional and void, because contrary to the ninth section of the Pennsylvania bill of rights, which provides, in the words of magna charta, that no one shall be deprived of his property but by the laws of the land. This exception has already been disposed of, by the view that has been taken of the nature and character of those laws. It has been shown, that there is nothing in this provision, either inconsistent with natural justice or the constitution of the state; there is nothing of an arbitrary character in them.\n They are also charged with being contrary to the ninth article of the amendments of the constitution of the United States, and the sixth section of the Pennsylvania bill of rights, securing the trial by jury. As to the amendments of the constitution of the United States, they must be put out of the case; since it is now settled, \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 552]\n\u00a0\n that those amendments do not extend to the states; and this observation disposes of the next exception, which relies on the seventh article of those amendments. As to the sixth section of the Pennsylvania bill of rights, we can see nothing in these laws on which to fasten the imputation of a violation of the right of trial by jury; since, in creating the lien attached to the settled accounts, the right of an appeal to a jury is secured to the debtor: and as to the inquest given under the execution law, with a view to ascertaining if the rents and profits can discharge the debt in a limited time, as a prelude to the right of selling, we are well satisfied, that there is no more reason for extending the provision of the amendment to that inquest, than there would be to the inquest of a coroner, or any other mere inquest of office. The word trial, used in the sixth section, clearly points to a different object; and the distinction between trial by jury and inquest of office, is so familiar to every mind, as to leave no sufficient ground for extending to the latter that inviolability which could have been intended only for the former. The one appertains to a mere remedy for the recovery of money, which may be altered at any time, without any danger to private security; the other is justly regarded in every state in the Union, as among the most inestimable privileges of a freeman.\n The two remaining grounds urged for impugning the constitutionality of these laws, have been disposed of by observations already made.\n It only remains to consider the point made upon the rejection of certain evidence proposed to be introduced; the object of which was to invalidate the settled accounts, by showing that, in fact, the accounts between the state and Nicholson never were settled, that is, finally and conclusively settled. Here again, as was remarked of the evidence already considered, admitting the fact proposed to be proved, what could it avail the party in this suit? So far as the accounts were settled and certified, the law gave the lien for the amount certified; and why should that benefit be deferred, until the last possible shilling in dispute should be finally passed upon; delayed perhaps until lost, or until the debtor could no longer parry the decision; and thus give a preference to others at his will? If, then, the fact intended to be established by the evidence \n\n[32 U.S. 469, 553]\n\u00a0\n could not have availed the plaintiffs, the court could have committed no error in rejecting it, whatever may have been the reasons given for the rejection.\n We are of opinion, that there is no error in the judgment below, and it will accordingly be affirmed, with costs.\n THIS cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the district of Pennsylvania, and was argued by counsel: On consideration whereof, it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be and the same is hereby affirmed, with costs. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The charge of Judge HOPKINSON will be found in Bald. 424. \n\n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMAGNIAC v. THOMSON(1833)\nNo. 18\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1833\n\n\n\n\n[32 U.S. 348, 349]\n\u00a0\n ERROR to the Circuit Court of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. In the circuit court, at October sessions 1826, a feigned issue was made up between the plaintiffs and the defendant, to try the question of the ability of the defendant to pay a debt acknowledged to be due to the plaintiffs, and for which judgments had been obtained in their favor. The competency of the defendant to satisfy the debt, depended on the validity of a certain marriage-settlement, made in contemplation of marriage between the defendant and Miss Annis Stockton, daughter of Richard Stockton, Esq., late of New Jersey, to which instrument Mr. Stockton was a party, he being, by its provisions, the trustee of his daughter. The marriage-settlement was as follows:\n'Articles of agreement and covenant made and executed this 19th day of December, in the year of our Lord 1825, by and between John R. Thomson, Esq., late of the city of Philadelphia, of the first part, Annis Stockton, daughter of Richard Stockton, Esq., of the second part, and Richard Stockton, of the county of Somerset and state of New Jersey, father and trustee of the said Annis Stockton, of the third part.\n\n'Whereas, a marriage is intended to be shortly had and solemnized between the said John R. Thomson and the said Annis Stockton; and whereas, the said Richard Stockton has promised to give unto his said daughter a certain lot or tract of land, belonging to him, situate in the county of Middlesex and state of New Jersey; directly opposite the mansion-house of the said Richard Stockton, between the old road to Trenton and the turnpike road, which consists of between four and five acres of land, be the same more or less, and is bounded on the north and south by the said roads, on the west by lands of Dr. John Vanclave, and the east by a line to be run from the north-east corner of the garden, now in the possession of Mrs. Abigail Field, to the said turnpike road, upon which said lot the said John R. Thomson has begun to build a house. Now, it is hereby agreed between the parties aforesaid, and the said Richard Stockton, for himself and his heirs, doth hereby covenant and agree to and with the parties of the first and second \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 350]\n\u00a0\n parts, their heirs, executors and administrators, in consideration of the said marriage, and of the love and natural affection he hath for his said daughter, that from the time of, and immediately after, the said marriage shall be solemnized, he, the said Richard Stockton, shall and will stand seised of the said lot and premises, and of all and singular the buildings and improvements which shall be erected and made thereon by the said party of the first part, to the uses, trusts and purposes hereinafter mentioned, and to none other, that is to say: in trust to permit the said John R. Thomson, and Annis his wife, during the time of their joint lives, to possess, live in, and occupy the said lot, house and premises, with the appurtenances, free and clear of all demands; and in case the said parties of the first and second parts do not think proper to inhabit and reside in the said premises, that he, the said Richard Stockton, will let out, upon lease, the said premises, and receive the rents, issues and profits thereof, and pay over the same to the said Annis, party of the second part, during the joint lives of the parties of the first and second parts. And if the said John R. Thomson should survive the said Annis Stockton, and have issue by her, then in trust to permit the said John R. Thomson, during his life, to inhabit and occupy the said premises, if he elect so to do, free and clear as aforesaid, and pay over the said rents and profits, as he shall receive the same, to the said John R. Thomson, for the maintenance and support of him and his family, without he, the said John R. Thomson, being at any time thereafter accountable to any person or persons for the said rents and profits. And after the death of the said John R. Thomson, in trust for the child or children of the said marriage, in equal shares, as tenants in common, in fee-simple; and if there shall be no child or children of the said marriage, then, upon the death of either of the said parties of the first and second parts, in trust to convey the said premises to the survivor in fee-simple.\n\n'And the said John R. Thomson, for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, doth covenant and agree to and with the parties of the second and third parts, that if the said marriage shall take effect, and in consideration thereof, he will, with all convenient speed, build and furnish the said house, in a suitable manner, as he shall judge fit and \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 351]\n\u00a0\n proper; and that the said erections, improvements and furniture, together with the changes and additions which shall be, from time to time, made, shall be subject to and included in the said trusts, as far as the same are applicable to each species of property. And further, that he will, in the space of one year from the time the said marriage shall take effect, place out on good security, in stock or otherwise, the sum of $40,000, and hand over and assign the evidences thereof to the said party of the third part, who shall hold the same, in trust to receive the interest, profits or dividends thereon, as they shall, from time to time, arise, to the said party of the second part, during the joint lives of the parties of the first and second parts, and that her receipts for the same, and also for what may be produced under the before-mentioned trusts, shall be good and valid, notwithstanding her coverture. If the said party of the second part should die before the said party of the first part, and there should be issue of the said marriage, then in trust to receive the said interest, profits and dividends, and pay the same over, from time to time, to the said party of the first part, during his life, for the support of himself, and the maintenance and education of his children, without his being subject to any account as aforesaid; and after his death, in trust for any child or children of the said marriage, in equal shares; and if the said Annis should survive the said John, and there be issue of the said marriage, then to pay over the same to the said Annis, during her life, for her maintenance, and the support and education of the said children, and without her being liable to any account for the same; and after her death, in trust for the child or children of the said marriage, in equal shares; and if there shall be no child or children of the said marriage, then, upon the death of the said John R. Thomson, or Annis his wife, in trust, to assign and deliver the said securities, and all moneys remaining due to the one who shall survive, to his or her own uses.\n\n'And it is further agreed and covenanted by and between the parties aforesaid, that it may be lawful for the said John R. Thomson to act as the agent of the parties aforesaid, in all the matters aforesaid, by the permission and under the control, if need be, of the said trustee, and to change, and, from time to time, alter the said \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 352]\n\u00a0\n securities, as occasion may require, and take new securities in their stead, so as that the fund, as aforesaid settled, shall always be kept good. And it is also hereby further agreed and covenanted by and between all the said parties, that the said trustee shall not be held guilty of breach of trust, although he does not act personally in the permises, unless he be expressly desired and requested so to do by one of the other parties hereto, or those claiming under them; and that he shall not in any manner be held liable as trustee, unless for acts of wilful neglect or misconduct.'\n\n The plaintiffs and the defendant were merchants residing in Canton, in China, previous to the 25th of March 1825, when the defendant returned to the United States, leaving an agent, Rodney Fisher, in Canton, with full powers to transact his business, and to bind him by commercial contracts, and who was introduced to the plaintiffs as his agent, by the defendant. Very large loans were made to the agent of the defendant, by the plaintiffs, which were employed in loading the vessels of Edward Thomson; the goods being pledged to pay the loans at Philadelphia, and the shipments so made being for the use of Edward Thomson. Edward Thomson was without credit or friends in Canton, and the credit of his son, John R. Thomson, was thus employed by his agent to load the ships; the defendant's compensation consisting of the commissions on the transactions.\n On the 22d of November 1825, Mr. Fisher, as the agent of the defendant, borrowed of the plaintiffs $30,000, on the pledge of an invoice of goods valued at about $42,000; and on the second of December 1825, $33, 000 more were borrowed on the pledge of another invoice valued at upwards of $44,000, together exceeding more than $63,000 on pledges of goods exceeding, in invoice amount, $86,000. Besides these loans, the defendant obtained others in China, where he also owed some other debts, inconsiderable in amount, and after his return home, he signed his father's respondentia bonds for $200,000. On all these loans and respondentia, there were large sums lost; the goods pledged \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 353]\n\u00a0\n to the plaintiffs did not sell for half the invoice prices; and the defendant lost moreover upwards of $20,000 by his father's failure. He was not possessed of any real estate, mortgages, public stock or other productive property; and whatever he was worth, if anything, was involved in his father's affairs.\n On the 19th of November 1825, Edward Thomson's insolvency was made public. On the 19th of December 1825, the defendant, having arrived from Canton, in this country, on the 1st of June of that year, and soon after made an engagement to be married with Annis, the daughter of Richard Stockton, Esq., submitted a statement of his affairs to Mr. Stockton, with a view to the marriage-settlement before stated, which was executed the same day.\n Statement by John R. Thomson, made previous to settlement:\n'I have no personal debts, except to a small amount, in common course of business and living. I am surety for my father in a respondentia bond to Messrs. Schott & Lippincott, in a penal sum of $200,000. If the goods which are pledged sell reasonably well, there can be no loss; for the freight on these goods, the commissions in China, and the premium on dollars on the outward investment, all tend to enhance the security; and such is the opinion of Mr. Schott, expressed to me in a conversation on this subject; there can, therefore, be no demand on me. Upon no fair principle of calculation, could the loss, if it should happen, be more than $20,000, and I consider myself worth that amount, if not more, in addition to the sum proposed to be settled.\n\n JOHN R. THOMSON.'\n'December 19, 1825.'\n\n Indorsed by Richard Stockton-'Statement made to the trustee by J. R. Thomson, as the basis of the settlement, and upon which it was made. R. S.'\n The marriage took place the 28th December 1825. But during the life of Richard Stockton, the settlement was never acknowledged or registered, nor was the $40,000 \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 354]\n\u00a0\n in productive stock ever provided, as the settlement stipulated, by the defendant, who pleaded inability to do so, from insolvency. After Mr. Stockton's death, and shortly before judgment confessed by defendant, for the balance remaining due to the plaintiffs, the defendant delivered to Robert Stockton, the eldest son of Richard Stockton, deceased, two promissory notes, together for $9500, one of which, for $4500, was of doubtful worth.\n Of the $60,000 and upwards, due by the defendant to the plaintiffs, a principal sum of about $12,000 remaining due, suits were brought for the same against him, in Pennsylvania, where he resided, and in New Jersey, where he settled at the time of his marriage, in both of which suits judgments were confessed for the sum claimed.\n On the 3d of June 1830, the following agreements relative to the case were entered into by the counsel for the plaintiffs and for the defendant.\n'Whereas, the above-named plaintiffs did recover, on the 26th day of November 1827, against the said John R. Thomson, the sum of $20,929.07, damages, besides costs of suit; and whereas, the said plaintiffs allege that the said John R. Thomson has the means of satisfying said judgment and costs, and the said John R. Thomson denies his ability to pay the same, and requires that the proof thereof may be tried by a jury, and an issue for the trial thereof has been agreed upon between the parties, in the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, to April sessions 1830; it is hereby ordered and agreed, that the action as above stated be entered, and that the said John R. Thomson cause an appearance to be entered for him to the same, and that said plaintiffs declare, of the said term, of a discourse had and moved between the said plaintiffs and the said defendant, of and concerning whether the said defendant has the means, by the property in his marriage- settlement or otherwise, of satisfying the judgment aforesaid; and that the said defendant, in consideration of a mutual promise on the part of the said plaintiffs to him made, did promise to pay to the said plaintiffs the sum of $25,000, \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 355]\n\u00a0\n in case he, the said defendant, has the means or ability of satisfying the judgment aforesaid, so that this said issue may be tried by the country. And it is further ordered and agreed, that the circumstances of the said mutual promises, and of the affirmations and assertions laid in the declaration, shall be confessed, so that the said issue shall be tried on the merits, and that the costs of the suit shall follow the verdict; but that the said verdict shall give no title to either party to recover from the other the sum laid in the declaration. The merits to be tried without regard to form, and either party to be at liberty, under he direction of the court, to modify or change the pleadings, so as to facilitate such trial on the merits.'\n\n'Whereas, a feigned issue has been agreed upon between the parties in this case, for the purpose of ascertaining by law, whether the defendant, John R. Thomson, has the means, by the property in his marriage-settlement, or otherwise, of satisfying the judgment recovered against him in this court, to October sessions 1826, No. 18: Now, it is hereby agreed to be the understanding of the parties to this suit, that if the plaintiffs recover, that the liability of the security from said defendant shall be to the extent of the property actually settled by said defendant on his then intended wife, by virtue of a marriage-settlement, dated the ___ day of December 1825. And if judgment shall be for the defendant, that the said property contained in said settlement shall be entirely discharged, and the security entered as above stated entirely at an end; either party to be at liberty to carry the case, according to established regulations, to the supreme court of the United States for determination.'\n\n The case was tried at the April term of the circuit court in 1831, under these agreements, and a verdict, under the charge of the court, was rendered for the defendant. The plaintiffs excepted to this charge and prosecuted this writ of error. The whole of the charge of the court was inserted in the bill of exceptions, and brought up with the record. The facts of the case as made out in evidence, according to the views of the court, are stated particularly in the charge to the jury. \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 356]\n\u00a0\n The charge was as follows:\n'The nominal parties are the plaintiffs and the defendant. The real parties are the plaintiffs and the defendant's wife. The nominal question is whether the defendant has any property? The real question is, whether the property he owned in December 1825, passed to Richard Stockton, father and trustee of Mrs. Thomson, for her use, or whether it remained in the defendant, on account of the legal inefficacy of the marriage-agreement to divest him of it, and vest it according to that agreement? If it was operative in law, the house furniture and fund in hands of Robert Stockton belong to him, in trust for the uses of the agreement. If not, then the law deems J. R. Thomson to be the legal owner, in trust for his creditors, of whom the plaintiffs seem to be the only ones. He remains the owner, not because the agreement is not binding on him, but because, under the circumstances of the case, his indebtedness to the plaintiffs put it out of his power to so divest himself of it, as to prevent his creditors from considering it his, so far as to be a fund for the payment of their debt; and this is the only question we have to settle.\n\n'From the evidence, the plaintiffs' debt is a fair and valid one, as between them and defendant; between him and Mr. Fisher, it is not our province to inquire; that depends, perhaps, on the evidence of authority which the latter can produce; but his evidence is sufficient for the plaintiffs to show a debt existing at the time of the marriage-agreement. The judgments confessed by Thomson are evidence not only against him, but as they may affect the interest of his wife in the property in question, to show the indebtedness of Thomson at the time of the agreement. (Hinde v. Longworth, 11 Wheat. 210.) Taking the judgment, in connection with the testimony of Mr. Fisher, you will probably think the plaintiffs' case so far made out as to establish the existence of a valid legal debt due plaintiffs by defendant, at the time of the marriage-settlement, and no evidence being given to impeach the claim, we think, in point of law, it is so, unless you feel at liberty to discredit Mr. Fisher; though Mrs. Thomson is no party to the judgment, it is evidence to affect her claim.\n\n'- \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 357]\n\u00a0\n This brings us to the main question of the validity of the marriage- settlement, on which the cause must turn. It is good between the parties, and good as to all the world, unless it is liable to impeachment for fraud; which is of two kinds, fraud in fact, and fraud in law. The first is an intention or design to defraud, delay, injure or prevent creditors from receiving their just debts, by a sale, deed, settlement or agreement, by which the property of a debtor is withdrawn, or attempted to be withdrawn, from their reach. The English statute of 13 Eliz. declares all such acts null and void as to creditors; this statute is in force here, and you will consider it as having the same effect in this cause as a law of New Jersey; the common law makes the same declaration; and if the evidence brings this case within it, your verdict must be for the plaintiff. Proof of fraud may be made out by direct evidence, or may be inferred from such circumstances as will justify that inference; but a jury ought never to presume it, without either; you ought to be satisfied, that the facts before you indicate and reasonably prove the existence of that dishonest fraudulent intention, which brings the case within the true spirit and meaning of the law. A mere doubt or suspicion of the fairness of the transaction, ought not to be sufficient to lead to the finding of any act to be fraudulent, unless the conduct and situation of the parties, and the effects intended to be produced by the act, appear inconsistent with their integrity, and admit of no reasonable interpretation but meditated fraud, to be effected by the agreement, sale or deed; on this subject, the law does not remain to be settled by this court; it is laid down by Judge WASHINGTON, and adopted by the supreme court in the case of Conrad v. Nicoll, 4 Pet. 295, and must be considered as binding on court and jury, in deciding on this part of the case.\n\n'To taint a transaction with fraud, both parties must concur in the illegal design; it is not enough, to prove fraud in the debtor; he may lawfully sell his property, with the direct intention of defrauding his creditors, or prefer one creditor to another; but unless the purchaser or preferred creditor receives the property with the same fraudulent design, the contract is \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 358]\n\u00a0\n valid against other creditors or purchasers who may be injured by the transaction. The declarations or admissions of the debtor, as to the object intended to be affected, are evidence to contradict his answer to a bill in chancery, brought to annul the act alleged to be fraudulent, but not to defeat the title of the grantee or person claiming under it, or to have a bearing on the whole case. Venable v. Bank of the United States, 2 Pet. 119-20; S. P. 2 Halst. 173-4. Before you can pronounce this marriage- agreement void and inoperative, on the ground of actual fraud, you must be satisfied, not only that the defendant made it, with design to defraud his creditors, but also that Mrs. Thomson, and her father and trustee, Mr. Richard Stockton, participated and concurred in the fraud intended; if they were innocent of the combination, it would be harsh and cruel in the extreme, to visit on her the serious consequence of her intended husband's acts, and as inconsistent with law as justice.\n\n'The facts of the case are neither complicated or contradictory; affording evidence much more clear and satisfactory than usually appears in such cases; it appears, that John R. Thomson, after residing some time in Canton, left it in March 1825, and returned to this place, in June following; that he paid his addresses to Miss Stockton, during the summer, contracted an engagement of marriage with her, and contemplated making a settlement upon her as early as September. That the marriage articles were executed on the 19th December, and the marriage solemnized a few days afterwards, or perhaps sooner; he built a house on the lot mentioned in the agreement, at an expense of $13,000, furnished it at the expense of $ 5000, but invested no part of the $40,000, during the lifetime of Mr. Stockton. In September 1829, he put into the hands of Captain Robert Stockton, who succeeded his father in the trust, securities to the amount of $9500, on account of the sum to be invested pursuant to the settlement. From the evidence of Mr. Fisher and Mr. Mackie, it appears, that Mr. Thomson was worth, say in December 1825, about $80,000 or $90,000 in money and personal property, and \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 359]\n\u00a0\n owed $70,500 of which $7500 were, on his own account, due in Canton, and paid by Mr. Fisher. The residue was the $63,000 borrowed by Mr. Fisher, on the 22d November and the 2d December 1825, from the plaintiffs, on the credit and on the alleged authority of Mr. Thomson, but entirely for the use of his father, Edward Thomson, in order to complete the cargoes of his ships, then at Canton, short of funds. We have no evidence of any other debts which would materially diminish the sum which he was estimated to be worth. This large debt was contracted, not by any specific, but general directions or orders; it was unknown to him, till the spring of 1826 that such a debt existed, and therefore, could have been in his contemplation, when the marriage-articles were executed; they could not have been entered into for the purpose of defrauding the plaintiffs, and he appears to have had no other creditors, unless those who were paid by Mr. Fisher, in Canton, out of Thomson's funds in his hands. The security given to the plaintiffs exceeded the amount of the respondentia bond $23,300, which may fairly be presumed to have been invested in the invoices pledged to the plaintiffs, out of his own funds, as there is no evidence that this sum was raised by loan, on the goods purchased on credit. This, added to the other debts, amounting to $7548, makes $30,748, which would seem to have been raised, without contracting a debt. Defendant pledged $23,300 of this to secure the plaintiffs for a loan made for the use of Edward Thomson, and made Thomson personally liable in the bond. If the contracting a debt in this manner, by which there could be no profit but commission, and might be attended with heavy loss, was intentional fraud, then you will judge whom it could have been intended to defraud, Magniac or Thomson; if there were any part of the debt lost, it must fall on the latter; the former could not suffer, unless the proceeds of the two invoices produced less than $63,000, and Thomson became insolvent; if, under such circumstances, you find that there was meditated fraud, it will \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 360]\n\u00a0\n be hard to discover a motive which could operate on the mind of the defendant, to his own benefit, or injury of the plaintiffs.\n\n'This debt not being contracted personally by Mr. Thomson, or his special directions, it would be difficult to infer any fraud in him in borrowing the money, and still more so in his agent, Mr. Fisher; it cannot well be doubted, that it was the intention of the one, in conferring the authority, and of the other, in executing it, to comply with every stipulation for repayment, or that, in entering into this agreement of marriage, all parties were ignorant of the existence of the debt. The mortgages of the invoices of $86,000 for security, is most powerful evidence to negative fraud of any kind; these are the most material, and probably, all the facts of the case, necessary for your consideration of the question of fraud in fact; you will apply the law, as read and stated to you, to the evidence, and decide according to your convictions of the justice of the case. As a question of fact, it is for your exclusive decision; the court, however, think proper to say, that in their opinion, an inference or intentional fraud would be a very severe comment on the conduct of the parties. If however, you should be of opinion, that there was such fraud attending this transaction, as brings it within the legal principles laid down for your guide, you will find, accordingly, a verdict for the plaintiffs.\n\n'Another part of the issue which you are to decide is, whether the defendant has concealed, and has in his possession, disposal or command, any part of the property he owned in 1825, amounting to $80,000 or $90,000, which has been accounted for as by statement of Mr. Fisher and Mackie, leaving the sum of $25,000 or $26,000, which has been shown to be invested in the house, furniture and securities in the hands of Captain Stockton; connecting this with the evidence of Mr. Norris, you will be able to decide whether defendant has any means of paying the plaintiffs' debt, of which he has not given an account, or which remain in his hands. In tracing through the evidence, the conduct of the defendant towards the plaintiff, in relation to this debt, you will discriminate between the deliberate design to defraud, by secreting \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 361]\n\u00a0\n property for his own use, and losses incurred by casualties and want of prudence or discretion; on this part of the issue, you are to inquire only as to the property which he actually has in his possession or control, not into what he ought to have had, or what he has disposed of for any other use than his own; and will not take into consideration what has been expended or applied towards the marriage-contract, that being the subject of the first inquiry, which is altogether distinct from this.\n\n'The next and most important question is, whether the marriage- contract is fraudulent in law, and for that reason, void as against the plaintiffs; that is, although the intention of the parties was fair and honest, and the act done without any design to defraud, the policy of the law forbids its execution, and takes from it all legal efficacy as to the creditors of John R. Thomson. The deeds, gifts, grants or other contracts, which the law avoids are those made with intent to defraud, hinder, delay or injure creditors; and in other to avoid them, both the party giving, and the party receiving, must be participating in the fraud. On this subject, the law is written and cannot be misunderstood. The 6th section of the statute, 13 Eliz., provides, that the act shall not extend to any interest in lands, or goods and chattels, made on good consideration, bon a fide lawfully conveyed or assured to any person not having, at the time of such conveyance or assurance to them made, any manner of notice or knowledge of such fraud, covin or collusion. The words of the law require that both parties must concur in the fraud, in order to bring the case within its provisions, and such has been it settled judicial exposition for 260 years.\n\n'There are in law two kinds of considerations; good, which is natural love and affection; and valuable, which is money or marriage. The word good is used in this law, as applied to cases which it does not mean to embrace; but from the evident meaning and object of the law to protect creditors from the disposition by debtors of their property, with intent to defraud them, and from dispositions which might produce that effect, by conveying it to their wives, children, relations or friends; all courts, both of law and equity, have considered the word good as meaning valuable consideration. \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 362]\n\u00a0\n 'You will perceive, that the law, as thus expounded, embraces three kinds of conveyances: 1. Those made with the intention in both parties to defraud creditors; these are void, whether made with or without consideration, good or valuable, not only on account of the covin or collusion, but as exempted from the saving of the sixth section, not being bon a fide. 2. Voluntary, made for good consideration, but tending to defraud creditors; if they are permitted to have a legal operation to vest the property conveyed, the policy of the law makes them void for legal fraud-though there is no fraud in fact, the fraud in law being deemed equivalent to it. 3. For valuable consideration, in good faith, without notice by the person receiving the conveyance, of any fraud, covin or collusion by the grantor, to defraud his creditors; these are excepted from the operation of the law before referred to; they are good and valid at common law, to pass the property conveyed, and purchasers under such conveyances are entitled to, and receive the protection of, all courts of justice.\n\n'From what has already been given you in charge on the subject of actual fraud, you will be enabled to decide, whether this case comes within the first class of cases of intentional fraud in both parties to the marriage-contract; if you are not satisfied that this contract is of this character, then it cannot fall within the second class of voluntary conveyances. If it was made in contemplation of marriage, it was made on a valuable consideration, and puts the intended wife on the footing of a purchaser for money, and not of a voluntary grantee or donee for the mere consideration of love and affection. She is not to be considered in any court as a volunteer, but comes into court, at least, on an equality, both in law and equity, with any other parties whose claims are founded in money. You will not forget the difference between a provision for a wife and children, before and after marriage; when there is no portion or money paid, it is the difference between a purchaser and a volunteer; for the former, the consideration is as valuable as the debt due a creditor, or the money received from a purchaser in the latter; it is, from its nature, merely voluntary; there can be no other than a good consideration for making it; there \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 363]\n\u00a0\n exists, it is true, a moral obligation to provide for their support and comfort, but that moral obligation must yield to the legal one, which every man must observe towards those who have just claims on his property. In dispositions of property which take effect in the disposer's lifetime, as well as after his death, there is a golden rule which applies to all-a man must be just before he is generous; this applies to all cases between volunteers, or those claiming merely by a voluntary disposition, made by deed or will, to whose who have no legal claims on the person who makes it, on the one hand, and creditors and purchasers, on the other.\n\n'But where conflicting claims between creditor and creditor, purchaser and purchaser, or purchaser and creditor, arise in court, they are settled by other rules. The first inquiry as to them, is, whether one class has a legal right to the debt claimed, or the other to the thing claimed to be purchased, such as is recognised in a court of law; the second is, whether that right has been so acquired as to be attended with such circumstances of fraud, accident, mistake, trust, inadequacy of price, or unfairness, as will annul or modify it in a court of chancery, according to the established principle of courts of equity. Creditors have, as between them and the debtor, an undoubted right to so much of his estate as will pay their debts; but the debtor has a right, equally undoubted, of preferring one creditor to another, or giving all his property to one; this is neither fraud in law or fact, in the absence of covin or collusion. A debtor may sell his whole estate, turn it into money, and distribute it among his creditors, at his pleasure; those only who have liens on it, can, in either case, have any resort to the property in the hands of a bon a fide purchaser or creditor, who has fairly received it in payment of his debts. These are known principles of law, long settled and established by universal consent and adoption in our system of jurisprudence; they form rules of property and title on which the peace of society and security of rights essentially depend; they cannot be shaken by courts or juries, without producing endless confusion, uncertainty, and want of confidence in the administration of the laws of the land. We will then apply them to the case under our \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 364]\n\u00a0\n consideration, in order to ascertain, by their bearing on its merits, whether it comes within the third class of cases, which, we have seen, are excepted from the provisions of the statute.\n\n'A contract, in consideration of a future marriage, is of that nature which creates a legal and equitable obligation on the parties to perform it, in good faith, according to its stipulations; the consideration is as good and valuable, in contemplation of the law, as if it was made on the loan or payment of money; if the contract is executed, the parties become purchasers; if it remains executory, till after the marriage, they become creditors, on its consummation, or assume pro tanto the character and acquire the rights of both, if executed only in part. They are entitled to the protection of all courts, in the enjoyment of what is granted, and to their aid in enforcing the performance of what has been stipulated to be done, and where either party can rightfully call on a court of law or equity to compel the other to perform an act necessary to the execution of the contract, and the judgment or decree of the court would be given in his favor, a voluntary performance of the legal or equitable obligation would be equally valid. The consideration being valuable, if the contract, whether executed or executory, is made in good faith, with one having no notice or knowledge of any fraud, covin or collusion to defraud creditors, performance may be enforced, or voluntarily made, and the contract carried into execution, at any time, either in the whole or in part, as is in the power of the party; and whatever is so done, will be as valid and binding between the parties, and in relation to third persons, as if the execution had been completed on its date. The law is express in referring to the time of the conveyance and assurance, and embraces not only perfect grants or gifts, but any estate or interest in lands, goods and chattels, made, conveyed or assured. On these principles, it is the opinion of the court, that the evidence in this case brings the marriage-contract within the sixth section of the law, excepting it from the operation of the first section, unless you shall find that it was made, not bon a fide, or with notice or knowledge of a fraud in John R. Thomson in entering into it, brought home to his intended wife, and that Thomson actually entered into it with such fraudulent, covinous or collusive intention. \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 365]\n\u00a0\n 'If you do not find such want of good faith or existence of notice, then Mr. Richard Stockton must be considered at law as a purchaser for valuable consideration, bon a fide, and without notice, so far as the contract has, at any time, been proved to have been executed by Thomson, and his creditor, so far as remains to be executed; and Mrs. Thomson as having the same character in equity, and Captain Stockton as invested with all the rights, and standing, in all respects, in the situation, of his father.\n\n'The aspect in which these considerations present the case, is a contest between Mr. Stockton and Mrs. Thomson, the one the legal, and the other the equitable purchaser of the house, furniture and securities from John R. Thomson, by the contract, and in consideration of the marriage, and the lot as the marriage portion, and the plaintiffs, his sole creditors. Thus they stood at the commencement of this suit, and as creditors at the time of the contract and consummation of the marriage, they, having performed their stipulation, had a perfect right to call on Thomson, both at law and equity, to perform his. If Mrs. Thomson is a purchaser, she is one of the most favored class; the consideration she has given is a valuable and as much to be valued as money; it is not necessary to consider it as more so; if she is invested with the acknowledged rights of a money purchaser, a conveyance of real or personal property made to her before marriage, by her intended husband, of real or personal estate, would be as valid and effectual, although he was in debt, as if he was not. If he had the legal title to the thing conveyed, and power to sell, the interest and beneficial use would vest in her, and her trustee, by the deed, as fully and completely, if the property had been held in trust for others, as if Thomson had a right as perfect in equity as at law, provided she had no notice of the trust. This is a universal principle, never questioned, and protects all bon a fide purchasers for valuable consideration, without notice, before the money paid or the condition of the grant performed.\n\n'The application of this well-known and acknowledged rule of law to Mrs. Thomson does not make her a prerogative or a privileged purchaser; it only puts her on the footing of every other purchaser, from one who has the legal title, subject to \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 366]\n\u00a0\n an unknown trust for the use of a third person. This case is of the strongest kind against the cestui que trust, if the plaintiffs can be so considered, and they cannot be placed in any attitude which can give them better rights than in that; for the debt was contracted with them, but a few days before the date of the marriage-articles, and in a quarter of the world so distant as to preclude the possibility of notice to other parties. In the common case of a trustee, conveying the legal estate to the injury of cestui que trust, the trust exists at the time of the conveyance, it is necessarily known to the trustee, and notice may be brought home to the purchaser, by direct or circumstantial evidence, as in all other cases; but in this, it could be done by no possibility.\n\n'When the law is so well settled, as in the case of a conveyance by a trustee to one having no notice of the trust, it can have no effect to urge any arguments of hardship on the person injured; we could not change the law on the subject, if we would, and should violate our duty, not so to declare it. It is a hardship on a widow or an orphan, who has been defrauded by her trustee, in selling what is not his own, but theirs; but it is as great, if not a greater, hardship on the widow or orphan, to be deprived of property which they have purchased and paid for by money earned by their industry, and deprived of that, on the faith of which they have devoted their lives to a husband, and placed at his disposal their future happiness, and last cent. A loss must fall on one of two innocent sufferers, whose claims may be supposed equal in justice and equity; in such cases, the law leaves the property with the one who has acquired the legal title, by fair purchase, in good faith, and without notice; and a creditor of a fraudulent debtor, who sells or settles on his intended wife property which he is bound both in law and equity to apply or pay his debts, can, on no principle, be more favored in any court, than the person whose property is unjustly conveyed by a trustee to pay his own debts, to rob one family in order to save another, or secure a provision for an expected one of his own. A creditor is nowhere more favored than the infant, the ward, the widow or orphan, whose property is in the hands of trustees, without lien or security, and subject to his disposition by deed or bill of sale. \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 367]\n\u00a0\n 'The creditor of a deceased debtor has the same right to the payment of his debt out of his property as a living one; yet a sale of the personal property of a decedent, by an executor, administrator or trustee, to pay his own debt, is good against creditors, the widow and next of kin, if made without notice or collusion, and no court of chancery will annul it; yet it is as much a breach of faith, as deep a violation of moral honesty, as to settle the same property on an intended wife, to whom he was under as high and imposing obligations to perform his contract of marriage, by paying the promised consideration on which it was solemnized, as to discharge a bond given for money lent or property purchased.\n\n'These are general principles and rules of law which, we feel confident, are the pre-existing law of this case, and, as such, lay them down to you as the legal rule for your verdict; we should make, instead of expounding the law, act as legislators of new rules, and not as judges, expositors and administrators of old and well-established ones, in declaring that Mrs. Thomson is, in this case, to be viewed in a less favored light than a purchaser in consideration of money or property.\n\n'The consideration of the contract on which this cause depends, is both marriage and property; the value of the one cannot be, and the other has not been, ascertained in dollars, but we think the justice of this case can be attained, without doing either; considered as a purchase made in good faith, and the purchase-money paid without notice of any fraud by the intended husband, we know of no principle by which it can be declared void in a court of law; we know of no case in which a conveyance of real or personal property so made, has ever been, or, agreeable to legal principles, could be, annulled and set aside, on any reason founded on mere inadequacy or consideration. All this is required to render a conveyance valid at law, in that respect, is, that there be some consideration, the amount is not material, and cannot be inquired into, either as respects the grantor, his creditors, or subsequent purchasers of the same property, in the absence of actual and legal fraud in the grantor, or notice of it to the grantee. The only resort of the parties who complain of any equitable fraud, or other circumstances which would \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 368]\n\u00a0\n invalidate it in equity, is to those courts; they only can decide upon the inadequacy of a pecuniary fund, or the equality of marriage to a given sum of money, or value in property, under the circumstances of the case. Cases may exist in which a court of chancery would compare and estimate them, for the relief of a creditor, a purchaser, or perhaps the party, in a strong and clear case of injustice; when such a case occurs, it will be time to give an opinion on it; as yet we know of no instance in which a court of chancery have set aside a purchase for a valuable consideration, or a marriage-contract, when made bon a, fide, and without notice of fraud or defect of title; those claiming under them have ever been the peculiar favorites of such courts, and their rights can never be disturbed, unless in some extreme case of such a nature as to call for the application of old rules and principles to a new state of facts, which have never yet been presented to a chancellor. Truth is not to be elicited by forced comparisons and extravagant suppositions, or extracted from extreme cases of rare and barely possible occurrence; the rules of law have been settled to meet the common and ordinary occurrences of life, which come within the cognisance of courts of justice; extreme cases may arise, and though necessity may have no law, yet there are rules for all exigencies, but they are only to be applied when they arise; they differ much from those which regulate and govern the ordinary common contracts of society. The court perceives nothing in the one now under our examination, which gives it any unusual features. At the time it was entered into, if you view the evidence as we do, Mr. Thomson, so far as he could judge, was abundantly able to make the stipulated provisions for his intended wife, without doing any injury to the plaintiffs or any other person; he has given evidence of losses enough, to account for his inability to comply either with his contract with his wife or plaintiffs, but they were unforeseen at the time; they happened not by his dishonesty or even imprudence. An investment was made by his agent, without his knowledge; the money was borrowed; the purchase and shipment made by Mr. Fisher, in good faith, and in the exercise of sound discretion. But what cost $86,300 in Canton, produced less, or \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 369]\n\u00a0\n not more, than $40,000 in Philadelphia; it has been a calamity by which the defendant has suffered and must suffer; his wife must lose $30,000 of her settlement, if the plaintiff lose $12,000 of his debt; even admitting their equities to be equal, she has a legal advantage which no court can take from her, unless her conduct can be impeached for actual or legal fraud; it would be as unjust, as illegal and inequitable, to visit alone on her the misfortunes which attended her husband's affairs.\n\n'Considering Mrs. Thomson, then, as a purchaser under the marriage- articles, we are decidedly of opinion, that there is no legal fraud attending the transaction, which would invalidate it in a court of law, nor any matter given in evidence, which would impair its obligation in a court of equity; the nature of the issue seems to us to require both views to be taken. If Mrs. Thomson cannot be viewed as the purchaser of the property contracted to be invested for her use, she is certainly a fair and honest creditor, from the time of its execution, if not from the time of the proposed settlement in August, after the engagement of marriage was made; if she was a creditor on the 19th December, Thomson had a right to prefer her in preference to any other creditor, to the extent of his whole property, whenever be could realize or reduce it into possession. The mere priority of the plaintiff's debt, in point of time, gave him no such legal or equitable priority of payment, as to prevent the marriage-agreement from having a legal efficacy on the parties; though Mr. Fisher had a previous authority to contract it, it could not cut out the inchoate rights of Mrs. Thomson, by the engagement and proposed settlement in the summer of 1825, which, you may fairly infer, from the agreement, was in the course of execution, by Thomson having begun to build a house on the lot of which Mr. Stockton was to stand seised in trust, before the date of the articles; and the deposition of Captain Stockton is, that it was built in 1825 and 1826. These circumstances may be thrown out of view on both sides, and the rights of the respective parties be tested at the time of the consummation of their respective contracts; that of the plaintiffs, on 22d November and 2d December, and Mrs. Thomson's on the 19th; if they were both fair creditors, \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 370]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomson had a clear undoubted right to prefer either, and pay the whole debt out of any property on which the other had no lien, and we are of opinion, that she might be considered as a fair creditor, to the amount of the promised settlement, made under circumstances which, we think, wholly insufficient to justify its being rescinded, in whole or in part, in a court of law or chancery, unless it was attended with actual fraud.\n\n'If it had comprehended his whole estate, and the certain consequence of being carried into effect, or the intention of the parties had been to exclude the plaintiff from the payment of his debts, under cover of the agreement, on the equity side of the court, we would give him relief. But this case seems to us to have no such character; the intervention of unexpected losses alone, and neither the effect of the agreement, nor the intention of the parties have produced the existing state of things; which, if not changed by your verdict, and our judgment, will leave the parties thus: The plaintiff's debt was nominally $63,000; the sum actually received by Mr. Fisher $61,002, bearing an interest of-per cent., of which he has received all now due, principal and interest, except about $12,000; that of Mrs. Thomson, estimating the house and furniture at $18,000, amounts to $58,000, of which there is yet due $35,000, if Morris' debt is not good, or $30,500 if it is good, besides interest from December 1825. Though this inequality of loss, might and would not be of any importance to her in a court of law, it would be a powerful circumstance in a court of equity, to which the plaintiff would apply for relief from alleged hardship. The time at which the contract was made, and the circumstances then attending it, connected with the situation of the parties at that time, furnish the proper criterion by which to ascertain their respective rights; if they have changed, by events happening since, and are to be governed by their situation at the commencement of the suit, it is important to view the change of the marriage-contract. Instead of withdrawing the $40,000, to be invested for the use of Mrs. Thomson, it has been reduced to $5000 certain, or $9500 \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 371]\n\u00a0\n contingent; had this been the original stipulation, it would hardly have been deemed an unreasonable or disproportionate consideration of the marriage; of the sum promised, and interest, she will in no event receive more than one-fifth, and possibly only only one-tenth, from the wreck of Mr. Thomson's property, while the plaintiff has received more than the half of what remained due him, after deducting the proceeds of the two invoices, of which no part went to Thomson or his wife, but the whole was applied to the plaintiff. It is also an important matter, as it affects the character of the two contracts, at the time they were made, that Thomson gave no security, and pledged no specific fund for the investment of $40,000, but as security for the repayment of an actual loan of $61,002, the plaintiff received as security goods of which the prime cost was $86, 300.\n\n'This view of the merits of this cause seems to the court to be sufficient for the decision of the points directly at issue; others have been made, and ably argued by counsel on both sides, but we are not disposed to trouble you with a discussion not necessary to a correct decision of the question between the parties. The cause has been tedious, and its examination sufficiently laborious; we shall not, therefore, investigate the doctrine of voluntary conveyances or contracts of marriage, made after it has been consummated, they not partaking of the character of purchases in consideration of money or marriage. In the first class of cases, the existence of debts due by the grantor, at the time of the deed or contract, has a very important, if not decisive, bearing on their validity, as to creditors; the law is not clearly settled, so as to their effect on subsequent purchasers. But it has never been decided, that a deed conveying to a bon a fide purchaser, or an intended wife, is in any manner impaired by the mere existence of pre-existing debts, and to this class of cases alone, it is necessary for you or the court to direct their attention.\n\n'The rules which we have expounded to you, as controlling this cause are such as are founded on principles which are assented to by counsel on both sides, they differing only in their application; there can, indeed, be no other question; if \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 372]\n\u00a0\n Mrs. Thomson is to be considered as a fair purchaser, without notice, or an honest creditor, her claims can only be affected by fraud, in a court of law, or such a case of equitable jurisdiction as could induce a court to annul a conveyance, made in consideration of money, or as security for a debt, or to enjoin the assertion of any right accruing or claiming under it. The importance of the principle involved in this controversy, made it our duty to examine it at large, and as the sum in dispute authorizes either party to take the cause to the supreme court for revision, we have given an opinion explicitly, so that the law may be fairly settled. We conclude, then, with instructing you, that a settlement made before marriage, makes the intended wife a purchaser; if agreed to be made, she is a creditor, and protected in the enjoyment of the the thing settled, and entitled to the means of enforcing what is executory, if the transaction was bon a fide and without notice or fraud. The plaintiffs have made an objection to the operation of this deed for the want of evidence of delivery; this is a question for you to decide; the evidence is sufficient to prove it, if you believe the witnesses; the building and furnishing the house are facts tending very strongly to prove the delivery in a satisfactory manner; the law on this subject is well settled by the supreme court, in Carver v. Astor, 4 Pet. 23, 28, 82; you will apply it to this case.\n\n'It has been said, that the contract of settlement has been abandoned; it is not to be presumed, and we think, the facts given in evidence do not amount to it; every act contemplated to be done by either party, has been performed, except making up the investment; the omission to complete it, is not, in itself, sufficient, to authorize you to find, that the whole contract has been rescinded; so far as it has been executed, it is not open to any presumption of the kind, and the allegation of abandonment seems to be inconsistent with the charge of alleged fraudulent intention to defraud the plaintiffs. You may find, if you are satisfied with the fact, that the payment of the balance of the $40,000 has been waived by consent of the parties, but this can have no effect on the investment actually made. The non-delivery of the securities for the $9500, till near the time when \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 373]\n\u00a0\n judgment was rendered in New Jersey, and the omission to record the marriage-articles, have been relied on in aid of the presumption of abandonment; but under the circumstances of the case, we do not think they conduce to prove it (the case last referred to seems to settle this point, 4 Pet. 24, 98-9), and nothing appears from which an inference can be drawn, that Mrs. Thomson, for whose benefit this contract was made, has done or consented to any act which could impair her rights under it; the omissions of her trustee to enforce the payment of the money, or to record the deed, cannot be deemed a waiver by her. If the trustee had done any acts inconsistent with the agreement, it could not affect the legal validity of her rights, and the acts of a parent will not be construed to be so, unless clearly intended. 4 Pet. 93, 95.\n\n'The court have been requested to charge you, that in point of law, the covenant on the part of Mr. Richard Stockton to stand seised to uses, operated as an immediate conveyance to his daughter, before marriage, and that by the marriage, Thomson became the owner of the furniture, in his own right, and had the exclusive use of the house and lot, unincumbered with the trusts of the agreement. By the covenant contained in that agreement, Mr. Stockton was not to stand seised to the use of his daughter, till after the marriage; if it is the understanding of the plaintiffs' counsel, that there is any evidence of any other covenant than this, we are unable to perceive it. The deposition of Captain Stockton is positive, that his father did not convey, but covenanted to stand seised of said lot ( prout deed); this does not even conduce to prove there was any deed, independent of the marriage-articles, and evidently refers to it, which the court instruct and charge you, as matter of law, does not operate, by the statute of uses, 27 Hen. VIII., to pass the legal estate to the lot, or any other property referred to in the agreement, to Mrs. Thomson or the defendant. It remained in Richard Stockton, during his lifetime, devolved, by his death, on his heir-at-law, Captain Stockton, and now remains in him, on a trust executory; it never was, and is not now, one executed by that statute. It is unnecessary to explain to you the reasons of this opinion, as it would perplex your consideration of the case, with a dry detail of abstruse \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 374]\n\u00a0\n principles, neither amusing or instructing to any persons, except those whose professional or judicial duty may lead them to the investigation; as a sheer question of law, you will probably not be disposed to investigate it for yourselves.\n\n'The court are also requested to charge you on three other points of law. 1. That the expenditure of $5000 in furnishing the house is per se fraudulent on creditors; we think not; furniture is part of the marriage- contract, to be provided by Thomson in a suitable manner, as he should think fit. He had a discretion which he might exercise in a reasonable manner, according to their station and associations in life, proportioned to the kind of house and extent of income; the trustee or wife could not, in law or equity, compel Thomson to furnish it extravagantly or at useless and wanton expense, and if he should do it, voluntarily, it would not be within the true spirit and meaning of the marriage-articles, and might be deemed a legal fraud on creditors as to the excess. But before we can say that it is a fraud in law, to expend $5000 in furnishing a house costing $ 13,000, and the establishment to be supported by the income of an investment of $40,000 in productive funds, we must be satisfied, that it is, at the first blush, an extravagant and unwarranted expenditure under all the circumstances in evidence, and to an extent indicating some fraudulent or other motive unconnected with the fair execution of the contract, of which we are not satisfied; and therefore, cannot charge you as requested by the plaintiff's counsel, there being no clear abuse of the discretion confided by the contract to Mr. Thomson. A less expenditure on both house and furniture would have been more prudent and discreet, in the situation of the parties in 1826, when the house was finished; something could have been saved for investment, if less expense had been incurred, and $8000 or $10,000 been made productive. Had this been done, there could have been little ground of complaint by a creditor; but as to him, it was immaterial how the money was expended; his only concern was, in the amount, not the objects, of the expenditure, so that they were according to the terms of the agreement; whether a given sum was applied to one object or the other, or fairly proportioned \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 375]\n\u00a0\n among them, affected only the parties, not creditors.\n\n'2. We are next asked to charge you, that the delivery of the notes to Captain Stockton, in September 1829, was a fraud; if it was done in order to comply, in part, with the agreement, it was not so; if it was colorable, made with the intention of covering and concealing so much, under pretence of the marriage-articles, for Thomson's use, and so received by the trustee, it was legally fraudulent as to creditors, but if delivered with such intention, and not so accepted, then Captain Stockton might not only fairly apply it to the trust fund, but was bound to do so. Though it may have been done on the eve of the judgment confessed in New Jersey, that would make no difference, it being to carry into effect the agreement of December 1825; had it been to make a new settlement, after marriage, if it was in consideration of a portion or property, it would not have been fraudulent per se; and the time which intervenes between the making provision for a wife, and the contracting the debt or obtaining a judgment against the husband, is not a matter which per se makes it a fraud; it may or may not be suspicious, and connected with other circumstances as evidence of it. 4 Wheat. 506-8.\n\n'The remaining point on which the charge of the court is requested, is, that the marriage-agreement is void, because not recorded within the time required by the law of New Jersey for recording deeds. The covenant to stand seised to the uses declared, would come within this law, if the uses were executed by the statute, so as to make it an actual conveyance or deed passing the legal estate, but being executory, it is only a covenant giving an equitable estate to those for whom the trust was created and continues, and not a deed. But considering it as a deed, the want of recording does not make it void as between the parties, though it would become void as to the creditors (perhaps) and purchasers from Richard Stockton without notice; but the omission to record it is no fraud on plaintiff, and cannot affect him; not being void as between the parties, it gives to John R. Thomson no other estate or interest but such as arises from the trust; he cannot be entitled to any legal estate or interest under it, incompatible with the nature and terms and objects of the trust; our instruction, \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 376]\n\u00a0\n therefore, is, that the marriage-contract is not void for want of being recorded in time.\n\n'The principles of law which have been thus expounded to you as the guides to your verdict, are all which are deemed by the court or counsel to be applicable to the merits of this case, or necessary to be understood, in order to decide it correctly; they form what, in our judgment, is the pre-existing law of the case, and have been extracted from judicial decisions which afford to our minds conclusive evidence of their wisdom and justice. The rules laid down are not new ones, either here or in that country which is the source of our jurisprudence, and to whose judicial tribunals the wisest and best judges will look, without any fear of foreign influence; to some, with veneration, and to all, with respect, as the expositors of the same common law which originated there, and, adopted in this country, is the source of national pride to both, as a system equally distinguished for its wisdom and public benefits. It has not been thought necessary to cite to you all the particular cases in which judges have established these principles, or refer you to the time of their application, as the nature of the cases decided may have led to their development; this is more proper in courts of error, or in deciding, in others, questions referred solely to the court. The course pursued saves you much time, and relieves your minds from much perplexity; it does not produce an injury to the parties; it saves you from a comparison between the character of the courts and judges who may have given judgments or opinions, settling and declaring the rules of the common law or the construction of statutes. Whether we have, in forming our judgment as to the law of this case, drawn from the old and pure fountains of jurisprudence, or the muddly rivulets which flow from them, need only be decided by that tribunal to whom none appeal without full confidence that it will in justice give such judgment as will correct all the errors of inferior courts. You will not be willing to confide more in your own judgment, to correct any mistakes which this court may have committed in the instructions they have given you, than in that of the supreme court, to whom either party may submit this cause. Let our judgment be what it may, as to the law, it can do harm to no one, without their sanction; with \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 377]\n\u00a0\n their approbation, a safe rule of titles and property will be established; your judgment might not lead to one so sound or permanent. Much of what you have heard, has been repeated from the adjudications of that court, much from those of England, their judges and chancellors, whose judgments, decrees and opinions have been carefully reviewed and approved by the pure and eminent jurists who have presided in our own courts. If, in following the path which they have pursued in the administration of justice, this court looks abroad, as well as at home, for light and knowledge to guide our course of legal investigation, it has been, and will continue to be, done, without the fear of being misled by example, or the self-reproach of adopting in our, or inculcating in your, minds, principles unsound in law, or dangerous in their moral tendency.'\n\n The case was argued by C. J. Ingersoll, for the plaintiffs in error; and by Binney, for the defendant.\n The counsel for the plaintiffs made the following assignment of errors: The charge of the court instructed the jury, that under the circumstances in evidence, the law is against the plaintiffs; that the marriage-settlement in question would be valid, unless all the parties thereto were guilty of fraud; that marriage is a sufficient consideration for settlement; and left to the jury nothing to find by their verdict, but whether the defendant's wife and father were equally guilty with the defendant in the alleged contrivance to defeat the plaintiffs; arguing, as the charge does throughout that the verdict should be for the defendant. He also submitted, in argument, the following points of law.\n\n 1. \nThe settlement covenants that the grantor should furnish the house in a suitable manner, as he should judge suitable and proper. As he proved insolvent, and unable to comply with the other terms of the settlement, it was contended for the plaintiffs, that $5000 was a fraudulent investment in furniture; on which the jury were to pass their \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 378]\n\u00a0\n verdict. The court rejected this view, assumed to determine that the sum was proper, and would not permit the jury to pass upon it.\n\n 2. \nThe settlement covenants that the grantor would, in the space of one year from the time of the marriage, place out on good security, in stock or otherwise, the sum of $40,000, and hand over the evidences thereof to the trustee. This covenant was never fulfilled. But some years afterwards, when the trustee was dead, on the eve of the judgment confessed by the grantor in New Jersey, he passed over two promissory notes for $9500, together, to the son of the trustee, in performance, as was said, of the settlement in part. This was contended for the plaintiffs to be fraudulent, and as such to be passed upon by the jury. The court overruled this position, and charged, that unless the notes were both delivered by the grantor and accepted by Robert Stockton, with fraudulent intentions, the transfer is good.\n\n 3. \nAs the deed of settlement was not registered, till after the plaintiffs' judgment in Jersey against the defendant, it was insisted for the plaintiffs, that pursuant to the express provision of the statute of New Jersey, in that case, the prior judgment prevails over the subsequent settlement. The statute of uses, 27 Eliz., c. 10, annexes the possession to the use; the lot and house held by Richard Stockton, in trust for his daughter, became her property, which the husband reduced into his possession; and the plaintiffs' judgment binds it, notwithstanding the subsequent marriage-settlement. This was also overruled by the court.\n Ingersoll contended:-The plaintiffs are prior creditors. There was no contract for a marriage-settlement, until a month after the defendant, through his agent, contracted the debt in question to the plaintiffs. The property settled is enough to pay the debt; so that the marriage- settlement is the only hindrance, and the question is, whether it is an insuperable legal impediment? The philosophy of the law on this subject is simple honesty-to give \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 379]\n\u00a0\n every one his own. The English common law, which is our law, differs from the law of all the rest of the civilized world, in identifying the wife with the husband. A married woman can own nothing, can lose nothing, can hardly be guilty of a misdemeanor, if, by construction of law, it may be imputed to her husband; whereas, in the countries of the civil law, marriage is like a commercial partnership, a firm in which the interests of husband and wife are the same, respecting the joint-stock or property. In the great families of England, says Lord MANSFIELD, it has been found convenient to establish marriage-settlements, which luxury and chancery have entrenched behind the principles of the civil law, usurping the free empire of the common law. So long ago as the year 1570, the statute 13 Eliz. indicates a primitive and proper repugnance to such a contrivance, and endeavors to reinstate the common law, impaired by marriage- settlements and other frandulent conveyances: for which it enacts not only annihilation, but punishment. In defiance, however, of this resistance of the common law, and the statute law, which is but declaratory of the common law, the English chancellors, who were always interested parties, have built up a system of encroachment and exclusiveness, ill suited to American manners, fortunes and institutions. The state of New Jersey, by an act of assembly, re-enacted the statute of Elizabeth, which itself was but declaratory of the common law, and though American judges are deplorably prone to follow blindly in the ruts of British precedent, yet we may, at least, claim it as the settled law of this court, that we are to be governed by English law before the American revolution, and not to follow them in all the enormities which they are chargeable with since. Cathcart v. Robinson, 5 Pet. 264. The case of Campion v. Campion, 17 Ves. 262, may be mentioned as one of those usurped decisions of the modern English chancery, which it is to be hoped do not give the law to this country.\n The present is the case of a man in trade, with immense outstanding debts and liabilities, without a particle of real estate, or even of personal, but in mere speculation, who, \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 380]\n\u00a0\n immediately after the marriage, declared his inability to settle the property promised by the marriage-settlement, who has not, and never had, any goods, stocks, credits, property or estate of any kind, nothing to pledge, even if he wanted to borrow, who pleads utter insolvency, who settled, on his marriage, the very money he borrowed of the plaintiffs, and who now lives upon it, in their despite. Within a month of the crash of his father's immense failure, with whom he was connected in trade, which was an affair of such importance as to be published in the English newspapers, the defendant, by marriage-settlement, set apart, and now withholds, all he could ever claim, and much more than he ever was entitled to.\n The question is, whether such is a valid marriage-settlement? That it hinders the plaintiffs, who are prior creditors, is beyond all question. In the court below, it was insisted for the defendant, that by ante- nuptial settlement, the wife is a purchaser, holding by a consideration equivalent, if not superior, to the most valuable. For the plaintiff, conceding this position, it was contended, nevertheless, that there must be a fair transaction, as well as a valuable consideration, that fraud will vitiate any contract whatever, that even acquittances, bonds, laws, treaties, may be annulled by fraud, and why not the contract of marriage- settlement? The charge sanctioned both these positions; the plaintiffs, without reserve, carrying it out in argument, ad libitum, and the plaintiff's position, with a qualification which forms the first exception, to wit, that to invalidate a marriage-settlement, the wife and her father must combine with the settler or husband, and be equally guilty with him of premeditated fraud. The charge is explicit, that there must be not only notice or knowledge, or even participation, but combination and premeditation of all together and alike.\n This, it is submitted, is not the law. The jury were misled in being so instructed. They should have been advised, that they might find fraud in the husband, and knowledge of, or notice to, the wife or father; and that such a state of things would vitiate the settlement as a fraudulent transaction. The charge considers, first, fraud in fact; secondly, the question of property, under the special agreement; and thirdly, fraud in \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 381]\n\u00a0\n law, or constructive fraud. The jury supposed, and had reason to suppose, that unless they found the wife and father equally guilty with the husband, they must affirm the marriage-settlement as a fair transaction. It even goes so far as to say, in an argument much elaborated to support the settlement, that it would be cruel and harsh in the extreme, and inconsistent with law and justice, to visit the wife with the husband's fraud, unless she concurred in the intention of it, and was guilty of the combination. Now, the law, as expressly enacted by the statute of Elizabeth, and by the act of New Jersey, the common law, the common sense, the obvious morality and reason of the case are, that if either wife or father knew, or might have known, or had the least reason to suspect, the husband's fraud, the transaction is altogether fraudulent and void. For it is a question to be determined by the whole transaction, not a part of it. The argument of the charge to the jury puts it to them to ascertain how much fraud there was, whereas, it is submitted as the law, the reason, and the morality of the contested principle, that any, the least particle of fraud, by either party, with any, the least notice to the other party, vitiates and annihilates the whole proceeding. The proviso or exception of the sixth section (Atherly 212) is to except those settlements which are made on good consideration and bon a fide, without any manner of notice or knowledge of the fraud: and so are the authorities. Cadogan v. Kennett, Cowp. 434; Doe v. Routledge, Ibid. 710; Blanchard v. Ingersoll, 4 Dall. 305; Geiger v. Welsh, 1 Rawle 353; 1 Roper on Husband and Wife, 298; Dewey v. Baynton, 6 East 257; Barrown v. Barrow, 2 Dick. 506; Wheaton v. Sexton, 4 Wheat. 507; s. c., 8 Ibid. 389; Hinde v. Longworth, 10 Ibid. 213; Johnston v. Harvy, 2 P. &. W. 82; Garland v. Rives, 4 Rand. 282; the two last cases are in point.\n In all these cases, and on all occasions, the question was, and must be, was it a fair transaction, not how much fraud was there in it. In postnuptial cases, the law infers fraud. In ante-nuptial cases, it is the question to be tried. It is a question of fact, which a court cannot compel a jury to qualify. The morality which pervades all law, and which is the law \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 382]\n\u00a0\n itself, prohibits all fraud, not merely a combination of fraud, and it considers the slightest notice as the fullest participation. Edward Thomson's enormous failure, shortly before the settlement, involving John R. Thomson, must have excited suspicion and inquiry; and the fact is, and such was the plaintiffs' argument on the trial, that Mr. Stockton repudiated the settlement, satisfied, as he must have become, of its invalidity. For the poignancy of the misdirection is, that it was a complete surprise; the fact of combination or participation between husband and father never having been suggested or intimated by the plaintiffs' counsel to the jury. On the contrary, their argument was, that far from combining, Mr. Stockton revolted at the settlement, and refused to complete it. This argument was drawn from the incontrovertible and conclusive facts, that it never was either acknowledged or recorded during his life, but remained a dead letter, in family secret, never carried into execution, owing to the settler's acknowledgment, immediately after the marriage, that he was unable to set apart the $40,000 stipulated by the settlement to be invested for the use of the wife, or any part of it, being, as he acknowledged, utterly insolvent. Thus, his immense debts, large losses, and overwhelming liabilities, becoming known to Mr. Stockton, immediately after the settlement was signed, and the marriage took place, he did not choose to involve his daughter and himself in the useless odium of such an illegal attempt to deprive creditors of their property. The settlement was, therefore, cast away, never completed while Mr. Stockton lived, never acted upon, and no attempt ever made to realize it, till by the settler, just on the eve of his confession of judgment to the plaintiff, when he had it acknowledged and recorded. All these circumstances the plaintiff had a right to submit to the jury, as proof of knowledge or notice, to be inferred, not from participation in the fraud, repudiation of it. But the court, instead of suffering this view to be presented to the jury for their determination, frustrated it, by a misdirection as to combination, which left the jury nothing to find but the fact of combination, or a verdict for the defendant.\n Even in the definition of fraud, the charge misdirected the \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 383]\n\u00a0\n jury by a reference to the case of Conard v. Nicoll, 4 Pet. 296; where Judge WASHINGTON's attention was fixed on the instance of fraud by one, with notice to another, not that of fraud by two or more, which is defined covin. Co. Litt. 357 b, defines it as referred to by Judge WASHINGTON; but both Littleton, in the text, and Coke, in the commentary, put instances of individual fraud, in which two or more are concerned, as contradistinguished from the fraud of combination, or covin. So does HARDWICKE, in the case of Chesterfield v. Janssen, 2 Ves. sen. 155. So does MANSFIELD, in the case of Cadogan v. Kennett, Cowp. 43, where the very case is put of a fraudulent conveyance to an innocent trustee. Such are the cases of Garland v. Rives, and Johnston v. Harvy, before cited. In the case of the Postmaster-General v. Reeder, 4 W. C. C. 683, Judge WASHINGTON explains his opinion of fraud, actual and constructive; and in the case of Gilmore v. North American Land Company, Pet. C. C. 464, he individuates it. The charge, it is, therefore, submitted, annuls the whole law of notice as to fraudulent conveyances, and makes every one a fair purchaser, who is not a participator in the fraud; so that a wife or father have only to remain wilfully ignorant of a husband's fraud, and a family settlement will be valid of property acquired by highway robbery. On the part of the plaintiff, it is submitted, that the principle of law is to be found well expressed in the careful language of the sixth section of the statute of Elizabeth, that entire good faith, besides a valuable consideration, are indispensable to the validity of every marriage- settlement.\n Exception was also taken to three distinct errors alleged against the charge, as follows:\n\n 1. \nThe settlement covenants that the grantor should furnish the house in a suitable manner. As he proved insolvent and unable to comply with the other terms of the settlement, it was contended, that $5000 was a fraudulent investment in furniture, on which the jury were to pass their verdict. The court overruled this position, would not permit the jury to pass upon it, but assumed to itself the determination that there was no fraud. The case of \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 384]\n\u00a0\n Campion v. Campion, 17 Ves. 262, the authority of which has been denied, sanctions this positions of the plaintiffs' counsel, and is authority fortiori, when it determines against a family settlement.\n\n 2. \nThe settlement covenants that the grantor would, in the space of a year, place the sum of $40,000 on good security and hand over the evidences thereof to the trustee; which covenant was never fulfilled. But several years afterwards, the trustee having in the meanwhile died, without the acknowledgment or registry of the conveyance; on the eve of the judgment he confessed to the plaintiff, passed over two promissory notes to the trustee's successor, in part performance of the settlement, as it was said. For the plaintiff, it was contended, that this was fraudulent, and as such to be passed upon by the jury. The court overruled this position; and erroneously, as is submitted, assumed to itself to determine, that there was no fraud, unless the settler and the trustee concurred in it.\n\n 3. \nThe deed of settlement was not recorded, till after the plaintiff's judgment; in which case, the act of assembly of New Jersey is explicit, that the conveyance is inoperative as against the judgment. Act of 5th June 1820, Laws of New Jersey (ed. 1821), p. 747. Two cases have been determined in South Carolina, where the law is similar, that are strongly in point. Ward v. Wilson, 1 Desauss. 401; Forrest v. Warrington, 2 Ibid. 254. The statute of uses, 27 Hen. VIII., c. 10, annexes the possession to the use. The house and lot held by Mr. Stockton, in trust for his daughter, became her property, by the express terms of this statute; the husband, by occupation, reduced it into his possession; and the plaintiffs' judgment binds it, notwithstanding the marriage-settlement. The statute is positive, that of real estate held for her use, the seisin is in her. 4 Cruise's Dig. 96 (133); 419 (420), tit. 11. ch. 3,  4-6. The charge is, that the marriage-article is not a conveyance, but an executory covenant; which makes no difference, for the statute in terms comprehends that with all similar cases. It is the very case the statute intended to provide against.\n Binney, for the defendant in error.-- \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 385]\n\u00a0\n There cannot be a better introduction to the defendant's argument, than a reference to Carver v. Astor, 4 Pet. 80, upon the sweeping exceptions to the charge of the circuit court, which this bill of exceptions exhibits. The whole charge is set out, and the whole is excepted to, the recommendation of this court to the contrary notwithstanding; and the proper corrective of the practice, if persisted in, would seem to be, to disregard every exception which any possible interpretation of the charge can obviate. A fair interpretation, as it is termed, does not belong to a practice which, whatever be its motive, is unjust to the court, the opposite counsel, and the cause. Nothing, however, is necessary to support this charge, but the application of common rules.\n What the plaintiffs' paper book calls the overpowering argument of the court upon the facts, is not a ground of exception. Whether the opinion of the court was right or wrong, it did not bind the jury. It may be difficult, in some cases, and it was impossible, in this, to say anything about the facts, without an overpowering argument against the plaintiff's claim. So far as that claim asserted any intentional wrong in any one of the parties to the settlement, it was wholly without foundation or color. The naked question presented by the case, if question it was, was, whether an ante-nuptial marriage-settlement, a settlement in consideration of marriage, without the least suspicion by the intended wife, or her trustee, of marriage, without the debt on the part of the intended husband, was good against creditors. The facts exhibit nothing to vary the terms of this question. In the autumn of 1825, the defendant was worth from $80,000 to $90,000, without any debt, and without any responsibility, except for a respondentia contract, which resulted in no loss. In September, he made proposals of marriage and of settlement, and was accepted. On the 19th of December, the articles in question were executed, after a statement of his property, set forth in the bill of exceptions. The marriage soon afterwards took place. The defendant then completed the house upon Mr. Stockton's lot, at a cost of about $12,000, and furnished it at a cost of about $4000, and in 1829, he handed to \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 386]\n\u00a0\n the trustee $5000 of good, and $4500 of doubtful property, on account of the marriage-settlement; and this is all that it has produced. The plaintiffs' demand, and the only demand in existence, against the defendant, except a loan for personal expenses during his embarrassments, arose out of a contract in Canton, on the 22d of November 1825. It was a loan of $63,000, made upon a pledge of all the merchandise which that sum purchased in Canton, and $23,000 more, with the additional benefit of coming freight free to the United States, the intended market of the investment. The loan was made, without the knowledge, and against the expectation of the defendant, but in virtue of a power left behind him to meet the contingency, which occurred, of his father's ships requiring funds to fill them up; and the commercial disasters of the season not only absorbed the entire pledge, but left the defendant a debtor to the extent of the judgment in the circuit court. The peculiar feature of this debt is, therefore, that it is the residuum of a mortgage-debt, after an original pledge of the entire investment of the money and a third more, and the specific transaction, moreover, unknown to the debtor at the time, and of course, to the intended wife.\n What effect such a debt would have upon a post-nuptial settlement, is a question that does not arise here. It would be a stronger case for such a settlement, than has ever been held to be insufficient. The statute 13 Eliz. does not avoid any settlement, as voluntary, but only as fraudulent. Actual fraud in such a case could not be suggested, upon the evidence; and if the law would presume it, it must do so in every imaginable case in which the settled property becomes necessary, by subsequent disaster, to pay the husband's previous debts. This proposition does not appear to be warranted by the books.\n The present is, however, asn ante-nuptial settlement, upon the valuable consideration of marriage, the very highest consideration, as it is, in one instance, said, that is known to the law. 2 Eq. Cas. Abr. 585. It is valid against purchasers as well as creditors, purchasers even without notice, unless they have got the legal estate; for the wife is a purchaser and has equal equity. Atherly 129, 151; Roberts on Fraud. Conv. 102-3; \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 387]\n\u00a0\n Reynell v. Peacock, 2 Roll. 105; Sir Ralph Bovy's Case, 1 Vent. 194; Douglass v. Ward, 1 Cases in Chan. 99; Ex parte Marsh, 1 Atk. 158; Brown v. Jones, Ibid. 190; North v. Ansell, 2 P. Wms. 618; Wheeler v. Caryl, Ambl. 121; Brown v. Carter, 5 Ves. 878; Doe v. Routledge, Cowp. 712; Nairn v. Prowse, 6 Ves. 752; East India Company v. Clavel, Prec. Ch. 377. Being such a consideration, the statute 13 Eliz. expressly excepts it from its operation. It excepts deeds upon valuable consideration, even fraudulently intended by the grantor to defeat his creditors, unless the grantee has notice or knowledge of such covin. The intended wife, and not merely her trustee, must have notice or knowledge that the bounty of the husband is intended as a fraud upon his creditors. Nothing short of this will answer. The deed, and the intended fraud, without such notice, are nothing more than in the case of an ordinary sale. Barrow v. Barrow, 2 Dick. 504; Champion v. Cotton, 17 Ves. 263; Tunno v. Trevisant, 2 Desauss. 264; Prebble v. Boghurst, 1 Swanst. 319.\n The plaintiffs' counsel, while he impugned the doctrine in the circuit court, admits it here, and objects to the charge, because it goes further. He understands the judge to have charged, that something more is necessary than notice of the intended fraud; that there must be combination, concurrence, confederacy, preconcert. Supposing this not to have been explained or qualified, it means nothing more than what must exist in every such case as the plaintiff alleged this to be; one, namely, in which notice, if brought home at all, was so to a party with whom a previous negotiation was made for the deed, and who, in consummation of the treaty, accepted the deed. In such a case, all parties are actors in the fraud. The fraud is perpetrated with the aid of a party conscious of it, and assisting at its birth. If A. makes a fraudulent deed to B., C. may know of it, without combining or concurring; but if B. has notice of the fraud, before and at the time of accepting the deed, he is guilty of combination, concurrence, confederacy, and preconcert with the grantor. There is unity of action and design in both. The statute, in such a case, punishes the \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 388]\n\u00a0\n grantee by a penalty. This, consequently, was good law, in reference to the case, as the plaintiff himself stated it.\n But the court did not say, that something more than notice was necessary. They simply stated, what, in every such case, notice to the grantee must amount to. This meaning is obvious, from many parts of the charge, and particularly, from the concluding summary, in which the instruction is given to the jury. 'A settlement made before marriage, makes the intended wife a purchaser; if agreed to be made, she is a creditor, and protected in the enjoyment of the thing settled, and entitled to the means of enforcing what is executory, if the transaction was bon a fide, and without notice of fraud.' The facts of fraud in the husband, and notice to the wife, were left to the jury. The doctrine of the court was, that both must be shown by the plaintiff; and if this is right, the main exception fails.\n The main points adhered to in this court by the learned counsel, admit of short answers.\n\n 1. \nThe paper book mistakes the charge as to the furniture. The bill of exceptions must be the guide. It shows the plaintiffs' prayer to have been, for an instruction that the expenditure of $5000 in furnishing the house was per se fraudulent, which the court refused. There is no such proposition in law, as that a covenant 'to furnish a house in a suitable manner, as the husband shall judge fit and proper,' which is the language of the covenant, or an actual expenditure to the extent of $5000, is per se fraudulent. There must be other circumstances. These were marriage articles, rather than a consummate settlement, and chancery will so mould and control them as to effectuate the intention, annulling the excess of the execution beyond what was lawfully intended. Atherly 92, 106, 121. It is a strong proposition, to assert that an unsuitable expenditure by the husband, contrary to the express language of his covenant, shall defeat the wife's settlement for anything more than the excess, when that is made out by evidence. The court expressed an opinion, that the expenditure might be bad for the excess, when shown, and were right in refusing to say, that a given expenditure, was per se a fraud. \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 389]\n\u00a0\n 2. The delivery of notes to the trustee, upon the eve of the plaintiffs' judgment, was good, if the settlement was so. The trustee was a creditor to a much larger amount, and the debtor had a right to prefer him. The court were right in saying, that the payment or delivery was good, unless made by the defendant with the intention of covering the property, under pretence of the articles, and so accepted by the trustee.\n\n 3. \nThe New Jersey statute of 5th June 1820, is wholly misconceived, or rather its effect. If the deed is void, by reason of the non-registry, the real estate, upon which alone the statute has any bearing, remains the property of R. Stockton, and is liable to his creditors. The creditors of the grantor, and not the grantee, are the creditors meant by the statute. It is difficult to sustain the exception, that the judgment against Thomson is to prevail over the settlement, and defeat it, when it is only by the validity of the settlement, that Thomson can have anything in the land for the judgment to affect. It is a further mistake, to suppose, that any use in the real estate, in the settlement, was executed by the statute in the defendant. The legal estate was intended to remain in R. Stockton, for the performance of the trusts. They could not be performed without it. He was, in certain events, to lease, to receive the rents, to convey. The execution of a use in the defendant, would have been contrary to the whole scope of the articles, and therefore, it is not executed. 1 Saund. on Uses, 246, 206, 208, and the authorities there cited; 1 Shep. Touch. 505. But if executed in the defendant, as to the legal estate, it could not have altered the case, as he would have thereby become a trustee for the purpose of the settlement; and, consequently, for the separate use of his wife and her children.\n\n STORY, Justice, delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is a writ of error to the circuit court for the district of Pennsylvania. The original action was a feigned issue between the plaintiffs, who are creditors, and the defendant, to try the question, whether he is able to pay the debt due to them; and this depends upon the validity of certain articles of settlement, made in contemplation of a marriage between the defendant and Miss Annis Stockton, daughter of the late \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 390]\n\u00a0\n Richard Stockton, Esq., stated in the case. The verdict in the court below was for the defendant; and judgment having been rendered thereon, accordingly, the present writ of error is brought to revise that judgment, upon a bill of exceptions taken to the charge of the court at the trial.\n The whole charge of the court is spread upon the record (a practice which this court have uniformly discountenanced, and which, we trust, a rule made at the last term will effectually suppress), and the question now is, whether that charge contains any erroneous statement of the law; for as to the comments of the court upon the evidence, it is almost unnecessary to say, after what was said by this court in Carver v. Astor, 4 Pet. 80-1, that we have nothing to do with them. In examining the charge, for the purpose of ascertaining its correctness in point of law, the whole scope and bearing of it must be taken together. It is wholly inadmissible, to take up single and detached passages, and to decide upon them, without attending to the context, or without incorporating such qualifications and explanations as naturally flow from the language of other parts of the charge. In short, we are to construe the whole, as it must have been understood, both by the court and the jury, at the time when it was delivered.\n The material facts are as follows: The plaintiffs and the defendant were resident merchants in China; and the defendant left it, in March 1825, to visit America. In the summer of that year, he paid his addresses to Miss Stockton, then resident, with her father, in New Jersey, by whom his addresses were accepted; and in contemplation of marriage, on the 19th of December of the same year, the articles of marriage-settlement referred to were executed. They purport to be articles of agreement and covenant, between the defendant of the first part, Miss Annis Stockton, of the second part, and Richard Stockton, father and trustee of Miss Stockton, of the third part. By these articles, after reciting the intended marriage, and that Richard Stockton, the father, had promised to give a certain lot of land (described in the articles) to his daughter, upon which the defendant, Thomson, had begun to build a house, it is stated, that R. Stockton covenants, in consideration of the \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 391]\n\u00a0\n said marriage, and his love and affection for his daughter, that from the time of the marriage, he will stand seised of the lot and premises, in trust to permit the defendant, and Annis his wife, to live in and occupy the same; and if they do not think proper so to do, then to let out the premises on lease, and receive the rents and profits, and pay over the same to the said Annis, during the joint lives of herself and her husband ( the defendant); if the defendant should survive his said wife, and have issue by her, then in trust to permit him, during his life, to inhabit and occupy the premises, if he should elect so to do, and to pay over the rents and profits to him, for the support of himself and his family, without his (the defendant's) being accountable therefor; and after his death, in trust for the child or children of the marriage, in equal shares, as tenants in common; and if no children, then upon the death of either the husband or the wife, to convey the premises to the survivor in fee- simple. By the same instrument, the defendant covenants, that if the marriage should take effect, and in consideration thereof, he will, with all convenient speed, build and furnish the house in a suitable manner, as he shall judge fit and proper, and that the erections, improvements and furniture shall be subject to and included in the trust. And further, that he will, in the space of a year from the marriage, place out, at good security, in stock or otherwise, the sum of $40,000, and hand over and assign the evidences thereof, to the trustee, who shall hold the same, in trust to receive the interest, profits and dividends thereof, for the wife, during the joint lives of herself and her husband. And if she should die before her husband, and there should be issue of the marriage, then in trust to receive the interest, profits and dividends, and pay the same to the husband, during his life, for the support and maintenance of himself and children, without any account, and after his death, in trust for the children of the marriage. A similar provision is made, in case of the survivorship of the wife; and if no children, then the trustee is to assign and deliver the securities and moneys remaining due to the survivor, to his or her own use.\n Such are the most material clauses of the marriage-articles. Before the execution of them, the defendant made out a \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 392]\n\u00a0\n written statement of his pecuniary circumstances, in which he states, that he owes no personal debts, except to a small amount, in the common course of business; that he is surety for his father in a respondentia bond to Messrs. Schott & Lippincott, in the penal sum of $200,000, upon which there was a pledge of goods, supposed to be sufficient to discharge the bond; and if any loss should accrue, it could not be more than $20,000, and that he considered himself worth that amount, if not more, in addition to the sum proposed to be settled.\n From the testimony in the case, which is stated in the charge, it appears, that the marriage was consummated; that the defendant built the house on the lot mentioned in the articles, at an expense of $13,000, and furnished it at the expense of $5000, but invested no part of the $40,000, during the life of the trustee. It also appears, that at the time of executing the articles, he was worth about $80,000 or $90,000 in money and personal property; that his agent in China, in November and December 1825, borrowed of the plaintiffs $63,000 on the pledge and security of property of the invoice value of $86,000 and upwards, on the credit of the defendant, but entirely for the use of the defendant's father, in order to complete the cargoes of his ships, then at Canton, short of funds. The property arrived at a losing market, and the debt now due to the plaintiffs by the defendant grew out of their transactions, his father having failed on the 19th of November 1825; but the existence of the loan, contracted with the plaintiffs, was not known to the defendant (though fully authorized to be made, if necessary), until the spring of 1826.\n The marriage-articles were never recorded in New Jersey, where the land lies, until May 1830, after the death of the trustee. In September 1829, shortly before the plaintiffs obtained a judgment for their debt against the defendant, the defendant delivered over to Captain Robert Stockton, the son of the trustee, who succeeded him in the trust, securities to the amount of $9500, in account of the sum to be invested pursuant to the marriage-articles. \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 393]\n\u00a0\n Such are the material facts, which appeared at the trial; and the question was, whether, under all the circumstances, the marriagearticles were void, as a fraud upon creditors? With reference to this point, the learned judge who delivered the charge to the jury, made, among others, the following remarks: 'To taint a transaction with fraud, both parties must concur in the illegal design; it is not enough, to prove fraud in the debtor; he may lawfully sell his property, with the direct intention of defrauding his creditor, or prefer one creditor to another; but, unless the purchaser or preferred creditor receives the property, with the same faudulent design, the contract is valid against other creditors or purchasers, who may be injured by the transaction.' 'Before you can pronounce this marriage agreement void and inoperative, on the ground of actual fraud, you must be satisfied, not only that the defendant made it, with design to defraud his creditors, but also that Mrs. Thomson, and her father and trustee, Mr. Richard Stockton, participated and concurred in the fraud intended. If they were innocent of the combination, it would be harsh and cruel in the extreme, to visit on her the serious consequences of her intended husband's acts, and as inconsistent with law as justice.' 'The deeds, gifts, grants or other contracts, which the law avoids, are those made with intent to defraud, hinder, delay or injure creditors; and in order to avoid them, both the party giving and the party receiving must participate in the fraud.' 'The words of the law (the statute of 13 Eliz., c. 5) require, that both parties must concur in the fraud, in order to bring the same within the provisions.' Nothing can be clearer, both upon principle and authority, than the doctrine, that to make an ante-nuptial settlement void, as a fraud upon creditors, it is necessary, that both parties should concur in, or have cognisance of, the intended fraud. If the settler alone intend a fraud, and the other party have no notice of it, but is innocent of it, she is not, and cannot be affected by it. Marriage, in contemplation of the law, is not only a valuable consideration to support such a settlement, but is a consideration of the highest value, and from motives of the soundest policy, is upheld with a steady resolution. The \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 394]\n\u00a0\n husband and wife, parties to such a contract, are, therefore, deemed, in the highest sense, purchasers for a valuable consideration; and so that it is bond fide, and without notice of fraud, brought home to both sides, it becomes unimpeachable by creditors. Fraud may be imputable to the parties, either by direct co-operation in the original design, at the time of its concoction, or by constructive co-operation, from notice of it, and carrying the design, after such notice, into execution.\n The argument at the bar admits these principles to be incontrovertible. But it is supposed by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, that the charge contains a different and broader doctrine; that it requires active co-operation, preconcert and participation in the original design of fraud; and that notice of it is not sufficient to avoid the settlement, although all the parties, after such notice, proceed to execute it. It appears to us, that this is an entirely erroneous view of the scope and reasoning of the charge, even in the passages above cited. But taking them in connection with other passages in the same charge, it is beyond doubt, that no such distinction was in the mind of the court, nor was, in fact, uttered to the jury. The language of the charge has reference to the actual posture of the case before the court, and not to any other possible state of facts. The case was not of a settlement already made and executed by the settler alone, with a fraudulent intent, to which settlement the wife or her trustee were not contemplated to be executing parties, and which was, after notice of the intent, accepted by them; in which case, the effect of notice might have been the very hinge of the cause. But the case was of marriage-articles about to be executed by all the parties, upon negotiations then had between them for that purpose; and of course, if there was a fraudulent design, known to all the parties at the time, the very execution of the articles made them all equally participators and parties to the fraud. It necessarily involved combination, and participation, and preconcert. It was to this posture of facts, that the reasoning of the charge was addressed; and it met and stated the law truly, as applicable to them. Notice, under such circumstances, necessarily included participation in the fraud. It was not possible, that the wife and her trustee, with notice of an intended fraud on \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 395]\n\u00a0\n the part of her husband, could execute the instrument, without being, in the sense of the law, participes delicti.\n But the charge does, in various other passages, distinctly point out to the jury, the very doctrine, which the plaintiffs in error assume as the basis of their argument, and for which they contend. Thus, in commenting upon the different classes of conveyances, to which the statute of 13 Eliz. is applicable, it is observed, that all conveyances are valid and excepted, which are 'for a valuable consideration, in good faith, without notice by the person receiving the conveyance, of any fraud, covin or collusion by the grantor to defraud his creditors.' Again, 'the consideration being valuable, if the contract, whether executed or executory, is made in good faith, with one having no notice or knowledge of any fraud, covin or collusion to defraud creditors, performance may be enforced, or voluntarily made, and the contract carried into execution, at any time, either in the whole or in part, as is in the power of the party.' Again, 'it is the opinion of the court, that the evidence in this case brings the marriage-contract within the sixth section of the law (the act of 13 Eliz.), excepting it from the operation of the first section; unless you shall find, that it was made, not bond fide, or with notice or knowledge of a fraud in John R. Thomson in entering into it, brought home to his intended wife, and that Thomson actually entered into it, with such fraudulent, covinous and collusive intention.' And, without dwelling on other passages equally expressive, it is added in the very close of the charge, 'we conclude, then, with instructing you, that a settlement made before marriage, makes the intended wife a purchaser for a valuable consideration; if agreed to be made, she is a creditor, and proteeted in the enjoyment of the thing settled, and entitled to the means of enforcing what is executory, if the transaction was bon a fide and without notice or fraud.' That these directions are correct in point of law, cannot admit of doubt; and that they cover the whole ground asserted in the argument for the plaintiffs, seems equally undeniable. We may then dismiss any further commentary on this part of the case.\n The next objection is, to the charge of the court in regard to the furniture. The court were requested to charge the jury \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 396]\n\u00a0\n that the expenditure of $5000 in furnishing the house was, per se, fraudulent. The court refused so to do, stating, 'that furniture is part of the marriage-contract, to be provided by Thomson, in a suitable manner, as he should think fit. He had a discretion, which he might exercise in a reasonable manner, according to their station and associations in life, proportioned to the kind of house and extent of income; the trustee or wife could not, in law or equity, compel Thomson to furnish it extravagantly, or at useless and wanton expense; and if he should do it voluntarily, it would not be within the true spirit and meaning of the marriage-articles, and might be deemed a legal fraud on creditors, as to the excess. But before we can say, that it is a fraud in law, to expend $ 5000 in furnishing a house costing $13,000, and the establishment to be supported by the income of an investment of $40,000 in productive funds, we must be satisfied, that it is, at the first blush, an extravagant and unwarranted expenditure, under all the circumstances in evidence, and to an extent indicating some fraudulent or other motive unconnected with the fair execution of the contract, of which we are not satisfied.'\n It is difficult to perceive any error in this direction; and it was going quite as far in favor of the plaintiffs in error as the law would warrant; for the change of circumstances of the defendant made no difference in his obligations to perform the stipulations of the marriage- articles. The court might well have refused to give the instruction, without any explanation, for it was asking them to decide, as matter of law, what was clearly matter of fact. The argument at the bar has, indeed, insisted, that the court misunderstood the object and request of the counsel; but there is no evidence of that, on the record, and certainly, it is not to be presumed.\n The next objection is, to the charge of the court respecting the delivery of the notes to Captain Robert Stockton, in September 1829. The court were requested to charge the jury, that the delivery of these notes to Captain Stockton was a fraud. The court directed the jury, that 'if it was done, in order to comply, in part, with the agreement, it was not so. If it was colorable, made with the intention of covering and \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 397]\n\u00a0\n concealing so much, under pretence of the marriage-articles, for Thomson's use, and so received by the trustee, it was legally fraudulent as to creditors; but if delivered with such intention, and not so accepted, then Captain Stockton might not only fairly apply it to the trust fund, but was bound so to do. Though it may have been done on the eve of the judgment confessed in New Jersey, that would make no difference; it being to carry into effect the agreement of December 1825.'\n We cannot perceive any error in this part of the charge. The wife became a purchaser and creditor of her husband, in virtue of the marriage- articles; and if the delivery of the notes was made in part performance of these articles, bon a fide, and without fraud, it was a discharge of a moral as well as of a legal duty. Among creditors equally meritorious, a debtor may conscientiously prefer one to another; and it can make no difference, that the preferred creditor is his wife.\n The remaining objection is, that the marriage-articles are inoperative and void, not having been recorded within the time prescribed by the laws of New Jersey for the registration of conveyances. To this objection several answers may be given, each of which is equally conclusive against the plaintiffs in error. In the first place, marriage- articles or settlements, as such, are not required by the laws of New Jersey, to be rocorded at all, but only conveyances of real estate; and as to conveyances of real estate, the omission to record them, avoids them only as to purchasers and creditors, leaving them in full force between the parties. This is the express provision of the statute of New Jersey of 1820;3 so that, notwithstanding the non-registration, the articles were good between the parties. In the next place, as to the personal estate, covenanted on the part of the defendant to be settled on his wife, whether furniture or money, it is clear, that the non-registration of the articles could produce no effect whatever. If the conveyance was free of fraud, it was, as to the personal estate, completely valid, even against creditors. In the next place, as to the real estate covered by the articles, whether these articles are treated as an actual conveyance, or as an executory contract, it is clear, that \n\n[32 U.S. 348, 398]\n\u00a0\n except as to the creditors of the grantor, Mr. Stockton, they were completely valid and operative. Viewed as a conveyance, or as a contract for a conveyance, the husband could not, consistently with the avowed trusts, take any legal estate or executed use in the real estate. The grantor necessarily remained the legal owner, in order to effectuate the trusts of the settlement; and the husband could entitle himself to the benefit of the trusts provided in his favor, only in the events and upon the contingencies which are therein stated. He had no equitable interest therein, capable of a present appropriation by his creditors. In every view of the circumstances, it is therefore clear, that the non- registration of the articles does not touch the plaintiffs' rights; and the court were correct in their instruction to the jury, 'that the marriage-contract is not void for want of being recorded in time.'\n Upon the whole, it is the unanimous opinion of the court, that the judgment of the circuit court ought to be affirmed, with costs.\n Judgment affirmed. \n4\n\u00a0\n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Spring Co. v.

In the district court, a libel was filed, on the 10th December 1830, by Howard & Varion, shipwrights, residing in New Orleans, against the steamboat Planter, claiming the sum of $2193.35, being the balance asserted to be due to them for the price of work, labor, materials furnished, and repairs made, on the said boat, under contracts of 13th September and 19th October 1830; and alleging that, by the admiralty law and the law of the state of Louisiana, they had a lien on the said boat for the payment of the same; and that she was about leaving the port of New Orleans, and praying process, &c. The account for the work, materials, & c., was annexed to the libel.\n The owners of the steamboat Planter filed a claim and plea, setting forth, that they were all citizens of Louisiana, all resided in the city of New Orleans, and that the libellants were also citizens of that state; and that, therefore, the district court of the United States had not jurisdiction of the case. By a supplemental answer, the respondents denied all the facts set forth in the libel. \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 326]\n\u00a0\n The plea to the jurisdiction of the court was overruled and dismissed; and the parties proceeded to take the testimony of witnesses, by depositions, which were filed as part of the proceedings in the case. By the first contract, the shipwrights stipulated to do certain specified work, and furnish certain materials, the same to be approved by 'experts,' for which they were to be paid the sum of $1150. By the contract of the 19th of October, the Planter was to be hauled on shore, and in consideration of $475, of which $200 was to be paid in cash, and $275 in one month after the boat should be launched and set afloat, certain other repairs were to be done to her, and she should be delivered and ready to receive a cargo by the 20th of November, under a penalty of $25 per day for each day her delivery should afterwards be retarded by the shipwrights. The evidence in the case is fully stated in the opinion of the court.\n The district court made the following decree: 'The libellants claim a balance due them of $2193.35 for work and materials furnished in the repairs of the steamboat Planter, at the request of the claimants, and for which they have a lien by the local law. The claimants, in their first answer, deny the jurisdiction of the court, on the ground, that all the parties were citizens of the same state, to wit, of Louisiana; that objection, however, was not insisted upon at the trial, and is not sustainable on the admiralty side of this court. In their supplemental answer, they deny generally the allegations of the libellants, and pray for the dismissal of the libel and damages. The whole account of the libellants against the owners amounts to $3693.35, including the amount of the written contracts entered into between the parties; of this sum they acknowledge the payment of $1500, leaving, as they allege, a balance of $ 2193.35 due \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 327]\n\u00a0\n them. By the first contract, made on the 11th September 1830 (the boat being then in the water), the libellants agreed, for the sum of $1150, to make certain repairs on that part of the boat which was above water, from the wheel-house to the bow; and it was further stipulated, that if they made any other repairs, by replacing unsound timbers, in any other part of the boat above water, not then discovered, they were to be paid separately for so much. After commencing the work, it was perceived, that the boat required repairs under the water as well as above, and in consequence of that discovery, the claimants, through Captain Jarreau, master of the boat, and one of the owners, agreed to pay the libellants $475 for hauling out the boat, and for launching her, when she should be repaired; and as the quantity of work to be done was uncertain, it was stipulated, that an account of it should be kept, and if approved by Captain Jarreau, under whose inspection the work was to be done, the claimants bound themselves to pay the amount thus to be ascertained; this latter contract was made on the 19th October last. After the boat was hauled out, it appears, the work under both contracts was carried on simultaneously. On a first view of the account-current exhibited in this case, it would seem, from the dates, that at least a part of the work to be done under the first contract was again charged, but the subsequent testimony taken in this case shows that these charges were made on account of the extra repairs provided for under the first contract; and it further appears, that all the charges made after the 19th of October, have no relation to the first agreement, but all relate to the work contemplated by the second contract. From the complexion of the testimony taken by the complainants, their real defence seems to be, that the prices of the work charged are greater than they should be, that it was not executed in a proper manner, and that the libellants have forfeited a considerable sum of money, in consequence of not delivering the boat within the time stipulated in the contract. As to the first two objections, the evidence is conclusive in favor of the libellants; Captain Jarreau, himself, upon being shown the account, did not object to it; on the contrary, expressed himself satisfied with the work, and said \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 328]\n\u00a0\n he was 'not surprised at it, because there was a great deal more work done than he had any idea of;' with respect to the non-delivery of the boat at the time agreed upon, the fault chiefly attaches to Captain Jarreau, who, in several instances, retarded the work, by opposing repairs which were proposed by the libellants, but which turned out to be indispensable, and were afterwards ordered by him to be made; besides, he promised them indemnity against their obligation to pay $25 a day for every day they were in default in delivering the boat, and gave as the reason, that they had to do more work than was at first anticipated. The charge of $475, is for the specific service of hauling out and launching the boat, and must be allowed as such. On the whole, the evidence and exhibits in the case fully sustain the demand of the libellants; it is, therefore, ordered, adjudged and decreed, that the claimants pay to them the said sum of 1193. 35, and costs of suit.'\n From this decree the owners of the Planter appealed to this court.\n The case was argued by Morton, for the appellants; Livingston submitted a printed argument.\n For the appellants, it was contended:-1. It does not appear, upon the proceedings, that the court below had jurisdiction. 2. That the libellants had waived any privilege or lien upon hte said steamboat, under the laws of Louisiana, and therefore, proceedings in rem were improper. 3. Though the court had jurisdiction, yet the decree rendered is erroneous.\n On the first point, 'that it does not appear, upon the proceedings, that the court below had jurisdiction;' Mr. Morton contended, that jurisdiction should appear affirmatively, for the district courts of the United States are of limited jurisdiction, and their proceedings are erroneous, if the jurisdiction be not shown upon them. Kempe's Lessees v. Kennedy, 5 Cranch 184; Walker v. Turner, 9 Wheat. 541. And this rule is \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 329]\n\u00a0\n applicable to all courts of inferior jurisdiction (Stanyon v. Davis, 6 Mod. 224; Lord Coningsby's Case, 9 Ibid. 95); and has been adopted by the appellate court, from the earliest periods of judicial history, for the purpose of restraining inferior tribunals within their appropriate spheres of action, and preventing the possibility of their passing those bounds, even by the assent of parties below, to the erroneous exercise of power.\n To sustain the jurisdiction of the court below, it must appear affirmatively, either that the Planter was a 'foreign vessel,' or, being a domestic vessel, that the lien or privilege created by the laws of Louisiana, constituted her a proper subject for the action of a court of admiralty. The first is not contended for on the part of the libellants; and to maintain the second, it must be shown affirmatively, that the Planter 'was engaged in a maritime employment,' being a navigation 'super altum mare,' or 'substantially upon waters within ebb and flow of the tide,' constituting a case of admiralty jurisdiction, as recognised 'by the law admiralty and maritime, as it has existed for ages,' which alone, the admiralty courts of the United States act under, and have authority to administer to the cases as they arise.

Admiralty jurisdiction is not then to be inferred, because a vessel is the subject, and a state law has created a lien, however positively these facts may be alleged upon a record, and remain uncontroverted; a converse doctrine would have sustained the jurisdiction in the case of The Jefferson, before cited; and would equally establish an admiralty jurisdiction, where state laws had created liens, whether upon tideless rivers or upon the waters of the lakes; in all of which cases, it may be observed, that the vice-admiralty colonial courts would have exercised jurisdiction, by virtue of their peculiar commissions; but not as cases of admiralty jurisdiction, which they never were, and to constitute them such would not be within the power of congress; though, to a certain extent, a jurisdiction over them might be conferred upon \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 330]\n\u00a0\n the district courts, under the power 'to regulate commerce among the states,' as is intimated in the case of The Jefferson. For the extent of power conferred on the vice-admiralty courts by their commissions, see 2 Gallis. 470, note, for Commission of Vice-admiralty Court.\n'A libel not alleging a thing done 'super altum mare,' nothing appears to give the court jurisdiction; for a man shall not sue in the admiralty only because it is a vessel.' 'The principal' must be shown to be within their jurisdiction. 1 Ld. Raym. 271; 1 Kent's Com. 353; Hall's Adm. Pract. 135, 137; 2 Browne's Civ. & Adm. Law 271.\n\n What does appear upon the record, is relied upon to be sufficient for inferring jurisdiction in the court below. The libel only alleges, that the libellants have a lien and privilege upon said boat, by the admiralty law, and by the law of Louisiana; being merely a statement of consequences, that could give jurisdiction of the case to the court as a result, should it appear by further facts, that the Planter was engaged in a 'maritime employment,' navigating 'super altum mare,' or 'waters within ebb and flow of the tide;' neither of which are to be found in any part of the record of the proceedings below, and in the absence of which, the clear bearing of the authorities indicates, that no jurisdiction can ever be inferred; 'the case not appearing to be a maritime contract, nor made such by the state law,' which it is admitted must be done, to maintain the jurisdiction of the court. It would seem to have been conceded on the part of the libellants, that were the inception, progress and termini of the Planter's employment, beyond ebb and flow of the tide, or substantially such, the case would clearly be within that of The Thomas Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428. It is submitted with some confidence, that this state of facts is but a fair inference from the whole record of the case.\n It is by no means conceded, that New Orleans is within the ebb and flow of the tide; on the contrary, that the court will notice the notorious and historical fact, that it is beyond the ebb and flow of the tide; that the Mississippi river is not an arm of the sea, nor an inlet from the ocean but an inland river, whose current assumes but one course or flux to the \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 331]\n\u00a0\n ocean, and is uninfluenced by its tides. The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 374; 3 Dall. 297; Hooker v. Cummings, 20 Johns. 98; Malte Brun's Geography, vol. 5, p. 58, book 79 (ed. of 1826); Stoddard's Louisiana, 164, ch. 4. An arm of the sea is where the sea or tide 'flows and reflows.' Sir Henry Constable's Case, 5 Co. 107. A navigable river is also considered as an arm of the sea; but there is an important distinction between the legal and popular import of the term 'navigable,' as applied to rivers; and no part of the law is more clearly settled, than that to determine, whether or not a river is navigable, a regard must be had to the 'ebbing and flowing of the tide.' For those streams of water which are of public use for inland navigation, above the line to which the tide ordinarily flows, are strictly 'not navigable,' though they are public highways, for the purpose of transportation; although the water is fresh at full tide, yet the river is still an arm of the sea if it 'flows and reflows.' This has never been controverted in England, and is well settled in this country. Angell on Tide Waters, ch. 4, p. 60 (ed. of 1826), where will be found collected all the English and American authorities upon the subject.\n'The tide is not felt at New Orleans. The rise and fall of the river is caused exclusively by the rainy and dry season in the interior; at low water, the flow to the sea is searcely perceptible.' From the surveyor- general of Louisiana. Hall's Travels, vol. 2, 284. The tides have little effect upon the water at New Orleans. They 'sometimes' cause it to 'swell,' but never to 'slacken its current.' Stoddard's Louisiana, 164, ch. 4. The employment of the Planter, thus, in its inception, appearing not to have been of a maritime nature, is shown in its further progress to have been exclusively beyond the ebb and flow of the tide. The second contract states, that the boat is to be delivered 'ready to receive a cargo.' The testimony shows her to have been 'launched and partly laden.' The return of the marshal shows her redelivery to claimants. The testimony of Wilson states Jarreau to have acted as commander, when the Planter was launched, and as commanding her, at the time witness gave his evidence. The \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 332]\n\u00a0\n affidavit of claimants states that Captain Jarreau was then navigating 'on the Mississippi, between New Orleans and Bayou Sara, and on the Red river, between New Orleans and Alexandria.' As, in the case of The Jefferson, the court noticed that Shippingport was beyond ebb and flow of tide, without any positive evidence appearing on the record; so will they notice the same fact, as to New Orleans, Bayou Sara, Alexandria, Baton Rouge and Red river. The last four places being also historically noted as equally beyond tide water. Darby's Louisiana, 95, 197; Stoddard's Louisiana, 165, 186.\n\n The record then affords evidence that the Planter, having been redelivered to the claimants, and laden with cargo, was employed, not in 'maritime service,' nor in trading 'to Mobile, Pensacola or intermediate places,' but in navigating between New Orleans, Bayou Sara, Red river and Alexandria, presenting a case of 'interior trade,' wherein the inception, intermediate progress and termination of the voyage were wholly beyond admiralty jurisdiction. On the part of the libellants, it is assumed, that New Orleans is within tide-water, and a doctrine thereupon is applied, drawn from the case of The Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428, that admiralty jurisdiction is sustainable, when the 'inception' of the contract, &c., is thus circumstanced. But that case, we suppose, to establish a converse doctrine. The 'inception,' &c., being there noticed by the court, as not answering to the idea of a navigation 'substantially' byond tide-waters, so as to oust admiralty jurisdiction, and consequently, not sufficient to confer jurisdiction, were alone relied upon as substantially 'a maritime employment.'\n It is not perceived, in what manner the inferences adverse to the jurisdiction below become negatived, or the defective libel aided, through the evidence of a public act making New Orleans a port of entry. Could an analogous law for Shippingport, in Kentucky, have varied the views taken by the court of that case? The general collection law of March 1799,  4, creates various ports of entry and delivery, upon Lake Champlain, Ontario and Lake Erie; and supposing a case similar to the present to be now before the court from the northern district of New York, the force of these laws is not realized, if \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 333]\n\u00a0\n invoked to aid the court in determining admiralty and maritime jurisdiction upon those waters. 'Cases in admiralty do not arise under the constitution and laws of the United States.' American Insurance Co. v. Canter, 1 Pet. 545.\n The pleadings on the part of the claimants are not only sufficient to sustain all the exceptions now taken, but to warrant the inference, that they were taken below and overruled. They plead to the jurisdiction: first, on the ground, that all the owners are residents, &c., which having been overruled, subsequently, a supplemental answer and plea were filed, denying generally all the allegations contained in the libel. Neither the reasons for disallowing the objections to the jurisdiction, if offered, under both of these pleadings, nor the objections themselves, appear; the court below alone noticing that part of the evidence upon which, 'in its judgment,' the real defence of the claimants rested. Under the first point, then, it is believed, that the court will either dismiss the case, as not showing jurisdiction upon the face of the proceedings, or remand the same, for the purpose of settling the facts upon which the jurisdiction must rest, if it is to be sustained.\n The second point made on the part of the appellants is-that the libellants had waived any privilege or lien upon the boat under the laws of Louisiana, and therefore, proceedings 'in rem' were improper. In other words, that the inference is fairly deducible from the case, that it was within the contemplation of the parties, that their contracts should not create a right to 'provisional seizure,' under articles 284 and 298 of the Code of Practice of 1830, p. 104, and article 2748 of the Civil Code.\n It is observed on the part of libellants, that, in this case, extraordinary diligence was sued to enforce a right which would have been lost, had the vessel been permitted to depart without its exercise; and the inference would seem to be suggested, that probably such a state of things was within the contemplation of libellants, when entering into the agreements. It is certainly true, that article 2748, referred to, declares the privilege to cease, if the boat is allowed to depart without exercising the right of seizure. \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 334]\n\u00a0\n But this effect takes place only, if the contract should not have been reduced to writing; and if the amount should not exceed $500, and the contract be reduced to writing, the privilege may be unlimited. Civil Code, art. 2743, 2747. The Curia Philippica, 'quoad' liens or privileges on vessels, is supposed to have been abrogated by articles 3521, 2746 and 2748 of the Louisiana civil code, although referred to as yet subsisting, in a note to Abbott on Shipping, p. 116, (ed. of 1829).\n The reducing the contract to writing, may then be fairly taken as expressing the intention of the parties, that the right to a provisional seizure should be wholly suspended, but the right preserved until the return of the vessel, and to be exercised only in the event of a failure of personal responsibility on the part of claimants, to which, by the terms of the contract of 19th October, the libellants alone think proper to look. That full reliance must have been placed in the immediate return of the Planter to New Orleans, is apparent, from the fact of her ownership and commercial employment there, as well as by the evidence upon the record, showing New Orleans to have been the inception and terminus, after her voyage upon the rivers throughout the interior of the country. And as conclusively affirming this view of the intention of the libellants, is the further fact, evidenced by the contract of the 19th October, of extending a credit of $275, forming a portion of the aggregate sum, to one month after the Planter should have been launched, set afloat and delivered, ready to receive a cargo-an evident suspension of the right to provisional seizure, until after the Planter must have left the jurisdiction of the court, showing clearly that such an understanding existed between the parties, as justifies an application of the principle in the note to Raitt v. Mitchell, 4 Camp. 150, and which is conceded to be entirely compatible with the laws of Louisiana. The construction placed upon the contract of 19th October by the libellants, limits it to 'thirty days after the vessel should be set afloat;' but it is presumed, this limitation will not be sanctioned, and when the whole contract is brought \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 335]\n\u00a0\n into notice, and its parts viewed in connection, that construction contended for by the appellants, must be affirmed. Under the second point, then, it is admitted, that superadding to other corroborating circumstances, the extension of credit for a portion of the aggregate amount involved, to a period after the right to provisional seizure could have been exercised, brings the case within the doctrine of Raitt v. Mitchell, 4 Camp. 150.\n The third point relied upon by the appellants is, that the decree rendered is erroneous. In support of this position, Mr. Morton went into a particular examination of the evidence. This part of the argument is stated and examined in the opinion of the court. The decree rendered is further erroneous, in that it directs $475, charged in the account of libellants for drawing the boat out of the water, to be paid to them; of which sum, $275, by the express terms of the contract of 19th October, were not demandable, until 'one month after the libellants had delivered the Planter afloat, and ready to receive a cargo.' [Here the counsel went into a particular examination of the evidence.]\n The regulation of the subject of 'liens or privileges,' and provisional seizure, by the laws of Louisiana, will be found mainly to have in view the internal trading navigation of the country, from New Orleans. Art. 284 of the Code of Practice of 1800, which is a comment upon Art. 2748 of the Civil Code, has alone reference to 'water-craft within the state,' and Art. 289 of the same, after dealing much in detail upon 'lien and provisional seizure of ships, vessels or water-craft, navigating within the state,' in a separate section, and as an exception to the general purview and scope of the legislation, further provides, that 'such seizure may be made 'even' of ships or vessels trading out of the state,' and their laws appear to have had in view, among other subjects, 'the intricate matters of dispute, involved with the peculiar internal steamboat navigation from New Orleans, by affording various aids and facilities, susceptible of being adapted to most of the difficulties that would arise, and of which aids their courts have express power \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 336]\n\u00a0\n to avail themselves. Thus, from Art. 441 to 461 of the Code of Practice of 1830, are recognised, 'experts,' persons versed in the knowledge either of a science, an art, or a profession, selected in order to give their opinion, on some point or question, on which the decision of a cause depends.' Also, 'auditors' of accounts, 'judicial' arbitrators, &c., whose detailed services are therein fully enumerated; but none of whom, it is supposed, could be required to act by the district court of the United States, however essential to the elucidation of a cause.\n From the decisions of the inferior tribunals, invested with cognisance of these cases, the right of appeal, and a speedy final determination of the appellate court is carefully provided for by art. 570 to 603 of the Code of Practice for Louisiana of 1830.\n In conclusion, it is submitted that, if the inference be not decidedly adverse to the jurisdiction below, upon the face of the proceedings, yet important facts, identified with that jurisdiction, appear of so doubtful and unsettled a character, as to render it proper to remand the case for a satisfactory establishment of those facts. That, although it should be considered that proceedings below 'in rem' were proper, yet material errors having been obviously incorporated with the decree, renders its enforcement impossible, and makes it now essential for the ends of justice, that the whole subject be remanded for that full re- investigation, through which those ends can alone be attained.\n Livingston, for the appellees, stated:-The main objection to the decree in this case is, that the district court of Louisiana, as a court of admiralty, had no jurisdiction of the case. The libellants contend for the jurisdiction, on the privilege granted by general maritime law; and on the express lien given by the laws of the state. 1. The general maritime law. Cases are abundant to show that ship-wrights have a privilege on the ship for repairs and a right to enforce it. Roll. Abr. 533; 1 Pet. Adm. 227, 233. \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 337]\n\u00a0\n 2. The laws of the state give the privilege, without reducing the agreement to writing, as is required in other cases. Louisiana Civ. Code, art. 2748.\n It is argued, that a state law cannot give jurisdiction to a court of the United States. In one sense, this is true: a state law cannot extend such jurisdiction, but they may create a right which can only be enforced by such a court. For instance, by the general admiralty law, a master of a ship cannot sue in the admiralty for his wages, by a libel on the ship, because, by the maritime law, he has no lien on the vessel. But suppose a state law to give such lien for all contracts made with the owners in the state, the maritime court of the United States, it is apprehended, would take cognisance of the case, and enforce the law. This, it is acknowledged, would not be done, unless the case made by the state is a maritime contract. Is this such an one? In the case of The Jefferson, 10 Wheat. 428, the mariners could not sue in the district court, because the service, in its inception, progress and termination, was above the ebb and flow of the sea; the inference then is plain, that if the contract and service had, either in the beginning, end, or any intermediate point, been within the ebb and flow of the sea, the decision would have been different. In the present case, the contract was made, the work begun and completed in a seaport, where there is a regular flux and reflux whenever the river is in its ordinary state.\n Should it be objected, that it does not appear, that the steamboat in question was intended, after her repair, to navigate within the ebb and flow the answer is, first, that the presumption must be, that she was intended to navigate to and from the place where her owners resided and where she was repaired; that, at any rate, the inception of her first voyage must be from the sea-port where she was. Whether to go on the coasting trade by sea to Mobile, Pensacola, or the intermediate places, or to ply between the sea and the port, is at least as probable as that she was for the interior trade. Nor was it necessary for the libellants to state this. In a libel for repairs of a vessel, it is sufficient to describe it by the name given to vessels of that class, as ship, schooner , & c., without averring that the repairs were intended to enable her to \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 338]\n\u00a0\n prosecute a sea voyage; yet vessels of all descriptions sometimes navigate waters above the flux and reflux of the sea. So, in the present case, it was sufficient to call the vessel, on which the repairs were done, a steamboat; for steamboats are as frequently, and perhaps more so, employed on tide-water, as above it. If the exception were material, it ought to have been made by the answer; but here, the objection in the answer is merely to the person of the libellants.\n If it should be objected, that the fact of New Orleans being within the ebb and flow of the sea, is not in evidence, the answer is, that there are notorious facts with which courts are supposed to be conversant, and of which they will take notice without further proof. Thus in the case of La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 296, the court takes official notice of the situation of Sandy Hook; and in the case from 20 Johns., cited by the defendant, they assume, in like manner, that Salmon river is a fresh-water river, and that it has no flux and reflux. In the case before the court, there is moreover the evidence of a public act, making New Orleans a port of entry and delivery.\n The second error assigned in the printed statement is, that the libellants had waived any privilege or lien on the steamboat, by the laws of Louisiana. If this were made out, it would not affect the right of the libellants, under the law maritime. But it is not perceived, that there is any evidence of such waiver. The article which gives the privilege declares, that it shall be lost, if the party suffer the vessel to depart, without exercising the right; and this is the only condition. But in this case, extraordinary diligence was used, and the libel calls for the immediate interposition of the court to prevent the departure. The vessel crossed the river from the shipyard, on the 8th of December, the libel was filed on the 10th, and the seizure made on the 11th of the same month.\n That an express contract for a specific sum is not a waives of the privilege, is proved by the case cited by the defendant from 4 Camp. 150. Such a rule could only have been made, by using the word credit in a sense in which it was not employed. The workman may be said to perform his labor on the credit of the owner, when he takes his promise for a certain \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 339]\n\u00a0\n sum, to be paid in cash on the finishing of the work; and in this sense the rule applies, and was considered an implied waiver of the privilege. In the case before the court, there are two different contracts, both written. By the first, for certain specified repairs, the owners agree, 'in the name of the boat,' to pay in cash $1150; by the second, it being found it would be necessary to haul up the boat, $475 were agreed to be paid for that service, $200 in cash, and $275 in thirty days ufter the boat should be set afloat; and it is further agreed, that the libellants should caulk and repair the boat so that she shall not leak, to be paid for as soon as the account shall be approved. Here, it will be observed, that no term of time was given for any part, except the $275 for hauling up the boat; this was to be paid thirty days after the boat was set afloat. When that happened, does not appear. She came over to the town side of the river, on the 8th of December, but when she was launched, was not said. Part of the $1500 paid may then be reasonably imputed to this balance of $ 275, because the debt for the extra repairs was not due until they were finished, and it appears they were not finished until the suit was brought. Where, then, there are two debts, one already payable, the other not, a sum paid without designation shall be imputed to that which is due. Civil Code, article 2162. Therefore, this part of the debt, on which credit was given, being extinguished, no question can arise as to the lien for the balance.\n There remain now only the objections to the sum allowed. On this point, the court is referred to the full and conclusive testimony offered by the libellants, that all the materials and workmen they furnished were necessary; that they were actually furnished; that they are not overcharged; that the work was carried on under the inspection of the master, and was acknowledged to have been executed to his satisfaction.\n\n THOMPSON, Justice, delivered the opinion of the court.\n This case comes up from the district court of the United \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 340]\n\u00a0\n States for the eastern district of Louisiana. The proceedings in the court below were in rem against the steamboat Planter, to recover compensation for repairs made upon the boat.\n The libel states, that Howard & Varion, ship-wrights, residing in the city of New Orleans, had found materials and performed certain work on the steamboat Planter, for which the said steamboat her owners were justly indebted to them in the sum of $2193.35; and alleges, that by the admiralty law, and the laws of the state of Louisiana, they have a lien and privilege upon the boat, her tackle, apparel and furniture, for the payment of the same; and prays admiralty process against the boat, and that the usual monition may issue. The appellants afterwards appeared in court and filed their claim and plea, alleging that they are citizens of Louisiana, and residing in the city of New Orleans, and that they are the sole and lawful owners of the steamboat Planter; and alleging further, that the libellants are also citizens of the same state, and that the court had no jurisdiction of the case. The plea to the jurisdiction of the court was overruled, and a supplemental and amended claim and answer filed, denying all and singular the facts set forth in the libel; and by consent of parties, an order of court was entered, that the testimony of the witnesses for the respective parties be taken before the clerk of the court, and read in evidence upon the trial, subject to all legal exceptions; and upon the hearing of the cause, the court decreed, that the claimants should pay to the libellants $2193. 35, and costs of suit. An appeal to this court was prayed and allowed.\n Upon the argument here, the following points have been made. 1. It does not appear upon the proceedings, that the court below had jurisdiction of the case. 2. That the libellants had waived any privilege or lien upon the steamboat, under the law of Louisiana, and therefore, proceedings in rem were improper. 3. If the court had jurisdiction, the decree is erroneous on the merits. \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 341]\n\u00a0\n The want of jurisdiction in the district court is not put on the ground set up in the plea in the court below, that all the parties were citizens of the same state. This has been very properly abandoned here, as entirely inapplicable to admiralty proceedings in the district court. But it is said, that it does not appear upon the face of the proceedings, that the cause of action properly belonged to admiralty jurisdiction. There can be no doubt, that it must appear from the proceedings, that the court had jurisdiction of the case. The proceeding is in rem against a steamboat, for materials found and work performed in repairing the vessel, in the port of New Orleans, as is alleged in the libel, under a contract entered into between the parties for that purpose. It is, therefore, a maritime contract; and if the service was to be performed in a place within the jurisdiction of the admiralty, and the lien given by the local law of the state of Louisiana, it will bring the case within the jurisdiction of the court.\n By the Civil Code of Louisiana, article 2748, workmen employed in the construction or repair of ships and boats enjoy the privilege established by the code, without being bound to reduce their contracts to writing, whatever may be their amount; but this privilege ceases, if they have allowed the ship or boat to depart, without exercising their right. The state law, therefore, gives a lien, in cases like the present. In the case of The General Smith, 4 Wheat. 438, it is decided, that the jurisdiction of the admiralty, in such cases, where the repairs are upon a domestic vessel, depends upno the local law of the state. Where the repairs have been made, or necessaries furnished to a foreign ship, or to a ship in the ports of a state to which she does not belong, the general maritime law gives a lien on the ship as security, and the party may maintain a suit in the admiralty to enforce his right. But as to repairs or necessaries in the port or state to which the ship belongs, the case is governed altogether by the local law of the state, and no lien is implied, unless it is recognised by that law. But if the local law gives the lien, it may be enforced in the admiralty.\n It is said, however, that the place where these services were performed was not within the jurisdiction of the admiralty. \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 342]\n\u00a0\n The services in this case were performed in the port of New Orleans, and whether this was within the jurisdiction of the court or not, will depend upon the fact, whether the tide in the Mississippi ebbs and flows as high up the river as New Orleans. This is a question of fact, and it is not undeserving of notice, that although there was a plea to the jurisdiction of the court interposed, the objection was not set up. Had it been put in issue, the evidence would probably have removed all doubt upon that question; not having been set up, it affords an inference that the objection could not have been sustained by proof.\n But we think we are authorized judicially to notice the situation of New Orleans, for the purpose of determining whether the tide ebbs and flows as high up the river as that place. In the case of The Apollon, 9 Wheat. 374, it is said by this court, that it has been very justly observed at the bar, that the court is bound to take notice of public facts and geographical positions; and in the case of The Steamboat Thomas Jefferson, the libel claimed wages earned on a voyage from Shippingport, in the state of Kentucky, up the river Missouri, and back again to the port of departure. And the court say, that the voyage, not only in its commencement and termination, but in all its intermediate progress, was several hundred miles above the ebb and flow of the tide, and therefore, in no just sense, can the wages be considered as earned in a maritime employment. It is fairly to be inferred, that the court judicially noticed the fact, that the tide did not ebb and flow, within the range of voyage upon which the services were rendered, as there is no intimation of any evidence before the court to establish the fact.\n It cannot certainly be laid down as a universal, or even as a general, proposition, that the court can judicially notice matters of fact. Yet it cannot be doubted, that there are many facts, particularly with respect to geographical positions, of such public notoriety, and the knowledge of which is to be derived from other sources than parol proof, which the court may judicially notice. Thus, in the case of the United States v. La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297, the court judicially noticed the geographical position of Sandy \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 343]\n\u00a0\n Hook. And it may certainly take notice judicially of like notorious facts, as that the bay of New York, for instance, is within the ebb and flow of the tide.\n The appellants' counsel has referred the court to Stoddard's Louisiana, 164, for the purpose of showing that the tide does not ebb and flow at New Orleans; but we think it affords a contrary conclusion. The author says, 'the tides have little effect upon the water at New Orleans; they sometimes cause it to swell, but never to slacken its current.' No distinction has ever been attempted in settling the line between the admiralty and common-law jurisdiction, growing out of the greater or less influence of the tide. So far as that admiralty jurisdiction depends upon locality, it is bounded by the ebb and flow of the tide; and if the influence of the tide is at all felt, it must determine the question. No other certain and fixed rule can be adopted; and in determining this, we must look at the ordinary state of the water, uninfluenced by any extraordinary freshets. The authority of Mr. Stoddard goes to show that the tides have some effect upon the water at New Orleans; they cause it to swell, but not so much as to slacken the current. In the case of Rex v. Smith, 2 Doug. 441, it became a question, whether the sea could properly be said to flow above London bridge. It was contended, that the tide beyond that limit was occasioned by the pressure and accumulation backwards of the river water. Lord MANSFIELD said, a distinction between the case of the tide occasioned by the flux of sea water, or by the pressure backwards of the fresh water of a river, seemed entirely new. We think, that although the current in the Mississippi, at New Orleans, may be so strong as not to be turned backwards by the tide, yet if the effect of the tide upon the current is so great as to occasion a regular rise and fall of the water, it may properly be said to be within the ebb and flow of the tide.\n It has been argued on the part of the appellant, that the evidence shows, that this steamboat was to be employed in navigating waters beyond the ebb and flow of the tide, and therefore, not employed in the maritime service. In the case of The Steamboat Jefferson, the court said, there is no doubt, the \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 344]\n\u00a0\n jurisdiction exists, although the commencement or termination of the voyage may happen to be at some place beyond the reach of the tide. The material consideration is, whether the service is essentially a maritime service, and to be performed substantially on the sea or on tidewater. All the service in the case now before the court was at New Orleans; and the first voyage, at all events, was to commence from that port. The objection, therefore, to the jurisdiction of the court cannot be sustained.\n\n 2. \nThe second exception is founded on a supposed waiver of any privilege or lien, and that the appellees trusted alone to the personal responsibility of the owners of the steamboat. To determine this question, it becomes necessary to look at the contracts under which the repairs were made. The first bears date on the 11th of September 1830, by which certain specified repairs were to be made, for which the appellants stipulated to pay $1150. No time is fixed for the payment. The repairs contemplated by this contract were such only as could be made without hauling up the boat. In the progress of the work, however, it was discovered, that more repairs were necessary than had been supposed, and which could not be made, without hauling up the boat. And on the 19th of October 1830, another contract was entered into, by which the owners agreed to pay $475 for hauling up the boat, $200 of which was to be paid in cash, and the balance in one month after the boat shall be launched and set afloat. The boat was then to be repaired under the instruction of Captain Jarreau, the work to be paid for, when the account shall be approved by Captain Jarreau. The boat to be repaired and delivered afloat by the 20th November, ready to receive a cargo; the appellees were to allow $25 a day for each day they retarded the delivery.\n An express contract having been entered into between the parties, under which these repairs were made, is no waiver of the lien, unless such contract contains stipulations inconsistent with the lien, and from which it may fairly be inferred, that a waiver was intended, and the personal responsibility of the party only relied upon. Express contracts are generally made \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 345]\n\u00a0\n for freight and seamen's wages, but this has never been supposed to operate as a waiver of a lien on the vessel for the same. There are certainly some of the older authorities which would seem to give countenance to the doctrine, that an express contract operated as a waiver of the lien; but whatever may have been the old rule on the subject, it is settled, at the present day, that an express contract for a specific sum is not, of itself, a waiver of the lien, but that to produce that effect, the contract must contain some stipulations inconsistent with the continuance of such lien, or from which a waiver may fairly be inferred. Hutton v. Bragg, 2 Marsh. 339; 4 Camp. 145, and the cases cited in note.\n Applying these rules to the case before us, we can discover nothing ( except as to $275, the balance for haulting out the boat, which will be noticed hereafter) inconsistent with the right of a lien, or indicating any intention to waive it. In the first contract, no time is fixed for the payment of the $1150; it became payable, therefore, as soon as the work was completed. And the repairs under the second contract were to be paid for as soon as the account was approved by Captain Jarreau. There is nothing, therefore, from which it can be inferred, that any time of credit was to be allowed. The balance of $275, for hauling out the steamboat, stands upon a footing a little different. That was to be paid in one month after the boat was launched and set afloat. A credit was here given: and a credit, too, beyond the time when, in all probability, the boat would have left the port of New Orleans; for it can hardly be supposed, that it would have taken thirty days to load her. And by the Civil Code of Louisiana, Art. 2748, the privilege ceases, if the ship or boat is allowed to depart without exercising the right. As to this sum, therefore, the decree is erroneous.\n\n 3. \nThe principal ground of complaint, under the third point made at the bar, is, that the appellants have been made to pay twice for some part of the work. That is, that part of the work which was to be done under the first contract, and for which they were to pay $1150, has \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 346]\n\u00a0\n been charged under the second contract. There is certainly some confusion growing out of the manner in which this work was carried on under the different contracts. The work which was to be performed under the first, was not completed, when the second was entered into, and both being carried on at the same time, might very easily occasion some mistake. And in addition to this, there was, under the first contract, some extra work to be done and paid for, over and above the stipulated sum of $1150, which rendered it still more difficult to keep the accounts for materials and labor under the different contracts, separate and distinct. The evidence was taken in writing, out of court, and no opportunity afforded for explanation upon these points. The district judge, feeling the difficulties growing out of these circumstances, ordered Wilson, one of the witnesses whose deposition had been taken and read in evidence, to appear and answer in open court. He was the clerk of the appellees, who had kept an account of the timber used and work performed; and on his examination, he swore, that all the charges and items for work done, in the account of the libellants, were over and above the work done under the first contract for $1150. That the libellants had hands at work at the repairs, under the contract, and the extra work, at the same time. That there is not a day's work, nor a foot of plank, charged in the account which was to be done under the first contract. This testimony leaves no reasonable doubt of the correctness of the account. By the second contract, payment was to be made, when the account was approved by Captain Jarreau; no formal approval appears to have been made; but he was a part-owner, and superintended the repairs, and one of the witnesses says, he was present when the account was presented to Captain Jarreau; who said, he was not surprised at it, because there was a great deal more work than he had any idea of; and that he did not think, at first, that she required so much. This, although not a direct, was an implied approval of the account.\n The delay in not delivering the boat to the appellants by the time specified in the contract, was occasioned by her unexpected state and condition, and the extent of repairs required. \n\n[32 U.S. 324, 347]\n\u00a0\n And besides, the delivery at the time mentioned in the contract, was dispensed with by Captain Jarreau.\n Upon the whole, we are of opinion, that the decree of the district court, as to the $275, must be reversed, and in all other repects affirmed.\n THIS cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel: On consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this court, that the decree of the said district court as to the $275 is erroneous and should be reversed, and that in all other respects the said decree should be affirmed: Whereupon, it is ordered, adjudged and decreed by this court that the decree of the said district court in this cause, as to the balance of $275 for hauling out the steamboat, be and the same is hereby reversed, and that the said decree, in all other respects, be and the same is hereby affirmed; and it is further ordered, that each party pay his own costs in this court. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See note to The General Smith, 4 Wheat. 444. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] As to what amounts to a waiver of the lien for repairs, see The Medora, 2 W. & M. 92; Murray v.

St. Augustine of Florida, on the 31st December 1815.\n JUAN PERCHEMAN.\n St. Augustine, 31st December 1815. The preceding petition is granted.\n\n\n ESTRADA.\n\n\n I, Don Robert McHardy, an inhabitant of this province, and appointed surveyor, by decree of this government, rendered on the 31st December 1815 in behalf of the interested party, do certify, that I have surveyed for Don Juan Percheman, lieutenant of the Havana dragoons, a tract of land containing two thousand acres, situated on the south side of Ockliwaha, and is conformable in all its circumstances to the following plat. In testimony whereof, I sign the present, in St. Augustine of Florida, on the 20th of August 1819.\n R'T McHARDY.\n The petitioner proceeded to state, that his claim to said tract of land so claimed by him, was submitted to the examination of the board of commissioners appointed under and in virtue of an act of the congress of the United States of America, entitled 'an act for ascertaining claims and titles to lands in the territory of Florida, and to provide for the survey and disposal of the public lands in Florida,' passed the 3d day of March 1823. And that the land so claimed by him, and situated as aforesaid, within the territory of Florida, and within the jurisdiction \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 57]\n\u00a0\n of this honorable court, as aforesaid, was embraced by the treaty between Spain and the United States of the 22d of February 1819; that his claim to said land had not been finally settled, under the provisions of the act of the congress of the United States, entitled 'an act supplementary to the several acts providing for the settlement and confirmation of private land- claims in Florida,' passed the 23d day of May 1828, or of any of the acts to which the said last-recited act is supplementary; and that the claim of the petitioner to the said land had not been reported by the said commissioners appointed under any of the said acts of congress, or any other, or by the register and receiver acting as such, under the several acts of the congress of the United States in such case made and provided, as ante-dated or forged, and that the said claim had not been annulled by the aforesaid treaty between Spain and the United States, nor by the decree ratifying the same. Wherefore, he prayed, that the validity of his claim to said land might be inquired into, and decided upon, by the court, and that, in pursuance of an act of congress for that purpose, in that case made and provided, the United States be made a party defendant to this petition, and that process, &c.\n On the 2d of October, the attorney of the United States for the district of East Florida filed an answer to the petition of Juan Percheman, in which it is stated, that on the 28th of November 1823, he, the said Juan Percheman, sold, transferred and conveyed to one Francis P. Sanchez, all his right, title and interest in the tract of land claimed by him; which, the answer asserted, appeared by a copy of the conveyance annexed to the action, and that he had not, at the time of the filing of his petition, any right, title or interest in the land. The answer admitted, that the claim of the said Francis P. Sanchez to the said tract of land was duly presented to the register and receiver of the district, while they were acting as a board of commissioners to ascertain titles to land in East Florida; and averred, that the said claim was finally acted upon and rejected by the said register and receiver, while lawfully acting as aforesaid, as appeared by a copy of their report thereon, annexed to the answer. The United States further said, that the tract of land claimed \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 58]\n\u00a0\n by the petitioner contains a less quantity than 3500 acres, to wit, but 2000 acres, by the showing of the petitioner himself, and that the court had no jurisdiction in the case, nor could any court exercise jurisdiction over the claim against the United States. The answer submitted, that if the Governor Estrada did make the grant or concession set forth by the petitioner, at the time, 'and in the manner alleged in the said petition of bill of complaint, he made it contrary to the laws, ordinances and royal regulations of the government of Spain, which were then in force in East Florida, on the subject of granting lands, and without any power or authority to do so, and that the said grant was, therefore, null and void; and that the right and title to said tract of land, consequently, vested in the said United States, as will more fully appear by reference to the laws, ordinances and royal regulations aforesaid.'\n The proceedings of the register and receiver on the claim of Francis P. Sanchez, referred to in the answer, were as follows:\n'This is a certificate of Thomas de Aguilar, that in December 1815, Estrada granted Don Juan Percheman, cornet of squadron of dragoons, for services, two thousand acres of land, at a place called Ockliwaha, on the St. John's river. In 1819, Percheman sold to Sanchez. In the memorial of the claimant to this board, he speaks of a survey made by authority in 1819. If this had been produced, it would have furnished some support to the certificate of Aguilar. As it is, we reject the claim.'\n\n The petitioner, by an amended petition, filed on the 14th of December 1830, stated, that the register and receiver of the United States for East Florida, in their final report on the land-claims, transmitted on the 12th December 1828, to the secretary of the treasury, reported the claim of the petitioner as rejected, on the ground, that the claim depended on a certificate only of Don Thomas Aguilar, notary of the Spanish government in East Florida; and he averred, that his claim depended on an original grant on file in the office of the public archives of East Florida, a certified copy of which was filed with the petition in the court, dated 8th December 1815.\n The amended petition also stated, that the sale made by him \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 59]\n\u00a0\n of the tract of land described in the original petition, was a conditional sale, and no more. It also stated, that the register and receiver further reported, that the survey of the tract of land, made by the authority of the Spanish government, was not produced to them; but the petitioner averred the contrary, for that the survey was filed with the claim, and was before them, when they examined the same; for the truth of which averment, a certificate from the keeper of the office of archives was filed with the amended petition.\n On the hearing of the case before the supreme court for the district of East Florida, the claimant, by his counsel, offered in evidence, a copy from the office of the keeper of public archives, of the original grant on which this claim was founded; to the receiving of which in evidence, the said attorney for the United States objected, alleging that the original grant itself should be produced, and its execution proved, before it could be admitted in evidence, and that the original only could be received in evidence; which objection, after argument from the counsel, was overruled by the court, and the copy from the office of the keeper of the public archives, certified according to law, was ordered to be received in evidence. And the court further ordered, that though, by the express statute of this territory, copies are to be received in evidence, yet, in cases where either the claimant or the United States shall suggest that the original in the office of the keeper of the public archives is deemed necessary to be produced in court, on motion therefor, a subpoena will be issued, by order of the court, to the said keeper, to appear and produce the said original in court for due examination there.\n The court proceeded to a decree in the case, and adjudged, that the claim of the petitioner as presented was within its jurisdiction-'that the grant is valid, that it ought to be, and by virtue of the statute of the 26th of May 1830, and of the late treaty between the United States and Spain, it is confirmed.' The United States appealed to this court.\n The case was argued by Taney, Attorney-General, for the United States; and by White, for the appellee. \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 60]\n\u00a0\n For the United States, it was contended:-1. That the copy of the grant and other proceedings produced by the petitioner, were not admissible in evidence, but the original papers ought to have been produced. 2. That the court had not jurisdiction of the case, under the act of congress of May 26th, 1830; the claim in question having been finally acted upon and rejected by the register and receiver. 3. If the court had jurisdiction of the claim, the suit could be maintained only by Francis P. Sanchez, to whom Percheman had conveyed his interest; and the court erred in confirming and decreeing the land to Percheman. 4. That if these points are against the United States, the authority exercised by the Spanish governor in making the grant to the appellee, was not within the royal order of the king of Spain.\n\n 1. \nAs to the first point, the admissibility in evidence of certified copies of the grant and other proceedings, the attorney-general cited the act of congress of May 26th, 1824,  4; of May 23d, 1828; and the Laws of Florida of July 3d, 1823,  4.\n\n 2. \nAs to the second point, that the court had not jurisdiction of the case, under the act May 26th, 1830, the claim having been finally acted upon and rejected; he cited the fourth section of that law. The acts cf congress made the decision of the commissioners, and afterwards of the register and receiver, final, in all cases under 3500 acres. For the correctness of this position, he referred to the various provisions of the laws on the subject of the claims to lands in Florida, which are found in the 1st, 4th, 5th and 6th sections of the act of May 8th, 1822; the 2d section of the act of March 3d, 1823; the 4th and 5th sections of the act of February 8th, 1827; and the 4th and 6th sections of the act of May 23d, 1828. The language and provisions of all these laws, he contended, sustain the position, that the decision of the register and receiver upon the claim of the appellee was final, as his claim was within 3500 acres. The act of congress of May 26th, 1824, gave jurisdiction to decide on all claims to lands in Missouri.\n In Arkansas, the jurisdiction was confined to claims not exceeding one league \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 61]\n\u00a0\n square. No argument can, therefore, be drawn in favor of the jurisdiction in Florida, from that given in Missouri. The restrictive words in the act of 1828, are not in the act of 1824; and their introduction shows, that the legislature, warned by experience, did not mean to give the same jurisdiction which it had given before. Nor did the act of 26th of May 1830, mean to extend the jurisdiction beyond that given by the law of 1828. It uses strong words of restriction. It refers to the jurisdiction given by the law of 1828, and not that given by the act of 1824. It is said, that the act of 1830,  4, would be nugatory, according to this construction. If that were the case, it would not alter the plain meaning of the words. The legislature intended to provide for any cases which, in the various legislation on that subject, might, by possibility, be found not to have been finally acted on, and to supersede the necessity of further legislation. The fact that no such case existed, and that there is nothing for it to operate on, and that there were no cases brought to the view of the legislature, for which this section provides, cannot affect its construction. Congress meant to provide for any unforeseen contingency, and any cases unknown or overlooked, which had not been finally acted on.\n\n 3. \nAs to the third point, that if the court had jurisdiction, the claim could only be maintained by Francis P. Sanchez, it was argued, that the provisions of the act of 1824, required that the party having title must file the petition; the language of the section which gives the power to the commissioners to decide is, 'to hear and determine all questions relative to the title of the claimants.' Thus, the title under which a claimant presents himself must be exhibited, and the decision of the commissioners, and afterwards of the register and receiver, must be upon the title. The conveyance of the appellee to Sanchez was absolute; it gave him all the title and rights derived from the grant of the Spanish governor; it made him the legal owner of the tract of land described in the grant; and thus, by him only, or by those holding under him, could a petition be presented, under the provisions of the act of congress. The petition of the appellee was a suit in chancery against \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 62]\n\u00a0\n the United States, by a person who claims the title against every one else, and he must show his title, and establish it as a complete title, before he can be relieved. Act of congress of 1824,  6; Act of 1830,  4. How can land be decreed to one, in a court of chancery, when it appears to the court, that he is not entitled to it, and that another is the owner of it?\n\n 4. \nTo sustain the position that Governor Estrada was not authorized by the royal order of the king of Spain to make the grant to the appellee, it was argued, that the powers of the governor did not extend to the issuing of grants for so large a tract of land as that claimed by the petitioner in this case. The royal order of March 29th, 1815 (White's collection of Land Laws 248), the letter of Governor Kindelan to the captain-general of Cuba (White's Collection of Land Laws 247), were cited. Also, United States v. Arredondo, 6 Pet. 727-8.\n White, for the appellee.-The appellee, who was petitioner in the court below, obtained a decree of confirmation to his claim of two thousand arpens of land in East Florida. From that decree, the United States have appealed, and the grounds upon which that appeal was taken, have been explained by the attorney-general. This case is one of great importance, because it involves a principle common to a number of others, and more especially, because the honor and good faith of the government of the United States.\n The title set up by the petitioner, an officer in the service of the king of Spain, is admitted to be genuine. It was made by the governor of East Florida, in pursuance of a royal order promulgated in 1815. It was made to one of the officers, specially designated as a person intended to be benefited by the royal bounty which dictated the ordinance. The grant was made as a remuneration for services rendered by the claimant to the province, at a time of great peril, occasioned by external invasion and internal insurrection. The grant was made prior to the limitation contained in the treaty, and was presented to the commissioners \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 63]\n\u00a0\n appointed to ascertain claims and titles to land in East Florida. Upon this state of the facts presented on the record, three points will be submitted on the part of the appellee to the consideration of the court, and relied upon in support of the decree of the court below. 1. This title was confirmed by the treaty of the 22d of February 1819. 2. It is not competent for congress to pass any law authorizing any tribunal created under its authority to invalidate such a title. 3. By the act of 1830, this court has jurisdiction of the case.\n The first point involves the construction of the treaty. Whether is the 8th article executory or executed? This requires an examination into the article itself, and the negotiations which led to it. By the treaty of the 22d of February 1819, Spain ceded the Floridas to the United States. The latter acquired these provinces and their appendages in full sovereignty, including all public grounds and edifices, and all vacant lands which were not private property. Article 2d. It was stipulated between the high contracting parties, that all grants made by his Catholic Majesty, or his lawful authorities, before the 24th of January 1818, in the ceded territory, should remain confirmed and acknowledged, in the same manner as they would have been, if the provinces had continued under the dominion of his Catholic Majesty. Article 8th. Further time was given to proprietors who had been prevented from fullfiling the conditions of their grants, by the recent circumstances of the Spanish monarchy, and the revolutions in Europe. The inhabitants of the ceded territory were protected in all their rights, and became citizens of the United States. Articles 5th and 6th.\n Congress has, from time to time, adopted various legislative provisions for the purpose of preserving the national faith, separating private property from the public domain, and securing the individual titles intended to be protected by the treaty. Commissioners were appointed to examine land-claims, with authority to confirm grants not exceeding a certain size, and \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 64]\n\u00a0\n to report those above that limit to congress. When these commissions were dissolved, similar powers were vested in the register and receiver of the land-offices. In some instances, an option was given to the holders of certain grants, to select a league square within their respective concessions, upon condition of surrendering the residue by deed to the United States. Through these and other means, the titles of the smaller proprietors have, for the most part, been definitely adjusted, and the larger claims alone remain for settlement. These, congress, by act of 23d May 1828, authorized the courts of the territory to hear and determine, with an appeal to the supreme court of the United States. Several cases have been adjudicated in the courts below. Decisions have been pronounced, not easily reconcilable, if not at total variance with each other; appeals have been taken, and the questions discussed are now before this court, whose judgment is deeply interesting, not merely to the parties on the record, but the numerous other suitors whose rights, or supposed rights, depend on similar principles.\n One or two considerations of a general nature may here, it is presumed, be not inappropriately introduced. Those who represent the interests of the United States in some of the cases before the court, have thought proper to assume, as one ground of defence, that the confirmation or rejection of these titles is matter essentially of executive or legislative cognisance, and addresses itself exclusively to their discretion. The question, they urge, is a political, not a judicial one, and is equally unfit to be submitted to, and incapable of being decided by, a court. Waiving all considerations of the hardship and mockery of referring claimants under a treaty to a tribunal incompetent to afford them redress-forbearing to touch on the indecorum of a construction which attributes to congress an act of futile or deceptive legislation-it will be enough to say, that this interpretation, it is believed, has been once considered and rejected. Soulard's Case, 4 Pet. 511. The argument, indeed, amounts to little more than this-we have bound ourselves to do what Spain would have done. What that is, we know not; and having referred the question to those who cannot decide it, we will, therefore, do nothing. \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 65]\n\u00a0\n Perfidy often wears the mask of subtlety, as well from shame as cowardice; but it is seldom that the counsellors of bad faith, if they condescend to argue at all, are satisfied with a defence so feeble.\n The act of congress requires the court to examine and decide upon these claims, in conformity with the law of nations, the treaty, and the laws of Spain. It is proposed to consider the subject, in reference to each of these defence so several rules of decision.\n\n 1. \nThe law of nations. It is conceived, that, according to the mitigated rights of war, as now well understood and settled by international law, the lands of individuals are safe, even after conquest, Vatt. lib. 3, c. 13,  200; much less, can a cession, of itself, destroy private rights. Absolute or perfect grants, it is believed, would be protected by the law of nations, independent of the treaty. Some legislative recognition of their validity might indeed be necessary to sustain a suit upon them in our courts, but the national obligation to respect them could hardly be denied. It is in behalf of concessions or inchoate grants, that the stipulations of the treaty were most requisite and important. To the acts of the Spanish government in this respect, nor merely the authority of res adjudicata, such as belongs to all foreign sentences and decrees, was given by the treaty; its effect was to make binding on us, all that would have been valid against Spain; and to oblige us to complete whatever she, in good faith, had begun, but left unfinished. A detailed examination of the maxims of customary international law, as they would bear upon the rights of proprietors of land in Florida, is not called for, in the presence of an express treaty stipulation; and in referring to the law of nations as a rule of decision for the courts, congress perhaps had more expressly in view such part of it as relates to the interpretation of treaties. This will be more conveniently considered under another head.\n\n 2. \nThe treaty. This instrument, it is contended, shall be most liberally construed. Its interpretation is to be sought in the motives and policy of the parties; in their words, and in their acts. \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 66]\n\u00a0\n The leading objects of the United States were, to procure a more convenient and secure frontier; to command the Gulf of Mexcio, the outlet of a large portion of their commerce; to obtain indemnity for their merchants, and to secure themselves against the annoyance they must naturally expect from Florida, in the hands of an enemy, or a false or feeble neutral. It is notorious, that for more than a century, this territory had been a constant source of injury, jealousy and vexation to the adjoining colonies and states. The colony of Georgia was founded as a barrier against the encroachments of the Spaniards; and the refuge and encouragement afforded by the latter to absconding slaves, hostile Indians, and other incendiaries, was a continued cause of complaint, from the settlement of Carolina to the Seminole compaign. In examining the interests and duties of the United States in connection with this subject, it is not as landed proprietors alone that we must regard them. The rage for new settlements, indeed, makes this the chief point among the people, and greatly increases the prejudices against the large grants; but the court is far above the contagion of their example.\n To consider the cession of Florida merely as a land-jobbing transaction, would be doing great injustice to the liberal and enlightened policy which sought this valuable acquisition, with steady calmness, through so long a course of evasion and delay. Yet its value, even in that point of view, is not unworthy ef notice. Thirty-five millions and a half of acres, of which, up to the 30th of June 1828, but little more than a million and a half had been granted or sold (Reports of Committees, H. R. No. 95, 2d session, 20th congress), will surely, after making a most liberal allowance for the satisfaction of unsettled land-claims, more than refund to us the five millions paid to our own merchants. Computing but thirty millions at the minimum price to which it is proposed to reduce the refuse lands, the United States will receive back their principal from the soil, and obtain the sovereignty for nothing.\n It is admitted, that in the cession of a province, the disposition of the inhabitants and their effects is a question of policy between the parties. To divest them of their rights of property is, however, in modern times, an unheard of cruelty. Usually, \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 67]\n\u00a0\n the option is allowed them of becoming subjects of the new government, or of selling their estates, and removing within a specified period. Such were the terms of cession of this very province, from Spain to Britain, in 1763; and from Britain to Spain, twenty years afterwards. It will be borne in mind by the court, that population rather than land is the want of the United States; that their policy as to naturalization is as liberal as that which the wisest modern philosopher has praised in the greatest of the ancient republics; and that sovereignty, not soil, was the great motive for the acquisition. Our government, it may safely be affirmed, neither contemplated the explusion of the ancient inhabitants, nor any injury to their property. The terms held out in the treaty ceding Louisiana, as well as that by which Florida was acquired, show, that the United States never intended to grasp a barren sceptre, and wave it over a dispeopled territory. The inhabitants were made citizens; the province was to become a state. Can it be imagined, that any rational government would act so unwisely, as to receive into their society a large body of foreigners, endow them with civil rights and political power; and, after rendering them disaffected, by stripping them of their property, leave to these malcontents the protection of an extensive, important and exposed frontier?\n Many of the motives which must have operated on Spain are equally obvious. She naturally wished to extinguish demands, the justice of which had been admitted, while their satisfaction had been evaded, until all the arts of procrastination were exhausted. She might desire to get rid of a useless and expensive appendage; and she must have foreseen, that it would probably be wrested from her as an indemnity, if she trifled much longer with our patience. But in yielding up the inhabitants, with the territory, she would naturally stipulate most favorably for the people she was about to surrender. She did not intend to sacrifice them; their fidelity to her in every vicissitude; the temptations by which they had been assailed; the invasions to which they had been exposed; their sufferings, their constancy, their very helplessness, all pleaded powerfully in their favor. In the eighth article, two parties were stipulating for the \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 68]\n\u00a0\n security and advantage of a third, whom both had the strongest reasons to cherish and protect. It is submitted, therefore, with some degree of confidence, that, so far as the motives and policy of the parties afford a key to the meaning of their words, the construction most favorable to the claimants is permitted to, nay, is enjoined upon, the court.\n Before proceeding to examine the language of the treaty, a few observations on the rules of interpretation may, perhaps, be pardoned. Jurists generally admit that all grants, contracts and stipulations are to be taken most strongly against the grantor. Cooper's Justinian, in note, 601. The words of the party promising are to be regardcd rather than those of the party to whom the promise is made. Vattel, lib. 2, c. 17,  267. Other general rules are to be found in the works of the most esteemed publicists, and must be familiar to the court. Grotius, lib. 2, c. 16, 136; Vatt. lib. 2, c. 17,  270. Among the rest, that interpretation which is drawn from the reason of the act is strongly and safely recommended. Vatt. lib. 2, c. 17,  287. A special rule of construction has, moreover, been deduced from the character of the stipulation itself; hence the distinction between things favorable and things odious-a distinction recognised by Grotius and Vattel. Grotius, lib. 2, c. 16,  10, p. 148; Vattel, lib. 2, c. 17,  300, 301, 303. The difference between the former, and mere acts of liberality prejudicial to the sovereign, is illustrated by the last named author (Vatt. lib. 2, c. 17,  310), in such a manner, as leaves no doubt to which class the provisions of the eighth article belong. What, indeed, can be more clearly entitled to rank among things favorable, than engagements between nations securing the private property of faithful subjects, honestly acquired under a government which is on the eve of relinquishing their allegiance, and confided to the pledged protection of that contry which is about to receive them as citizens?\n This brings us to the words of the treaty. There is a difference between the English and the Spanish versions of the eighth article. Both are equally originals, but surely the justice and liberality of the United States will extend to the claimants the full benefit of either. The first difference is in \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 69]\n\u00a0\n rendering 'concesiones de terrenos,' as grants of land. Concesiones, it is apprehended, is a term much broader than grants, and comprehends all which we, in the technical language of our land-laws, might call entries or warrants of survey or location. The substitution of lawful, in the English, for legitimos, in the Spanish, will be commented on in another place. The residue of the clause, that those grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid, &c., is by no means equivalent to the Spanish phraseology. The latter, fairly rendered, is to this effect: 'All concessions of lands made by his Catholic Majesty, or by his legitimate authorities, before the 24th January 1818, in the aforesaid territories, which his majesty cedes to the United States, shall remain confirmed and acknowledged to the persons in possession of them (i. e. the concessions), in the same manner that they would have been, if the dominion of his Catholic Majesty over these territories had continued.'\n The difference between declaring that these grants shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would have been valid, &c., and saying that all concessions of land shall remain confirmed and acknowledged to the persons in possession of them (i. e. the title-papers), in the same manner that they would have been, & c., is sufficiently obvious and important; the sense is materially different. The English side of the treaty leaves the ratification of the grants executory-they shall be ratified; the Spanish, executed-they shall continue acknowledged and confirmed, quedaran artificados. Quedan signifies remain or continue, and in this sense is used in the last clause of the same article-quedan anuladas y de ningun valor, remain null and of no effect. In the English, possession refers to the lands; in the Spanish, to the grants. The relative ellas agrees with the antecedent concesiones; if it referred to terrenos, the relative would have been ellos. No word equivalent to extent is to be found in the Spanish.\n It has been suposed, with little reason, that the eighth article might be interpreted to confer a discretion, rather than impose an obligation, on the American government. It is one of the admitted rules of construction, that interpretations which \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 70]\n\u00a0\n lead to an absurdity, or render an act null, are to be avoided. Vattel, lib. 2, c. 17,  282, 304. The king of Spain can annul a grant made by himself, without any allegation of surprise or fraud, simply in virtue of his absolute will and sovereign power. It is too late for us to deny that position; we have recognised it by the treaty; the grants to Alagon, Vargas, and Punon Rostro were annulled. By the treaty, we succeed to all the rights of Spain; the concessions made by Spain are to continue valid to the same extent, &c.; but will it be asserted, that, in succeeding to the rights of Spain, we succeed to the right of his Catholic Majesty to annul the grants of his subjects? Can it be pretended, that the provisions of the eighth article were designed only to leave all grants, perfect and inchoate, as completely at the mercy of the American government as they had been at that of the Spanish monarch?\n In attempting to ascertain the true meaning of the parties, it is humbly conceived, we are not confined to the language of the treaty; we may look into the negotiations which preceded it. In this instance, there is a particular propriety in doing so. 'As the instrument of ratification, an assential part of the whole treaty, refers to the history of the negotiation, it lets in the whole of that history, as matter to be adverted to, according to all the strictness of legal argument, in reasoning on the construction of the claim in question. The matter is thus made capable of being argued, as if the question were upon an act of parliament, or private deed, reciting the circumstances under which it was obtained. One might, therefore, rest, as elucidating the case, upon all the authorities, which establish, with respect to private and diplomatic instruments, that however general and comprehensive particular expressions may by, they ought, in their effect, to be confined to the particular object the parties had in view. The reports of the court of chancery in England contain a variety of instances as to the restriction of deeds, however widely expressed, to the particular object of the parties, founded on a review of the circumstances under which they were made. (See Cholmondeley v. Clinton.) It is also observed by Vattel ( 268), that we are to interpret a clause in the utmost latitude that the strict \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 71]\n\u00a0\n and appropriate meaning of the words will admit of, if it appears that the author had in view everything which that strict and appropriate meaning comprehends; but we must interpret it in a more limited sense, when it appears probable that the author did not mean it to extend to everything which the strict propriety of the terms might be made to include.' MS. Opinion of Sir John Joseph Dillon, on Rattenbury's grant.\n A short sketch of the negotiations, with some brief extracts and references, will therefore be submitted. In January 1818, the government of the United States proposed to the Chevalier de Onis to terminate all differences in the following terms: 1. Spain to cede all territory eastward of the Mississippi. 2. The eastern boundary to be the Colorado. 3. Claims for indemnities to be referred to commissioners. 4. The lands in East Florida' and to the Perdido, to be held as security for the indemnities; but no grant subsequent to August 11th, 1802, to be considered valid. 5. Spain to be released from the payment of the debts. ( 2 Lyman's Diplomacy U. States, p. 133.) On the 24th October 1818, Don Luis de Onis proposes to cede the Floridas: 'the donations to sales of land made by the government of his majesty, or by legal authorities, until this time, are nevertheless to be valid.' 1 Executive Papers, 1st sess. 16th cong. 1819-20, doc. 2, p. 25. The secretary of state replies, October 31st, 1818, 'neither can the United States recognise as valid all the grants of land, until this time, and at the same time renounce all their claims for indemnity.' He adverts to the notice given to the government of Spain, that all the grants lately made within those territories (i. e. to Alagon, Vargas, &c.), must be cancelled, unless some other adequate fund should be provided to satisfy the claims of the United States and their citizens. 1 Executive Papers, 1st sess. 16th cong. 1819-20, doc. 2, p. 25. De Onis rejoins, 10th November 1818, 'my second proposal has been admitted by your government, with this modification, that all grants and sales of land made by his Catholic Majesty, or by lawful Spanish authorities in the Floridas, from the year 1802 to the present, shall be null and void. To this modification, in its absolute sense, I cannot assent, inasmuch \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 72]\n\u00a0\n as it is offensive to the dignity and imprescriptible rights of the crown of Spain; which, as the legitimate owner of both the Floridas, had a right to dispose of those lands as it pleased: and further, as the said modification, would be productive of incalculable injury to the bon a fide possessors, who have acquired, settled and improved those tracts of land.' 'The extent of what I can agree to is, that the late grants made by his Catholic Majesty in the Floridas, since the 24th of January last, the date of my first note, announcing his Majesty's willingness to cede them to the United States (the said grants having been made with a view to promote population, cultivation and industry, and not with that of alienating them ), shall be declared null and void, in consideration of the grantees not having complied with the essential conditions of the cessions, as has been the fact.' 1 Ex. Papers, 1st sess. 16 cong. doc. 2, p. 26.\n On the 9th of February 1819, the minister of Spain submitted his project of a treaty. The ninth article, answering to the eighth of the present treaty, is as follows: 'All grants of lands made by his Catholic Majesty, or his legitimate authorities, in the aforesaid territories of the two Floridas, and others which his majesty cedes to the United States, shall be confirmed and acknowledged as valid, excepting those grants which may have been made after the 24th of January of last year, the date that the first proposals were made for the cession of those provinces, which shall be held null, in consideration of the grantees not having complied with the conditions of the cession.' 1 Ex. Papers, 1st cess. 16th cong. doc. 2, p. 37. On the 13th of February 1819, the American secretary offered his counter-project, in which the eighth article proposed stands thus: 'All grants of land made by or in the name of his Catholic Majesty in the aforesaid territories, after the 24th of January 1818, shall be held null, the conditions of the said grants not having been performed by the grantees. All grants made before that date, by his Catholic Majesty, or by his legitimate authorities in the said territories, the conditions of which shall have been performed by the grantees, according to the tenor of \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 73]\n\u00a0\n their respective grants, and none other, shall be confirmed and acknowledged as valid.' 1 Ex. Papers, 1st sess. 16th cong. doc. 2, p. 43.\n In the minute or protocol of conferences preserved by M. Hyde de Neuville, whose good offices were interposed on this occasion, the following entry will be found: 'Art. 8th. This article cannot be varied from what is contained in the chevalier's project, as the object of the last clause therein is merely to save the honor and dignity of the sovereignty of his Catholic Majesty.' 'Note of Mr. Adams thereon.-Agreed, with the following explanation; that all grants of land which shall not be annulled by this convention are valid to the same extent as they are binding on his Catholic Majesty.' 'Remarks of M. de Neuville.-The secretary of state observed to me, that the federal government would, most assuredly, never entertain the idea of disturbing individuals who were vested with a bon a fide title to their property; but, as a treaty ought not to cover fraudulent practices, so no more could be asked of the United States than could be offered by his Catholic Majesty; that being in this case substituted for his majesty, they would scrupulously fulfil their engagements, but that more could not be expected of them.' 'The secretary of state even proposes, if M. de Onis wishes it, that the article shall be inserted in the treaty, as proposed by the minister of Spain, on condition that the above explanation shall be given in the form of a note. The federal government, unwilling to leave anything in a state of doubt or uncertainty, only wishes to place on the most secure footing whatever is just and honorable, and is at the same time perfectly satisfied that his Catholic Majesty neither asks nor wishes more.' 1 Ex. Papers, 1st sess. 16th cong., doc. 2, p. 48.\n The eighth article was finally inserted as it at present stands; but doubts arising whether the recent large grants were effectually excluded by the words of the treaty, Mr. Adams writes to the Chevalier de Onis, on the 10th March 1818, that it was distinctly understood that the grants to Alagon, Varges and Punon Rostro were all annulled by the treaty, as much as if they had been specifically named, and that they will be so \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 74]\n\u00a0\n held by the United States. (1 Ex. Papers, 1st sess. 16th cong., doc. 2, p. 63.) Mr. Adams, on the 14th July 1819, submits to M. de Neuville the following observations on the eighth article: 'M. de Neuville's particular attention is requested to the difference between the two projected articles, because it will recall particularly to his remembrance the point upon which the discussion concerning this article turned. By turning to the written memorandum, drawn up by M. de Neuville himself, of this discussion, he will perceive he has noted that M. de Onis insisted, that this article could not be varied from what was contained in the chevalier's project, as the object of the last clause therein was merely to save the honor and dignity of the sovereignty of his Catholic Majesty.' It was then observed by Mr. Adams, that the honor and dignity of his Catholic Majesty would be saved by recognising the grants prior to the 24th of January, as 'valid to the same extent as they were binding on his Catholic Majesty;' and he agreed to accept the article, as drawn by M. de Onis, with this explanation. (See M. de Neuville's memorandum.) It was on this occasion, that M. de Neuville observed, that, if the grants prior to January 24th, 1818, were confirmed only to the same extent that they were binding on the king of Spain, there were many bon a fide grantees, of long standing, in actual possession of their grants, and having actually made partial settlements upon them, but who had been prevented by the extraordinary circumstances in which Spain had been situated, and the revolutions in Europe, from fulfilling all the conditions of their grants; that it would be very harsh to leave these persons liable to a forfeiture, which might indeed, in rigor, be exacted from them, but which very certainly never would be, if they had remained under the Spanish dominion. It will be remembered by M. de Neuville, how earnestly he insisted upon this equitable suggestion, and how strongly he disclaimed for M. de Onis every wish or intention to cover, by a provision for such persons, any fraudulent grants. And it was then observed by M. de Neuville, that the date assumed, of 24th of January 1818, was not sufficient for guarding against fraudulent grants, because they might be easily ante-dated. It was with \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 75]\n\u00a0\n reference to these suggestions of M. de Neuville, afterwards again strenuously urged by M. de Onis, that the article was finally modified as it now stands in the treaty, declaring all grants subsequent to 24th January 1818, absolutely null, and those of prior date valid, to the same extent only that they would have been binding on the king; but allowing to bond fide grantees, in actual possession, and having commenced settlements, but who had been prevented by the late circumstances of the Spanish nation, and the revolutions in Europe, from fulfilling all the conditions of their grants, time to complete them. The terms of the article accord precisely with the intentions of all the parties to the negotiation, and the signature of the treaty. If the dates of the grants are subsequent to the 24th of January 1818, they are annulled by the date; if prior to that date, they are null, because not included among the prior grants confirmed.' 1 Ex. Papers, 1st sess. 16th cong. pp. 68, 69.\n From all these documents, the clear inference is, that the great subject of anxiety with our negotiator was the large grants to Alagon, Vargas and Punon Rostro. It was against them almost alone that the article was directed. The American government, indeed, at one time, proposed to carry the date back to 1802, by which means they would have excluded the claims of Forbes, Arredondo and others, with whose existence, there is every reason to believe, they were perfectly well acquainted. But this pretension was speedily abandoned. If there appeared a distinct declaration on the part of the American government, that the sole object of the eighth article was to exclude the grants to Alagon, Punon Rostro and Vargas, such declaration, it is apprehended, would be conclusive. It could no longer be deemed just or honorable, to apply the question ordinary and extraordinary to other grants, dated before the 24th January 1818, with a view of extorting from them, by legal subtlety, something which should debar their proprietors the benefits of that very article which was framed solely to admit them, and to exclude others. Yet, it is respectfully submitted, that no express admission of the fact could be stronger than the implication arising from this correspondence. If, however, an explicit avowal on the part of our government will alone be received, we refer to the message of the president to congress, in which \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 76]\n\u00a0\n he tells that body, 'it was the intention of the parties to annul these latter grants, and that clause was drawn for that express purpose and none other.' 1 Ex. Papers, 1st sess. 16th cong. 1819-20, doc. 2, p. 5.\n May we not ask, whether this is the sole purpose to which it is now sought to be applied, and how far it is consistent with justice and good faith, to extend the effect of the clause in question beyond what either of the parties contemplated at the time of its adoption?\n The application of the common-law principle, that a grant may be absolutely void, where the officer issuing it had no authority, is insisted on; and it is asserted, that the royal governors of the Spanish colonies had no power to make sales or donations of the public lands, except in very limited quantitles and under numerous restrictions. An inquiry into the truth of this assertion will be attempted, according to the limited means within our power; and the more readily because of the intimations thrown out by this court in the case of Soulard and Smith. 4 Pet. 511.\n Every fair presumption is against these supposed limitations. Legal or constitutional restrictions upon the power of the king, or his officers, according to our ideas of them, are inconsistent whith the character of the Spanish monarchy. They are hardly comprehensible by a native of that country and have been rejected, together with the constitutional monarchy, by the people of Spain. How is it possible to reconcile limitations of power with the fundamental maxim, 'the will of the prince has the force of a law?' Portions of the royal authority, as arbitrary as that of the king himself, were intrusted to the several governors of provinces, each of whom, within the limits of his own government, was the image of his sovereign, and, in practice, at least, and in popular opinion also, absolute. The only restraints upon his acts were his instructions, and accountability to the king; but the royal instructions, and the residencia, or account on his transactions, which the governor was obliged to give were not properly legal limitations upon his power, but rather directions for the exercise of his discretion, and securities for his good behavior. \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 77]\n\u00a0\n Every nation has its own manner of securing the fidelity of its agents. Free governments are constructed upon the principle of intrusting as little power as possible, and providing against its abuse preventively by all species of checks and limitations. Arbitrary ones proceed upon the principle of bestowing ample powers and extensive discretion, and guarding against their abuse by prompt and strict accuntability and severe punishment. Both have been invented by mankind for purposes of mutual defence and common justice, but the prevading spirit of the one is preventive, of the other vindicatory. How absurd would it be, then, to apply the maxims of the one government to the acts of the other. As well might we judge the life of Pythagoras by the law of the New Testament, or the philosophy of Zoroaster by that of Newton, as subject the administration of a Spanish governor to the test of magna charta, the bill of rights, the habeas corpus act, or the principles of American constitutional law.\n Even the laws of the Indies, obscure, perplexed, and sometimes even unintelligible, as they are, hardly reached across the ocean; and the decline of the Spanish, like that of the Roman empire, was marked by the absolutism of the distant prefects.\n Nor were the offices of captain-general, intendant or sub-delegate, sinecures. Intrusted with the command and defence of remote and exposed possession; often reduced to the greatest extremeties, for the want of money and supplies; neglected by the feeble government of the mother country, they were yet expected to guard the colony, and execute the most rigorous system of monopoly, amid greedy neighbors and an impoverished people. They were frequently obliged to create their own resources; and some idea of their difficulties, and the devotion and address which surmounted them, may be formed by remembering how long the able but cruel Morilla protacted a desperate warfare, amid every species of distress and destitution. Their first duty was to preserve his Catholic Majesty's province, committed to their care; and if they did it, and could only do it by some invasions of the fisc, or dilapidations of the royal domain; does it lie with us to complain of their fidelity to \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 78]\n\u00a0\n him, and vitiate those titles which were devised from a law above all others-necessity? See White's Land Laws, 235; 7 Ex. Doc. 1824-25, p. 2; also, MS. extracts from Col. McKee's correspondence. See also the letter of Gov. Chester to the Earl of Dartmouth, MS. Letter Book, West Florida, 18th Nov. 1775, p. 34.\n This general outline of the treaty, the negotiations which led to it, the objects of the contracting parties, cannot fail to be considered by the court in the adjudication of every case presented to it. If it be considered, as it has been proved and admitted in part, in another case decided at the last term, that the treaty itself operated as a confirmation of every legitimate and valid title which 'emanated from his Catholic Majesty, or his lawful authorities, prior to the 24th of January 1818;' it only remains to be shown, that this was such a title. Juan Percheman was an officer in the Spanish service, at the period of the invasion of that province in 1812-13. He was referred to by name, in the royal dispatch, and this grant was made in absolute property to him, as a remuneration for his services. How is it attempted by the government agents to defeat so just and equitable a claim?\n The first ground taken is, that 'the copy of the grant is not admissible evidence, but the original ought to have been produced and proved. This involves the question, what is a copy, and what an original, under the Spanish government, as defined by the Spanish laws. This is a paper certified by the escribano of government, to be a full copy of the petition and decree of the governor of East Florida. It is, in fact, the original grant. The petition and decree of the governor are preserved in the office of the escribano, are placed there in proper books as composing the diligencias of his office. These papers never go out, any more than the notes of the surveyors, upon which a grant issues in the United States. In this country, the original patent, signed by the governor or president, is delivered to the patentee, and the copy is retained in the office. Now, if we are asked why this is so, the answer is, 'ita lex scripta est.' It is the law and custom of Spain and her provinces; and it would be as reasonable to ask, why \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 79]\n\u00a0\n has she not adopted the common law of England? The decree of the governor has been certified under his seal of office, and the seal and signature proved.\n The second point relied upon by the agents of the United States, to avoid the confirmation of this grant, is, the court has not jurisdiction, the claim having been finally settled by the rejection of the register and receiver. If the title was confirmed by the treaty, which is the supreme law of the land, the United States have no power to create a tribunal 'finally to reject a claim,' without an appeal to this court. Such an act would directly violate the treaty, and must be considered void. The decisions of the commissioners and register and receiver have never been considered final by congress itself. In every report made since the date of the Louisiana treaty upon claims, which the commissioners nominally had power to decide, an act of congress has been deemed necessary to consummate the title.\n There is a case in point, in the very act relating to the report, in which it is contended, that this claim has been finally rejected. The first section of the act of congress to confirm it, provides, that all the cases, except those subsequent to a certain period, are confirmed and approved. Here, the government agents have two horns of a dilemma. If the decrees of this register and receiver, like the laws of the Medes and Persians, are irreversible, it must operate both ways. It will not do, for any honest government to say it is final when in our favor, aliter when against us. If the proposition be maintained, that a register and receiver appointed to sell lands, and who were not selected with reference to their ability to decide those delicate legal questions, have been invested with such extraordinary powers over the rights of individuals; it will follow of course, that all such as were excluded by congress, were improperly excluded, and the decision which bars the hope of redress against this claim, will give confirmation to all those rejected. A contrary doctrine would involve the absurd consequence of the assumption by congress of judicial power, and of its exercise in reversing the decisions of a tribunal vested with \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 80]\n\u00a0\n authority by law to decide in the last resort, or, the language of the attorney-general, 'finally to decide.' The register and receiver never had such a power, and it was not competent to congress to confer it, without a palpable violation of the treaty. The register and receiver never had power to decide this case at all, and consequently, could not have rejected it. The cases which were authorized to be presented to commissioners, divided themselves into two classes, one of which the commissioners decided, subject to the approval of congress, and the other they reported to the secretary of the treasury. This was regulated by the quantity. The act of 1822 required them to decide claims under one thousand acres, and report all over that quantity. The act of 1823 increased the quantity, in certain cases, to three thousand five hundred acres. These specified cases were such as where the owners were in the actual possession and occupation of the land at the date of the treaty. It was intended to give a preference to actual occupants, who have always been deservedly favorites with the congress of the United States. This was a case in which the owner, Juan Percheman, was not in possession at the date of the treaty; and consequently, the register and receiver could only report, and not decide his case. The report was made, and opposite the name of the claimant with a short note was written 'rejected.' In this state, this case was presented to congress. It is evident, that it was not prepared before the register and receiver. This report was made after the act of 1828. That act disposed of all claims under a league square, and referred all over that quautity to the courts for decision.\n This brings us to the question of jurisdiction in this case. It is contended, that the court cannot take jurisdiction of any case under a league square; that is admitted under the act of 1828; this is a very different case. The act of 1830 did not dispose of these cases. A part were referred, by the first section, back to the register and receiver, requiring them to report the evidence. Some were confirmed. This one was rejected, without the power to reject, because it was over one thousand, and under three thousand five hundred acres, without proof of actual possession. The first section of the act of 1830 disposes of certain Spanish claims; the second, of \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 81]\n\u00a0\n conflicting Spanish and British claims; the third, of British claims; the fourth section provides, that 'all the remaining claims which have been presented according to law, and not finally acted upon, shall be adjudicated and finally settled upon the conditions, restrictions and limitations of the act of 1828.' The claim of Percheman was a 'remaining claim, not finally acted upon;' because I have shown it could not be acted upon by the register and receiver. It was one of those which the law declared should be adjudicated upon the principles of the act of 1828. It will be observed by the court, that this act says nothing about the quantity of land.\n The question then arises, which must be decisive of the point of jurisdiction, do the words 'adjudicated and settled upon the conditions, restrictions and limitations' of another law, confine the quantity to the amount authorized by that law? All these relate to the quo modo of the adjudication. The conditions are, that they are to file a bill, conduct their case, &c. The restrictions are, that certain evidence shall be admitted, and certain dates regarded. The limitations, that they shall be presented within a certain time. All these relate to the mode of conducting the cases remaining; this is too plain to require argument.\n The third point relied upon by the United States is, that the land was conveyed by the grantee to F. P. Sanchez. Whether this land belongs to Percheman or Sanchez must be perfectly immaterial to the United States. If confirmed to Percheman, it operates eo instanti as a confirmation to Sanchez. The attempt to hunt up a deed, conditional or absolute, is but an expedient to avoid the trial of the merits of the case, in the favorable decision of which the United States, as a just government, ought to feel as much solicitude as in the performance of the most sacred national obligation. These pleas in abatement and technical niceties may serve to retard the country, impoverish individuals, promote litigation, and embarrass public justice, at the expense of individual rights and public faith; they never can receive the sanction or countenance of this court. If the petition had been filed in the name of Sanchez, and the astuteness of the government agents could have discovered the point, we should have been thrown out of \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 82]\n\u00a0\n court, because possession is necessary to give validity to a deed, and because the seal is to the name of attorney, and not to that of the grantee. Such a deed conveys no title, and might have been excluded. The record shows, however, that the contract was to be void, unless the title was confirmed. The act of congress for 1823, dispenses with the deraignment of title; and this case is to be decided, not only according to 'the treaty,' but the 'proceedings under the same.' That act, being one of the proceedings under the treaty, dispenses with the production of deeds from the grantee; and sub-proprietors have a right to file their petition in the name of the original grantee.\n The last point made by the attorney-general was, that the governor had no right to grant. This question has been raised in every Spanish case. Such a point could not have been expected, in the face of the royal order commanding him to grant to the individual in question by name. This question was settled at the last term; and although an attempt has been made to reverse that decision, by a bill in congress, the judiciary committee put the seal upon it, by a unanimous rejection. Upon the subject of the powers of Spanish governments, the court is furnished with translations from Soloozano's Politica Indiana. This author is one of the most celebrated of the Spanish commentators. His authority was considered unquestionable by Lord ELLENBOROUGH in the court of king's bench, in the trial of the King v. Picton, Governor of Trinidad, 30 State Trials 866.\n\n MARSHALL, Ch. J., delivered the opinion of the court.\n This is an appeal from a decree pronounced by the judge of the superior court for the district of East Florida, confirming the title of the appellee to 2000 acres of land lying in that territory, which he claimed by virtue of a grant from the Spanish governor, made in December 1815. The title laid before the district court by the petitioner, consists of a petition presented by himself to the governor of East Florida, praying for a grant of 2000 acres of land, in the place called Ockliwaha, situated on the margin of St. John's river; which \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 83]\n\u00a0\n he prays for in pursuance of the royal order of the 29th of March 1815, granting lands to the military who were in St. Augustine, during the invasion in the years 1812 and 1813; to which the following grant is attached.\n St. Augustine of Florida, 12th of December 1815. Whereas, this officer, the party interested, by the two certificates inclosed, and which will be returned to him for the purposes which may be convenient to him, has proved the services which he rendered in defence of this province, and in consideration also of what is provided in the royal order of the 29th of March last past, which he cites, I do grant him the two thousand acres of land which he solicits, in absolute property, in the indicated place, to which effect let a certified copy of this petition and decree be issued to him, from the secretary's office, in order that it may be to him in all events an equivalent of a title in form.\n\n\n ESTRADA.\n\n\n In a copy of the grant, certified by Thomas de Aguilar, secretary of his majesty's government, the words 'which documents will at all events serve him as a title in form,' are employed instead of the words 'in order that it may be to him in all events an equivalent of a title in form.'\n The petitioner also filed his petition to the governor, for an order of survey, dated the 31st of December 1815, which was granted on the same day; and a certificate of Robert McHardy, the surveyor, dated the 20th of August 1813, that the survey had been made.\n The attorney of the United States for the district, in his answer to this petition, states, that on the 28th of November 1823, the petitioner sold and conveyed his right in and to the said tract of land to Francis P. Sanchez, as will appear by the deed of conveyance to which he refers; that the claim was presented by the said Francis P. Sanchez to the register and receiver, while acting as a board of commissioners to ascertain claims and titles to land in East Florida, and was finally acted upon and rejected by them, as appears by a copy of their report thereon. As the tract claimed by the petitioner contains less than 3500 acres of land, and had been rejected by the register and receiver acting as a board of \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 84]\n\u00a0\n commissioners, the attorney contended, that the court had no jurisdiction of the case.\n At the trial, the counsel for the claimant offered in evidence, a copy from the office of the keeper of public archives, of the original grant on which the claim was founded, to the receiving of which in evidence the attorney for the United States objected, alleging that the original grant itself should be procured, and its execution proved. This objection was overruled by the court, and the copy from the office of the keeper of the public archives, certified according to law, was admitted. The attorney for the United States excepted to this opinion.\n It appears, from the words of the grant, that the original was not in possession of the grantee. The decree which constitutes the title appears to be addressed to the officer of the government, whose duty it was to keep the originals and to issue a copy. Its language, after granting in absolute property, is, 'for the attainment of which let a certified copy of this petition and decree be issued to him for the secretary's office, in order that it may be to him in all events equivalent to a title is form.' This copy is, in contemplation of law, an original. It appears, too, from the opinion of the judge, 'that by an express statute of the territory, copies are to be received in evidence.' The judge added, that 'where either party shall suggest that the original in the office of the keeper of the public archives, is deemed necessary to be produced in court, on motion therefor, a subpoena will be issued, by order of the court, to the said keeper, to appear and produce the said original for examination.' The act of the 26th of May 1824, 'enabling the claimants of lands within the limits of the state of Missouri and territory of Arkansas to institute proceedings to try the validity of their claims,' in its fourth section, makes it the duty of 'the keeper of any public records who may have possession of the records and evidence of the different tribunals which have been constituted by law for the adjustment of land-titles in Missouri, as held by France, upon the application of any person or persons whose claims to lands have been rejected by such tribunals, or either of them, or on the application of any person interested, \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 85]\n\u00a0\n or by the attorney of the United States for the district of Missouri, to furnish copies of such evidence, certified under his official signature, with the seal of office thereto annexed, if there be a seal of office.' The act of the 23d of May 1828, supplementary to the several acts providing for the settlement and confirmation of private land-claims in Florida, declares, in its sixth section, that certain claims to lands in Florida, which have not been decided and finally settled, 'shall be received and adjudicated by the judge of the superior court of the district within which the land lies, upon the petition of the claimant, according to the forms, rules, regulations, conditions, restrictions and limitations prescribed by (for) the district and claimants in the state of Missouri, by act of congress approved May 26th, 1824, entitled, 'an act enabling the claimants,' &c. The copies directed by the act of 1824 would undoubtedly have been receivable in evidence on the trial of claims to lands in Missouri. Every reason which could operate with congress for applying this rule of evidence to the courts of Missouri, operates with equal force for applying it to the courts of Florida; and a liberal construction of the act of May 23d, 1828, admits of this application. The fourth section of the act of May 26th, 1830, 'to provide for the final settlement of land-claims in Florida,' adopts, almost in words, the provision which has been cited from the sixth section of the act of May 23d, 1828. Whether these acts be or be not construed to authorize the admission of the copies offered in this cause, we think that, on general principles of law, a copy given by a public officer whose duty it is to keep the original, ought to be received in evidence. We are all satisfied, that the opinion was perfectly correct, and that the copies ought to have been admitted.\n We proceed then to examine the decree which was pronounced, confirming the title of the petitioner. The general jurisdiction of the courts not extending to suits against the United States, the power of the superior court for the district of East Florida to act upon the claim of the petitioner, Percheman, in the form in which it was presented, must be specially conferred by statute. It is conferred, if at all, by \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 86]\n\u00a0\n the act of the 26th of May 1830, entitled 'an act to provide for the final settlement of landclaims in Florida.' The fourth section of that act enacts, 'that all the remaining claims which have been presented according to law, and not finally acted upon, shall be adjudicated and finally settled upon the same conditions, restrictions and limitations, in every respect, as are prescribed by the act of congress approved the 23d of May 1828, entitled 'an act supplementary,' &c.\n The claim of the petitioner, it is admitted, 'had been presented according to law;' but the attorney for the United States contended, that 'it had been finally acted upon.' The jurisdiction of the court depends on the correctness of the allegation. In support of it, the attorney for the United States produced an extract from the books of the register and receiver, acting as commissioners to ascertain claims and titles to land in East Florida, from which it appears, that this claim was presented by Francis P. Sanchez, assignee of the petitioner, on which the following entry was made. 'In the memorial of the claimant to this board, he speaks of a survey made by authority in 1819; if this had been produced, it would have furnished some support for the certificate of Aguilar; as it is, we reject the claim.' Is this rejection a final action on the claim, in the sense in which those words are used in the act of the 26th of May 1830?\n In pursuing this inquiry, in endeavoring to ascertain the intention of congress, it may not be improper to review the acts which have passed on the subject, in connection with the actual situation of the person to whom those acts relate. Florida was a colony of Spain, the acquisition of which by the United States was extremely desirable. It was ceded by a treaty concluded between the two powers at Washington, on the 22d day of February 1819. The second article contains the cession, and enumerates its objects. The eighth contains stipulations respecting the titles to lands in the ceded territory.\n It may not be unworthy of remark, that it is very unusual, even in cases of conquest, for the conqueror to do more than to displace the sovereign and assume dominion over the country. The modern usage of nations, which has become law, \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 87]\n\u00a0\n would be violated; that sense of justice and of right which is acknowledged and felt by the whole civilized world would be outraged, if private property should be generally confiscated, and private rights annulled. The people change their allegiance; their relation to their ancient sovereign is dissolved; but their relations to each other, and their rights of property, remain undisturbed. If this be the modern rule, even in cases of conquest, who can doubt its application to the case of an amicable cession of territory? Had Florida changed its sovereign by an act containing no stipulation respecting the property of individuals, the right of property in all those who became subjects or citizens of the new government would have been unaffected by the change; it would have remained the same as under the ancient sovereign. The language of the second article conforms to this general principle: 'His Catholic Majesty cedes to the United States in full property and sovereignty, all the territories which belong to him, situated to the eastward of the Mississippi, by the name of East and West Florida.' A cession of territory is never understood to be a cession of the property belonging to its inhabitants. The king cedes that only which belonged to him; lands he had previously granted, were not his to cede. Neither party could so understand the cession; neither party could consider itself as attempting a wrong to individuals, condemned by the practice of the whole civilized world. The cession of a territory, by its name, from one sovereign to another, conveying the compound idea of surrendering at the same time the lands and the people who inhabit them, would be necessarily understood to pass the sovereignty only, and not to interfere with private property. If this could be doubted, the doubt would be removed by the particular enumeration which follows: 'The adjacent islands, dependent on said provinces, all public lots and squares, vacant lands, public edifices, fortifications, barracks and other building which are not private property, archives and documents which relate directly to the property and sovereignty of the said provinces, are included in this article.' This special enumeration could not have been made, had the first clause of the article been supposed to pass not only the objects thus enumerated, but private property also. The grant \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 88]\n\u00a0\n of buildings could not have been limited by the words 'which are not private property,' had private property been included in the cession of the territory.\n This state of things ought to be kept in view, when we construe the eighth article of the treaty, and the acts which have been passed by congress for the ascertainment and adjustment of titles acquired under the Spanish government. That article, in the English part of it, is in these words: 'All the grants of land made before the 24th of January 1818, by his Catholic Majesty, or by his lawful authorities, in the said territories ceded by his majesty to the United States, shall be ratified and confirmed to the persons in possession of the lands, to the same extent that the same grants would be valid if the territories had remained under the dominion of his Catholic Majesty.'\n This article is apparently introduced on the part of Spain, and must be intended to stipulate expressly for that security to private property which the laws and usages of nations would, without express stipulation, have conferred. No construction which would impair that security further than its positive words require, would seem to be admissible. Without it, the titles of individuals would remain as valid under the new government as they were under the old; and those titles, so far at least as they were consummate might be asserted in the courts of the United States, independently of this article.\n The treaty was drawn up in the Spanish as well as in the English language; both are originals, and were unquestionably intended by the parties to be identical. The Spanish has been translated, and we now understand, that the article as expressed in that language, is, that the grants 'shall remain ratified and confirmed to the person in possession of them, to the same extent,' &c.-thus conforming exactly to the universally received doctrine of the law of nations. If the English and the Spanish parts can, without violence, be made to agree, that construction which establishes this conformity ought to prevail. If, as we think must be admitted, the security of private property was intended by the parties; if this security would have been complete without the article, the United States could have no motive for insisting on the interposition of government in order to give validity to titles which, according \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 89]\n\u00a0\n to the usages of the civilized world, were already valid. No violence is done to the language of the treaty by a construction which conforms the English and Spanish to each other. Although the words 'shall be ratified and confirmed,' are properly the words of contract, stipulating for some future legislative act; they are not necessarily so. They may import that they 'shall be ratified and confirmed,' by force of the instrument itself. When we observe, that in the counterpart of the same treaty, executed at the same, time by the same parties, they are used in this sense, we think the construction proper, if not unavoidable. In the case of Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, this court considered these words as importing contract. The Spanish part of the treaty was not then brought to our view, and we then supposed, that there was no variance between them. We did not suppose, that there was even a formal difference of expression in the same instrument, drawn up in the language of each party. Had this circumstance been known, we believe it would have produced the construction which we now give to the article.\n This understanding of the article must enter into our construction of the acts of congress on the subject. The United States had acquired a territory containing near thirty millions of acres, of which about three millions had probably been granted to individuals. The demands of the treasury, and the settlement of the territory, required that the vacant lands should be brought into the market; for which purpose, the operations of the land-office were to be extended into Florida. The necessity of distinguishing the vacant from the appropriated lands was obvious; and this could be effected only by adopting means to search out and ascertain pre-existing titles. This seems to have been the object of the first legislation of congress. On the 8th of May 1822, an act was passed, 'for ascertaining claims and titles to land within the territory of Florida.' The first section directs the appointment of commissioners for the purpose of ascertaining the claims and titles to lands within the territory of Florida, as acquired by the treaty of the 22d of February 1819. \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 90]\n\u00a0\n It would seem, from the title of the act, and from this declaratory section, that the object for which these commissioners were appointed, was the ascertainment of these claims and titles. That they constituted a board of inquiry, not a court exercising judicial power and deciding finally on titles. By the act 'for the establishment of a territorial government in Florida,' previously passed at the same session, superior courts had been establish in East and West Florida, whose jurisdiction extended to the trial of civil causes between individuals. These commissioners seem to have been appointed for the special purpose of procuring promptly for congress that information which was required for the immediate operations of the land-office. In pursuance of this idea, the second section directs, that all the proceedings of the commissioners, the claims admitted, with those rejected, and the reason of their admission and rejection, be recorded in a well-bound book, and forwarded to the secretary of the treasury, to be submitted to congress. To this desire for immediate information, we must ascribe the short duration of the board. Their session for East Florida was to terminate on the last of June in the succeeding year; but any claims not filed previous to the 31st of May in that year, to be void and of no effect.\n These provisions show the solicitude of congress to obtain, with the utmost celerity, that information which ought to be preliminary to the sale of the plblic lands. The provision, that claims not filed with the commissioners previous to the 30th of June 1823, should be void, can mean only that they should be held so by the commissioners, and not allowed by them. Their power should not extend to claims filed afterwards. It is impossible to suppose, that congress intended to forfeit real titles, not exhibited to their commissioners within so short a period.\n The principal object of this act is further illustrated by the sixth section, which directed the appointment of a surveyor who should survey the country; taking care to have surveyed and marked, and laid down upon a general plan to be kept in his office, the metes and bounds of the claims admitted.\n The fourth section might seem, in its language, to invest the commissioners with judicial powers, and to enable them to \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 91]\n\u00a0\n decide as a court in the first instance, for or against the title in cases brought before them; and to make such decision final, if approved by congress. It directs, that the 'said commissioners shall proceed to examine and determine on the validity of said patents,' &c. If, however, the preceding part of the section to which this clause refers be considered, we shall find in it almost conclusive reason for the opinion, that the examination and determination they were to make, had relation to the purpose of the act, to the purpose of quieting speedily those whose titles were free from objection, and procuring that information which was necessary for the safe operation of the land-office; not for the ultimate decision, which, if adverse, should bind the proprietor. The part of the section describing the claims into the validity of which the commissioners were to examine, and on which they were to determine, enacts, that every person, &c., claiming title to lands under any patent, &c., 'which were valid under the Spanish government, or by the law of nations, and which are not rejected by the treaty ceding the territory of East and West Florida to the United States, shall file, &c.' Is it possible, that congress could design to submit the validity of titles, which were 'valid under the Spanish government, or by the law of nations,' to the determination of these commissioners? It was necessary to ascertain these claims, and to ascertain their location, not to decide finally upon them. The powers to be exercised by the commissioners, under these words, ought, therefore, to be limited to the object and purpose of the act. The fifth section, in its terms, enables them only to examine into and confirm the claims before them. They were authorized to confirm those claims only which did not exceed one thousand acres.\n From this review of the original act, it results, we think, that the object for which this board of commissioners was appointed, was to examine into and report to congress such claims as ought to be confirmed; and their refusal to report a claim for confirmation, whether expressed by the term 'rejected,' or in any other manner, is not to be considered as a final judicial \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 92]\n\u00a0\n decision on the claim, binding the title of the party; but as a rejection for the purposes of the act. This idea is strongly supported by a consideration of the manner in which the commissioners proceeded, and by an examination of the proceedings themselves, as exhibited in the reports to congress. The commissioners do not appear to have proceeded with open doors, deriving aid from the argument of counsel, as is the usage of a judicial tribunal, deciding finally on the rights of parties; but to have pursued their inquiries like a board of commissioners, making those preliminary inquiries which would enable the government to open its land- office; whose inquiries would enable the government to ascertain the great bulk of titles which were to be confirmed, not to decide ultimately on the titles which those who had become American citizens legally possessed.\n On the 3d of March 1823, congress passed a supplementary act, which also provided for the survey and disposal of the public lands in East Florida. It authorizes the appointment of a separate board of commissioners for East Florida, and empowers the commissioners to continue their sessions until the second Monday in the succeeding February, when they were to return their proceedings to the secretary of the treasury. This act dispenses with the necessity of deducing title from the original grantee, and authorizes the commissioners to decide on the validity of all claims derived from the Spanish government, in favor of actual settlers, where the quantity claimed does not exceed 3500 acres. The act 'to extend the time for the settlement of private land-claims in the territory of Florida,' passed on the 28th of February 1824, enacts, that no person shall be deemed an actual settler, 'unless such person, or those under whom he claims title, shall have been in the cultivation or occupation of the land, at and before the period of the cession.' On the 8th of February 1827, congress passed an act extending the time for receiving private land- claims in Florida, and directing them to be filed on or before the 1st day of the following November, with the register and receiver of the \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 93]\n\u00a0\n district; 'whose duty it shall be to report the same, with their decision thereon,' on or before the 1st day of January 1828, to be laid before congress at the next session. These acts are not understood to vary the powers and duties of the tribunals authorized to settle and confirm these private land-claims.\n On the 23d of May 1828, an act passed, supplementary to the several acts providing for the settlement and confirmation of private land-claims in Florida. This act continues the power of the register and receiver till the first Monday in the following December, when they are to make a final report; after which, it shall not be lawful for any of the claimants to exhibit any further evidence in support of their claims. The sixth section of this act transfers to the court all claims 'which shall not be decided and finally settled under the foregoing provisions of this act, containing a greater quantity of land than the commissioners were authorized to decide, and above the amount confirmed by this act, and which have not been reported as ante-dated or forged,' and declares, that they 'shall be received and adjudicated by the judge of the district court in which the land lies, upon the petition of the claimant, according to the forms,' &c., 'prescribed,' &c., by act of congress approved May 26th, 1824, entitled 'an act enabling the claimants to land within the limits of the state of Missouri and territory of Arkansas to institute proceedings,' &c. A proviso excepts from the jurisdiction of the court any claim annulled by the treaty or decree of ratification by the king of Spain, or any claim not presented to the commissioners or register and receiver. The 13th section enacts, that the decrees which may be rendered by the district or supreme court 'shall be conclusive between the United States and the said claimants only, and shall not affect the interests of third persons.'\n In all the acts passed upon this subject, previous to that of May 1830, the decisions of the commissioners, or of the register and receiver acting as commissioners, have been confirmed. Whether these acts affirm those decisions by which claims are rejected, as well as those by which they are recommended for confirmation, admits of some doubt; whether a rejection \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 94]\n\u00a0\n amounts to more than a refusal to recommend for confirmation, may be a subject for serious inquiry; however this may be, we think it can admit of no doubt, that the decision of the commissioners was conclusive in no case, until confirmed by an act of congress. The language of these acts, and among others, that of the act of 1828, would indicate, that the mind of congress was directed solely to the confirmation of claims, not to their annulment. The decision of this question is not necessary to this case. The claim of the petitioner was not contained in any one of the reports which have been stated.\n On the 26th of May 1830, congress passed 'an act to provide for the final settlement of land claims in Florida.' This act contains the action of congress on the report of the 14th of January 1830, which contains the rejection of the claim in question. The first section confirm all the claims and titles to land filed before the register and receiver of the land-office, under one league square, which have been decided and recommended for confirmation. The second section confirms all the conflicting Spanish claims, recommended for confirmation as valid titles. The third confirms certain claims derived from the former British government, and which have been recommended for confirmation. The fourth enacts, 'that all remaining claims which have been presented according to law, and not finally acted upon, shall be adjudicated and finally settled upon the same conditions,' &c.\n It is apparent, that no claim was finally acted upon, until it had been acted upon by congress; and it is equally apparent, that the action of congress on the report containing this claim, is confined to the confirmation of those titles which were recommended for confirmation. Congress has not passed on those which were rejected; they were, of consequence, expressly submitted to the court. The decision of the register and receiver could not be conclusive for another reason. Their power to decide did not extend to claims exceeding one thousand acres, unless the claimant was an actual settler; and it is not pretended, that either the petitioner, or Francisco de Sanchez, his assignee, \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 95]\n\u00a0\n was a settler, as described in the third section of the act of 1824. The rejection of this claim, then, by the register and receiver, did not withdraw it from the jurisdiction of the court, nor constitute any bar to a judgment on the case according to its merits.\n An objection, not noticed in the decree of the territorial court, has been urged by the attorney-general, and is entitled to serious consideration. The governor, it is said, was empowered by the royal order on which the grant professes to be founded, to allow to each person the quantity of land established by regulation in the province, agreeable to the number of persons composing each family. The presumption arising from the grant itself of a right to make it, is not directly controverted; but the attorney insists, that the documents themselves prove that the governor has exceeded his authority.\n Papers translated from a foreign language, respecting the transactions of foreign officers, with whose powers and authorities we are not well acquainted, containing uncertain and incomplete references to things well understood by the parties, but not understood by the court, should be carefully examined, before we pronounce that an officer, holding a high place of trust and confidence, has exceeded his authority. The objection rests on the assumption that the grant to the petitioner is founded entirely on the allowance made in the royal order of the 29th of March 1815, at the request of the governor of East Florida; and the petition to the governor undoubtedly affords strong ground for this assumption; but we are far from thinking it conclusive. The petitioner says, 'that, in virtue of the bounty in lands which, pursuant to his royal order of the 29th of March of the present year, the king grants to the military who were in this place at the time of the invasion which took place in the years 1812 and 1813, and your petitioner considering himself as being comprehended in the said sovereign resolution, as it is proved by the annexed certificates of his lordship, Brigadier Don Sebastian Kindelan, and by that which your lordship thought proper to to provide herewith, which certificates express the merits and services \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 96]\n\u00a0\n rendered by your petitioner, at the time of the siege, in consequence of which said bounties were granted to those who deserved them;' 'therefore, he most respectfully supplicates your lordship to grant him two thousand acres of land in the place,' &c. The governor granted the two thousand acres of land for which the petitioner prays.\n The attorney contends, that the royal order of the 29th of March 1815, empowered the governor to grant so much land only, as, according to the established rules, was allowed to each settler. This did not exceed one hundred acres to the head of a family, and a smaller portion for each member of it. The extraordinary facts that an application for two thousand acres should be founded on an express power to grant only one hundred; that this application should be accompanied by no explanation whatever; and that the grant should be made without hesitation, as an ordinary exercise of legitimate authority, are circumstances well calculated to excite some doubt, whether the real character of the transaction is understood, and to suggest the propriety of further examination. The royal order is founded on a letter from Governor Kindelan to the captain-general of Cuba, in which he recommends the militia as worthy the gifts to which the supreme governor may think them entitled; 'taking the liberty of recommending the granting of some, which may be as follows: to each officer who has been in actual service in said militia, a royal commission for each grade he may obtain as provincial, and to the soldiers a certain quantity of land as established by regulation in this province, agreeably to the number of persons composing each family, and which gifts can also be exclusively made to the married officers and soldiers of the said third battalion of Cuba.' The words 'and which gifts,' &c., in the concluding part of the sentence, would seem to refer to that part which asks lands for the soldiers of the militia; and yet it is unusual in land bounties for military service, to bestow the same quantity on the officers as on the soldiers. But be this as it may, the application of Governor Kindelan is confined to the privates who served in the militia, and to the married officers and soldiers of the third battalion of Cuba. \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 97]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner was in neither of these corps; he was an ensign of the corps of dragoons.\n The royal order alluded to, is contained in a letter of the 29th of March 1815, from the minister of the Indies; who, after stating the application in favor of the militia, and the third regiment of Cuba, adds, 'at the same time that his majesty approves said gifts, he desires that your excellency will inform him as to the reward which the commandant of the third battalion of Cuba, Don Juan Jos e de Estrada, who acted as governor pro tem. at the commencement of the rebellion, the officers of artillery, Don Ignacia Salus, Don Manuel Paulin, and of dragoons, Don Juan Percheman, are entitled to, as mentioned by the governor in his official letter. By royal order, I communicate the same to his excellency, for your information and compliance therewith, inclosing the royal commissions of local militia, according to the note forwarded by your excellency.' The governor adds, 'I forward you a copy of the same, inclosing also the documents above mentioned, that you may give their correspondent direction, with the intention, by the first opportunity, of informing his majesty of what I consider just as to the remuneration before mentioned.'\n It appears, then, that the part of the royal order which is supposed to limit this power of the governor to grants of one hundred acres does not comprehend the petitioner; that he is mentioned in that order as a person entitled to the royal bounty, the extent of which is not fixed, and respecting which the governor intended to inform his majesty. The royal order, then, is referred to in the petition, as showing the favorable intentions of the crown towards the petitioner; not as ascertaining limits applying to him, which the governor could not transcend. The petition also refers to certificates granted by General Kindelan, and the governor himself, expressing his merits and services during the siege. These could have no influence, if the amount of the grant was fixed. In his grant, annexed to the petition, the governor says, 'whereas, this officer, the party interested by the two certificates inclosed, has proved the services which he rendered in defence of \n\n[32 U.S. 51, 98]\n\u00a0\n this province, and in consideration also of what is provided in the royal order of the 29th of March last past, which he cites, I do grant him,' &c. Military service, then, is the foundation of the grant, and the royal order is referred to only as showing that the favorable attention the king had been directed to the petitioner. The record furnishes other reasons for the opinion, that the power of the governor was not so limited in this case, as is supposed by the attorney for the United States.\n The objection does not appear to have been made in the territorial court, where the subject must have been understood. It was neither raised by the attorney for the United States, nor noticed by the court. The register and receiver, before whom the claim was laid by Sanchez, the assignee of the present petitioner, did not reject it, because the governor had exceeded his power in making it, but because the survey was not exhibited. 'If this' (the survey), say the register and receiver, 'had been produced, it would have furnished some support for the certificate of Aguilar; as it is, we reject the claim.' It may be added, that other claims under the same royal order for the same quantity of land, have been admitted by the receiver and register; and have been confirmed by congress. We do not think the testimony proves that the governor has transcended his power.\n The court does not enter into the inquiry, whether the title has been conveyed to Sanchez or remains in Percheman. That is a question in which the United States can feel no interest, and which is not to be decided in this cause. It was very truly observed by the territorial court, that this objection 'is founded altogether on a suggestion of a private adverse claim;' but adverse claims, under the law giving jurisdiction to the court, are not to be decided or investigated. The point has not been made in this court. The decree is affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Delassus v. United States, 9 Pet. 118, 130; Strother v.

WILSON(1833)\n\nArgued: Decided: January 1, 1833\n\n\n\n\n[32 U.S. 150, 151]\n\u00a0\n CERTIFICATE of Division from the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n At the April sessions 1830, of that court, six indictments were presented to, and found by, the grand jury against James Porter and George Wilson; one for obstructing the mail of the United States from Philadelphia to Kimberton, on the 26th day of November 1829; one for obstructing the mail from Philadelphia to Reading, on the 6th day of December 1829; one for the robbery of the Kimberton mail, and putting the life of the carrier in jeopardy, on the same day in November 1829; one for robbery of the Reading mail, and putting the life of the carrier in jeopardy, on the same 6th day of December 1829; one for robbery of the Kimberton mail, also on the 26th of November 1829; and one for robbery of the Reading mail, also on the 6th of December 1829. At the same sessions, two other indictments were presented to the grand jury, against the same defendants, in which they were severally charged with robbery of the Reading and Kimberton mail, and wounding the carrier, which were returned to the court as 'true bills, except as to wounding the carrier.' Upon the indictment for robbery of the Kimberton mail, and putting the life of the carrier in jeopardy, and also in the two last-mentioned indictments, a nolle prosequi was afterwards entered by the district-attorney of the United States. On the 26th day of April 1830, the defendants, James Porter and George Wilson, pleaded not guilty to the several bills upon which they were arrainged; and on the 1st of May, a verdict of guilty was rendered against them, upon the indictment for robbery of the Reading mail, and putting the life of the carrier in jeopardy. \n5\n The circuit court, on the 27th of May 1830, sentenced the defendants to suffer death, on the 2d July following, and James Porter was executed in pursuance of this sentence.\n Upon the 27th of May 1830, George Wilson withdrew the \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 152]\n\u00a0\n pleas of not guilty to all the indictments against him, except those on which a nolle prosequi was afterwards entered, and pleaded guilty to the same.\n The indictment for robbery of the Reading mail, and putting the life of the driver in jeopardy, upon which James Porter and George Wilson were tried and convicted, was in the following terms:\n'Eastern district of Pennsylvania, to wit: The grand inquest of the United States of America, inquiring for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, upon their oaths and affirmations, respectively, do present, that James Porter, otherwise called James May, late of the eastern district aforesaid, yeoman, and George Wilson, late of the eastern district aforesaid, yeoman on the 6th day of December, in the year of our Lord 1829, at the eastern district aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this court, with force and arms, in and upon one Samuel McCrea, in the peace of God and of the United States of America then and there being, and then and there being a carrier of the mail of the United States, and then and there intrusted therewith, and then and there proceeding with the said mail, from the city of Philadelphia to the borough of Reading, feloniously did make an assault, and him the said Samuel McCrea in bodily fear and danger, then and there, feloniously did put, and the said mail of the United States from him the said Samuel McCrea, then and there, feloniously, violently and against his will, did steal, take and carry away, contrary to the form of the act of congress in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United States of America.\n\n'And the inquest aforesaid, upon their oaths and affirmations aforesaid, do further present, that the said James Porter, otherwise called James May, and the said George Wilson, afterwards, to wit, on the same day and year aforesaid, at the eastern district aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this court, with force and arms, in and upon the said Samuel McCrea, then and there being a carrier of the mail of the United States, and then and there intrusted therewith, feloniously did make an assault, and him, the said carrier of the said mail, then and there, feloniously, violently and against his will, did rob, contrary to the form of the act of congress in such case \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 153]\n\u00a0\n made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United States of America.'\n\n On the 14th of June 1830, the president of the United States granted the following pardon to George Wilson:\n'Andrew Jackson, President of the United States, to all who shall see these presents, greeting: Whereas a certain George Wilson has been convicted before the circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania, of the crime of robbing the mail of the United States, and has been sentenced by the said court to suffer the penalty of death, on the 2d day of July next; and whereas, the said George Wilson has been recommended as a fit subject for the exercise of executive clemency, by a numerous and respectable body of petitioners, praying for him a remission of the sentence of death, inasmuch as, in such a case, sentence of imprisonment for twenty years may yet be pronounced against him on the indictments to which he has pleaded guilty in the circuit court of the United States for the said district, and a still more severe imprisonment may be awarded him for the same acts, in the criminal courts of Pennsylvania: Now, therefore, I, Andrew Jackson, President of the United States of America, in consideration of the premises, divers other good and sufficient reasons me thereunto moving, have pardoned, and do hereby pardon, the said George Wilson the crime for which he has been sentenced to suffer death, remitting the penalty aforesaid, with this express stipulation, that this pardon shall not extend to any judgment which may be had or obtained against him, in any other case or cases now pending before said court for other offences wherewith he may stand charged.\n\n'In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents. Given at the city of Washington this 14th day of June, A. D. 1830, and of the independence of the United States the fifty-fourth.\n\n [L. S.] ANDREW JACKSON.'\n'By the President:-M. VAN BUREN, Secretary of state.' \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 154]\n\u00a0\n The record, as certified from the circuit court, proceeded to state: 'And now, to wit, this 20th day of October, A. D. 1830, the district- attorney of the United States moves the court for sentence upon the defendant, George Wilson; but the court suggesting the propriety of inquiring as to the effect of a certain pardon, understood to have been granted by the president of the United States to the defendant, since the conviction on this indictment, although alleged to relate to a conviction on another indictment, the case postponed till the 21st day of October 1830. And now, to wit, this 21st day of October 1830, the counsel for the defendant, George Wilson, appear before the court, and on behalf of the said defendant, waive and decline any advantage or protection which might be supposed to arise from the pardon referred to: and thereupon, the following questions or points were argued by the district-attorney of the United States, upon which the opinions of the judges of the said circuit court were opposed: 1. That the pardon referred to (prout the same) is expressly restricted to the sentence of death passed upon the defendant, under another conviction, and as expressly reserves from its operation the conviction now before the court. 2. That the prisoner can, under this conviction, derive no advantage from the pardon, without bringing the same judicially before the court by plea, motion or otherwise.\n\n'And now, to wit, this 21st day of October 1830, the defendant, George Wilson, being in person before the court, was asked by the court, whether he had anything to say why sentence should not be pronounced for the crime whereof he stands convicted in this particular case, and whether he wished in any manner to avail himself of the pardon referred to; and the said defendant answered in person, that he had nothing to say, and that he did not wish in any manner to avail himself, in order to avoid sentence in this particular case, of the pardon referred to. And the said judges being so opposed in opinion upon the points or questions above stated, the same were then and there, at the request of the district- attorney of the United States, \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 155]\n\u00a0\n stated, under the direction of the judges, and ordered by the court to be certified, under the seal of the court, to the supreme court, at their next session thereafter, to be finally decided by the said supreme court. And the court being further of opinion, that other proceedings could not be had in the said case, without prejudice to its merits, did order the same to be continued over to the next sessions of the court.\n\n HENRY BALDWIN.\n JOS. HOPKINSON.'\n The case was argued for the United States, by Taney, Attorney-General; no counsel appeared for the defendant, George Wilson.\n The Attorney-General contended, that the other indictments against the defendant, and the proceedings on them, formed no part of the proceedings or evidence in this case; and they are not offered in evidence, either by the United States or George Wilson. This court could judicially notice, perhaps, that such indictments were upon the records of the circuit court. But whether it was the same Wilson, or the act constituting the offence the same act, and whether it was pardoned, were matters of fact, and not matters of law. Neither one of these facts was pleaded by either of the parties, nor in any form alleged, nor any evidence offered to establish either of them. The question is, can the court, without the allegation of either party, and without evidence offered, decide the facts, that he is the same person; that the act pardoned is the same with the one now charged; and that he has been pardoned for that act?\n This is not a statute pardon. The pardoning power in the constitution is the executive power. Waiving, for the present, the identity of the person and the act, and conceding that the pardon would discharge him, it is insisted:\n\n 1. \nThat the court cannot give the prisoner the benefit of the pardon, unless he claims the benefit of it, and relies on it by plea or motion. The form in which he may ask it, is not \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 156]\n\u00a0\n material to this inquiry; but the claim must be made in some shape by him. It is a grant to him; it is his property; and he may accept it or not, as he pleases. The ancient doctrine was, that his plea of 'not guilty' waived it, and that he could not afterwards rely on it; that a general plea of not guilty, was equivalent to a refusal to accept it. This doctrine is not meant to be contended for. It is admitted, that he may avail himself of it, at any time, by plea, before or after verdict or confession. But is insisted, that unless he pleads it, or in some way claims its benefit, thereby denoting his acceptance of the proffered grace, the court cannot notice it, nor allow it to prevent them from passing sentence. The whole current of authority establishes this principle. 2 Hawk. P. C. ch. 37,  59, 64, 56; 4 Bl. Com. 402; Arch. Plead. & Ev. 55; 5 Bac. Abr. 292-3, tit. Pardon, E; Comyn's Dig.; 13 Petersd. Abr. 82; Kelyng 24; Radcliffe's Case, Fost. 40; 1 Wils. 150; King v. Haines, Ibid. 214; Jenk. Cent. p. 12, ca. 62. The necessity of his pleading it, or claiming it in some other manner, grows out of the nature of the grant; he must accept it.\n We must not look at a pardon, as if confined to capital cases. It exists in cases of misdemeanors also; and the same rule applies to both, and the same effect is produced in both. A pardon may be granted on a condition precedent or subsequent, and the party remains liable to the punishment if the condition is not performed. 2 Hawk. P. C. ch. 37,  45; 3 Thomas' Co. Litt. 569, 615, note m, and the authorities; Patrick Maddan's Case, 1 Leach's Cas. 220, 263; People v. James, 2 Caines 57; Radcliffe's Case, Fost. Cr. Law 41. Suppose, a pardon granted on conditions, which the prisoner does not choose to accept? Suppose, the condition is exile, and he thinks the sentence a lighter punishment? Suppose, he thinks it his interest to undergo the punishment, in order to make his peace with the public for an offence committed in sudden temptation? A prisoner might be placed in circumstances, when he would feel it to be his interest to suffer imprisonment or pay a fine, as the evidence of his contrition. Might he not, under such \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 157]\n\u00a0\n circumstances, refuse to accept a general and unconditional pardon?\n It is hardly necessary to speculate on the case of a man refusing to accept a pardon in a capital case. It is an event, not even possible, where the party was in his sound mind. If it should happen, without doubt, there is a power in the executive, to prevent the execution of the sentence. But we are now discussing judicial power, which, being governed by fixed laws and rules of proceeding, cannot exercise a discretion beyond the limits which the law has prescribed. They cannot look to cases which may possibly arise. There is sufficient power in another branch of the government, to prevent any evil from the principle insisted on. The argument is fortified by the clause introduced into the acts of amnesty in England. Radcliffe's Case, Fost. 44-5.\n\n 2. \nBut suppose, the prisoner is not bound to plead it. How was it before the court in any other form? The attorney for the United States did not call on the court to allow it. No evidence was offered of the identity of Wilson, or of the act pardoned. Radcliffe's Case, Fost. Cr. Law 43. The identity had been found by a jury. How did the court obtain a knowledge of the fact? A man who has been acquitted, cannot lawfully be punished in another proceeding. So of a former conviction. Arch. Plead. & Ev. 50-4. Suppose, another indictment for the same offence, and the court saw the man, and heard the evidence, and knew it to be the same, could they direct a verdict of not guilty? The defence must be pleaded with the proper averments. If the party, by an oversight, omitted it, no doubt, the court would give him an opportunity of correcting the error. But if he refused to plead it, and the jury found him guilty, or he pleaded guilty, could the court discharge him? If they could not, how can they do it, with a pardon, when the party refuses to avail himself of the defence. Yet a former acquittal absolves him from all the consequences of crime, as perfectly as a pardon. It declares him innocent. The pardon restores him to innocence in the eye of the law. \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 158]\n\u00a0\n A pardon may release a part of the penalty inflicted by law and reserve the other. A pardon may be granted on condition, as already shown. May it not, then, annex any condition? a condition that a party shall undergo a part of the punishment? It may be on condition that he will leave the United States. Why may it not be that he will pay the fine, where the punishment is fine and imprisonment? Why may it not be on condition that he undergoes the imprisonment? Why not, that he undergoes part of the imprisonment? 3 Johns. Cas. 333; United States v. Lukens, Coxe's Dig. tit. Pardon, 510.\n\n MARSHALL, Ch. J., delivered the opinion of the court.\n In this case, the grand jury had found an indictment against the prisoner for robbing the mail, to which he had pleaded not guilty. Afterwards, he withdrew this plea, and pleaded guilty. On a motion by the district-attorney, at a subsequent day, for judgment, the court suggested the propriety of inquiring as to the effect of a certain pardon, understood to have been granted by the president of the United States to the defendant, since the conviction on this indictment, alleged to relate to a conviction on another indictment, and that motion was adjourned until the next day. On the succeeding day, the counsel for the prisoner appeared in court, and on his behalf waived and declined any advantage or protection which might be supposed to arise from the pardon referred to; and thereupon, the following points were made by the district-attorney: 1. That the pardon referred to, is expressly restricted to the sentence of death passed upon the defendant, under another conviction, and as expressly reserves from its operation the conviction now before the court. 2. That the prisoner can, under this conviction, derive no advantage from the pardon, without bringing the same judicially before the court.\n The prisoner being asked by the court, whether he had anything to say, why sentence should not be pronounced for the crime whereof he stood convicted in this particular case, and whether he wished in any manner to avail himself of the \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 159]\n\u00a0\n pardon referred to, answered, that he had nothing to say, and that he did not wish in any manner to avail himself, in order to avoid the sentence in this particular case, of the pardon referred to. The judges were, thereupon, divided in opinion, on both points made by the district- attorney, and ordered them to be certified to this court.\n A certiorari was afterwards awarded, to bring up the record of the case in which judgment of death had been pronounced against the prisoner. The indictment charges a robbery of the mail, and putting the life of the driver in jeopardy. The robbery charged in each indictment, is on the same day, at the same place, and on the same carrier. We do not think that this record is admissible, since no direct reference is made to it in the points adjourned by the circuit court; and without its aid, we can readily comprehend the questions submitted to us.\n If this difficulty be removed, another is presented by the terms in which the first point is stated on the record. The attorney argued, first, that the pardon referred to is expressly restricted to the sentence of death passed upon the defendant, under another conviction, and as expressly reserves from its operation the conviction now before the court. Upon this point, the judges were opposed in opinion. Whether they were opposed on the fact, or on the inference drawn from it by the attorney, and what that inference was, the record does not explicitly inform us. If the question on which the judges doubted was, whether such a pardon ought to restrain the court from pronouncing judgment in the case before them, which was expressly excluded from it; the first inquiry is, whether the robbery charged in the one indictment is the same with that charged in the other? This is neither expressly affirmed nor denied. If the convictions be for different robberies, no question of law can arise on the effect which the pardon of the one may have on the proceedings for the others.\n If the statement on the record be sufficient to inform this court, judicially, that the robberies are the same, we are not told, on what point of law the judges were divided. The only inference we can draw from the statement is, that it was \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 160]\n\u00a0\n doubted, whether the terms of the pardon could restrain the court from pronouncing the judgment of law on the conviction before them. The prisoner was convicted of robbing the mail, and putting the life of the carrier in jeopardy, for which the punishment is death. He had also been convicted on an indictment for the same robbery, as we now suppose, without putting life in jeopardy, for which the punishment is fine and imprisonment; and the question supposed to be submitted is, whether a pardon of the greater offence, excluding the less, necessarily comprehends the less, against its own express terms. We should not feel much difficulty on this statement of the question, but it is unnecessary to discuss or decide it. Whether the pardon reached the less offence or not, the first indictment comprehended both the robbery and the putting life in jeopardy, and the conviction and judgment pronounced upon it extended to both. After the judgment, no subsequent prosecution could be maintained for the same offence, nor for any part of it, provided the former conviction was pleaded. Whether it could avail, without being pleaded, or in any manner relied on by the prisoner, is substantially the same question with that presented in the second point, which is, 'that the prisoner can, under this conviction, derive no advantage from the pardon, without bringing the same judicially before the court, by plea, motion or otherwise.'\n The constitution gives to the president, in general terms, 'the power to grant reprieves and pardons for offences against the United States.' As this power had been exercised, from time immemorial, by the executive of that nation whose language is our language, and to whose judicial institutions ours bear a close resemblance; we adopt their principles respecting the operation and effect of a pardon, and look into their books for the rules prescribing the manner in which it is to be used by the person who would avail himself of it.\n A pardon is an act of grace, proceeding from the power intrusted with the execution of the laws, which exempts the individual, on whom it is bestowed, from the punishment the law inflicts for a crime he has committed. It is the private, though official, act of the executive magistrate, delivered to the \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 161]\n\u00a0\n individual for whose benefit it is intended, and not communicated officially to the court. It is a constituent part of the judicial system, that the judge sees only with judicial eyes, and knows nothing respecting any particular case, of which he is not informed judicially. A private deed, not communicated to him, whatever may be its character, whether a pardon or release, is totally unknown, and cannot be acted on. The looseness which would be introduced into judicial proceedings, would prove fatal to the great principles of justice, if the judge might notice and act upon facts not brought regularly into the cause. Such a proceeding, in ordinary cases, would subvert the best established principles, and overturn those rules which have been settled by the wisdom of ages.\n Is there anything peculiar in a pardon which ought to distinguish it in this respect from other facts? We know of no legal principle which will sustain such a distinction. A pardon is a deed, to the validity of which, delivery is essential, and delivery is not complete, without acceptance. It may then be rejected by the person to whom it is tendered; and if it be rejected, we have discovered no power in a court to force it on him. It may be supposed, that no being condemned to death would reject a pardon; but the rule must be the same in capital cases and in misdemeanors. A pardon may be conditional; and the condition may be more objectionable than the punishment inflicted by the judgment. The pardon may possibly apply to a different person, or a different crime. It may be absolute or conditional. It may be controverted by the prosecutor, and must be expounded by the court. These circumstances combine to show, that this, like any other deed, ought to be brought 'judicially before the court, by plea, motion or otherwise.' The decisions on this point conform to these principles. Hawkins, b. 2, ch. 37,  59, says, 'but it is certain, that a man may waive the benefit of a pardon under the great seal, as where one who hath such a pardon doth not plead it, but takes the general issue, after which he shall not resort to the \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 162]\n\u00a0\n pardon.' In  67, he says, 'an exception is made of a pardon after plea.' Notwithstanding this general assertion, a court would, undoubtedly, at this day, permit a pardon to be used, after the general issue. Still, where the benefit is to be obtained through the agency of the court, it must be brought regularly to the notice of that tribunal.\n Hawkins says,  64, 'it will be error to allow a man the benefit of such a pardon, unless it be pleaded.' In  65, he says, 'he who pleads such a pardon must produce it sub pede sigilli, though it be a plea in bar, because it is presumed to be in his custody, and the property of it belongs to him. Comyn, in his Digest, tit. Pardon, H, says, 'if a man has a charter of pardon from the king, he ought to plead it, in bar of the indictment; and if he pleads not guilty, he waives his pardon.' The same law is laid down in Bacon's Abridgment, title Pardon; and is confirmed by the cases these authors quote.\n We have met with only one case which might seem to question it. Jenkins, page 169, case 62, says, 'if the king pardons a felon, and it is shown to the court, and yet the felon pleads guilty, and waives the pardon, he shall not be hanged; for it is the king's will, that he shall not, and the king has an interest in the life of his subject. The books to the contrary are to be understood, where the charter of pardon is not shown to the court.' This vague dictum supposes the pardon to be shown to the court. The waiver spoken of is probably that implied waiver which arises from pleading the general issue; and the case may be considered as determining nothing more than that the prisoner may avail himself of the pardon, by showing it to the court, even after waiving it, by pleading the general issue. If this be, and it most probably is, the fair and sound construction of this case, it is reconciled with all the other decisions, so far as respects the present inquiry.\n Blackstone, in his 4th vol., p. 337, says, 'a pardon may be pleaded in bar.' In p. 376, he says, 'it may also be pleaded in arrest of judgment.' In p. 401, he says, 'a pardon by act \n\n[32 U.S. 150, 163]\n\u00a0\n of parliament is more beneficial than by the king's charter; for a man is not bound to plead it, but the court must, ex officio, take notice of it; neither can he lose the benefit of it by his own laches or negligence, as he may of the king's charter of pardon. The king's charter of pardon must be specially pleaded, and that at a proper time; for if a man is indicted and has a pardon in his pocket and afterwards puts himself upon his trial, by pleading the general issue, he has waived the benefit of such pardon. But if a man avails himself thereof, as by course of law he may, a pardon may either be pleaded on arraignment, or in arrest of judgment, or, in the present stage of proceedings, in bar of execution.' The reason why a court must ex officio take notice of pardon by act of parliament, is that it is considered as a public law; having the same effect on the case, as if the general law punishing the offence had been repealed or annulled.\n This court is of opinion, that the pardon in the proceedings mentioned, not having been brought judicially before the court, by plea, motion or otherwise, cannot be noticed by the judges.\n THIS cause came on to be heard, on the transcript of the record from the circuit court of the United States for the third circuit and eastern district of Pennsylvania, and on the question on which the judges of that court were divided in opinion, and was argued by the attorney-general on the part of the United States: On consideration whereof, this court is of opinion, that the pardon alluded to in the proceedings, not having been brought judicially before the court, by plea, motion or otherwise, ought not to be noticed by the judges, or in any manner to affect the judgment of the law. All which is directed and adjudged to be certified to the judges of the said circuit court of the United States for the eastern district of Pennsylvania. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] One who accepts and complies with the conditions of a pardon, granted by the president, for acts done in aid of the rebellion, may plead the same in bar of proceedings for the confiscation of his property. Armstrong v. United States, 13 Wall. 154; Brown v. United States, McCahon 229. Such pardon restores to the grantee all his rights of property, not already vested in others by judicial proceedings. Ibid. A pardon, after conviction, releases a fine, though payable to the county. Cope v. Commonwealth, 28 Penn. St. 297. A pardon remitting the whole of a penalty, for which judgment has been rendered, operates as well upon the moiety adjudged to the informer, as upon the portion coming to the United States. United States v. Thomasson, 4 Biss. 336. But a pardon, without words of restitution, does not restore an estate forfeited for treason. Aldrich v. Jessup, 3 Grant (Pa.) 158. It will not operate to the injury of a third person, so as to deprive him of a vested right. United States v. Morris, 1 Paine 231. The effect of a pardon, duly granted by the president, cannot be restricted by subsequent legislation. United States v. Klein, 13 Wall. 128. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The transmission of a pardon to the marshal, and its receipt by him, is not a delivery to the prisoner. Exparte De Puy, 3 Ben. 307. S. P. Commonwealth v. Holloway, 44 Penn. St. 210; Commonwealth v. Kelly, 9 Phila. 556. If not complete, it may be revoked by the successor of the president by whom it was granted. Ex parte De Puy, ut supra. So, it may be recalled, after a delivery to the warden of the penitentiary, if obtained by false and forged representations and papers. Commonwealth v. Holloway, ut supra. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] The president has power to grant a conditional pardon to a person under sentence of death, by commuting it into imprisonment for life; and if accepted, the convict cannot insist that the pardon is absolute, and the condition void. Ex parte Wells, 18 How. 307. If a pardon be granted on condition subsequent, on a breach thereof, the original sentence may be enforced. Flavell's Case, 8 W. & S. 197; Commonwealth v. Haggerty, 4 Brewst. (Pa.) 326; People v. Potter, 1 Parker (N. Y.) 47. But the acceptance of a conditional pardon, which never becomes operative, is not an admission of the party's guilt. Scott v. United States, 8 Ct. Claims 457. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] A pardon must be pleaded; the prison inspectors have no power to discharge a convict, upon its production. Commonwealth v. Shisler, 2 Phila. 256; Merritt's Case, 4 City Hall Rec. 58. Where a conditional pardon is granted, the fact that the party is in prison, under sentence, does not constitute such duress as will make his acceptance of the condition of no effect. Ex parte Greathouse, 2 Abb. U. S. 382. Where a prisoner was pardoned on condition of leaving the United States, within a limited time, it appearing that he had been insane during that period, the court enlarged the time for complying with the condition. People v. James, 2 Caines 57. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] See United States v. Wilson, Bald. 78. \n\n\n\n\n"}}
