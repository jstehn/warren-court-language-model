Richberg, both of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n[295 U.S. 495, 519]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners in No. 854 were convicted in the District Court of the United States for the Eastern District of New York on eighteen counts of an indictment charging violations of what is known as the 'Live Poultry Code,'1 and on an additional count for conspiracy to commit such violations. \n2\n By demurrer to the indictment and appropriate motions on the trial, the defendants contended (1) that the code had been adopted pursuant to an unconstitutional delegation by Congress of legislative power; (2) that it attempted to regulate intrastate transactions which lay outside the authority of Congress; and (3) that in certain provisions it was repugnant to the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 520]\n\u00a0\n 'The Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the conviction on the conspiracy count and on sixteen counts for violation of the code, but reversed the conviction on two counts which charged violation of requirements as to minimum wages and maximum hours of labor, as these were not deemed to be within the congressional power of regulation. 76 F.(2d) 617. On the respective applications of the defendants (No. 854) and of the government (No. 864), this Court granted writs of certiorari April 15, 1935. \n295 \nU.S. 723\n, 55 S.Ct. 651, 79 L.Ed. --.\n New York City is the largest live poultry market in the United States. Ninety-six per cent. of the live poultry there marketed comes from other states. Three-fourths of this amount arrives by rail and is consigned to commission men or receivers. Most of these freight shipments (about 75 per cent.) come in at the Manhattan Terminal of the New York Central Railroad, and the remainder at one of the four terminals in New Jersey serving New York City. The commission men transact by far the greater part of the business on a commission basis, representing the shippers as agents, and remitting to them the proceeds of sale, less commissions, freight, and handling charges. Otherwise, they buy for their own account. They sell to slaughterhouse operators who are also called marketmen.\n The defendants are slaughterhouse operators of the latter class. A.L. A. Schechter Poultry Corporation and Schechter Live Poultry Market are corporations conducting wholesale poultry slaughterhouse markets in Brooklyn, New York City. Joseph Schechter operated the latter corporation and also guaranteed the credits of the former corporation, which was operated by Martin, Alex, and Aaron Schechter. Defendants ordinarily purchase their live poultry from commission men at the West Washington Market in New York City or at the railroad terminals serving the city, but occasionally they purchase from commission men in Philadelphia. They buy the \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 521]\n\u00a0\n poultry for slaughter and resale. After the poultry is trucked to their slaughterhouse markets in Brooklyn, it is there sold, usually within twenty-four hours, to retail poultry dealers and butchers who sell directly to consumers. The poultry purchased from defendants is immediately slaughtered, prior to delivery, by shochtim in defendants' employ. Defendants do not sell poultry in interstate commerce.\n The 'Live Poultry Code' was promulgated under section 3 of the National Industrial Recovery Act. \n3\n That section, the pertinent provisions of which are set forth in the margin,4 authorizes the President to approve 'codes of \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 522]\n\u00a0\n fair competition.' SUCH A CODE may be approved for a trade or industry, upon application by one or more trade or industrial associations or groups, if the President finds (1) that such associations or groups 'impose no inequitable restrictions on admission to membership therein and are truly representative,' and (2) that such codes are not designed 'to promote monopolies or to eliminate or oppress small enterprises and will not operate to discrimi-\n___ '(c) The several district courts of the United States are hereby invested with jurisdiction to prevent and restrain violations of any code of fair competition approved under this title (chapter); and it shall be the duty of the several district attorneys of the United States, in their respective districts, under the direction of the Attorney General, to institute proceedings in equity to prevent and restrain such violations.\n'(d) Upon his own motion, or if complaint is made to the President that abuses inimical to the public interest and contrary to the policy herein declared are prevalent in any trade or industry or subdivision thereof, and if no code of fair competition therefor has theretofore been approved by the President, the President, after such public notice and hearing as he shall specify, may prescribe and approve a code of fair competition for such trade or industry or subdivision thereof, which shall have the same effect as a code of fair competition approved by the President under subsection (a) of this section. ...\n\n'(f) When a code of fair competition has been approved or prescribed by the President under this title (chapter), any violation of any provision thereof in any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce shall be a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof an offender shall be fined not more than $500 for each offense, and each day such violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.' \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 523]\n\u00a0\n nate against them, and will tend to effectuate the policy' of title 1 of the act (15 USCA  701 et seq.). Such codes 'shall not permit monopolies or monopolistic practices.' As a condition of his approval, the President may 'impose such conditions (including requirements for the making of reports and the keeping of accounts) for the protection of consumers, competitors, employees, and others, and in furtherance of the public interest, and may provide such exceptions to and exemptions from the provisions of such code as the President in his discretion deems necessary to effectuate the policy herein declared.' Where such a code has not been approved, the President may prescribe one, either on his own motion or on complaint. Violation of any provision of a code (so approved or prescribed) 'in any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce' is made a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $500 for each offense, and each day the violation continues is to be deemed a separate offense.\n\n The 'Live Poultry Code' was approved by the President on April 13, 1934. Its divisions indicate its nature and scope. The code has eight articles entitled (1) 'purposes,' (2) 'definitions,' (3) 'hours,' (4) 'wages,' (5) 'general labor provisions,' (6) 'administration,' (7) 'trade practice provisions,' and (8) 'general.'\n The declared purpose is 'To effect the policies of title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act.' The code is established as 'a code for fair competition for the live poultry industry of the metropolitan area in and about the City of New York.' That area is described as embracing the five boroughs of New York City, the counties of Rockland, Westchester, Nassau, and Suffolk in the state of New York, the counties of Hudson and Bergen in the state of New Jersey, and the county of Fairfield in the state of Connecticut.\n The 'industry' is defined as including 'every person engaged in the business of selling, purchasing of re- \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 524]\n\u00a0\n sale, transporting, or handling and\/or slaughtering live poultry, from the time such poultry comes into the New York metropolitan area to the time it is first sold in slaughtered form,' and such 'related branches' as may from time to time be included by amendment. Employers are styled 'members of the industry,' and the term 'employee' is defined to embrace 'any and all persons engaged in the industry, however compensated,' except 'members.'\n The code fixes the number of hours for workdays. It provides that no employee, with certain exceptions, shall be permitted to work in excess of forty hours in any one week, and that no employees, save as stated, 'shall be paid in any pay period less than at the rate of fifty (50) cents per hour.' The article containing 'general labor provisions' prohibits the employment of any person under 16 years of age, and declares that employees shall have the right of 'collective bargaining' and freedom of choice with respect to labor organizations, in the terms of section 7(a) of the act (15 USCA  707(a). The minimum number of employees, who shall be employed by slaughterhouse operators, is fixed; the number being graduated according to the average volume of weekly sales.\n Provision is made for administration through an 'industry advisory committee,' to be selected by trade associations and members of the industry, and a 'code supervisor,' to be appointed, with the approval of the committee, by agreement between the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator for Industrial Recovery. The expenses of administration are to be borne by the members of the industry proportionately upon the basis of volume of business, or such other factors as the advisory committee may deem equitable, 'subject to the disapproval of the Secretary and\/or Administrator.'\n The seventh article, containing 'trade practice provisions,' prohibits various practices which are said to consti- \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 525]\n\u00a0\n tute 'unfair methods of competition.' The final article provides for verified reports, such as the Secretary or Administrator may require, '(1) for the protection of consumers, competitors, employees, and others, and in furtherance of the public interest, and (2) for the determination by the Secretary or Administrator of the extent to which the declared policy of the act is being effectuated by this code.' The members of the industry are also required to keep books and records which 'will clearly reflect all financial transactions of their respective businesses and the financial condition thereof,' and to submit weekly reports showing the range of daily prices and volume of sales' for each kind of produce.\n The President approved the code by an executive order (No. 6675-A) in which he found that the application for his approval had been duly made in accordance with the provisions of title 1 of the National Industrial Recover Act; that there had been due notice and hearings; that the code constituted 'a code of fair competition' as contemplated by the act and complied with its pertinent provisions, including clauses (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of section 3 of title 1 (15 USCA  703(a)(1, 2); and that the code would tend 'to effectuate the policy of Congress as declared in section 1 of Title I.' \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 495, 526]\n\u00a0\n The executive order also recited that the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the National Industrial Recovery Act had rendered separate reports as to the provisions within their respective jurisdictions. The Secretary of Agriculture reported that the provisions of the code 'establishing standards of fair competition (a) are regulations of transactions in or affecting the current of interstate and\/or foreign commerce and (b) are reason- \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 527]\n\u00a0\n able,' and also that the code would tend to effectuate the policy declared in title 1 of the act, as set forth in section 1 (15 USCA  701). The report of the Administrator for Industrial Recovery dealt with wages, hours of labor, and other labor provisions. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Of the eighteen counts of the indictment upon which the defendants were convicted, aside from the count for conspiracy, two counts charged violation of the minimum wage and maximum hour provisions of the code, and ten counts were for violation of the requirement (found in the 'trade practice provisions') of 'straight killing.' This requirement was really one of 'straight' selling. The term 'straight killing' was defined in the code as 'the practice of requiring persons purchasing poultry for resale to accept the run of any half coop, coop, or coops, as purchased by slaughterhouse operators, except for culls.' \n7\n The charges in the ten counts, respectively, were \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 528]\n\u00a0\n that the defendants in selling to retail dealers and butchers had permitted 'selections of individual chickens taken from particular coops and half coops.'\n Of the other six counts, one charged the sale to a butcher of an unfit chicken; two counts charged the making of sales without having the poultry inspected or approved in accordance with regulations or ordinances of the city of New York; two counts charged the making of false reports or the failure to make reports relating to the range of daily prices and volume of sales for certain periods; and the remaining count was for sales to slaughterers or dealers who were without licenses required by the ordinances and regulations of the city of New York.\n First. Two preliminary points are stressed by the government with respect to the appropriate approach to the important questions presented. We are told that the provision of the statute authorizing the adoption of codes must be viewed in the light of the grave national crisis with which Congress was confronted. Undoubtedly, the conditions to which power is addressed are always to be considered when the exercise of power is challenged. Extraordinary conditions may call for extraordinary remedies. But the argument necessarily stops short of an attempt to justify action which lies outside the sphere of constitutional authority. Extraordinary conditions do not create or enlarge constitutional power. \n8\n The Constitution established a national government with powers deemed to be adequate, as they have proved to be both in war and peace, but these powers of the national government are limited by the constitutional grants. Those who act under these grants are not at liberty to transcend the \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 529]\n\u00a0\n imposed limits because they believe that more or different power is necessary. Such assertions of extraconstitutional authority were anticipated and precluded by the explicit terms of the Tenth Amendment- 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.'\n The further point is urged that the national crisis demanded a broad and intensive co-operative effort by those engaged in trade and industry, and that this necessary co-operation was sought to be fostered by permitting them to initiate the adoption of codes. But the statutory plan is not simply one for voluntary effort. It does not seek merely to endow voluntary trade or industrial associations or groups with privileges or immunities. It involves the coercive exercise of the lawmaking power. The codes of fair competition which the statute attempts to authorize are codes of laws. If valid, they place all persons within their reach under the obligation of positive law, binding equally those who assent and those who do not assent. Violations of the provisions of the codes are punishable as crimes.\n Second. The Question of the Delegation of Legislative Power.-We recently had occasion to review the pertinent decisions and the general principles which govern the determination of this question. Panama Refining Company v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388\n, 55 S.Ct. 241, 79 L.Ed . 446. The Constitution provides that 'All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.' Article 1,  1. And the Congress is authorized 'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution' its general powers. Article 1,  8, par. 18. The Congress is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested. We have repeatedly recognized the necessity of adapting \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 530]\n\u00a0\n legislation to complex conditions involving a host of details with which the national Legislature cannot deal directly. We pointed out in the Panama Refining Company Case that the Constitution has never been regarded as denying to Congress the necessary resources of flexibility and practicality, which will enable it to perform its function in laying down policies and establishing standards, while leaving to selected instrumentalities the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the Legislature is to apply. But we said that the constant recognition of the necessity and validity of such provisions, and the wide range of administrative authority which has been developed by means of them, cannot be allowed to obscure the limitations of the authority to delegate, if our constitutional system is to be maintained. Id., \n293 U.S. 388\n, page 421, 55 S.Ct. 241.\n Accordingly, we look to the statute to see whether Congress has overstepped these limitations-whether Congress in authorizing 'codes of fair competition' has itself established the standards of legal obligation, thus performing its essential legislative function, or, by the failure to enact such standards, has attempted to transfer that function to others.\n The aspect in which the question is now presented is distinct from that which was before us in the case of the Panama Refining Company. There the subject of the statutory prohibition was defined. National Industrial Recovery Act,  9(c), 15 USCA  709(c). That subject was the transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum and petroleum products which are produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted by state authority. The question was with respect to the range of discretion given to the President in prohibiting that transportation. Id., \n293 U.S. 388\n, pages 414, 415, 430, 55 S.Ct. 241. As to the 'codes of fair competition,' under section 3 of the act, the question is more funda- \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 531]\n\u00a0\n mental. It is whether there is any adequate definition of the subject to which the codes are to be addressed.\n What is meant by 'fair competition' as the term is used in the act? Does it refer to a category established in the law, and is the authority to make codes limited accordingly? Or is it used as a convenient designation for whatever set of laws the formulators of a code for a particular trade or industry may propose and the President may approve ( subject to certain restrictions), or the President may himself prescribe, as being wise and beneficient provisions for the government of the trade or industry in order to accomplish the broad purposes of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion which are stated in the first section of title 1? 9\n The act does not define 'fair competition.' 'Unfair competition,' as known to the common law, is a limited concept. Primarily, and strictly, it relates to the palming off of one's goods as those of a rival trader. Good- year's Rubber Manufacturing Co. v. Good-year Rubber Co., \n128 U.S. 598\n, \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 532]\n\u00a0\n 604, 9 S.Ct. 166; Howe Scale Co. v. Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict, \n198 \nU.S. 118, 140\n, 25 S.Ct. 609; Hanover Star Milling Co. v. Metcalf, \n240 \nU.S. 403, 413\n, 36 S.Ct. 357. In recent years, its scope has been extended. It has been held to apply to misappropriation as well as misrepresenation, to the selling of another's goods as one's own-to misappropriation of what equitably belongs to a competitor. International News Service v. Associated Press, \n248 \nU.S. 215, 241\n, 242 S., 39 S.Ct. 68, 2 A.L.R. 293. Unfairness in competition has been predicated of acts which lie outside the ordinary course of business and are tainted by fraud or coercion or conduct otherwise prohibited by law. \n10\n Id., \n248 U.S. 315\n, page 258, 39 S.Ct. 68, 2 A.L.R. 293. But it is evident that in its widest range, 'unfair competition,' as it has been understood in the law, does not reach the objectives of the codes which are authorized by the National Industrial Recovery Act. The codes may, indeed, cover conduct which existing law condemns, but they are not limited to conduct of that sort. The government does not contend that the act contemplates such a limitation. It would be opposed both to the declared purposes of the act and to its administrative construction.\n The Federal Trade Commission Act [section 5 (15 USCA  45 11 introduced the expression 'unfair methods of competition,' which were declared to be unlawful. That was an expression new in the law. Debate apparently convinced the sponsors of the legislation that the words 'unfair competition,' in the light of their meaning at common law, were too narrow. We have said that the substituted phrase has a broader meaning, that it does not admit of precise definition; its scope being left to judicial determination as controversies arise. Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 648\n, 649 S., 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191; Federal Trade Commission v. R. F. Keppel, \n291 U.S. 304\n, 310-312, 54 S.Ct. 423. What are \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 533]\n\u00a0\n 'UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION' ARE THUS to be determined in particular instances, upon evidence, in the light of particular competitive conditions and of what is found to be a specific and substantial public interest. Federal Trade Commission v. Beech-Nut Packing Co., \n257 \nU.S. 441, 453\n, 42 S.Ct. 150, 19 A.L.R. 882; Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, \n280 \nU.S. 19, 27\n, 28 S., 50 S.Ct. 1, 68 A.L.R. 838; Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., supra; Federal Trade Commission v. R. F. Keppel, supra; Federal Trade Commission v. Algoma Lumber Co., \n291 \nU.S. 67, 73\n, 54 S.Ct. 315. To make this possible, Congress set up a special procedure. A commission, a quasi judicial body, was created. Provision was made for formal complaint, for notice and hearing, for appropriate findings of fact supported by adequate evidence, and for judicial review to give assurance that the action of the commission is taken within its statutory authority. Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., supra; Federal Trade Commission v. Klesner, supra. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n In providing for codes, the National Industrial Recovery Act dispenses with this administrative procedure and with any administrative procedure of an analogous character. But the difference between the code plan of the Recovery Act and the scheme of the Federal Trade Commission Act lies not only in procedure but in subject- \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 534]\n\u00a0\n matter. We cannot regard the 'fair competition' of the codes as antithetical to the 'unfair methods of competition' of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The 'fair competition' of the codes has a much broader range and a new significance. The Recovery Act provides that it shall not be construed to impair the powers of the Federal Trade Commission, but, when a code is approved, its provisions are to be the 'standards of fair competition' for the trade or industry concerned, and any violation of such standards in any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce is to be deemed 'an unfair method of competition' within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act. Section 3(b) of the act, 15 USCA  703(b).\n For a statement of the authorized objectives and content of the 'codes of fair competition,' we are referred repeatedly to the 'Declaration of Policy' in section 1 of title 1 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA  701). Thus the approval of a code by the President is conditioned on his finding that it 'will tend to effectuate the policy of this title.' Section 3(a) of the act, 15 USCA  703(a). The President is authorized to impose such conditions 'for the protection of consumers, competitors, employees, and others, and in furtherance of the public interest, and may provide such exceptions to and exemptions from the provisions of such code, as the President in his discretion deems necessary to effectuate the policy herein declared.' Id. The 'policy herein declared' is manifestly that set forth in section 1. That declaration embraces a broad range of objectives. Among them we find the elimination of 'unfair competitive practices.' But, even if this clause were to be taken to relate to practices which fall under the ban of existing law, either common law or statute, it is still only one of the authorized aims described in section 1. It is there declared to be 'the policy of Congress'- 'to remove obstructions to the free flow of interstate and foreign commerce which tend to diminish the amount \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 535]\n\u00a0\n thereof; and to provide for the general welfare by promoting the organization of industry for the purpose of cooperative action among trade groups, to induce and maintain united action of labor and management under adequate governmental sanctions and supervision, to eliminate unfair competitive practices, to promote the fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of industries, to avoid undue restriction of production (except as may be temporarily required), to increase the consumption of industrial and agricultural products by increasing purchasing power, to reduce and relieve unemployment, to improve standards of labor, and otherwise to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural resources.' \n13\n\u00a0\n\n Under section 3, whatever 'may tend to effectuate' these general purposes may be included in the 'codes of fair competition.' We think the conclusion is inescapable that the authority sought to be conferred by section 3 was not merely to deal with 'unfair competitive practices' which offend against existing law, and could be the subject of judicial condemnation without further legislation, or to create administrative machinery for the application of established principles of law to particular instances of violation. Rather, the purpose is clearly disclosed to authorize new and controlling prohibitions through codes of laws which would embrace what the formulators would propose, and what the President would approve or prescribe, as wise and beneficient measures for the government of trades and industries in order to bring about their rehabilitation, correction, and development, according to the general declaration of policy in section 1. Codes of laws of this sort are styled 'codes of fair competition.'\n We find no real controversy upon this point and we must determine the validity of the code in question in this aspect. As the government candidly says in its \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 536]\n\u00a0\n brief: 'The words 'policy of this title' clearly refer to the 'policy' which Congress declared in the section entitled 'Declaration of Policy'- Section 1. All of the policies there set forth point toward a single goal- the rehabilitation of industry and the industrial recovery which unquestionably was the major policy of Congress in adopting the National Industrial Recovery Act.' And that this is the controlling purpose of the code now before us appears both from its repeated declarations to that effect and from the scope of its requirements. It will be observed that its provisions as to the hours and wages of employees and its 'general labor provisions' were placed in separate articles, and these were not included in the article on 'trade practice provisions' declaring what should be deemed to constitute 'unfair methods of competition.' The Secretary of Agriculture thus stated the objectives of the Live Poultry Code in his report to the President, which was recited in the executive order of approval:\n'That said code will tend to effectuate the declared policy of title I of the National Industrial Recovery Act as set forth in section 1 of said act in that the terms and provisions of such code tend to: (a) Remove obstructions to the free flow of interstate and foreign commerce which tend to diminish the amount thereof: (b) to provide for the general welfare by promoting the organization of industry for the purpose of cooperative action among trade groups; (c) to eliminate unfair competitive practices; (d) to promote the fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of industries; (e) to avoid undue restriction of production (except as may be temporarily required); (f) to increase the consumption of industrial and agricultural products by increasing purchasing power; and (g) otherwise to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural resources.' \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 537]\n\u00a0\n The government urges that the codes will 'consist of rules of competition deemed fair for each industry by representative members of that industry-by the persons most vitally concerned and most familiar with its problems.' Instances are cited in which Congress has availed itself of such assistance; as, e.g., in the exercise of its authority over the public domain, with respect to the recognition of local customs or rules of miners as to mining claims, 14 or, in matters of a more or less technical nature, as in designating the standard height of drawbars. \n15\n But would it be seriously contended that Congress could delegate its legislative authority to trade or industrial associations or groups so as to empower them to enact the laws they deem to be wise and beneficent for the rehabilitation and expansion of their trade or industries? Could trade or industrial associations or groups be constituted legislative bodies for that purpose because such associations or groups are familiar with the problems of their enterprises? And could an effort of that sort be made valid by such a preface of generalities as to permissible aims as we find in section 1 of title 1? The answer is obvious. Such a delegation of legislative power is unknown to our law, and is utterly inconsistent with the constitutional prerogatives and duties of Congress.\n\n The question, then, turns upon the authority which section 3 of the Recovery Act vests in the President to approve or prescribe. If the codes have standing as penal statutes, this must be due to the effect of the executive action. But Congress cannot delegate legislative power to the President to exercise an unfettered discretion to make \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 538]\n\u00a0\n whatever laws he thinks may be needed or advisable for the rehabilitation and expansion of trade or industry. See Panama Refining Company v. Ryan, supra, and cases there reviewed.\n Accordingly we turn to the Recovery Act to ascertain what limits have been set to the exercise of the President's discretion: First, the President, as a condition of approval, is required to find that the trade or industrial associations or groups which propose a code 'impose no inequitable restrictions on admission to membership' and are 'truly representative.' That condition, however, relates only to the status of the initiators of the new laws and not to the permissible scope of such laws. Second, the President is required to find that the code is not 'designed to promote monopolies or to eliminate or oppress small enterprises and will not operate to discriminate against them.' And to this is added a proviso that the code 'shall not permit monopolies or monopolistic practices.' But these restrictions leave virtually untouched the field of policy envisaged by section 1, and, in that wide field of legislative possibilities, the proponents of a code, refraining from monopolistic designs, may roam at will, and the President may approve or disapprove their proposals as he may see fit. That is the precise effect of the further finding that the President is to make-that the code 'will tend to effectuate the policy of this title.' While this is called a finding, it is really but a statement of an opinion as to the general effect upon the promotion of trade or industry of a scheme of laws. These are the only findings which Congress has made essential in order to put into operation a legislative code having the aims described in the 'Declaration of Policy.'\n Nor is the breadth of the President's discretion left to the necessary implications of this limited requirement as to his findings. As already noted, the President in approving a code may impose his own conditions, adding to \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 539]\n\u00a0\n or taking from what is proposed, as 'in his discretion' he thinks necessary 'to effectuate the policy' declared by the act. Of course, he has no less liberty when he prescribes a code on his own motion or on complaint, and he is free to prescribe one if a code has not been approved. The act provides for the creation by the President of administrative agencies to assist him, but the action or reports of such agencies, or of his other assistants-their recommendations and findings in relation to the making of codes-have no sanction beyond the will of the President, who may accept, modify, or reject them as he pleases. Such recommendations or findings in no way limit the authority which section 3 undertakes to vest in the President with no other conditions than those there specified. And this authority relates to a host of different trades and industries, thus extending the President's discretion to all the varieties of laws which he may deem to be beneficial in dealing with the vast array of commercial and industrial activities throughout the country.\n Such a sweeping delegation of legislative power finds no support in the decisions upon which the government especially relies. By the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.), Congress has itself provided a code of laws regulating the activities of the common carriers subject to the act, in order to assure the performance of their services upon just and reasonable terms, with adequate facilities and without unjust discrimination. Congress from time to time has elaborated its requirements, as needs have been disclosed. To facilitate the application of the standards prescribed by the act, Congress has provided an expert body. That administrative agency, in dealing with particular cases, is required to act upon notice and hearing, and its orders must be supported by findings of fact which in turn are sustained by evidence. Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company, \n227 \nU.S. 88\n, 33 S.Ct. 185; State of Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119; United States \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 540]\n\u00a0\n v. Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, \n293 \nU.S. 454\n, 55 S.Ct. 268. When the Commission is authorized to issue, for the construction, extension, or abandonment of lines, a certificate of 'public convenience and necessity,' or to permit the acquisition by one carrier of the control of another, if that is found to be 'in the public interest,' we have pointed out that these provisions are not left without standards to guide determination. The authority conferred has direct relation to the standards prescribed for the service of common carriers, and can be exercised only upon findings, based upon evidence, with respect to particular conditions of transportation. New York Central Securities Corporation v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 25 S., 53 S.Ct. 45; Texas & Pacific Railway Co. v. Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe Railway Co., \n270 \nU.S. 266, 273\n, 46 S.Ct. 263; Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 35, 42\n, 51 S.Ct. 337.\n Similarly, we have held that the Radio Act of 192716 established standards to govern radio communications, and, in view of the limited number of available broadcasting frequencies, Congress authorized allocation and licenses. The Federal Radio Commission was created as the licensing authority, in order to secure a reasonable equality of opportunity in radio transmission and reception. The authority of the Commission to grant licenses 'as public convenience, interest or necessity requires' was limited by the nature of radio communications, and by the scope, character, and quality of the services to be rendered and the relative advantages to be derived through distribution of facilities. These standards established by Congress were to be enforced upon hearing and evidence by an administrative body acting under statutory restrictions adapted to the particular activity. Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Brothers Bond & Mtg. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266\n, 53 S.Ct. 627\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 495, 541]\n\u00a0\n In Hampton, Jr. & Company v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S.Ct. 348, 350 the question related to the 'flexible tariff provision' of the Tariff Act of 1922.17 We held that Congress had described its plan 'to secure by law the imposition of customs duties on articles of imported merchandise which should equal the difference between the cost of producing in a foreign country the articles in question and laying them down for sale in the United States, and the cost of producing and selling like or similar articles in the United States.' As the differences in cost might vary from time to time, provision was made for the investigation and determination of these differences by the executive branch so as to make 'the adjustments necessary to conform the duties to the standard underlying that policy and plan.' Id. \n276 U.S. 394\n, pages 404, 405, 48 S.Ct. 348, 350. The Court found the same principle to be applicable in fixing customs duties as that which permitted Congress to exercise its rate-making power in interstate commerce, 'by declaring the rule which shall prevail in the legislative fixing of rates,' and then remitting 'the fixing of such rates' in accordance with its provisions 'to a rate-making body.' Id. \n276 U.S. 394\n, page 409, 48 S.Ct. 348, 352. The Court fully recognized the limitations upon the delegation of legislative power. Id. \n276 U.S. 394\n, pages 408-411, 48 S.Ct. 348.\n To summarize and conclude upon this point: Section 3 of the Recovery Act (15 USCA  703 is without precedent. It supplies no standards for any trade, industry, or activity. It does not undertake to prescribe rules of conduct to be applied to particular states of fact determined by appropriate administrative procedure. Instead of prescribing rules of conduct, it authorizes the making of codes to prescribe them. For that legislative undertaking, section 3 sets up no standards, aside from the statement of the general aims of rehabilitation, correction, and expansion described in section 1. In view of the scope of that broad declaration and of the \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 542]\n\u00a0\n nature of the few restrictions that are imposed, the discretion of the President in approving or prescribing codes, and thus enacting laws for the government of trade and industry throughout the country, is virtually unfettered. We think that the code-making authority thus conferred is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.\n Third. The Question of the Application of the Provisions of the Live Poultry Code to Intrastate Transactions.-Although the validity of the codes (apart from the question of delegation) rests upon the commerce clause of the Constitution, section 3(a) of the act (15 USCA  703(a) is not in terms limited to interstate and foreign commerce. From the generality of its terms, and from the argument of the government at the bar, it would appear that section 3(a) was designed to authorize codes without that limitation. But under section 3(f) of the act (15 USCA  73(f) penalties are confined to violations of a code provision 'in any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.' This aspect of the case presents the question whether the particular provisions of the Live Poultry Code, which the defendants were convicted for violating and for having conspired to violate, were within the regulating power of Congress.\n These provisions relate to the hours and wages of those employed by defendants in their slaughterhouses in Brooklyn and to the sales there made to retail dealers and butchers.\n Were these transactions 'in' interstate commerce? Much is made of the fact that almost all the poultry coming to New York is sent there from other states. But the code provisions, as here applied, do not concern the transportation of the poultry from other states to New York, or the transactions of the commission men or others to whom it is consigned, or the sales made by such consignees to defendants. When defendants had made their purchases, whether at the West Washington Market in New York City or at the railroad \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 543]\n\u00a0\n terminals serving the city, or elsewhere, the poultry was trucked to their slaughterhouses in Brooklyn for local disposition. The interstate transactions in relation to that poultry then ended. Defendants held the poultry at their slaughterhouse markets for slaughter and local sale to retail dealers and butchers who in turn sold directly to consumers. Neither the slaughtering nor the sales by defendants were transactions in interstate commerce. Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622, 632\n, 633 S., 5 S.Ct. 1091; Public Utilities Commission v. Landon, \n249 \nU.S. 236, 245\n, 39 S.Ct. 268; Industrial Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64, 78\n, 79 S., 45 S.Ct. 403; Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Standard Oil Co., \n275 \nU.S. 257, 267\n, 48 S.Ct. 107.\n The undisputed facts thus afford no warrant for the argument that the poultry handled by defendants at their slaughterhouse markets was in a 'current' or 'flow' of interstate commerce, and was thus subject to congressional regulation. The mere fact that there may be a constant flow of commodities into a state does not mean that the flow continues after the property has arrived and has become commingled with the mass of property within the state and is there held solely for local disposition and use. So far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow in interstate commerce had ceased. The poultry had come to a permanent rest within the state. It was not held, used, or sold by defendants in relation to any further transactions in interstate commerce and was not destined for transportation to other states. Hence decisions which deal with a stream of interstate commerce-where goods come to rest within a state temporarily and are later to go forward in interstate commerce-and with the regulations of transactions involved in that practical continuity of movement, are not applicable here. See Swift & Company v. United States, \n196 \nU.S. 375, 387\n, 388 S., 25 S.Ct. 276; Lemke v. Farmers' Grain Company, \n258 \nU.S. 50, 55\n, 42 S.Ct. 244; Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 519\n, 42 S.Ct. 397, 23 A.L.R. 229; Board of Trade of City of Chi- \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 544]\n\u00a0\n cago v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1, 35\n, 43 S.Ct. 470; Tagg Bros. & Moorhead v. United States, \n280 \nU.S. 420, 439\n, 50 S.Ct. 220.\n Did the defendants' transactions directly 'affect' interstate commerce so as to be subject to federal regulation? The power of Congress extends, not only to the regulation of transactions which are part of interstate commerce, but to the protection of that commerce from injury. It matters not that the injury may be due to the conduct of those engaged in intrastate operations. Thus, Congress may protect the safety of those employed in interstate transportation, 'no matter what may be the source of the dangers which threaten it.' Southern Railway Company v. United States, \n222 \nU.S. 20, 27\n, 32 S.Ct. 2, 4. We said in Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co. (Second Employers' Liability Cases), \n223 \nU.S. 1, 51\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, that it is the 'effect upon interstate commerce,' not 'the source of the injury,' which is 'the criterion of congressional power.' We have held that, in dealing with common carriers engaged in both interstate and intrastate commerce, the dominant authority of Congress necessarily embraces the right to control their intrastate operations in all matters having such a close and substantial relation to interstate traffic that the control is essential or appropriate to secure the freedom of that traffic from interference or unjust discrimination and to promote the efficiency of the interstate service. Houston, E. & W.T.R. Co. v. U.S. (The Shreveport Case), \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 352 S., 34 S.Ct. 833; Railroad Commission of State of Wisconsin v. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co., \n257 \nU.S. 563, 588\n, 42 S.Ct. 232, 22 A.L.R. 1086. And combinations and conspiracies to restrain interstate commerce, or to monopolize any part of it, are none the less within the reach of the Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1 et seq.) because the conspirators seek to attain their end by means of intrastate activities. Coronado Coal Company v. United Mine Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 551; Bedford Cut Stone Company v. Journeyman Stone Cutters' Association, \n274 \nU.S. 37, 46\n, 47 S.Ct. 522, 54 A.L.R. 791.\n We recently had occasion, in Local 167 V. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 293\n, 54 S.Ct. 396, to apply this principle in connection with \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 545]\n\u00a0\n the live poultry industry. That was a suit to enjoin a conspiracy to restrain and monopolize interstate commerce in violation of the Anti-Trust Act. It was shown that marketmen, teamsters, and slaughterers (shochtim) had conspired to burden the free movement of live poultry into the metropolitan area in and about New York City. Marketmen had organized an association, had allocated retailers among themselves, and had agreed to increase prices. To accomplish their objects, large amounts of money were raised by levies upon poultry sold, men were hired to obstruct the business of dealers who resisted, wholesalers and retailers were spied upon, and by violence and other forms of intimidation were prevented from freely purchasing live poultry. Teamsters refused to handle poultry for recalcitrant marketmen, and members of the shochtim union refused to slaughter. In view of the proof of that conspiracy, we said that it was unnecessary to decide when interstate commerce ended and when intrastate commerce began. We found that the proved interference by the conspirators 'with the unloading, the transportation, the sales by marketmen to retailers, the prices charged, and the amount of profits exacted' operated 'substantially and directly to restrain and burden the untrammelled shipment and movement of the poultry,' while unquestionably it was in interstate commerce. The intrastate acts of the conspirators were included in the injunction because that was found to be necessary for the protection of interstate commerce against the attempted and illegal restraint. Id. \n291 U.S. 293\n, pp. 297, 299, 300, 54 S.Ct. 396, 398.\n The instant case is not of that sort. This is not a prosecution for a conspiracy to restrain or monopolize interstate commerce in violation of the Anti-Trust Act. Defendants have been convicted, not upon direct charges of injury to interstate commerce or of interference with persons engaged in that commerce, but of violations of certain provisions of the Live Poultry Code and of con- \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 546]\n\u00a0\n spiracy to commit these violations. Interstate commerce is brought in only upon the charge that violations of these provisions-as to hours and wages of employees and local sales-'affected' interstate commerce.\n In determining how far the federal government may go in controlling intrastate transactions upon the ground that they 'affect' interstate commerce, there is a necessary and well-established distinction between direct and indirect effects. The precise line can be drawn only as individual cases arise, but the distinction is clear in principle. Direct effects are illustrated by the railroad cases we have cited, as, e.g., the effect of failure to use prescribed safety appliances on railroads which are the highways of both interstate and intrastate commerce, injury to an employee engaged in interstate transportation by the negligence of an employee engaged in an intrastate movement, the fixing of rates for intrastate transportation which unjustly discriminate against interstate commerce. But where the effect of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce is merely indirect, such transactions remain within the domain of state power. If the commerce clause were construed to reach all enterprises and transactions which could be said to have an indirect effect upon interstate commerce, the federal authority would embrace practically all the activities of the people, and the authority of the state over its domestic concerns would exist only by sufferance of the federal government. Indeed, on such a theory, even the development of the state's commercial facilities would be subject to federal control. As we said in Simpson v. Shepard (Minnesota Rate Case), \n230 \nU.S. 352, 410\n, 33 S. Ct. 729, 745, 48 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18: 'In the intimacy of commercial relations, much that is done in the superintendence of local matters may have an indirect bearing upon interstate commerce. The development of local resources and the extension of local facilities may have a very important effect upon communities less favored, and to an appreciable degree \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 547]\n\u00a0\n alter the course of trade. The freedom of local trade may stimulate interstate commerce, while restrictive measures within the police power of the state, enacted exclusively with respect to internal business, as distinguished from interstate traffic, may in their reflex or indirect influence diminish the latter and reduce the volume of articles transported into or out of the state.' See, also, Kidd v. Pearson, \n128 \nU.S. 1, 21\n, 9 S.Ct. 6; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245, 259\n, 260 S., 43 S.Ct. 83.\n The distinction between direct and indirect effects has been clearly recognized in the application of the Anti-Trust Act. Where a combination or conspiracy is formed, with the intent to restrain interstate commerce or to monopolize any part of it, the violation of the statute is clear. Coronado Coal Company v. United Mine Workers, \n268 \nU.S. 295, 310\n, 45 S.Ct. 551. But, where that intent is absent, and the objectives are limited to intrastate activities, the fact that there may be an indirect effect upon interstate commerce does not subject the parties to the federal statute, notwithstanding its broad provisions. This principle has frequently been applied in litigation growing out of labor disputes. United Mine Workers v. Coronado Coal Company, \n259 \nU.S. 344, 410\n, 411 S., 42 S. Ct. 570, 27 A.L.R. 762; United Leather Workers' International Union v. Herkert, \n265 U.S. 457\n, 464-467, 44 S.Ct. 623, 33 A.L.R. 566; Industrial Association v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 64, 82\n, 45 S.Ct. 403; Levering & Garrigues v. Morrin, \n289 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 108 S., 53 S.Ct. 549, 551. In the case last cited we quoted with approval the rule that had been stated and applied in Industrial Association v. United States, supra, after review of the decisions, as follows: 'The alleged conspiracy, and the acts here complained of, spent their intended and direct force upon a local situation-for building is as essentially local as mining, manufacturing or growing crops-and if, by resulting diminution of the commercial demand, interstate trade was curtailed either generally or in specific instances that was a fortuitous consequence so remote and indirect \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 548]\n\u00a0\n as plainly to cause it to fall outside the reach of the Sherman Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15 note).'\n While these decisions related to the application of the Federal statute, and not to its constitutional validity, the distinction between direct and indirect effects of intrastate transactions upon interstate commerce must be recognized as a fundamental one, essential to the maintenance of our constitutional system. Otherwise, as we have said, there would be virtually no limit to the federal power, and for all practical purposes we should have a completely centralized government. We must consider the provisions here in question in the light of this distinction.\n The question of chief importance relates to the provisions of the code as to the hours and wages of those employed in defendants' slaughterhouse markets. It is plain that these requirements are imposed in order to govern the details of defendants' management of their local business. The persons employed in slaughtering and selling in local trade are not employed in interstate commerce. Their hours and wages have no direct relation to interstate commerce. The question of how many hours these employees should work and what they should be paid differs in no essential respect from similar questions in other local businesses which handle commodities brought into a state and there dealt in as a part of its internal commerce. This appears from an examination of the considerations urged by the government with respect to conditions in the poultry trade. Thus, the government argues that hours and wages affect prices; that slaughterhouse men sell at a small margin above operating costs; that labor represents 50 to 60 per cent. of these costs; that a slaughterhouse operator paying lower wages or reducing his cost by exacting long hours of work translates his saving into lower prices; that this results in demands for a cheaper grade of goods: and that the cutting \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 549]\n\u00a0\n of prices brings about a demoralization of the price structure. Similar conditions may be adduced in relation to other businesses. The argument of the government proves too much. If the federal government may determine the wages and hours of employees in the internal commerce of a state, because of their relation to cost and prices and their indirect effect upon interstate commerce, it would seem that a similar control might be exerted over other elements of cost, also affecting prices, such as the number of employees, rents, advertising, methods of doing business, etc. All the processes of production and distribution that enter into cost could likewise be controlled. If the cost of doing an intrastate business is in itself the permitted object of federal control, the extent of the regulation of cost would be a question of discretion and not of power.\n The government also makes the point that efforts to enact state legislation establishing high labor standards have been impeded by the belief that, unless similar action is taken generally, commerce will be diverted from the states adopting such standards, and that this fear of diversion has led to demands for federal legislation on the subject of wages and hours. The apparent implication is that the federal authority under the commerce clause should be deemed to extend to the establishment of rules to govern wages and hours in intrastate trade and industry generally throughout the country, thus overriding the authority of the states to deal with domestic problems arising from labor conditions in their internal commerce.\n It is not the province of the Court to consider the economic advantages or disadvantages of such a centralized system. It is sufficient to say that the Federal Constitution does not provide for it. Our growth and development have called for wide use of the commerce power of the federal government in its control over the expanded activities of interstate commerce and in protecting that \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 550]\n\u00a0\n commerce from burdens, interferences, and conspiracies to restrain and monopolize it. But the authority of the federal government may not be pushed to such an extreme as to destroy the distinction, which the commerce clause itself establishes, between commerce 'among the several States' and the internal concerns of a state. The same answer must be made to the contention that is based upon the serious economic situation which led to the passage of the Recovery Act-the fall in prices, the decline in wages and employment, and the curtailment of the market for commodities. Stress is laid upon the great importance of maintaining wage distributions which would provide the necessary stimulus in starting 'the cumulative forces making for expanding commercial activity.' Without in any way disparaging this motive, it is enough to say that the recuperative efforts of the federal government must be made in a manner consistent with the authority granted by the Constitution.\n We are of the opinion that the attempt through the provisions of the code to fix the hours and wages of employees of defendants in their intrastate business was not a valid exercise of federal power.\n The other violations for which defendants were convicted related to the making of local sales. Ten counts, for violation of the provision as to 'straight killing,' were for permitting customers to make 'selections of individual chickens taken from particular coops and half coops.' Whether or not this practice is good or bad for the local trade, its effect, if any, upon interstate commerce was only indirect. The same may be said of violations of the code by intrastate transactions consisting of the sale 'of an unfit chicken' and of sales which were not in accord with the ordinances of the city of New York. The requirement of reports as to prices and volumes of defendants' sales was incident to the effort to control their intrastate business. \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 551]\n\u00a0\n In view of these conclusions, we find it unnecessary to discuss other questions which have been raised as to the validity of certain provisions of the code under the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n On both the grounds we have discussed, the attempted delegation of legislative power and the attempted regulation of intrastate transactions which affect interstate commerce only indirectly, we hold the code provisions here in question to be invalid and that the judgment of conviction must be reversed. \n No. 854\n-reversed.\n No. 864-affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (concurring).\n The delegated power of legislation which has found expression in this code is not canalized within banks that keep it from overflowing. It is unconfined and vagrant, if I may borrow my own words in an earlier opinion. Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388, 440\n, 55 S.Ct. 241.\n This court has held that delegation may be unlawful, though the act to be performed is definite and single, if the necessity, time, and occasion of performance have been left in the end to the discretion of the delegate. Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, supra. I thought that ruling went too far. I pointed out in an opinion that there had been 'no grant to the Executive of any roving commission to inquire into evils and then, upon discovering them, do anything he pleases.' \n293 U.S. 388\n, at page 435, 55 S. Ct. 241, 254. Choice, though within limits, had been given him 'as to the occasion, but none whatever as to the means.' Id. Here, in the case before us, is an attempted delegation not confined to any single act nor to any class or group of acts identified or described by reference to a standard. Here in effect is a roving commission to inquire into evils and upon discovery correct them. \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 552]\n\u00a0\n I have said that there is no standard, definite or even approximate, to which legislation must conform. Let me make my meaning more precise. If codes of fair competition are codes eliminating 'unfair' methods of competition ascertained upon inquiry to prevail in one industry or another, there is no unlawful delegation of legislative functions when the President is directed to inquire into such practices and denounce them when discovered. For many years a like power has been committed to the Federal Trade Commission with the approval of this court in a long series of decisions. Cf. Federal Trade Commission v. R.F. Keppel & Bro., \n291 \nU.S. 304, 312\n, 54 S.Ct. 423; Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 648\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191; Federal Trade Commission v. Gratz, \n253 \nU.S. 421\n, 40 S.Ct. 572. Delegation in such circumstances is born of the necessities of the occasion. The industries of the country are too many and diverse to make it possible for Congress, in respect of matters such as these, to legislate directly with adequate appreciation of varying conditions. Nor is the substance of the power changed because the President may act at the instance of trade or industrial associations having special knowledge of the facts. Their function is strictly advisory; it is the imprimatur of the President that begets the quality of law. Doty v. Love, \n295 \nU.S. 64\n, 55 S.Ct. 558, 79 L.Ed. --. When the task that is set before one is that of cleaning house, it is prudent as well as usual to take counsel of the dwellers.\n But there is another conception of codes of fair competition, their significance and function, which leads to very different consequences, though it is one that is struggling now for recognition and acceptance. By this other conception a code is not to be restricted to the elimination of business practices that would be characterized by general acceptation as oppressive or unfair. It is to include whatever ordinances may be desirable or helpful for the well-being or prosperity of the industry \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 553]\n\u00a0\n affected. In that view, the function of its adoption is not merely negative, but positive; the planning of improvements as well as the extirpation of abuses. What is fair, as thus conceived, is not something to be contrasted with what is unfair or fraudulent or tricky. The extension becomes as wide as the field of industrial regulation. If that conception shall prevail, anything that Congress may do within the limits of the commerce clause for the betterment of business may be done by the President upon the recommendation of a trade association by calling it a code. This is delegation running riot. No such plenitude of power is susceptible of transfer. The statute, however, aims at nothing less, as one can learn both from its terms and from the administrative practice under it. Nothing less is aimed at by the code now submitted to our scrutiny.\n The code does not confine itself to the suppression of methods of competition that would be classified as unfair according to accepted business standards or accepted norms of ethics. It sets up a comprehensive body of rules to promote the welfare of the industry, if not the welfare of the nation, without reference to standards, ethical or commercial, that could be known or predicted in advance of its adoption. One of the new rules, the source of ten counts in the indictment, is aimed at an established practice, not unethical or oppressive, the practice of selective buying. Many others could be instanced as open to the same objection if the sections of the code were to be examined one by one. The process of dissection will not be traced in all its details. Enough at this time to state what it reveals. Even if the statute itself had fixed the meaning of fair competition by way of contrast with practices that are oppressive or unfair, the code outruns the bounds of the authority conferred. What is excessive is not sporadic or superficial. It is deep- seated and per- \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 554]\n\u00a0\n vasive. The licit and illicit sections are so combined and welded as to be incapable of severance without destructive mutilation.\n But there is another objection, far-reaching and incurable, aside from any defect of unlawful delegation.\n If this code had been adopted by Congress itself, and not by the President on the advice of an industrial association, it would even then be void, unless authority to adopt it is included in the grant of power 'to regulare commerce with foreign nations, and among the several States.' United States Constitution, art. 1,  8, cl. 3.\n I find no authority in that grant for the regulation of wages and hours of labor in the intrastate transactions that make up the defendants' business. As to this feature of the case, little can be added to the opinion of the court. There is a view of causation that would obliterate the distinction between what is national and what is local in the activities of commerce. Motion at the outer rim is communicated perceptibly, though minutely, to recording instruments at the center. A society such as ours 'is an elastic medium which transmits all tremors throughout its territory; the only question is of their size.' Per Learned Hand, J., in the court below. The law is not indifferent to considerations of degree. Activities local in their immediacy do not become interstate and national because of distant repercussions. What is near and what is distant may at times be uncertain. Cf. Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen, \n262 \nU.S. 1\n, 43 S.Ct. 470. There is no penumbra of uncertainty obscuring judgment here. To find immediacy or directness here is to find it almost everywhere. If centripetal forces are to be isolated to the exclusion of the forces that oppose and counteract them, there will be an end to our federal system.\n To take from this code the provisions as to wages and the hours of labor is to destroy it altogether. If a trade or an industry is so predominantly local as to be exempt \n\n[295 U.S. 495, 555]\n\u00a0\n from regulation by the Congress in respect of matters such as these, there can be no 'code' for it at all. This is clear from the provisions of section 7(a) of the act (15 USCA  707(a), with its explicit disclosure of the statutory scheme. Wages and the hours of labor are essential features of the plan, its very bone and sinew. There is no opportunity in such circumstances for the severance of the infected parts in the hope of saving the remainder.

(a) Upon the application to the President by one or more trade or industrial associations or groups, the President may approve a code or codes of fair competition for the trade or industry or subdivision thereof, represented by the applicant or applicants, if the President finds (1) that such associations or groups impose no inequitable restrictions on admission to membership therein and are truly representative of such trades or industries or subdivisions thereof, and ( 2) that such code or codes are not designed to promote monopolies or to eliminate or oppress small enterprises and will not operate to discriminate against them, and will tend to effectuate the policy of this title: Provided, That such code or codes shall not permit monopolies or monopolistic practices: Provided further, That where such code or codes affect the services and welfare of persons engaged in other steps of the economic process, nothing in this section shall deprive such persons of the right to be heard prior to approval by the President of such code or codes. The President may, as a condition of his approval of any such code, impose such conditions (including requirements for the making of reports and the keeping of accounts) for the protection of consumers, competitors, employees, and others, and in furtherance of the public interest, and may provide such exceptions to and exemptions from the provisions of such code. as the President in his discretion deems necessary to effectuate the policy herein declared.\n\n'(b) After the President shall have approved any such code, the provisions of such code shall be the standards of fair competition for such trade or industry or subdivision thereof. Any violation of such standards in any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce shall be deemed an unfair method of competition in commerce within the meaning of the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended ( chapter 2 of this title); but nothing in this title (chapter) shall be construed to impair the powers of the Federal Trade Commission under such Act, as amended (chapter 2). \n\n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The executive order is as follows:\n'Executive Order.\n\n'Approval of Code of Fair Competition for the Live Poultry Industry of the Metropolitan Area in and about the City of New York.\n\n'Whereas, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the National Industrial Recovery Act having rendered their separate reports and recommendations and findings on the provisions of said code, coming within their respective jurisdictions, as set forth in the Executive Order No. 6182 of June 26, 1933, as supplemented by Executive Order No. 6207 of July 21, 1933, and Executive Order N. 6345 of October 20, 1933, as amended by Executive Order No. 6551 of January 8, 1934;\n\n'Now, therefore, I, Franklin D.

He further said that about 1,610 employees were engaged in the industry; that it had suffered severely on account of the prevailing economic conditions and because of unfair methods of competition and the abuses that had developed as a result of the 'uncontrolled methods of doing business'; and that these conditions had reduced the number of employees by approximately 40 per cent. He added that the report of the Research and Planning Division indicated that the code would bring about an increase in wages of about 20 per cent. in this industry and an increase in employment of 19.2 per cent. \n[\nFootnote 7\n] The prohibition in the code (article VII,  14) was as follows: 'Straight Killing.-The use, in the wholesale slaughtering of poultry, of any method of slaughtering other than 'straight killing' or killing on the basis of official grade.

Eckert, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner brought this action at law as beneficiary of several policies of insurance issued by respondent. The policies were alleged to have been issued in April, 1932, upon the life of petitioner's father who died in July, 1932. The policies were to be incontestable after two \n\n[293 U.S. 386, 387]\n\u00a0\n years from date of issue. The action was brought in a state court in Pennsylvania and was removed to the federal court in February, 1933. Respondent's affidavit of defense set up as new matter that the insured had made false answers and declarations in his application with respect to a surgical operation he had undergone and to the treatment he had received by physicians and at hospitals, that the insured knew that these answers and declarations were false. and that they had been made by the insured 'fraudulently with the intent of deceiving the defendant into issuing to him the policies of insurance in litigation, when the facts were such that if he had answered said questions truthfully and had made a full and honest disclosure, the defendant would not have issued any of said policies but would have declined his application.' Respondent tendered judgment for the amount of the premiums received by it, with interest, and prayed that the policies be canceled. Petitioner replied, denying the allegations of fraud.\n Respondent asked that the equitable issue raised by its affidavit of defense should be heard under section 274b of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C .  398 (28 USCA  398)) 'by a chancellor according to equity procedure in advance of the trial by jury at law of any purely legal issues.' The application was granted over petitioner's objection, and the issue of fraud was tried in equity. The District Judge decided that it was 'a very plain case of fraud upon the insurance company,' that the insured had 'falsely answered the questions as to his medical history,' and that these questions were all as to 'matters of fact within his knowledge.' 5 F.Supp. 278, 280; 5 F.Supp. 1019\n\n\n Decree was entered canceling the policies and providing for the repayment of the premiums tendered. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals (71 F.(2d) 997), and this Court granted certiorari November 12, 1934 (\n293 \nU.S. 549\n, 55 S.Ct. 148, 79 L.Ed. --). \n\n[293 U.S. 386, 388]\n\u00a0\n What we have said in Enelow v.

The issue of fraud raised by respondent's affidavit of defense was fully available in the action at law, and the court erred in directing the trial of that issue in equity.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded to the District Court, with direction to vacate its decree and to proceed with the trial of the action at law.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nADAMS v. CHAMPION(1935)\nNo. 374\nArgued: Decided: February 4, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 231, 232]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John F. Anderson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Harry C. Heyl, of Peoria, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A trustee in bankruptcy asserts a claim against the receiver of a national bank for the value of property received by the bank as an unlawful preference. The receiver admits the validity of the claim if it is placed upon the same level as the claims of creditors at large. The trustee insists that the claim must have priority on the ground that the avails of the unlawful preference are subject to a trust. \n\n[294 U.S. 231, 233]\n\u00a0\n In September, 1928, the bankrupt, John Fitzgerald, had overdrawn his deposit account with the Farmers' National Bank of Pekin, Ill., and was also indebted to the bank upon promissory notes. In response to a demand for collateral security he delivered to the bank notes of other persons, as well as a certificate of stock, the whole of the face or par value of about $35,000. Most of the securities so delivered have been returned to the trustee and are not in controversy now. Four items only are the subject of this suit.\n The bank received from Fitzgerald on September 7, 1928, a certificate for ten shares of its own stock, a promissory note of Charles Graff for $3, 000, a promissory note of W. C. Sommer for $1,000, and notes or bonds of Veesaert for $5,000, reduced later by $1,597.31 paid upon account. Within a period of four months (on October 26, 1928), creditors of Fitzgerald filed a petition in bankruptcy, an adjudication following in November of that year. No election was made by the trustee in bankruptcy to reclaim the collateral as an unlawful preference till July 20, 1929, or if there was an earlier election, it is not shown by the record. In the meantime the bank, which continued as a going concern until January, 1932, had disposed of three of the contested items of security as follows: On February 9, 1929, after having credited the bankrupt with a dividend of $ 30, it sold the ten shares of its own stock to one Cullinan, a depositor. The price was $3,000, by concession the fair value. Payment was effected by charging the deposit account of the purchaser with what was owing for the shares. On April 12, 1929, the bank collected $3,183.78 upon the note of Charles Graff by charging that amount against the deposit balance to his credit. On April 16, 1929, it collected $1,059.98 upon the note of W. C. Sommer by a charge against his balance. Nothing was received upon the Veesaert bonds, the fourth contested item, till December, \n\n[294 U.S. 231, 234]\n\u00a0\n 1930. The bank then had a payment on account to the extent of $1,597.31 the payment being made by the deposit of a check to its credit in the First National Bank of Chicago, Ill. The balance in that account was afterwards reduced to $776.57, which latter amount, together with the bonds themselves, the receiver stands ready to transfer to the trustee.\n The election by the trustee to reclaim the collateral securities in behalf of the estate was announced, as we have seen, on July 20, 1929, and was manifested by the beginning of a suit for appropriate relief. No charge was made that the transaction was voidable for any actual fraud. The suit was under section 60b of the National Bankruptcy Act (11 U.S.C.  96(b), 11 USCA  96(b) upon the ground that the effect of the transaction was to prefer one creditor over others, and that the creditor, the bank, had reasonable cause to believe that such effect would follow.* Under Schoenthal v. Irving Trust Co., \n287 \nU.S. 92\n, 53 S.Ct. 50, an action at law could have been maintained for the recovery of the property or its value. Without objection, however, the suit was tried in equity. Cf. Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co., \n289 \nU.S. 227, 235\n, 53 S.Ct. 539. It ended on June 24, 1932, in a decree invalidating the transactions of September 7, 1928, as constituting a forbidden preference, and directing the return of the securities, or the value of such as had been converted into money.\n During the years of litigation the bank had suffered reverses, and on January 8, 1932, it was closed by the \n\n[294 U.S. 231, 235]\n\u00a0\n Comptroller of the Currency. The receiver appointed by the Comptroller was not a party to the suit to invalidate the preference. After the entry of a decree, the trustee in bankruptcy petitioned for an order instructing the receiver that the four contested items were a preferred charge upon the assets, and that payment should be made accordingly. The District Court granted the relief prayed for, and upon appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit the order was affirmed. 70 F.(2d) 956. A writ of certiorari issued from this court. \n293 \nU.S. 547\n, 55 S.Ct. 122, 79 L.Ed. --.\n If we except a small item conceded by the receiver, we think the reasons are inadequate for the imposition of a trust in the nature of a preference upon the funds of this insolvent bank.\n\n 1. \nFor convenience the first of the contested items, the proceeds of the stock certificate, will be considered by itself, the conclusion appropriate for this item being typical of the conclusion appropriate for the others.\n The acceptance by the bank of the certificate delivered by Fitzgerald on September 7, 1928, was not a wrongful act whereby the bank forthwith became subject to the duties and liabilities of a trustee ex maleficio. One who acquires a security with reasonable cause to believe that the effect will be a preference does not from that alone become a party to a fraud. Van Iderstine v. National Discount Co., \n227 \nU.S. 575, 582\n, 33 S.Ct. 343; Watson v. Adams (C.C.A.) 242 F. 441, 444, 445; Dean v. Davis, \n242 \nU.S. 438, 444\n, 37 S.Ct. 130; Keppel v. Tiffin Savings Bank, \n197 \nU.S. 356\n, 25 S.Ct. 443; Carson v. Federal Reserve Bank, 254 N.Y. 218, 234, 172 N.E. 475, 70 A.L.R. 435. If bankruptcy is averted altogether, or postponed beyond four months, the security will stand, though a preference was intended at the time of its acceptance. So also a change of assets or liabilities before bankruptcy arrives may mean the difference between a preference and a ratable division. Haas v. Sachs (C.C.A.) 68 F.(2d) 623; Irving Trust Co. v. Townsend (C.C.A.) 65 F.(2d) 406, 408; Mansfield \n\n[294 U.S. 231, 236]\n\u00a0\n Lumber Co. v. Sternberg (C.C.A.) 38 F. (2d) 614, 617; Rogers v. Page (C.C. A.) 140 F. 596, 606; In re Henry C. King Co. (D.C.) 113 F. 110, 111; Rubenstein v. Lottow, 223 Mass. 227, 229 et seq., 111 N.E. 973. The bank took the risk that in future and indeterminate contingencies it might be compelled to return what it accepted or the value. At the outset it was not a trustee ex maleficio or otherwise. It was a bailee and nothing more.\n If a trust was not created in September, 1928, through the acceptance of a security which has turned out to be a preference, none was in existence on February 9, 1929, when part of that security, the certificate of stock, was delivered to a purchaser. True, by that time the debtor was in bankruptcy, but the other uncertainties, for anything here shown, were as indefinite as ever. The accurate determination of assets and liabilities had still to wait upon the process of proof and liquidation. At most the security was voidable, not void, and the trustee up to that time had made no move to avoid it. A suit would have been a sufficient election, even though not preceded by a demand (Eau Claire National Bank v. Jackman, \n204 \nU.S. 522, 534\n, 535 S., 27 S.Ct. 391; Stephens v. Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co. (C.C.A.) 36 F.(2d) 953), but as yet there had been no suit, nor statement that a suit was coming. To turn the bank into a wrongdoer in the absence of actual fraud, to charge it with all the liabilities growing out of a constructive trust, there was need of some act of avoidance that would put the brand of guilt upon it. Cf. Boyd v. Dunlap, 1 Johns. Ch. (N.Y.) 478, 482, per Kent, Ch. We hear of no such act till July, 1929, when the trustee in bankruptcy brought suit to declare the preference a nullity.\n The sale of the stock certificate to Cullinan on February 9, 1929, must be approached and considered in the light of the relation then existing. There was then no \n\n[294 U.S. 231, 237]\n\u00a0\n trust ex maleficio, whereby the bank was chargeable as a wrongdoer for parting with the shares. There was no trust implied in fact, unless it be the fiduciary obligation assumed by a bailee to act with prudence and fidelity in the disposition of the pledge. The trustee does not assert that this obligation has been violated. On the contrary he concedes that the price was equal to the value. With its duty thus defined and measured, the bank agreed with Cullinan to accept payment of the price by cancelling to an equivalent extent the debt due him as a depositor. Cf. Jennings v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. (Feb. 4, 1935) \n294 \nU.S. 216\n, 55 S.Ct. 394; Old Company's Lehigh, Inc., v. Meeker (Feb. 4, 1935) \n294 \nU.S. 227\n, 55 S.Ct. 392. We do not need to consider whether effect would be given to such an agreement according to its form if the bank at that time had been under a present duty to set up a trust as to the proceeds to the use of the bankrupt or of the trustee as his successor. For the purposes of this case we assume, though we do not hold, that a trust in that event would attach to the cash assets in the vaults to an equivalent amount. A different result follows when there is neither trust to be set up nor wilful wrong to be repaired. The bank, when it parted with the certificate, had a solvent, going business, and did not make the transfer with any fraudulent or obstructive purpose. There is no reason in such circumstances why the transaction should be treated retrospectively as something other than it was meant to be. Jennings v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., supra. Equity fashions a trust with flexible adaptation to the call of the occasion.\n Other remedies were at hand sufficient for the needs of justice. When the preference was avoided, the bank became chargeable like any common law debtor with a duty of restitution to the extent of the value of the property disposed of. There might even be a duty, if the proceeds \n\n[294 U.S. 231, 238]\n\u00a0\n were intact, to make return in specie. But what is here sought is very different. By a process of analysis a unitary transaction, the cancellation of a debt to a depositor, is treated as if split up into two parts, a fictitious withdrawal by the depositor of coin or other currency, and its return to the bank to be applied upon the purchase. The money so returned is then subjected to a trust and though mingled with other money is viewed as retaining its identity so long as any portion of the fund is discovered to be intact. These fictions and presumptions may serve well enough in their application to one whose act is against equity and conscience at the time of its commission. They may be implements of justice in cases of theft or actual fraud. So, at least, we now assume. In circumstances less flagrant, they will be used more charily. They will not be so applied as to impose a trust by relation upon moneys that have entered into 'the stream of the firm's general property' (Holmes, J., in National City Bank v. Hotchkiss, \n231 \nU.S. 50, 57\n, 34 S.Ct. 20, 21), and are distinguishable no longer.\n For nearly three years after the sale of this stock, the situation stood unchanged. An adequate remedy against the bank through the recovery of an ordinary money judgment belonged to the trustee continuously, and this whether the award of the value was to be at law or in equity. Schoenthal v. Irving Trust Co., supra; Buffum v. Peter Barceloux Co., supra. There was no attempt during those years to separate the proceeds of the sale from other assets through an injunction or a receivership, nor any hint of a desire to charge a trust upon the proceeds. Not till the suit was at an end and the bank was in the hands of the Comptroller of the Currency did the respondent shift his theory and turn a debt into a trust. By that time new duties had arisen, new interests had intervened. The assets of the bank were now \n\n[294 U.S. 231, 239]\n\u00a0\n held by the receiver upon a trust for equal distribution. Cf. Wisdom v. Keen (C.C.A.) 69 F.(2d) 349, 350; Fera v. Wickham, 135 N.Y. 223, 230, 31 N. E. 1028, 17 L.R.A. 456; Gerseta Corp. v. Equitable Trust Co., 241 N.Y. 418, 425, 150 N.E. 501, 43 A.L.R. 1320. The shift had come too late.\n\n 2. \nWhat has been said as to the sale of the stock certificate to Cullinan applies with equal force to the second and third of the contested items, the Graff and Sommer notes.\n The collections on these notes were made in April, 1929. They were made, not in cash received over the counter, but by cancellation of a debt owing to the makers upon their deposit balance in the bank. There was neither trust, nor claim of trust, until the bank had suspended, and was in the hands of a receiver.\n\n 3. \nThe fourth contested item, the collection on the Veesaert bonds, differs from the others in that the payment was received after the trustee in bankruptcy had elected to avoid the preference and had sued for that relief.\n The payment was made as we have seen, by the deposit of $1,597.31 in the First National Bank of Chicago, Ill.\n The balance in that account was reduced in 1931 to $776.57. What became of the difference ($820.74) there is nothing to inform us. Evidence is lacking that it was withdrawn in such a form or for such purposes as to be represented by any assets forming part of the estate today. The receiver consents that this item of $776.57, the balance in the Chicago bank, be paid to the respondent as a preferred charge upon the fund.\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] 'If a bankrupt shall ... have made a transfer of any of his property, and if, at the time of the transfer, ... and ... within four months before the filing of the petition in bankruptcy, ... the bankrupt be insolvent and the ... transfer then operate as a preference, and the person receiving it or to be benefited thereby, or his agent acting therein, shall then have reasonable cause to believe that the enforcement of such ... transfer would effect a preference, it shall be voidable by the trustee and he may recover the property or its value from such person . ...'

Georgia Laws 1931, Ex. Sess., p. 99. It prescribes a system of regulation for private carriers for hire. Common carriers are subject to the provisions of a separate statute. With exceptions to be stated later, every private carrier operating a motor vehicle in the business of transporting persons or property for hire over any public highway in the state must comply with certain conditions. The carrier must apply for and obtain from the Public Service Commission a certificate of public convenience and necessity ( section 4, page 102); must give a bond with adequate security for protection against damage caused by negligence (section 7, page 105); must pay for the certificate a fee of $35 (section 17, page 108); and at the same time and annually thereafter must pay a registration and license fee of $25 (section 18, page 108) for every vehicle so operated. The fees, when received by the Comptroller General of the state, are to be transmitted to the State Treasurer who is to keep them in a separate fund. This fund is to be subject to the control of the State Highway Department and is to be devoted to the maintenance and repair of the highways of the state.\n The exceptions to the foregoing requirements are stated in section 2. The act does not apply to a business conducted exclusively within the incorporated limits of any city or town. Cf. Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, \n286 \nU.S. 352, 366\n, 52 S.Ct. 595, 81 A.L.R. 1402. It does not apply to 'cars and trucks hauling people and farm products exclusively between points not having railroad facilities, and not passing through or beyond municipalities having railroad facilities, where not more than seven passengers and\/or one and one half tons of freight are transported.' Section 2(c)(1), page 101. It does not apply to 'motor- vehicles engaged exclusively in the transportation of agricultural and\/or dairy products between any of the following points: farm, market, gin, warehouse, or mill, \n\n[295 U.S. 285, 288]\n\u00a0\n where the weight of the load does not exceed 10,000 pounds, whether such motor-vehicle is owned by the owner or producer of such agricultural or dairy products or not, so long as the title remains in the producer.' Section 2(c)(2), page 101. Definitions of a 'producer' and of 'agricultural products,' which are contained in the same subdivision, are quoted in the margin.* There are other exceptions in other subdivisions, but they are omitted from this summary, for the attack upon the statute is not aimed at their provisions.\n The appellant, a private carrier for hire, is engaged in the transportation of household and office furniture between points in Georgia and other states, and is not within the range of any of the exceptions. It obtained a certificate of convenience and necessity, and paid the statutory fee therefor. It gave approved security for the protection of its customers and the public in the event of injury through negligence. All this it did before beginning the present suit, and in so doing took out of the case any question as to the validity of the statute in respect of those conditions. What it is contesting now is the validity of the requirement that for every motor vehicle it must pay an annual fee of $25 in order to obtain a license. Joining as defendants the Georgia Public Service Commission, the members thereof, and the Comptroller General of the state, it brought this suit to restrain \n\n[295 U.S. 285, 289]\n\u00a0\n interference with its business by the arrest or prosecution of its drivers or otherwise as a consequence of its refusal to pay the annual fee. The trial court sustained a demurrer and dismissed the complaint. The Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed. 179 Ga. 431, 176 S.E. 487. The case is here upon appeal. Judicial Code  237, 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 USCA  344).\n First. The statute, in imposing an annual license fee for the maintenance of the highways, does not lay an unlawful burden on interstate commerce.\n The fee is moderate in amount; it goes into a fund for the upkeep of highways which carriers must use in the doing of their business; it is exacted without hostility to foreign or interstate transactions, being imposed also upon domestic vehicles operated in like conditions.\n Its validity in this aspect is attested by decisions so precisely applicable alike in facts and in principle as to apply a closure to debate. Clark v. Poor, \n274 \nU.S. 554\n, 47 S.Ct. 702; Hicklin v. Coney, \n290 \nU.S. 169, 173\n, 54 S.Ct. 142; Sprout v. City of South Bend, \n277 \nU.S. 163, 171\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 62 A.L.R. 45; Bradley v. Public Utilities Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 92, 95\n, 53 S.Ct. 577, 85 A.L.R. 1131; Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, supra; cf. Interstate Transit, Inc., v. Lindsey, \n283 \nU.S. 183\n, 51 S.Ct. 380.\n The appellant urges the objection that its use of roads in Georgia is less than that by other carriers engaged in local business, yet they pay the same charge. The fee is not for the mileage covered by a vehicle. There would be administrative difficulties in collecting on that basis. The fee is for the privilege for a use as extensive as the carrier wills that it shall be. There is nothing unreasonable or oppressive in a burden so imposed. Cf. Clark v. Poor, supra; Hicklin v. Coney, supra. One who receives a privilege without limit is not wronged by his own refusal to enjoy it as freely as he may.\n Second. The exceptions permitted by the statute, in so far as they are challenged by the appellant, do not amount to a denial of the equal protection of the laws. \n\n[295 U.S. 285, 290]\n\u00a0\n The statute makes an exception, as we have seen, for the benefit of vehicles engaged in hauling passengers or farm products between points not having railroad facilities, and not passing through or beyond municipalities having such facilities, with certain limitations as to the number of the passengers and the quantity of the freight. This is a reasonable exception. Travelers and farmers without convenient access to a railroad stand in need of other means of transportation. There might be hardship in adding to their burdens. The wear and tear upon a road is not likely to be heavy when the haul must begin at a town without railroad facilities, must end at a like town, and must not pass through any town which does have them. Not many carriers for hire will be tempted to do business in such neighborhoods exclusively. Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 394\n, 52 S.Ct. 581, supplies an apposite analogy.\n Another exception, and one that more than any other has drawn the appellant's fire, is for the benefit of motor vehicles engaged exclusively in the transportation of agricultural or dairy products, whether the 'vehicle is owned by the owner or producer of such agricultural or dairy products or not, so long as the title remains in the producer.' The Supreme Court of Georgia, construing that provision in this case, has said that the final clause, 'so long as title remains in him (the producer),' qualifies the entire exception, as indeed it obviously does. In an earlier case (Nance v. Harrison, 176 Ga. 674, 169 S.E. 22), the same court, familiar, doubtless, with local conditions, pointed out some of the considerations of policy that underlie the statute. The court observed ( 176 Ga. p. 682, 169 S.E. 22, 26) that 'many of the farm products must be brought from remote sections unaccommodated by the better system of roads- in some cases not even by a public road.' This might make it necessary to offer some inducement to carriers 'in order to insure adequate service in the transportation of such commodities.' The court took notice of a common \n\n[295 U.S. 285, 291]\n\u00a0\n opinion, 'well justified by the facts,' that the farm lands of the state had been 'accustomed to bear an undue proportion of the taxes.' The effect of the exception would be to equalize the burden. 'Every one knows that as a general rule a tax of this kind finally reaches the consumer of the product, or user of the service; and hence an exemption of carriers of such products is to be taken as an exemption of the products themselves, and not of the carrier.' The enumeration of rational bases of distinction was not put forward as exhaustive. The court expressed the belief that others could be added.\n We think a classification thus designed to ameliorate the lot of the producers of farm and dairy products is not an arbitrary preference within the meaning and the condemnation of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plight of the Georgia farmer has been pictured by the state court in words already quoted. To free him of fresh burdens might seem to a wise statecraft to be a means whereby to foster agriculture and promote the common good. The case is very different from Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 \nU.S. 553\n, 51 S.Ct. 582. There a Florida statute, similar to this one in many of its provisions, gave relief from its exactions to any transportation company engaged exclusively in the carriage of agricultural, horticultural, dairy, or farm products, whether for the producer or for any one else. The attack was not directed, as in the case at hand, to an exemption of a particular class of carriers upon rational grounds of policy from the payment of an annual tax. What was complained of in that case was a release from the obligation imposed upon carriers in general to give a bond or insurance policy in promotion of the public safety. It was with reference to that exemption, not challenged by the appellant here, that the court condemned the statute. 'So far as the statute was designed to safeguard the public with respect to the use of the highways, we think that the discrimination it makes be- \n\n[295 U.S. 285, 292]\n\u00a0\n tween the private carriers which are relieved of the necessity of obtaining certificates and giving security, and a carrier such as the appellant, was wholly arbitrary, and constituted a violation of the appellant's constitutional right.' 283 U.S. at page 567, 51 S.Ct. 582, 587; cf. Nance v. Harrison, supra, 176 Ga. 674, at page 681, 169 S.E. 22.\n Smith v. Cahoon has been considered in later cases in this court, and the limits of its holding, clear enough at the beginning, have been brought out in sharp relief. Thus, in Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring, supra, \n286 U.S. 352\n, at page 371, 52 S.Ct. 595, 601, 81 A.L. R. 1402, which came here from the state of Kansas, exemption from various forms of regulation, including the payment of a tax, was accorded to 'the transportation of livestock and farm products to market by the owner thereof or supplies for his own use in his own motor vehicle.' The exemption was upheld. Again, in Hicklin v. Coney, supra, \n290 U.S. 169\n, at page 175, 54 S.Ct. 142, a statute of South Carolina gave exemption to 'farmers or dairymen, hauling dairy or farm products; or lumber haulers engaged in transporting lumber and logs from the forest to the shipping points.' Code S.Ct. 1932,  8508. The exemption was interpreted by the highest court of the state as limited to cases where the hauling was irregular or occasional and not as a regular business. We upheld the statute as thus interpreted, though the effect was to relieve from the filing of a bond.\n These cases and others like them (American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S.Ct. 43) are illustrations of the familiar doctrine that a Legislature has a wide discretion in the classification of trades and occupations for the purpose of taxation and in the allowance of exemptions and deductions within reasonable limits. Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232\n, 10 S.Ct. 533; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 125\n, 30 S.Ct. 496; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 572\n, 30 S.Ct. 578; Stebbins v. Riley, \n268 \nU.S. 137, 142\n, 45 S.Ct. 424, 44 A.L.R. 1454; Ohio Oil Co. v. Conway, \n281 \nU.S. 146, 159\n, 50 S.Ct. 310; State Board of \n\n[295 U.S. 285, 293]\n\u00a0\n Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. How far it may relieve a special group of carriers from the filing of a bond for the safety of the public may depend on very different considerations, as, for instance, the extent or regularity of the traffic thus excepted. This will vary from state to state. The excepted carriers in Florida did business, it seems, 'between fixed termini or over a regular route.' Smith v. Cahoon, \n283 U.S. 553\n, at page 566, 51 S.Ct. 582, 587. There is nothing in the present record to advise us as to the extent or regularity of traffic in farm and dairy products by carriers in Georgia. Be that as it may, exemption from a tax stands upon a different footing, though the purpose of the tax is the upkeep of the highway. At such times the Legislature may go far in apportioning and classifying to the end that public burdens may be distributed in accordance with its own conception of policy and justice. If its action be not arbitrary, the courts will stand aloof.\n We have reserved up to this point the statement of a final objection to the statute now pressed by the appellant. The objection is aimed at the definition of agricultural products, already quoted in this opinion, and especially to the inclusion of household goods and supplies, and to the accompanying words of reference to the business of a country merchant. The clauses in question are awkward and obscure. Apparently household goods and supplies are covered by the exception though moving to the farm, but only then, it seems, if transported to be used for farm purposes and in vehicles devoted to farm uses and no others. Indeed, all the enumerated articles grouped as agricultural are either products of a farm or incidental to its upkeep. Country merchants are exempted when they 'handle poultry and farm products in pursuance to their own business, and not for hire.' If the handling here referred to has to do with handling in the course of transportation, the exemption has been stated out of over- abundant \n\n[295 U.S. 285, 294]\n\u00a0\n caution, for carriage not for hire, whether by country merchants or by others, is without the statute altogether.\n We do not attempt to pass upon the meaning of the provisions considered in the foregoing paragraph, or upon their validity under the Fourteenth Amendment, or upon the propriety, if they are to any extent invalid, of severing them from other parts of the statute and upholding what remains. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286, 290\n, 291 S., 44 S.Ct. 323. Cf., sections 22 and 29 of the Motor Carrier Act of 1931 (pages 111, 113). No question as to their meaning or validity was raised by the appellant in its petition or complaint. Other clauses of the statute were quoted and assailed as void. These were not even mentioned. No question as to the meaning or validity of these provisions was decided or referred to by the Supreme Court of Georgia. The opinion of that court summarizes the allegations of the complaint, and considers the objections there stated and no others.\n This court is a court of review and limits the exercise of its jurisdiction in accordance with its function. Edward Hines Yellow Pine Trustees v. Martin, \n268 \nU.S. 458, 465\n, 45 S.Ct. 543; Wilson v. McNamee, \n102 U.S. 572\n; Old Jordan Mining and Milling Co. v. Socie te des Mines, \n164 \nU.S. 261, 265\n, 17 S.Ct. 113; Bass R. & G., Ltd., v. State Tax Comm., \n266 \nU.S. 271, 284\n, 285 S., 45 S.Ct. 82. The need of forbearance is commanding when the judgment brought before us comes from a state court and calls for the construction and application of the provisions of a local statute. In such circumstances we are deprived of an important aid to the wise performance of our duties if we proceed to a decision as to matters undetermined and unheeded in the judgment of the state tribunals. Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 277\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 87 A.L.R. 721.\n The decree of the Supreme Court of Georgia is accordingly affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] 'And the word 'producer' shall include a landlord where the relations of landlord and tenant or landlord and cropper are involved. The phrase 'agricultural products' as used in this Act shall include fruit, livestock, meats, fertilizer, wood, lumber, cotton, and naval stores, household goods and supplies transported to farms for farm purposes, and\/or other usual farm and dairy supplies, and including products of grove and\/or orchard, and also poultry and eggs, and also fish and oysters, and all country merchants in rural districts who handle poultry and farm products in pursuance to their own business, and not for hire, and timber and\/or logs being hauled by the owner thereof, or his agents and\/or employees between forest and mill or primary place of manufacturer.' \n\n\n\n\n","4":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nAKTIESELSKABET CUZCO v. THE SUCARSECO(1935)\nNo. 524\nArgued: February 14, 1935Decided: March 4, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 394, 395]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. H. McGrann, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 394, 398]\n\u00a0\n Mr. D. Roger Englar, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question in this case arises out of a collision at sea between the Norwegian vessel Toluma and the American vessel Sucarseco. Both vessels were at fault, and both were damaged. The Sucarseco proceeded on her voyage. The Toluma put into a port of refuge for necessary repairs. To permit these repairs, a part of her cargo was discharged; it was later reloaded and the Toluma completed her voyage. A general average statement was prepared which apportioned the expenses and losses, so far as they were of a general average nature, between the owner of the Toluma and the cargo owners.\n Three suits were brought in admiralty and were consolidated for trial. On was a libel for damages brought by the owner of the Toluma against the Sucarseco. Another was a cross-libel for damages by the owner of the Sucarseco against the Toluma. The third libel was by the owners of cargo on the Toluma against the owner of the Sucarseco to recover their damages, including the amounts which the cargo owners had paid as general average contributions.\n The only question presented here is with respect to the claim of the cargo owners. Their right to recover against the Sucarseco, the noncarrying vessel, is not contested so \n\n[294 U.S. 394, 399]\n\u00a0\n far as the physical damage to the cargo is concerned. The contest is with respect to the contributions of the cargo owners in general average. The Circuit Court of Appeals, reversing the District Court, allowed that recovery. The Toluma, 72 F.(2d) 690. Because of the importance of the question, which has not been decided by this Court, a writ of certiorari was granted, December 3, 1934. \n293 \nU.S. 552\n, 55 S.Ct. 218, 79 L.Ed. --.\n There is no dispute that both vessels were seaworthy and that the collision was due to the fault in navigation of both vessels equally. No question has been raised as to the correctness of the general average adjustment. As, through the application to the instant case of the rule for the division of the entire loss equally between the vessels,1 the ultimate share to be borne by the Sucarseco will not be affected by the determination of the present claim of the cargo owners, the Sucarseco is indifferent to the result and the claim is opposed by the Toluma.\n The cargo was carried under a provision of the bill of lading, known as the 'Jason clause,' that in case 'of danger, damage or disaster' resulting 'from faults or errors in navigation,' and if the shipowner 'shall have exercised due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied,' the owners of the cargo shall contribute with the shipowner in general average 'to the payment of any sacrifices, losses or expenses of a general average nature that may be incurred for the common benefit' to the same extent as if the danger, damage, or disaster had not resulted from faults or errors in navigation. \n2\n The clause is substantially to the \n\n[294 U.S. 394, 400]\n\u00a0\n same effect as the one sustained in the case of The Jason, \n225 \nU.S. 32\n, 32 S.Ct. 560, and has received its popular designation from that decision. Petitioner contends that the liability of cargo to contribute in general average results solely from this provision in the contract of carriage; that the owners of the Sucarseco were not parties to that contract; and that the claim of the cargo owners for the refund of their general average contributions in derivative and not directly recoverable from the Sucarseco, the cargo owners being entitled only to an accounting from their carrier (the Toluma) for their ratable proportion of that carrier's recovery. Respondents insist that cargo's contributions in general average are a part of cargo's 'collision damage' and are recoverable from the Sucarseco as a tort-feasor in the same manner as physical damage.\n While the damages due to a collision, when both vessels are at fault, are divided as between themselves, the innocent cargo owner may recover his full damages from the noncarrying vessel. The Atlas, \n93 U.S. 302\n, 315; The New York, \n175 \nU.S. 187, 209\n, 210 S., 20 S.Ct. 67; Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Steamships, \n285 \nU.S. 413, 418\n, 52 S.Ct. 413. This is so, al- \n\n[294 U.S. 394, 401]\n\u00a0\n though the carrying vessel may be free from liability to the cargo owners by reason of the application of section 3 of the Harter Act, 46 U.S.C.  192, 46 USCA  192.3 On a division of the entire damages between the two vessels, the noncarrying vessel may recoup one-half of the amount paid to the cargo owners. The Chattahooche, \n173 \nU.S. 540, 554\n, 555 S., 19 S.Ct. 491. The direct liability of the noncarrying vessel 'for all the damage to cargo' is 'one of the consequences plainly to be foreseen,' and the responsibility of the carrying vessel to the noncarrying vessel is measured accordingly. Erie Railroad Co. v. Erie & Western Transportation Co., \n204 \nU.S. 220, 226\n, 27 S.Ct. 246.\n In the stipulation of facts, the parties agreed that the expenses, for which recovery is now sought as a part of cargo's damage, were 'of a general average nature.' The description is brief but adequate. It is a description which incorporates the essential conditions of general average. It means that there was a common imminent peril and a voluntary sacrifice or extraordinary expenses necessarily made or incurred to avert the peril and with a resulting common benefit to the adventure. Columbian Insurance Co. v. Ashby, 13 Pet. 331, 338; McAndrews v. Thatcher, 3 Wall. 347, 365; The Star of Hope (The Star of Hope v. Annan), 9 Wall. 203, 228, 229; Ralli v. Troop, \n157 \nU.S. 386, 394\n, 395 S., 403, 15 S.Ct. 657; The Jason, supra, pages 48, 49 of 225 U.S., 32 S.Ct. 560. It means that the sacrifice or expenses fell upon the whole adventure and were to be assessed in proportion to the share of each in that adventure. The Star of Hope, supra; Ralli v. Troop, supra. This is the basic consideration in determining the present question.\n Prior to the Harter Act, a common carrier by sea could not exempt himself from liability to the cargo owner for damages caused by the negligence of master or crew. Liverpool & G.W.S. Co. v. Phenix Insurance Company, 129 \n\n[294 U.S. 394, 402]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 397, 9 S.Ct. 469. The Harter Act, prohibiting by sections 1 and 2 agreements with a shipowner which would relieve him from responsibility for the proper loading, stowage, custody, care, or delivery of the cargo, or from the duty to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy, provided in section 3 that if the shipowner did exercise due diligence 'to make the vessel in all respects seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied,' neither the vessel nor her owner should be responsible for damages resulting 'from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of the vessel.' The question then arose whether a shipowner who had exercised that due diligence was entitled to general average contribution for sacrifices made by him, subsequent to a stranding of his vessel, in successful efforts to save vessel, freight, and cargo. That right was denied the shipowner in The Irrawaddy, \n171 \nU.S. 187\n, 18 S. Ct. 831. The point of that decision was carefully stated in The Jason, supra, page 54 of 225 U.S., 32 S.Ct. 560, 564. The Court there said that the authority of The Irrawaddy went no further than that 'while the Harter act relieved the shipowner from liability for his servant's negligence, it did not of its own force entitle him to share in a general average rendered necessary by such negligence.' But, as the Harter Act had relieved the diligent shipowner from responsibility for the negligence of his master and crew, the Court decided in The Jason that it was 'no longer against the policy of the law' for him to contract with the cargo owners 'for a participation in general average contribution growing out of such negligence.' Upon this ground, the validity of the 'Jason clause,' similar to the one now before us, was upheld.\n What then is the effect of the 'Jason clause'? It in no way changes the essential features of general average contributions. It must still appear that voluntary and successful sacrifices have been made or extraordinary expenses incurred on behalf of those interested in the ad- \n\n[294 U.S. 394, 403]\n\u00a0\n venture in order to avert a common imminent peril, with resulting benefit to the adventure upon which the burden of such sacrifices and expenses appropriately rests. As the master of the ship is charged with the duty, and clothed with the power, to determine at the time 'whether the circumstances of danger in such a case are or are not so great and pressing as to render a sacrifice of a portion of the associated interests indispensable for the common safety of the remainder,' the effect of the 'Jason clause' is to invest the master with authority and responsibility to act directly for cargo in relation to cargo's duty to contribute in general average. The master becomes for that purpose the representative of cargo. Lawrence v. Minturn, 17 How. 100, 109, 110; The Star of Hope, supra, 9 Wall. page 230; Ralli v. Troop, supra, pages 397, 398 of 157 U.S., 15 S.Ct. 657; The Gratitudine, 3 C.Rob. 240, 257, 258, 260; Burton v. English, 12 Q.B.D. 218, 223. In The Jason, supra, page 54 of 225 U.S., 32 S.Ct. 560, the Court pointed out that as sacrifices and expenses, in order to justify the general average contribution, must be voluntary and extraordinary, they could not be regarded as made in the performance of the general duty of the shipowner to his cargo. The 'Jason clause' was sustained because it admitted the shipowner to share in general average only in circumstances where by the Harter Act he was relieved from responsibility. Id., pages 55, 56 of 225 U. S., 32 S.Ct. 560.\n It is with this understanding of the effect of the clause that we come to the question as to the right of the cargo owners to include, in the damages they have suffered by reason of the collision, their general average contributions. That the extraordinary expenses, thus shared, were due to the collision cannot be gainsaid. It is because they were thus directly caused that these expenses from part of the damages to be divided between the two vessels. On this basis they were included in the decree for division made by the District Court and the propriety of the inclusion of \n\n[294 U.S. 394, 404]\n\u00a0\n these amounts in the total damages to be divided between the vessels is not questioned. But the right to that inclusion springs directly from the tort and in that relation no question is raised as to proximate cause or foreseeable consequences.\n The nature of these expenditures and the fact that they are traceable directly to the collision are not changed by the sharing in general average. That merely affects the distribution of the loss, not its cause. The claim of the cargo owners for their general average contributions is not in any sense a derivative claim. It accrues to the cargo owners in their own right. It accrues because of cargo's own participation in the common adventure and the action taken on behalf of cargo and by its representative to avert a peril with which that adventure was threatened. Being cargo's own share of the expense incurred in the common interest, the amount which is paid properly belongs in the category of damage which the cargo owners have suffered by reason of the collision. The Energia (D. C.) 61 F. 222; Id. (C.C.A.) 66 F. 604, 608. The right does not stand on subrogation any more than the right of Sucarseco to bring into the division of damages the amount it has to pay to the cargo owners rests on subrogation. See Erie Railroad Co. v. Erie & Western Transportation Co., supra. In each case the right arises directly from the tort.\n The contention as to remoteness is but another way of presenting the same question. This is not a case of an attempt, by reason of 'a tort to the person or propety of one man,' to make the tort-feasor liable to another 'merely because the injured person was under a contract with that other, unknown to the doer of the wrong.' See Robins Dry Dock & Repair Co. v. Flint, \n275 \nU.S. 303, 309\n, 48 S.Ct. 134; Elliott Steam Tug Co., Ltd., v. The Shipping Controller, (1922) 1 K.B. 127, 139, 142; The Federal No. 2 (C.C.A.) 21 F.(2d) 313. Here, cargo as well as ship was placed in jeopardy. That jeopardy was due in part to the negligence of the vessel against which the claim is made. The fact that the vessel \n\n[294 U.S. 394, 405]\n\u00a0\n and the cargo under the 'Jason clause' bear their proportionate shares of the expenses gives Sucarseco no ground for a contention that the expenses themselves, or the share that cargo bears, were not occasioned directly b y the tort. In the light of the nature of the general average contributions, and of the event which made them necessary, the fact that they were made under the stipulation in the 'Jason clause' is no more a defense to Sucarseco than is the fact that the cargo was placed on board under a contract to carry it. Indeed, Sucarseco makes no contention of immunity. The question arises only because, through recovery by the cargo owners from Sucarseco, Toluma's share of the ultimate division is affected. But that does not establish remoteness. We have the anomalous situation that it is Toluma that is opposing the cargo owners' claim against Sucarseco, while Toluma has collected from cargo its share of the general average expenses on the ground that they were incurred on Cargo's behalf and were doe to the collision.\n As we have said, the 'Jason clause' merely distributed a loss for which Sucarseco was responsible, and in that view the cargo owners are entitled to recover that part of the loss which they have sustained.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See The North Star, \n106 \nU.S. 17\n, 1 S.Ct. 41; The Chattahooche, \n173 \nU.S. 540\n, 19 S.Ct. 491. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The applicable clause in the bill of lading is as follows: 'In case of danger, damage or disaster resulting from accident or from faults or errors in navigation or in the management of or from any latent or other defect of the vessel, her machinery or appurtenances, from unseaworthiness, even though existing at the time of shipment or at the beginning of the voyage, if the defect or unseaworthiness was not discoverable by the exercise of due diligence and if the shipowner shall have exercised due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy and properly manned, equipped and supplied with respect to the matters concerned in the aforesaid danger, damage or disaster, then the shippers, consignees or owners of the cargo or the holders of this bill of lading shall nevertheless pay salvage and any special charges incurred in respect of the cargo and shall contribute with the shipowners in general average to the payment of any sacrifices, losses or expenses of a general average nature that may be made or incurred for the common benefit or to relieve the adventure of any common peril, all with the same force and effect and to the same extent as if such accident, danger, damage or disaster had not resulted from or been occasioned by faults or errors in navigation or in the management of the vessel or by any latent or other defect or unseaworthiness.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act Feb. 13, 1893, c. 105, 27 Stat. 445 (46 USCA  190-195). \n\n\n\n\n","5":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nALASKA PACKERS ASS'N v. INDUSTRIAL ACC. COM'N(1935)\nNo. 465\nArgued: Decided: March 11, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 532, 533]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Francis Gill and Frank D. Madison, both of San Francisco, Cal ., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 532, 537]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Everett A. Corten and George C. Faulkner, both of San Francisco, Cal., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an appeal under section 237 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  344) from a judgment of the Supreme Court of California, 34 P.(2d) 716, upholding an award of compensation, by the state Industrial Accident Commission, to appellee Palma against appellant, his employer, and holding that the award does not infringe prohibitions of the Federal Constitution. The award was made in conformity to the statutes of California, where the contract of employment was entered into, rather than those of Alaska, where the injury occurred. \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 538]\n\u00a0\n On May 13, 1932, Palma, a nonresident alien, and appellant, doing business in California, executed at San Francisco a written contract of employment. Palma agreed to work for appellant in Alaska during the salmon canning season; the appellant agreed to transport him to Alaska, and, at the end of the season, to return him to San Francisco where he was to be paid his stipulated wages, less advances. The contract recited that appellant had elected to be bound by the Alaska Workmen's Compensation Law 1 and stipulated that the parties should be subject to and bound by the provisions of that statute. Section 58 of the California Workmen's Compensation Act (St. Cal. 1917, p. 870,  58)2 was then in force, which provides:\n'The commission shall have jurisdiction over all controversies arising out of injuries suffered without the territorial limits of this state in those cases where the injured employee is a resident of this state at the time of the injury and the contract of hire was made in this state. ...'\n\n At that time the California Supreme Court had held in Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, 184 Cal. 23, 36-44, 192 P. 1021, 12 A.L.R. 1190 (writ of error dismissed, \n255 \nU.S. 445\n, 41 S.Ct. 373), that this section was applicable to nonresidents of California, since the privileges and immunities clause of the Federal Constitution prevented giving any effect to the requirement that the employee be a resident. The California Workmen's Compensation Act also provides, section 27(a), St. Cal. 1923, p. 855,  27(a), as amended by St. Cal. 1931, p. 1950:\n'No contract, rule or regulation shall exempt the employer from liability for the compensation fixed by this act. ...'\n\n In August, 1932, after his return from Alaska to California, the employee applied for and later received an \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 539]\n\u00a0\n award by the California Commission in compensation for injuries received by him in the course of his employment in Alaska. On petition for review by the state Supreme Court, appellant assailed the California statute, as he does here, as invalid under the due process and the full faith and credit clauses of the Federal Constitution. In so far as the California statute denies validity to the agreement that the parties should be bound by the Alaska Workmen's Compensation Act, and attempts to give a remedy for injuries suffered by a nonresident employee without the state, it is challenged as a denial of due process. Petitioner also insists that as the Alaska statute affords, in Alaska, an exclusive remedy for the injury which occurred there, the California courts denied full faith and credit to the Alaska statute by refusing to recognize it as a defense to the application for an award under the California statute.\n In refusing to set aside the award of the state commission, the Supreme Court of California ruled, as in Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, supra, that section 58 of the California compensation act was applicable to Palma, although a nonresident alien; that, as the contract of employment was entered into within the state, the stipulation that the Alaska act should govern was invalid under section 27(a). It concluded that the Alaska statute afforded a remedy to the employee in Alaska and held that by setting up the defense of the Alaska statute in California the two statutes were brought into conflict, and that in the circumstances neither the due process clause nor the full faith and credit clause denied to the state the power to apply its own law, to the exclusion of the Alaska act in fixing and awarding compensation for the injury.\n\n 1. \nThe question first to be considered is whether a state, which may constitutionally impose on employer and employee a system of compensation for injuries to the employee in the course of his employment within the state, New York Certral R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, 37 S.Ct. 247, L.R.A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Moun- \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 540]\n\u00a0\n tain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642, is precluded by the due process clause, in the special circumstances of this case, from imposing liability for injuries to the employee occurring in Alaska.\n The California statute does not purport to have any extraterritorial effect, in the sense that it undertakes to impose a rule for foreign tribunals, nor did the judgment of the state Supreme Court give it any. The statute assumes only to provide a remedy to be granted by the California Commission for injuries, received in the course of employment entered into within the state, wherever they may occur. Compare Bradford Electric Light & Power Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 153\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696. We assume that in Alaska the employee had he chosen to do so, could have claimed the benefits of the Alaska statute, and that if any effect were there given to the California statute, it would be only by comity or by virtue of the full faith and credit clause. Bradford Electric Light & Power Co. v. Clapper, supra.\n The due process clause denies to a state any power to restrict or control the obligation of contracts executed and to be performed without the state, as an attempt to exercise power over a subject matter not within its constitutional jurisdiction. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Head, \n234 U.S. 149\n, 162-164, 34 S.Ct. 879; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Dodge, \n246 \nU.S. 357, 377\n, 38 S.Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1918E, 593; Home Insurance Co. v. Dick, \n281 \nU.S. 397, 407\n, 408 S., 50 S. Ct. 338, 74 A.L.R. 701; compare National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71, 75\n, 43 S.Ct. 32. Similarly, a state may not penalize or tax a contract entered into and to be performed outside the state, although one of the contracting parties is within the state. Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 \nU.S. 578\n, 17 S.Ct. 427; St. Louis Cotton Compress Co. v. Arkansas, \n260 \nU.S. 346, 348\n, 43 S.Ct. 125; Compania General de Tabacos de Filipinas v. Collector, \n275 \nU.S. 87\n, 48 S.Ct. 100.\n But where the contract is entered into within the state, even though it is to be performed elsewhere, its terms, its obligation, and its sanctions are subject, in some meas- \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 541]\n\u00a0\n ure, to the legislative control of the state. The fact that the contract is to be performed elsewhere does not of itself put these incidents beyond reach of the power which a state may constitutionally exercise. Selover, Bates & Co. v. Walsh, \n226 \nU.S. 112, 123\n, 33 S.Ct. 69; Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Liebing, \n259 \nU.S. 209, 214\n, 42 S.Ct. 467; Manhattan Life Insurance Co. v.

Dunken, \n266 U.S. 389\n, 397-400, 45 S.Ct. 129.\n While similar power to control the legal consequences of a tortious act committed elsewhere has been denied, Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Brown, \n234 \nU.S. 542, 547\n, 34 S.Ct. 955; Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Chiles, \n214 \nU.S. 274, 278\n, 29 S.Ct. 613; compare Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Commercial Milling Co., \n218 \nU.S. 406\n, 31 S.Ct. 59, 36 L.R.A.(N.S.) 220, 21 Ann.Cas. 815, the liability under Workmen's Compensation Acts is not for a tort. It is imposed as an incident of the employment relationship, as a cost to be borne by the business enterprise, rather than as an attempt to extend redress for the wrongful act of the employer. See Bradford Electric Light & Power Co. v. Clapper, supra, pages 157, 158 of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 571. The California court has declared: 'The contract creates a relationship under the sanction of the law and the same law attaches as an incident thereto an obligation to compensate for injuries sustained abroad, amounting to a sort of compulsory insurance.' Quong Ham Wah Co. v. Industrial Accident Commission, supra, page 36 of 184 Cal., 192 P. 1021, 1025. Obviously, the power of a state to effect legal consequences is not limited to occurrences within the state if it has control over the status which gives rise to those consequences. That it has power, through its own tribunals, to grant compensation to local employees, locally employed, for injuries received outside its borders, and likewise has power to forbid its own courts to give any other form of relief for such injury, was fully recognized by this Court in Bradford Electric Light & Power Co. v. Clapper, supra, page 156 of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 571. Objections which are founded upon the Fourteenth Amendment must, therefore, be directed, not to \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 542]\n\u00a0\n the existence of the power to impose liability for an injury outside state borders, but to the manner of its exercise as being so arbitrary or unreasonable as to amount to a denial of due process.\n We cannot say that the statutory requirement of California, that the provisions for compensation shall extend to injuries without the state when the contract for employment was entered into within it, is given such an unreasonable application in the present case as to transcend constitutional limitations. The employee, an alien more than 2,000 miles from his home in Mexico, was, with fifty-three others, employed by petitioner in California. The contract called for their transportation to Alaska, some 3,000 miles distant, for seasonal employment of between two and three months, at the conclusion of which they were to be returned to California, and were there to receive their wages.\n The meager facts disclosed by the record suggest a practice of employing workers in California for seasonal occupation in Alaska, under such conditions as to make it improbable that the employees injured in the course of their employment in Alaska would be able to apply for compensation there. It was necessary for them to return to California in order to receive their full wages. They would be accompanied by their fellow workers, who would normally be the witnesses required to establish the fact of the injury and its nature. The probability is slight that injured workmen, once returned to California, would be able to retrace their steps to Alaska, and there successfully prosecute their claims for compensation. Without a remedy in California, they would be remediless, and there was the danger that they might become public charges, both matters of grave public concern to the state.\n California, therefore, had a legitimate public interest in controlling and regulating this employer-employee relationship in such fashion as to impose a liability upon the \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 543]\n\u00a0\n employer for an injury suffered by the employee, and in providing a remedy available to him in California. In the special circumstances disclosed, the state had as great an interest in affording adequate protection to this class of its population as to employees injured within the state. Indulging the presumption of constitutionality which attaches to every state statute, we cannot say that this one, as applied, lacks a rational basis or involved any arbitrary or unreasonable exercise of state power.\n It is unnecessary to consider what effect should be given to the California statute if the parties were domiciled in Alaska or were their relationship to California such as to give it a lesser interest in protecting the employee by securing for him an adequate and readily available remedy.\n In providing a remedy for a liability which the state was authorized to impose, California was not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to prescribe the Alaska remedy rather than its own. Only the full faith and credit clause (article 4,  1) imposes on the courts of one state the duty so to enforce the laws of another.\n Nor did the state of California exceed its constitutional power by prohibiting any stipulation exempting the employer from liability for the compensation prescribed by the California statute. Legislation otherwise within the scope of acknowledged state power, not unreasonably or arbitrarily exercised, cannot be condemned because it curtails the power of the individual to contract. Hardware Dealers Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151, 157\n, 158 S., 52 S.Ct. 69. As the state had the power to impose the liability in pursuance of state policy, it was a rational, and therefore a permissible, exercise of state power to prohibit any contract in evasion of it. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. McGuire, \n219 \nU.S. 549, 571\n, 31 S.Ct. 259; see Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R.

Even though the compensation acts of either jurisdiction may, consistently with due process, be applied in either, the question remains whether the California court has failed to accord full faith and credit to the Alaska statute in refusing to allow it as a defense to the award of the California Commission. Appellant contends that as the provisions of the Alaska statute conflict with those of the California statutes, the full faith and credit clause and R.S.  905, 906, U.S.C., title 28,  687, 688 (28 USCA  687, 688), requiring that full faith and credit be accorded to territorial statutes, see Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Sowers, \n213 \nU.S. 55, 64\n, 65 S., 29 S.Ct. 397, compel recognition of the Alaska statute as a defense to the proceedings before the California Commission; that the award of the Commission should accordingly be set aside, leaving the employee to his remedy under the Alaska statute in California, if California provides the remedy, or remitting the parties to their proceeding in Alaska under the territorial statute.\n Both statutes are compensation acts, substituting for the common-law recovery for negligence a right to recover compensation at specified rates for injuries to employees in the course of their employment. The California act is compulsory, section 6(a), St. Cal. 1917, p. 834, as amended by St. 1929, p. 430; the Alaska act is similarly effective, unless the employer or employee elects not to be bound by it, sections 1, 31, 35, which in this case they have not done. The California act is administered by a Commission; the Alaska act provides for recovery by suit in the courts of the territory, brought in the Judicial division where the injury occurs (sections 24, 25). Each act provides that the liability imposed and the remedy given by it are in lieu of all others for the injury suffered. Sections 6(a), 27(a) of the California act; sections 1, 10, 28 of the Alaska act. While section 58 of the California statute authorizes the Commission to make an award for injuries suffered without the state, when the contract of employment is entered into within, it does not purport to provide, by regulation of the con- \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 545]\n\u00a0\n tract of employment or otherwise, that the parties may not resort, without the state, to other remedies given by the statutes in force at the place of injury. Compare Bradford Electric Light & Power Co. v. Clapper, supra, page 153 of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 571. The Alaska act, section 25, provides that no action shall be brought under the statute in any court outside the territory, except in the case where it is not possible to obtain service of process on the defendant within the territory; it is conceded that appellant may there be served.\n Petitioner, in relying on the Alaska statute as a defense in California, points out that it makes no distinction between residents and nonresidents, but gives a remedy to every employee injured in the course of his employment in Alaska, and invokes the rule, often followed in this Court, that suits to recover for personal injury are transitory, and that the jurisdiction creating the right may not, by restricting the venue, preclude recovery in any court outside the state having jurisdiction. See Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. Co. v. Sowers, supra, page 70 of 213 U.S., 29 S.Ct. 397; Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v. George, \n233 \nU.S. 354\n, 34 S. Ct. 587. The Supreme Court of California, accepting this view, nevertheless refused to give effect to the Alaska statute because of its conflict with the California compensation act. Since each statute provides a different remedy, the court recognized that, by setting up the Alaska statute as a defense to the award of the Commission, the two statutes were brought into direct conflict. It resolved the conflict by holding that the courts of California were not bound by the full faith and credit clause to apply the Alaska statute instead of its own.\n To the extent that California is required to give full faith and credit to the conflicting Alaska statute, it must be denied the right to apply in its own courts a statute of the state, lawfully enacted in pursuance of its domestic policy. We assume, as did the state court, that the remedy provided in the Alaska statute is one which could also be applied by the California courts, except for the con- \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 546]\n\u00a0\n flict. We also assume, as the parties concede, that by R.S.,  905, 906, the command of the full faith and credit clause is made applicable to territorial statutes with the same force and effect as that of the constitutional provision with respect to statutes of the states, see Embry v. Palmer, \n107 U.S. 3\n, 8-10, 2 S.Ct. 25; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. Sowers, supra pages 64, 65 of 213 U.S., 29 S.Ct. 397.3 The subject of our inquiry is therefore whether the full faith and credit clause requires the state of California to give effect to the Alaska statute rather than its own.\n It has often been recognized by this Court that there are some limitations upon the extent to which a state will be required by the full faith and credit clause to enforce even the judgment of another state, in contravention of its own statutes or policy. See State of Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370; Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657\n, 13 S.Ct. 224; Finney v. Guy, \n189 \nU.S. 335\n, 22 S.Ct. 558; see, also, Clarke v. Clarke, \n178 \nU.S. 186\n, 20 S.Ct. 873; Hood v. McGehee, \n237 \nU.S. 611\n, 35 S.Ct. 718; compare Gasquet v. Fenner, \n247 \nU.S. 16\n, 38 S. Ct. 416. \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 547]\n\u00a0\n In the case of statutes, the extra-state effect of which Congress has not prescribed, where the policy of one state statute comes into conflict with that of another, the necessity of some accommodation of the conflicting interests of the two states is still more apparent. A rigid and literal enforcement of the full faith and credit clause, without regard to the statute of the forum, would lead to the absurd result that, wherever the conflict arises, the statute of each state must be enforced in the courts of the other, but cannot be in its own. Unless by force of that clause a greater effect is thus to be given to a state statute abroad than the clause permits it to have at home, it is unavoidable that this Court determine for itself the extent to which the statute of one state may qualify or deny rights asserted under the statute of another. See Olmsted v. Olmsted, \n216 \nU.S. 386\n, 30 S.Ct. 292, 25 L.R.A.(N. S.) 1292; AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Dunken, supra, page 393 of 266 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 129.\n The necessity is not any the less whether the statute and policy of the forum is set up as a defense to a suit brought under the foreign statute or the foreign statute is set up as a defense to a suit or proceedings under the local statute. In either case, the conflict is the same. In each, rights claimed under one statute prevail only by denying effect to the other. In both the conflict is to be resolved, not by giving automatic effect to the full faith and credit clause, compelling the courts of each state to subordinate its own statutes to those of the other, but by appraising the governmental interests of each jurisdiction, and turning the scale of decision according to their weight.\n The enactment of the present statute of California was within state power and infringes no constitutional provision. Prima facie every state is entitled to enforce in its own courts its own statutes, lawfully enacted. One who challenges that right, because of the force given to a conflicting statute of another state by the full faith and credit clause, assumes the burden of showing, upon some rational \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 548]\n\u00a0\n basis, that of the conflicting interests involved those of the foreign state are superior to those of the forum. It follows that not every statute of another state will override a conflicting statute of the forum by virtue of the full faith and credit clause; that the statute of a state may sometimes override the conflicting statute of another, both at home and abroad; and, again, that the two conflicting statutes may each prevail over the other at home, although given no extraterritorial effect in the state of the other.\n This was fully recognized by this Court in Bradford Electric Light & Power Co. v. Clapper, supra, pages 157-162 of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 571. There, upon an appraisal of the governmental interests of the two states, Vermont and New Hampshire, it was held that the compensation act of Vermont, where the status of employer and employee was established, should prevail over the conflicting statute of New Hampshire, where the injury occurred and the suit was brought. In reaching that conclusion, weight was given to the following circumstances: That liability under the Vermont act was an incident of the status of employer and employee created within Vermont, and, as such, continued in New Hampshire where the injury occurred; that it was a substitute for a tort action, which was permitted by the statute of New Hampshire; that the Vermont statute expressly provided that it should extend to injuries occurring without the state and was interpreted to preclude recovery by proceedings brought in any other state; and that there was no adequate basis for saying that the compulsory recognition of the Vermont statute by the courts of New Hampshire would be obnoxious to the public policy of that state. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n If, for the reasons given, the Vermont statute was held to override the New Hampshire statute in the courts of \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 549]\n\u00a0\n New Hampshire, it is hardly to be supposed that the Constitution would require it to be given any less effect in Vermont, even though the New Hampshire statute were set up as a defense to proceedings there. Similarly, in the present case, only if it appears that, in the conflict of interests which have found expression in the conflicting statutes, the interest of Alaska is superior to that of California, is there rational basis for denying the the courts of California the right to apply the laws of their own state. While in Bradford Electric Light & Power Co. v. Clapper, supra, it did not appear that the subordination of the New Hampshire statute to that of Vermont, by compulsion of the full faith and credit clause, would be obnoxious to the policy of New Hampshire, the Supreme Court of California has declared it to be contrary to the policy of the state to give effect to the provisions of the Alaska statute and that they conflict with its own statutes.\n There are only two differences material for present purposes, between the facts of the Clapper Case and those presented in this case: The employee here is not a resident of the place in which the employment was begun, and the employment was wholly to be performed in the jurisdiction in which the injury arose. Whether these differences, with a third-that the Vermont statute was intended to preclude resort to any other remedy even without the state-are, when taken with the differences between the New Hampshire and Alaska compensation laws, sufficient ground for withholding or denying any effect to the California statute in Alaska, we need not now inquire. But it is clear that they do not lessen the interest of California in enforcing its compensation act within the state, or give any added weight to the interest of Alaska in having its statute enforced in California. We need not repeat what we have already said of the peculiar concern of California in providing a remedy for those in the situation of the present employee. Its interest is sufficient to justify its \n\n[294 U.S. 532, 550]\n\u00a0\n legislation and is greater than that of Alaska, of which the employee was never a resident and to which he may never return. Nor should the fact that the employment was wholly to be performed in Alaska, although temporary in character, lead to any different result. It neither diminishes the interest of California in giving a remedy to the employee, who is a member of a class in the protection of which the state has an especial interest, nor does it enlarge the interest of Alaska whose temporary relationship with the employee has been severed.\n The interest of Alaska is not shown to be superior to that of California. No persuasive reason is shown for denying to California the right to enforce its own laws in its own courts, and in the circumstances the full faith and credit clause does not require that the statutes of Alaska be given that effect.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] L. 1929, c. 25; Comp.

HILLMAN(1935)\nNo. 15\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 222, 224]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Davis A. Reed, W. M. Robinson, and Edwin W. Smith, all of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioners. \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 225]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Alexander J. Barron, of Pittsburgh, Pa., Edward W. Knight, of Charleston. W. Va., and George E. Alter, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for respondents.\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 222, 230]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversies here involved arise in a suit in equity brought November 3, 1924, in the federal court for the Southern District of West Virginia by the Piedmont Coal Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, and three persons, inhabitants of Pennsylvania, against the Tower Hill Connellsville Coke Company of West Virginia, a corporation organized under the laws of that state. The plaintiffs own 4,000 common and 10,850 preferred shares of its stock. August 25, 1932, the court entered a decree that defendant's business be wound up and its properties converted into money and distributed to its creditors and shareholders, appointed petitioners receivers, and directed a special master to state an account and to report to the court all claims against defendant. Respondents have \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 231]\n\u00a0\n presented claims. Petitioners oppose their demands and by counterclaims ask affirmative relief.\n The questions, as put by them, are:\n\n 1. \nWhen a claimant appears before a master in a federal receivership proceeding and proves a claim to share in the distribution of the receivership res, does he submit himself to the jurisdiction of the receivership court for the adjudication of his liability to the res, when the counterclaim asserted against him by the receiver is of a nature cognizable in equity and its adjudication is essential to a final disposition of the receivership proceeding?\n\n 2. \nIs not the adjudication of the counterclaim against the claimant and the determination of the whole controversy within the purpose and intendment of Equity Rule 30?\n The Tower Hill Connellsville Coke Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, operated coal mines and coke plants. \n1\n The West Virginia Tower Hill, by issue of its stock to the stockholders of the Pennsylvania Tower Hill, acquired all the share capital of the latter and until January 8, 1930, was merely a holding company owning only that stock. In April, 1920, Thompson Connellsville Coke Company, a Pennsylvania corporation, purchased a majority, about 28,000 shares, of the common stock of the West Virginia Tower Hill. Respondent Hillman, an inhabitant of Pennsylvania, was president of and controlled the purchasing company. Respondents Sheets and Watson of that state were also its officers. Hillman became president and Sheets and Watson became officers of both Tower Hill Companies. In June, 1920, the Eastern Coke \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 232]\n\u00a0\n Company was organized under Pennsylvania law; Hillman became its president and Sheets and Watson were given other offices. They caused the Pennsylvania Tower Hill to subscribe for 51 per cent. of the common shares, and later it acquired the rest. The three individual respondents were also directors of the Tower Hill Companies, the Eastern Company and the two corporate respondents, the Hillman Coal & Coke Company and the Hecla Coal & Coke Company. Hillman, with the other two acting under his direction, dominated these five corporations. The corporations maintained joint general offices and joint sales, operating, and engineering departments.\n The preferred stock of the West Virginia Tower Hill was, in preference to the common, entitled to cumulative dividends at the annual rate of $6 per share, and, upon distribution of assets, par plus unpaid dividends. In 1924 the company paid $9, leaving then accumulated $97.50 per share. No other dividend has been paid. The stockholders' bill alleged that, ever since Hillman took control, the Pennsylvania Tower Hill had sufficient resources to pay a dividend out of which the West Virginia Tower Hill could make a payment on account of its own preferred stock but that the directors of the former fraudulently refused to declare any dividend, and that it was intended to exhaust the resources of both companies without paying anything to stockholders of the latter. It prayed the appointment of receivers empowered to take the shares of Pennsylvania Tower Hill and vote them at meetings of the company's stockholders and to demand that it declare dividends, to procure appointment of ancillary receivers in Pennsylvania and, if found necessary to bring suits there.\n Defendant's answer denied the fraud charged. The court found plaintiffs entitled to relief and that the Pennsylvania Tower Hill had sufficient funds to pay $20 per share on defendant's preferred stock. It declared that, \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 233]\n\u00a0\n if the companies failed within 30 days to take steps to do this, receivers would be appointed and given appropriate authority. Then, defendant moved to dismiss the suit for want of indispensable parties asserted to be its common stockholders including the Thompson company, the Pennsylvania Tower Hill, and defendant's directors, all citizens of Pennsylvania. In support of the motion, defendant alleged that the directors were the actors in all the transactions of which the bill complained. Making any inhabitant of Pennsylvania a party would destroy diversity of citizenship and oust jurisdiction. Salem Co. v. Manufacturers' Co., \n264 \nU.S. 182, 189\n, 44 S.Ct. 266, 31 A.L.R. 867. The court refused to entertain the motion, and, since no steps were taken to pay the dividend, appointed receivers and authorized them substantially as prayed.\n Defendant appealed. The Circuit Court of Appeals, July 8, 1929, found that the holders of defendant's preferred stock had been subjected to treatment that amounted to fraud in law and that enough had been shown to require the appointment of receivers with power to bring in the courts in Pennsylvania all actions necessary to protect plaintiffs' rights. It held that for the appointment of receivers, with power so limited, the West Virginia Tower Hill was the only necessary party. Tower Hill Connellsville Coke Co. v. Piedmont Coal Co., 33 F.(2d) 703. This court having denied defendant's petition for certiorari (\n280 \nU.S. 607\n, 50 S.Ct. 157) the District Court made its decree conform to the mandate of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The District Court for Western Pennsylvania appointed ancillary receivers with authority to sue the Pennsylvania Tower Hill, its officers and directors to obtain transfer by that company of property and money to the defendant. But after the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals, and while its mandate was stayed pending decision by this court upon petition for certiorari, the individual respondents caused several transfers to be made; Pennsylvania Tower Hill traded coal lands for a \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 234]\n\u00a0\n mine of Redstone Coal & Coke Company; Eastern Coke Company conveyed all its assets to Pennsylvania Tower Hill; and the latter transferred all its property to defendant.\n Then plaintiffs by an amended and supplemental bill prayed that defendant be dissolved and that receivers be appointed to distribute its assets to creditors and stockholders. The relief was sought upon the ground that the purpose of the transfers had been to prevent inquiry into the management of the Tower Hill companies; great losses were endangering security for preferred stock liability, and the purposes for which the defendant was organized had failed. Almost immediately after knowledge of plaintiffs' purpose to file that bill, defendant paid $1,184,000 for 11, 840 shares of the Emerald Coal & Coke Company. Plaintiffs then filed a second amended and supplemental bill. After answer and trial, the District Court, in accordance with the plaintiffs' allegations and proofs, found: The purpose of the transfer of assets from Pennsylvania Tower Hill to defendant was to prevent the receivers from securing any relief. Defendant's assets had so decreased as to imperil its preferred shares and their value might disappear in the near future. And August 25, 1932, it entered a decree substantially as prayed.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 64 F.(2d) 817, 91 A.L.R. 648. It held:\n None of the transactions occurring since its first decision has been to the advantage of the Tower Hill Companies. The purchase of the Emerald stock was definitely harmful. Assets are hardly more than enough to pay preferred stockholders. To continue the business would allow those in control, who have shown utter disregard of rights of preferred stockholders, to speculate further at their risk alone. Transfer of assets by the Pennsylvania Tower Hill to defendant rendered futile and useless any- \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 235]\n\u00a0\n thing the receivers might do in Pennsylvania and was made for that purpose. There was no lack of indispensable parties. This court denied certiorari. \n290 \nU.S. 675\n, 54 S.Ct. 93.\n Respondents' claims were verified and presented at a hearing before the master January 30, 1934. Hillman and Sheets claim the value of $105, 000 in government bonds furnished by them to obtain supersedeas on defendant's appeal from the decree of August 25, 1932. Watson claims $33, 750. This is for salary as defendant's secretary, and for services as counsel for defendant in the main suit and for the Pennsylvania Tower Hill in tax matters. The Hecla Company claims as owner of preferred and common shares of defendant. The Hillman Company claims $2,720.03, alleged to have been paid for account of defendant in adjustment of expenses of the companies having joint offices.\n February 19, 1934, the receivers filed an ancillary bill. It asserts four counterclaims. The first is for large sums that under the guise of salaries the individual respondents took from the Tower Hill and Eastern Companies. The amounts so withdrawn were wholly disproportionate to the value of services rendered. The second is for $1,184,000 that, for the advantage and benefit of Hillman personally, they caused defendant to pay for the shares of Emerald Company. The third is for money that they, through and for the Hillman Company, caused to be taken from the Tower Hill and Eastern Companies under pretense of apportionment of joint expenses. The fourth is for $356,000, the value of land of the Pennsylvania Tower Hill that they, for the benefit of the Hecla Company, caused to be transferred to the Redstone Company in exchange for the coal mine, and claim is made for additional sums paid for taxes and improvements upon the latter. The facts alleged amount to charges that the disbursement of moneys and transfer of property complained of \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 236]\n\u00a0\n were directed to be made by the individual respondents in bad faith and in violation of duties that as officers and directors they owed to the three companies and their stockholders and were misappropriations of the assets of these corporations.\n The bill alleges that the claims presented by respondents cannot be adjudicated without consideration of the claims that the receivers assert against them and that the adjudication of both groups of claims in one proceeding is necessary for the effectual enforcement of the principal decree. It prays that Hillman, Sheets, and Watson be required to pay the amounts that they took under the guise of salaries and, upon return to them of the shares of the Emerald Company, the amount they caused defendant to pay therefor; that they and the Hillman Company pay the money taken on the pretended division of expenses; and that they and the Hecla Company, upon return of the property received in exchange, pay the value of the coal lands handed over by Pennsylvania Tower Hill to the Redstone Company, together with the net amounts expended by the Tower Hill Companies upon the first-mentioned property.\n The court's order granting leave to file the ancillary bill directed that it be given a separate number and that it be ancillary to the main suit, required defendants to move to dismiss or to answer within a specified time, directed receivers to mail to respondents at Pittsburg, and to deliver at the office in West Virginia of defendant's counsel in the main suit, a copy of the order and of the ancillary bill. This having been done, respondents appeared specially and moved to vacate the order and to quash the service on the ground that none of them was within the jurisdiction but that each was an inhabitant of Pennsylvania within the purview of section 51, Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  112, 28 USCA  112. \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 237]\n\u00a0\n The court dismissed the bill for want of jurisdiction over the persons of respondents. By a memorandum filed with the order, the District Judge indicated that he was of opinion that the respondents, by presenting their claims and appearing before the master, had become parties for all purposes but that, if he were to so hold, the suit would have to be tried before the question of jurisdiction could be finally decided, and that therefore he would grant the motion to dismiss so that the receivers might appeal and have the question settled in advance of trial. The Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the judges dissenting, held that the District Court was without jurisdiction of respondents to adjudicate the counterclaims or to grant any affirmative relief. It did have jurisdiction to pass on any defense, legal or equitable, which might be asserted against respondents' claims, and to stay action thereon until the counterclaims could be elsewhere adjudicated 'so that they could be set off against the claims, or the amounts payable thereunder, as might be proper.' The District Court should have retained the ancillary bill, 'treating it as a petition to stay action on the claims ... and as setting up defenses ... where the matters alleged could be considered as purely matters of defense as distinguished from counterclaims.' The court modified the decree and remanded the case for proceedings in accordance with the opinion. (C.C.A.) 75 F.(2d) 451, 456. This court granted certiorari. \n295 \nU.S. 725\n, 55 S.Ct. 826\n\n\n The subject-matter of the main suit is the right of plaintiffs, being stockholders of defendant, to have its business wound up, and its assets collected and distributed among its creditors and stockholders. That the District Court had jurisdiction to enter that decree has been finally adjudged. Tower Hill-Connellsville Coke Co. v. Piedmont Coal Co. (C.C.A.) 64 F.(2d) 817, 91 A.L.R. 648. The receivers are the court's representatives and are entitled to have all the property belonging to defendant, and, upon leave, may sue to re- \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 238]\n\u00a0\n cover any part of the res. The controversies before us arise between respondents who come to share therein and the receivers who not only put in issue the validity of respondents' claims but allege that they have and refuse to account for a portion of the assets. Undoubtedly the court has jurisdiction of the subject-matter, i.e., the claims and counterclaims. White v. Ewing, \n159 \nU.S. 36\n, 15 S.Ct. 1018; Pope v. Louisville, New Albany, etc., Railway Co., \n173 \nU.S. 573, 577\n, 19 S.Ct. 500; Peck v. Elliott (C.C.A.) 79 F. 10, 38 L.R.A. 616.\n We come to the question whether the court has jurisdiction of the persons of respondents in respect of the counterclaims.\n They were not parties to the controversy resulting in the decree winding up defendant's affairs. The court has issued to process against them. The delivery of copies of the order and bill in accordance with the court's direction did not make them parties. But petitioners insist that by presenting their claims respondents submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of the court to grant affirmative relief on the causes of action alleged against them. Respondents contend that in the last analysis the issue is one of venue. They say: The ancillary bill is an original one commencing a suit to which they, being inhabitants of Pennsylvania, cannot be made parties by the service of process. The proving of claims before the special master did not make them parties to the original cause, and they have not thereby waived the privilege conferred by section 51 of the Judicial Code.\n Respondents appropriately presented their claims and became entitled to adjudication without petition for intervention, any formal pleading, or commencement of suit. Unquestionably, they submitted themselves to the court's jurisdiction in respect of all defenses that might be made by the receivers and of all objections that other claimants might interpose to the validity, amounts, or priorities of \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 239]\n\u00a0\n their claims. And they put themselves in position, should their interest warrant, to challenge the receivers' acts and the demands of others claiming as creditors. Stewart v. Dunham, \n115 \nU.S. 61, 64\n, 5 S.Ct. 1163; Elkins v. First Nat. Bank (C.C.A.) 43 F.(2d) 777, 779; Continental Trust Co. v. Toledo, St. L. & K.C.R. Co. (C.C.) 82 F. 642, 647; Jones & Laughlins v. Sands (C.C.A.) 79 F. 913; Gasquet v. Fidelity Trust & Safety Vault Co., (C.C.A.) 57 F. 80, 83. Acme White Lead & Color Works v. Republic Motor T. Co. (D.C.) 285 F. 88, 90. And see Youtsey v. Hoffman (C. C.) 108 F. 693, 695.\n The ancillary bill is not an original bill for the commencement of a suit. That it was not so intended is shown by the fact that process was not prayed or issued. While in form not inappropriate for commencement of suit, it was in fact formulated and filed to serve as a pleading in the main suit to put respondents to proof of their claims and to assert the right to affirmative relief. Treating their established forms as flexible, courts of equity may suit proceedings and remedies to the circumstances of cases and formulate them appropriately to safeguard, conveniently to adjudge, and promptly to enforce substantial rights of all the parties before them. See Story, Equity Jurisprudence (14th Ed.)  28.\n All trusts, those implied as well as those expressly created, are within the jurisdiction of courts of equity. The doctrine of trusts is deemed to be 'the most efficient instrument in the hands of a chancellor for maintaining justice, good faith, and good conscience; and it has been extended so as to embrace, not only lands, but chattels, funds of every kind, things in action, and moneys.' Clews v. Jamieson, \n182 \nU.S. 461, 479\n, 21 S.Ct. 845, 852; Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (4th Ed.)  151. It is to be understood from the allegations of the ancillary bill that the individual respondents as officers and directors so dominated the corporate owners that they had and exerted full power over \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 240]\n\u00a0\n all the corporate property and transactions. Causes of action arising from transgressions of officers and directors of corporations such as those on which the receivers rest their counterclaims are cognizable in equity for the reason that the receivers have no adequate remedy at law and also because respondents, as it is alleged, fraudulently obtained defendant's property and therefore cannot in equity and good conscience retain it. See Pomeroy,  155, 157; Cockrill v. Cooper (C.C.A.) 86 F. 7, 13, et seq. And, so far as concerns the matters in controversy here, the individual respondents are to be dealt with just as if they were technically trustees for creditors and stockholders. Koehler v. Black River Falls Iron Company, 2 Bl. 715, 720, 721; Jackson v. Ludeling, 21 Wall. 616, 624, 631; Wardell v. Union P. Railroad Co., \n103 \nU.S. 651, 658\n, 659 S.; Briggs v. Spaulding, \n141 \nU.S. 132, 147\n, 11 S.Ct. 924; Geddes v. Anaconda Mining Co., \n254 \nU.S. 590, 599\n, 41 S.Ct. 209. The allegations of the ancillary bill make it appear that the corporate respondents were so under control of the individual respondents as to be merely their tools for carrying out the transactions culminating in the misappropriations charged. It results, therefore, that all the claims asserted against respondents may be dealt with in equity.\n The rule contained in section 51, Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.,  112, 28 USCA  112, that is invoked by respondents here declares: 'No civil suit shall be brought in any district court against any person by any original process or proceeding in any other district than that whereof he is an inhabitant.' The section applies only where a suit is 'brought ... by any original process or proceeding.' No attempt was made to summon respondents into court. That provision does not affect the general jurisdiction of District Courts, but merely confers a personal privilege that may be waived. General Inv. Co. v. Lake Shore R. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 261, 272\n, 43 S.Ct. 106; Lee \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 241]\n\u00a0\n v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 653, 655\n, 43 S.Ct. 230. By presenting their claims respondents subjected themselves to all the consequences that attach to an appearance, section 51 to the contrary notwithstanding. See General Elec. Co. v. Marvel Co., \n287 \nU.S. 430, 435\n, 53 S.Ct. 202.\n Petitioners invoke a provision of our Equity Rule 30 (28 USCA following section 723), 'The defendant by his answer shall set out ... his defense to each claim asserted in the bill. ... The answer must state ... any counterclaim arising out of the transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit, and may ... set up any set-off or counterclaim against the plaintiff which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity against him.' It may not be said that, by presenting their claims, respondents commenced a suit and so brought that provision into play. The rule does not purport to cover, and was not prescribed for, situations such as that here presented. Chandler & Price Co. v. Brandtjen & Kluge, Inc., \n296 \nU.S. 53\n, 56 S.Ct. 6. But the omission so to extend the rule gives rise to no implication that receivers may not assert and enforce, against those who appear and demand part of the res, counterclaims for portions of the receivership estate that they wrongfully took and still withhold. The right of the receivers to have affirmative relief in the receivership court is supported by the same, or at least similar and equally strong, reasons as those that constitute the foundation of the rule. Cf. American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., \n260 \nU.S. 360, 365\n, 43 S.Ct. 149; Moore v. New York Cotton Exchange, \n270 \nU.S. 593, 609\n, 46 S.Ct. 367, 45 A. L.R. 1370.\n Respondents' contention means that, while invoking the court's jurisdiction to establish their right to participate in the distribution, they may deny its power to require them to account for what they misappropriated. In behalf of creditors and stockholders, the receivers reasonably may insist that, before taking aught, respondents \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 242]\n\u00a0\n may by the receivership court be required to make restitution. That requirement is in harmony with the rule generally followed by courts of equity that, having jurisdiction of the parties to controversies brought before them, they will decide all matters in dispute and decree complete relief. Pomeroy,  181, 231. United States v. Union Pacific Railway Co., \n160 \nU.S. 1, 52\n, 16 S.Ct. 190; Camp v. Boyd, \n229 \nU.S. 530, 551\n, 552 S., 33 S.Ct. 785; McGowan v. Parish, \n237 \nU.S. 285, 296\n, 35 S.Ct. 543; Greene v. Louisville & Interurban R. Co., \n244 \nU.S. 499, 520\n, 37 S.Ct. 673, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 88. Cf. Hartford Accident Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n273 \nU.S. 207, 217\n, 218 S., 47 S.Ct. 357. Distribution may not be made without decision upon the counterclaims. Nothing is more clearly a part of the subject- matter of the main suit than recovery of all that to the res belongs. Gasquet v. Fidelity Trust & Safety Vault Co., supra, 57 F. 80, 83, 84; Peck v. Elliott, supra; Hollander v. Heaslip (C.C.A.) 222 F. 808, 811.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held that the District Court has jurisdiction to pass on all defenses against respondents' claims, but erred in holding it to be without jurisdiction to grant affirmative relief. The decision permits the court to pass upon the receivers' rights of recoupment and set-off up to the amount of respondents' claims, but, without regard to what they are entitled to have, prevents that court from giving them judgment against respondents. That limitation may be assumed to be in harmony with the rule governing recoupment and set-off that formerly was strictly applied. Cf. Virginia-Carolina Chemical Co. v. Kirven, \n215 \nU.S. 252, 258\n, 30 S.Ct. 78; Merchants' Heat & L. Co. v. James B. Clow & Sons, \n204 \nU.S. 286, 289\n, 290 S., 27 S.Ct. 285. But, contrary to the rule that equity will decree complete relief, the prescribed restrictions prevent appropriate adaptation of equity to the circumstances of cases. It requires the receivers to split their causes of action. While permitted to seek enforcement of so much of their claims as are 'purely defensive,' they would be com- \n\n[296 U.S. 222, 243]\n\u00a0\n pelled to go to another court to recover the rest. The splitting required extends even to separate items that go to make up a single cause of action; e.g., the items constituting the claim based upon respondents' apportionment of expenses. And if the receivership court has jurisdiction of respondents in respect of only so much of the receivers' counterclaims as are strictly defensive, then its determinations as to those parts would not be binding as to the rest. Portland Wood Pipe Co. v. Slick Bros. Const. Co. (D.C.) 222 F. 528. The decision may be construed to direct the receivership court to stay all proceedings on respondents' claims until final judgment may be obtained in suits brought elsewhere upon the causes of action asserted by the receivers. That would introduce additional elements of uncertainty and would involve unnecessary delay, work, and expense. As the individual respondents dominated the defendant and the other corporations used to effect the alleged misappropriations and also directed defendant's part in this litigation, it would seem that necessarily most of the issues in respect of the counterclaims will be quite similar to those litigated in the main suit. Unquestionably, all matters in the controversies between the parties may be tried and determined more conveniently and promptly in the receivership court than elsewhere.\n It is clear that, under the circumstances disclosed, the restrictions laid by the Circuit Court of Appeals upon the receivership court are not consistent with that freedom as to procedure that necessarily belongs to courts of equity administering receiverships. See Portland Wood Pipe Co. v. Slick Bros. Const. Co., supra. Its decree will be reversed and the case remanded to the District Court, with directions to proceed in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The facts prior to the appointment of the special master are derived from the records of earlier litigation in this suit that were filed in this court with petitions for certiorari.

Thacher, of New York City, for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases come here on certiorari, \n293 \nU.S. 528, 548\n, 629 S., 55 S.Ct. 139, 79 L.Ed. --, to review a decree of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, 72 F.(2d) 53, which affirmed a decree of the District Court, 5 F. Supp. 32, holding valid and infringed the patent of Vogt and others, No. 1, 713,726, of May 21, 1929, applied for March 20, 1922, for a 'device for phonographs with linear phonogram carriers.' The two cases were tried together and have been brought here on a single record.\n Petitioners, the defendants below, are operators of motion picture theaters whose sound reproduction machines are said to infringe certain claims of the patent in suit. The Radio Corporation of America is defending both cases on behalf of its subsidiary, R.C.A. Photophone, Inc., which supplied the petitioners' machines. Respondents, the plaintiffs below, are a patent holding company and a licensee.\n Of the nineteen claims of the patent, seven are in issue. Five of them, numbered 5, 7, 17, 18, and 19, relate to a device for securing uniformity of speed in machines used for recording and reproducing talking motion pictures, and are referred to as the 'flywheel claims.' They may conveniently be considered separately from claims 9 and 13, which present the flywheel claims in a different aspect. Claim 9, as originally allowed, was for the arcuate flexing of the film record; claim 13 similarly was for a combination for a means for projecting a narrow line of light upon and through the moving film to a photoelectric cell in \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 480]\n\u00a0\n sound reproduction. A disclaimer, filed by respondent shortly before the trial, purports, in varying terms, to add the flywheel device to each of these claims.\n While both courts below have found invention and sustained the patent, the Court of Appeals, as will presently appear in more detail, did not pass on the separate claims in issue, but found invention in a combination of elements not embraced in any single claim. In consequence, the case presents no question of concurrent findings by the courts below that the claims in issue severally involve invention. See Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, \n269 \nU.S. 177, 180\n, 46 S.Ct. 42.\n The Flywheel Claims.\n'Phonograms,' or sound records, for the recordation and reproduction of sound, are of several types. They include discs or cylinders to which, and from which, sound vibrations are transmitted mechanically by a stylus in the course of recording and reproducing sound. Long strips of waxed paper carrying sound record grooves, similarly made, are used. Other types are long strips of film on which sound is photographically recorded, and long steel wires on which sound variations have been magnetically recorded. The claims relate to an improvement in mechanisms for recording and reproducing sound by the use of linear photographic record carriers. The typical procedure in recording and reproducing sound by the use of photographic film strips is described in Paramount Publix Corporation v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, \n294 \nU.S. 464\n, 55 S.Ct. 449, decided this day, and need not be repeated here.\n\n Both in recording and reproducing sound, by any form of record, uniform speed in the movement of the phonogram is of the highest importance, in order to secure evenness and regularity in the reproduced sound. The specifications state:\n'The recording and the reproduction of sound waves by the use of linear phonogram carriers such as film strips, \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 481]\n\u00a0\n steel wires, and so forth, can only be effected in absolutely satisfactory manner, even after the removal of all other occurring difficulties, when the speed of the record carrier is uniform both for the receiving and the reproduction, and when in both cases no variations of any kind occur. Especially in the case of musical reproductions is the record extremely sensitive to the slightest variations of speed.'\n\n They also point out that linear phonograms such as the photographic film, because of their lightness and their want of the momentum afforded by a revolving cylinder or disc record, are peculiarly susceptible to irregularities of movement caused by the play or friction in the projections and connections of the many parts of the propelling apparatus, and declare that:\n'According to the present invention, this draw-back which attaches to all hitherto known propulsion mechanisms for linear phonogram records is obviated by the arrangement, that the light sound record has given to it at the controlling point the property of a weighty mass. This is attained by the arrangement that the record carrier (a film strip or the like) is firmly pressed against one or more rollers connecting with a heavy rotating mass, so that the record moves in exact conformity with the rollers and the rotating mass.'\n\n The references to a 'weighty mass' or 'a heavy rotating mass' used to secure uniformity of motion are to the familiar flywheel. The specified 'property' of a rotating heavy mass is inertia, the tendency of matter in motion to continue in motion, the force of which is increased by the mass of the moving body. It is the property which gives to the flywheel its peculiar efficacy in securing uniformity of speed in mechanisms with which it is associated.\n The first three flywheel claims, 5, 7, and 17, are apparatus claims. The others, 18 and 19, are, in form, method claims, defining the method of securing uniformity in \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 482]\n\u00a0\n movement of the record film by apparatus defined by claims 5 and 17. Claim 5 reads as follows:\n'In phonographic apparatus in which the sound record is formed on an elongated ribbon of inconsiderable mass, having feeding perforations therein, the combination of\n\n'(a) Means for supporting and progressing the record ribbon from one point to another point and past an intermediate point at which the record is made on the ribbon in recording or from which the record is taken from the ribbon in reproducing, including\n\n'(1) A toothed cylinder over a portion of which the ribbon passes adjacent to said intermediate point, the teeth of said cylinder engaging the perforations of the ribbon,\n\n'(2) A fly-wheel associated with said cylinder, and\n\n'(3) Means for rotating said cylinder, under control of said fly- wheel at uniform speed.'\n\n Claim 17 is substantially the same as claim 5; the principal difference being that it uses the word 'cylinder' instead of 'toothed cylinder.'\n Claim 7 adds to the essentials of claim 5 'a resilient connection between said driving member (the shaft) and fly wheel, and stop means for limiting the amount of yielding of said resilient connection.' This so- called flexible or elastic flywheel connection, designed to overcome more gradually the inertia of the flywheel, and thus to secure an improved flywheel operation, was anticipated, among others, by the Constable patent, United States No. 1,425,177, of August 8, 1922, applied for June 24, 1918, as the District Court found. Its inclusion in claim 7 may therefore be disregarded as adding nothing more to the present patent than the flywheel without it.\n There is no serious contention, nor could there well be, that the combination apparatus, for moving the linear record past the translation point at which the sound is recorded or reproduced involves invention without the flywheel. Mechanisms for moving linear strips or rib- \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 483]\n\u00a0\n bons, by passing the strip over a revolving drum or cylinder, are a familiar type in the arts. They have long been used in the motion picture industry when it was desired to employ the linear strips at an intermediate point for sound and picture reproduction, and the like. Such mechanism, for moving a picture film past the translation point in a motion picture projector, is shown by the Holst patent, United States No. 587,527, of 1897. A like mechanism for recording or reproducing sound, or both, by the use of linear photographic records, is shown in the British Duddel patent, No. 24,546, of 1902, and the Reis patent, United States No. 1,607,480, of 1923, filed May 21, 1913. Still other mechanisms, like two of the figures attached to the specifications of the patent in suit, show the translation point at the film-carrying cylinder. Examples are the patents of Bock, United States No. 364,472, of 1887, Byron, United States No. 1,185,056, of 1916, and Pedersen, British patent No. 115,942, of 1918. The gist of respondent's contention, as is shown by the claims and the parts of the specifications already quoted, is that, by the addition of the flywheel to this familar mechanism, the patentees have succeeded in producing a new type of machine for recording and reproducing sound by the photographic film method. It is insisted that the new device, because of its greater accuracy and precision of film movement, is so useful and constitutes such an advance in the sound motion picture art, as to entitle it to the rank of a patentable invention.\n The flywheel set upon a revolving shaft is an ancient mechanical device for securing continuity and uniformity of motion when brought into association with any form of machinery moved by intermittent force or meeting with irregular or intermittent resistence. \n1\n So universal is its \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 484]\n\u00a0\n use for that purpose in every type of machinery that standard treatises on mechanics, long before the application for the present patent, gave the mathematical formulae for ascertaining the appropriate weight and dimensions of a flywheel, moving at a given speed, required to overcome known variations in force resistance, and prescribed the standard procedure for locating the flywheel in as direct association as possible with that part of the mechanism at which the intermittent resistance occurs. See article, 'Mechanics,'  121, Encyclopaedia Britannica (11th Ed. 1911); Angus, Theory of Machines, pp. 261-272 (1917).\n The specifications of the patent recognize that disc and cylinder records themselves operate as flywheels and proceed to show how a want of a similar control may be supplied, in mechanisms used for motion picture film records, by the addition of the flywheel. But this was specifically taught by the prior art for the reproduction of sound both from phonographic and film records. There are in evidence two Edison commercial recording machines with cylindrical records, which were used at the Edison Recording Laboratory in New York before 1921. Each has a heavy flywheel mounted directly on the shaft of the record-carrying cylinder. These flywheels produce a high degree of 'speed constancy.' An application for a patent by Edison in 1879 on a claim for a combination 'with the phonograph cylinder and its shaft, of a flywheel,' was rejected by the Examiner April 7, 1879, as covering the 'use of a fly wheel as ordinarily used with machinery for the purpose of securing uniformity of motion.' Upon reconsideration, the claim was again rejected on the ground that the adaptation of the flywheel required only the exercise of 'ordinary good judgment' and not the inventive faculty.\n The Underhill patent, United States No. 995,390, of 1911, exhibits a phonograph machine with a flywheel to secure uniformity of motion of the record. The specifications \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 485]\n\u00a0\n state that the flywheel is used for that purpose. The patent of Alexander Graham Bell and others (Bell & Tainter), United States No. 341,213, of 1886, discloses a mechanism for recording sound on a photographic plate rotated at uniform speed under the control of a flywheel. Another patent of the same inventors, United States No. 341,214, of 1886, discloses a flywheel used in association with a mechanism for moving a linear waxcoated phonograph record at uniform speed for recording and reproducing speech and other sounds. That the record used was not photographic is unimportant. The problem of securing uniformity of motion of the record is the same for either type of linear sound record, as the present patent itself establishes, by classing together all types of linear records as exhibiting the 'problem' to which the patent is directed. The French Dragoumis patent, No. 472,467, of 1914, shows a film record moved by a cylinder turning on a shaft carrying a large wheel, obviously acting as a flywheel, though not described as such. See American Road-Machine Co. v. Pennock & Sharp Co., \n164 \nU.S. 26, 38\n, 17 S.Ct. 1. The flywheel was mounted on the shaft of the record-carrying cylinder at the translation point. Finally, the British Pedersen patent, already referred to, shows a photographic sound record carried by a cylinder as it passes the translation point. His specifications, after pointing out that sound is 'exceedingly sensitive to variation in rotating speed,' and that it is necessary to obviate this during the recording and reproducing operations, state that this may be done 'by providing particularly large flywheels.'\n There are numerous patents showing the like use of the flywheel in apparatus for reproducing motion pictures from film. That of Holst, already noted, shows in detail an apparatus exhibiting every element of claim 5 except that its use is for reproducing motion pictures instead of sound from film. The toothed cylinder is located adjacent \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 486]\n\u00a0\n to the intermediate point which is the point of translation. The flywheel is associated with the cylinder by being attached to the rotary shaft carrying the cylinder.\n An improvement to an apparatus or method, to be patentable, must be the result of invention, and not the mere exercise of the skill of the calling or an advance plainly indicated by the prior art. Electric Cable Joint Co. v. Brooklyn Edison Co., \n292 \nU.S. 69, 79\n, 80 S., 54 S.Ct. 586. The inclusion of a flywheel in any form of mechanism to secure uniformity of its motion has so long been standard procedure in the field of mechanics and machine design that the use of it in the manner claimed by the present patent involved no more than the skill of the calling. See American Road-Machine Co. v. Pennock & Sharp Co., supra, page 41 of 164 U. S., 17 S.Ct. 1. Patents for devices for use both in the motion picture art and in the art of sound reproduction, notably the Holst, the Bell & Tainter, the Dragoumis patents, and the Edison application, already noted, plainly foreshadowed the use made of the flywheel in the present patent, if they did not anticipate it. The patentees brought together old elements, in a mechanism involving no new principle, to produce an old result, greater uniformity of motion. However skillfully this was done, and even though there was produced a machine of greater precision and a higher degree of motion constancy, and hence one more useful in the art, it was still the product of skill, not of invention. Hailes v. Van Wormer, 20 Wall. 353, 368; Grinnell Washing Machine Co. v. E. E. Johnson Co., \n247 U.S. 426\n, 432-434, 38 S.Ct. 547; Powers- Kennedy Contracting Corp. v. Concrete Mixing & Conveying Co., \n282 \nU.S. 175, 186\n, 51 S.Ct. 95. Its application in recording sound or reproducing it, by use of a particular type of linear record, the photographic, analogous so far as the problem of uniformity of motion was concerned to other types used by Bell & Tainter and Dragoumis, was not invention. See Paramount Publix Corporation v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, supra. \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 487]\n\u00a0\n There is some suggestion in respondent's brief and argument that the location of the flywheel adjacent to the toothed cylinder is an element in the invention which contributed to the success of the mechanism. But, as has already been indicated, such location is but the teaching of the art. In any case, the claims call only for the flywheel located upon the shaft or in association with the cylinder. No particular location is mentioned.\n The Court of Appeals, in upholding the patent, made no examination of its separate claims, but treated the patent throughout as though it were a combination of five distinct elements, the photo-electric cell, the arcuate flexing of the film, the flywheel, the flexible connection of the flywheel, and the optical slit, although nowhere in the patent is any such combination claimed. The patent thus upheld is one which was neither claimed nor granted. Under the statute, it is the claims of the patent which define the invention. See White v. Dunbar, \n119 \nU.S. 47, 51\n, 52 S., 7 S. Ct. 72; McClain v. Ortmayer, \n141 U.S. 419\n, 423-425, 12 S.Ct. 76; Paper Bag Patent Case (Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co.), \n210 \nU.S. 405, 419\n, 28 S.Ct. 748; Smith v. Snow, \n294 \nU.S. 1\n, 55 S.Ct. 279, decided January 7, 1935. And each claim must stand or fall, as itself sufficiently defining invention, independently of the others. See Carlton v. Bokee, 17 Wall. 463, 472; Russell v. Place, \n94 U.S. 606\n, 609; Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Machine Co., \n213 \nU.S. 301, 319\n, 29 S.Ct. 495; Symington Co. v. National Malleable Castings Co., \n250 \nU.S. 383, 385\n, 39 S.Ct. 542; Smith v. Snow, supra; Walker on Patents (6th Ed.)  220. As none of the flywheel claims as drawn define an invention, none can be aided by reading into it parts of the specifications, or of other claims, which the patentees failed to include in it.\n The court below, attributing the rapid development of the sound motion picture industry to the invention in the patent in suit, thought, as respondent earnestly argues here, that its utility and commercial success must be accepted as convincing evidence of invention. But we think that \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 488]\n\u00a0\n want of invention would have to be far more doubtful than it is to be aided by evidence of commercial success, indicating that it brought realization of a long-felt want. Smith v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co., \n93 \nU.S. 486, 495\n, 496 S.; Grant v. Walker, \n148 \nU.S. 547, 556\n, 13 S.Ct. 699; De Forest Radio Co. v. General Electric Co., \n283 \nU.S. 664, 685\n, 51 S.Ct. 563. Compare McClain v. Ortmayer, supra, page 428 of 141 U.S., 12 S.Ct. 76. Moreover, the record fails to show that there was any long felt or generally recognized want in the motion picture industry for the device defined by the flywheel claims, or that the use of sound motion pictures was delayed by the inability of those skilled in the art to add a flywheel to the apparatus in order to give the desired uniformity of motion to linear phonograms. See Paramount Publix Corporation v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation, supra. There was no public demand for sound motion pictures before 1926, when the disc system of the Western Electric Company was first publicly used in conjunction with moving pictures. Before change to the photographic film system could be accomplished, it was necessary to await the development of numerous electrical devices not embraced in the present claims. Among them were adequate amplifiers, loud speakers, and microphones. Progress in the perfection of these appliances was achieved rapidly, after the public acceptance of the sound picture in 1926, through the efforts of many independent workers in the field. When the need arose for a mechanism suitable to move film records with such speed constancy as to reproduce the sound successfully, it was forthcoming. Only the skill of the art was required to adapt the flywheel device to familiar types of mechanism to secure the desired result.\n Claims 9 and 13.\n The court below made no reference to the contention of petitioner, urged here and below, that the patent was rendered invalid by the disclaimer filed shortly before the \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 489]\n\u00a0\n trial of the present suit. The patent as issued contained the following claims:\n'9. The method of translating sound or similar vibrations to or from a film record by the use of light varied in accordance with the sound, which comprises flexing the film arcuately longitudinally at the point of translation and rapidly and uniformly moving the film in a circumferential direction past said point.'\n\n'13. An apparatus for reproducing speech, music or the like sounds from vibrations recorded on a film, by the use of a line of light varied in accordance with the sound, comprising a photo-electric cell, means for imparting to the film a rapid and uniform motion longitudinally of the film past said cell, a source of light projection for providing said light, and an objective lens in the path of said light and spaced from the film for directing said light as a converging narrow line impinging on the film at a point in the region of the focal point of said lens, said light passing through the film and on to said cell, the space between said lens and the film being free of obstructions to said light.'\n\n In 1933 respondents, by appropriate procedure, disclaimed:\n'(b) The method as set forth in claim 9, except wherein the uniformity of movement of the film past the translation point is effected by subjecting the portion of the film passing said point to the control of the inertia of a rotating weighty mass.\n\n'(c) The combination as set forth in claim 13, except wherein a flywheel is operatively connected with the film through means which imparts uniformity of motion of the flywheel to the film.'\n\n While the effect of the disclaimer, if valid, was in one sense to narrow the claims, so as to cover the combinations originally appearing in claims 9 and 13 only when used in conjunction with a flywheel, it also operated to \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 490]\n\u00a0\n add the flywheel as a new element to each of the combinations described in the claims. The disclaimer is authorized by Rev. St.  4917 (35 USCA  65), which provides that, when 'through inadvertence, accident, or mistake ... a patentee has claimed more than that of which he was the ... inventor ... his patent shall be valid for all that part which is truly and justly his own,' provided that he or his assigns 'make disclaimer of such parts of the thing patented as he shall not choose to claim ... stating therein the extent of his interest in such patent.' While this statute affords a wide scope for relinquishment by the patentee of part of the patent mistakenly claimed, where the effect is to restrict or curtail the monopoly of the patent,2 it does not permit the addition of a new element to the combination previously claimed, whereby the patent originally for one combination is transformed into a new and different one for the new combination. \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 491]\n\u00a0\n If a change such as the present could validly be made, it could only be under the provisions of the reissue statute, Rev. St.  4916, amended by Act May 24, 1928 (35 USCA  64), which authorizes the alteration of the original invention in a reissued patent, upon surrender of the old patent, for its unexpired term. Upon the reissue, 'the specifications and claims in every such case shall be subject to revision and restriction in the same manner as original applications are.' A patent amended by disclaimer thus speaks from the date of the original patent, while the reissued patent, with respect to the amended claim, speaks from the date of reissue. If respondent could thus, by disclaimer, add the flywheel to the arcuate flexing claim and to the optical claim, he would in effect secure a new patent operating retroactively in a manner not permitted by the reissue statute and without subjecting the new claims to revision or restriction by the customary Patent Office procedure required in the case of an original or reissued patent. Such transformation of a patent is plainly not within the scope of the disclaimer statute, and the attempted disclaimer as applied to claims 9 and 13 is void. Hailes v. Albany Stove Co., \n123 \nU.S. 582, 587\n, 8 S.Ct. 262.3 See Union Metallic Cartridge Co. v. United States Cartridge Co., \n112 \nU.S. 624, 642\n, 5 S.Ct. 475; Collins Co. v. Coes, \n130 \nU.S. 56, 68\n, 9 S.Ct. 514. Compare Grant v. Walker, \n\n[294 U.S. 477, 492]\n\u00a0\n \n148 \nU.S. 547, 553\n, 13 S.Ct. 699. It is unnecessary to consider whether the flywheel claim, if added to the original claims 9 and 13, is such a part of the patentee's original conception as to entitle it to the benefit of the reissue statute. See Miller v. Brass Co., \n104 U.S. 350\n, 355; Hoffheins v. Russell, \n107 \nU.S. 132, 141\n, 1 S.Ct. 570; Gage v. Herring, \n107 \nU.S. 640, 645\n, 2 S.Ct. 819; Ives v. Sargent, \n119 \nU.S. 652, 663\n, 7 S.Ct. 436; Corbin Cabinet Lock Co. v. Eagle Lock Co., \n150 U.S. 38\n, 41-43, 14 S.Ct. 28.\n With the invalid disclaimer must fall the original claims as they stood before the disclaimer. The disclaimer is a representation, as open as the patent itself, on which the public is entitled to rely, that the original claim is one which the patentee does not, in the language of the statute, 'choose to claim or to hold by virtue of the patent.' Upon the filing of the disclaimers, the original claims were withdrawn from the protection of the patent laws, and the public was entitled to manufacture and use the device originally claimed as freely as though it had been abandoned. To permit the abandoned claim to be revived, with the presumption of validity, because the patentee had made an improper use of the disclaimer, would be an inadmissible abuse of the patent law to the detriment of the public.\n While the precise effect of an invalid disclaimer upon the original claim seems not to have been judicially determined, analogous principles of the patent law are so well recognized as to leave no doubt what our decision should be. It has long been settled that a claim abandoned or rejected in the Patent Office with the acquiescence of the applicant cannot be revived in a reissued patent. Yale Lock Mfg. Co. v. Berkshire Nat. Bank, \n135 \nU.S. 342, 379\n, 10 S.Ct. 884; Dobson v. Lees, \n137 U.S. 258\n, 263-265, 11 S.Ct. 71. Nor can an interpretation be given the allowed claims which would revive the claims which were abandoned in order to obtain the patent. Shepard v.

Similarly where, in order to secure a reissued patent, a disclaimer is made of a part of the original claims, the part so disclaimed cannot be revived by a second reissued patent, Leggett v. Avery, \n101 U.S. 256\n, nor where the disclaimer is for the purpose of securing an extension of the original patent, Union Metallic Cartridge Co. v. U.S. Cartridge Co., supra, page 644 of 112 U.S., 5 S.Ct. 475. See Collins v. Coes, supra, page 68 of 130 U.S., 9 S.Ct. 514. Compare Gage v. Herring, supra, page 646 of 107 U.S ., 2 S.Ct. 819. The settled rule that unreasonable delay in making a disclaimer invalidates the whole patent, Ensten v. Simon, Ascher & Co., \n282 U.S. 445\n, 452-458, 51 S.Ct. 207; compare O'Reilly v. Morse, 15 How. 62, 121; Seymour v. McCormick, 19 How. 96, 106; Silsby v. Foote, 20 How. 378, 387; Gage v. Herring, supra, page 646 of 107 U.S., 2 S.Ct. 819; Yale Lock Mfg. Co. v. Sargent, \n117 \nU.S. 536, 554\n, 6 S.Ct. 934; Minerals Separation, Ltd. v. Butte & Superior Mining Co., \n250 \nU.S. 336, 354\n, 39 S.Ct. 496, rests upon the similar principle that misuse of the patent, or a part of it, by the patentee, in such a manner as to mislead the public or operate to its detriment, deprives the claim of the benefit of the patent laws. The part of the patent disclaimed can stand in no better position because the disclaimer was an unsuccessful misuse of the disclaimer statute.\n As claims 9 and 13 must be held invalid because of the improper disclaimers, and as the remaining claims in issue, the flywheel claims, are held invalid for want of invention, it is unnecessary to determine whether the improper disclaimers as to some of the claims render the entire patent void, as petitioners contend, and as has been intimated but not decided.

Pasco, all of Pensacola, Fla., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A contract for drilling a well at the Naval Air Station at Pensacola, Fla., was made in November, 1930, between Melton J. Gray and the United States government. It was drawn in the standard form. Payments were to be made in accordance with approved estimates during the progress of the work, but the contracting officer was required to retain 10 per cent. of the estimated amount 'until final completion and acceptance of all work covered by the contract.' The percentage might be reduced in stated contingencies. A bond was to be given for the protection of the government and of persons supplying labor and materials. If, thereafter, a surety upon the \n\n[296 U.S. 133, 135]\n\u00a0\n bond became unacceptable, the contractor was to furnish such additional security as might be required to protect the interests concerned.\n The total contract price was $13,133.36. The bond which was executed by the contractor and by the petitioner as surety was in the penal sum of $ 3,940. The condition was that the principal, i.e., the contractor, should perform the contract in all its terms, and in addition should 'promptly make payment to all persons supplying the principal with labor and materials in the prosecution of the work.' The additional obligation thus incurred is one exacted by statute. Act of August 13, 1894, c. 280, 28 Stat. 278, Act of February 24, 1905, c. 778, 33 Stat. 811, Act of March 3, 1911, c. 231,  291, 36 Stat. 1167, 40 U.S.C.  270 (40 USCA  270). Laborers and materialmen, together with the government, are obligees or beneficiaries of a bond so given (Equitable Surety Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 448\n, 34 S.Ct. 803; Illinois Surety Co. v. John Davis Co., \n244 \nU.S. 376\n, 37 S.Ct. 614; Brogan v. National Surety Co., \n246 \nU.S. 257\n, 38 S.Ct. 250, L.R.A. 1918D, 776), though the claims, if any, of the government are to have priority of payment. 40 U.S.C.  270 (40 USCA  270).\n The contractor finished the work required by the contract, but did not make payment to all persons supplying him with labor and materials. Demand was made upon the surety, which paid into court $3,940, the full amount of the penalty, for distribution among the respondents in proportion to their interests. The payment did not satisfy what was owing to them for labor and materials furnished for the well. Thereupon conflicting claims arose to the 10 per cent. retained by the government in accordance with the contract. On the one hand, the surety laid claim to this reserved percentage ($2,724.23) by right of subrogation, and also and with greater emphasis by force of a covenant of indemnity received from the principal at the beginning of the work. On the other hand, the reserved percentage was claimed by the re- \n\n[296 U.S. 133, 136]\n\u00a0\n spondents on the ground that the effect of the statute, the contract, and the bond, when read together, was to make the equity of the surety subordinate to theirs. Out of this equity there grew, as they contended, a right or an interest which, even if not a lien in the strict and proper sense, brought kindred consequences along with it. At least a court of equity would not come to the aid of one whose equity was subordinate until claims superior in equity had been satisfied in full.\n By this time Gray was a bankrupt, and a trustee in bankruptcy was in charge of his affairs. The government turned over the fund to the trustee, who held it to abide the order of the court. No claim to any part of it was put forward by the general creditors or by the trustee in their behalf. The controversy was solely between the materialmen on the one side and the surety on the other. Indeed, there is nothing to show that any other creditors than these existed. The District Court, confirming a report of a referee, gave priority to the materialmen and made a decree accordingly. The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, one judge dissenting. 75 F.(2d) 377. A writ of certiorari brings the case here.\n The materialmen were creditors of the contractor; their standing as such being unchallenged in the record or in argument. The contractor was under a legal duty at the time of his insolvency to pay their claims in full. This obligation would have been his apart from any bond; the debtor- creditor relation subsisting independently. As to materialmen in that relation, the statute and the bond did not add to the extent of the contractor's obligation, though they made it definite and certain. What their effect would be when applied to materialmen, not creditors of the contractor is a question not before us. The obligation of the surety, however, unlike that of the contractor, was created solely by the bond and is limited thereby and by the equities growing out of the suretyship relation. \n\n[296 U.S. 133, 137]\n\u00a0\n In any suit upon the bond, at least against the surety, the nominated penalty was to be the limit of recovery. Upon payment of that penalty it was to be 'relieved,' in the words of the statute, 'from further liability.' 40 U.S.C.  270 (40 USCA  270).\n Liability to pay was ended, but equities growing out of the suretyship relation survived in undiminished force. Acquittance under the bond did not leave the surety at liberty to prove against the assets of the insolvent principal on equal terms with the materialmen, still less to go ahead of them. The settled principles of the law of suretyship forbid that competition. Jankins v. National Surety Co., \n277 \nU.S. 258, 266\n, 48 S. Ct. 445. A surety who has undertaken to pay the creditors of the principal, though not beyond a stated limit, may not share in the assets of the principal by reason of such payment until the debts thus partially protected have been satisfied in full. This is the rule where the right to a dividend has its basis in the principle of equitable subrogation. 'A surety liable only for part of the debt does not become subrogated to collateral or to remedies available to the creditor unless he pays the whole debt or it is otherwise satisfied.' United States v. National Surety Co., \n254 \nU.S. 73, 76\n, 41 S.Ct. 29, 30. 1 If the holding were different, the surety would reduce the protection of the bond to the extent of its dividend in the assets of the debtor. Jenkins v. National Surety Co., supra. The rule is the same, and for like reasons, where the basis of the claim is the debtor's promise to indemnify, if the debtor is insolvent when the promise is enforced. Jenkins v. National Surety Co., supra, \n277 U.S. 258\n, at pages 266, 267, 48 S.Ct. 445, 447. Cf. Springfield National Bank v. American Surety Co. of New York (C.C.A.) 7 F.(2d) 44. 'Wherever equitable principles are called in play, as they pre-e minently are in determining the \n\n[296 U.S. 133, 138]\n\u00a0\n rights and liabilities of sureties and in the distribution of insolvents' estates, they likewise forbid the surety to secure by independent contract with the debtor indemnity at the expense of the creditor whose claim he has undertaken to secure.' Jenkins v. National Surety Co., supra, \n277 U.S. 258\n, at page 267, 48 S.Ct. 445, 447. This is surely so unless the contract of indemnity has the effect of a specific lien. In the absence of such a lien the reserved percentages in controversy became assets available to creditors, the respondents along with others, upon the completion of the work to the satisfaction of the government. Insolvency supervening, the surety must be postponed in the distribution of the assets to the remedies of any claimants who are members of the class of creditors covered by the bond.\n The petitioner draws a distinction between a general promise to indemnify, which would be implied if not expressed, and a promise whereby a specific fund, whether in being or to arise thereafter, is set apart or earmarked as collateral security. We are told in effect that the displacement of a lien is an exercise of power more drastic and far- reaching than the marshaling of assets where there has been no agreement for a lien. The distinction might be important if the contest were between the surety and creditors not covered by the bond or between the surety and later assignees of the security so promised. Prairie State Bank v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 227\n, 17 S.Ct. 142; Henningsen v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n208 \nU.S. 404\n, 28 S.Ct. 389. Such is not the situation here, even though we assume in aid of the petitioner that the promise to indemnify, obscure in its terms, is to be read as amounting to a specific appropriation of the percentages reserved or of any other assets. The contest in this cause is between the surety on the one hand and on the other hand creditors of the class it has undertaken to protect. At such times the position \n\n[296 U.S. 133, 139]\n\u00a0\n of the surety is not bettered though the promise is directed to particular collateral, at all events where the bond is one required by the law. What considerations may govern after payment of the penalty in full where the bond is altogether a voluntary security we do not need to inquire. Cases such as Keller v. Ashford, \n133 \nU.S. 610, 622\n, 10 S.Ct. 494; Hampton v. Phipps, \n108 \nU.S. 260, 263\n, 2 S.Ct. 622; and Moses v. Murgatroyd, 1 Johns. Ch. (N.Y.) 119, 129, 7 Am.Dec. 478, though they suggest an analogy, do not control, even in principle, for there the surety was in default upon his obligation to the creditor. Slight differences in the facts may cause the equities to vary, and thus vary the result. What concerns us here is the remedy available where the bond has been given under the mandate of a statute. Equity then forbids that the statutory security be whittled down indirectly by any promise of indemnity, general or specific. Debtor and surety may not effectually agree that materialmen and laborers shall have less of the general assets as the price of their right to recover on the bond. Through the bond and the statute a new relation has been established with a new set of equities, not subject to destruction at the pleasure of the principal. The integrity of that relation is in the keeping of the law.\n We have no occasion to consider to what extent the creditors of the bankrupt not covered by the bond are affected by the equities of creditors so covered or by those of the petitioner with the result that their claims are to be held subordinate thereto. Cf. Prairie State Bank v. United States, supra; Henningsen v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., supra. As we have already pointed out, the record does not show that there are any general creditors, and, if any such exist, they are not complaining of the decree. Our decision must be kept within the bounds of the controversy before us. \n\n[296 U.S. 133, 140]\n\u00a0\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS (dissenting).\n The opinion of Judge Sibley in the court below, 75 F.(2d) 377, 380, seems to me conclusive upon the propositions that neither the common law, the contract with the government, nor the bond furnished by the contractor, give materialmen or laborers any right of lien upon the fund or preference in distribution thereof. I also agree with his view that the indemnity contract between the contractor and the surety company (even if an assignment of claim for retained percentages against the United States were valid, in view of Rev. St.  3477 (31 USCA  203)) is too vague to amount to an assignment of the retained percentages; and that the surety is not entitled to subrogation either to the rights of the United States or of the materialmen and contractors. I think it clear that, in the circumstances, the amount paid by the United States into the fund in the hands of the trustee in bankruptcy is general assets of the estate, and that the surety company, as respects its claim for the amount paid under its bond, and the furnishers of material and labor, are general creditors entitled to no preference or priority over each other. I think the judgment should, therefore, be reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf. Peoples v. Peoples Bros. (D.C.) 254 F. 489; Maryland Casualty Co. v.

The suit was brought by twenty- four railroads, appellants in No. 606, for convenience called 'carriers,' against the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission. Twenty-one are line carriers; the other three perform only switching service. The Union Stock Yard & Transit Company, appellant in No. 607, and the Hygrade Food Products Corporation, the complainant before the Commission and one of the appellees here, intervened.\n By its complaint to the Commission the Hygrade Company attacked as unreasonable in violation of section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act ( title 49, U.S.C.  1, 49 USCA  1), the carriers' tariff charges applicable to switching live stock to \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 195]\n\u00a0\n its packing plant. And it assailed as inapplicable the yardage charge collected by the Yards Company on live stock delivered at the stockyards. It claims that the service covered by the charge is included in transportation, sections 1(3), 15(5) of the act, 49 USCA  1(3), 15(5) that, not being specified in carriers' tariffs, they are unlawful, section 6 of the act, 49 USCA  6; and that the practice of the carriers and Yards Company in making the stockyards their depot for delivery of live stock pursuant to an arrangement by which the Yards Company imposes a yardage charge is an unjust and unreasonable practice in violation of section. 1.\n Subject to regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture under the Packers and Stockyards Act 1921, 42 Stat. 159, 7 U.S.C. c. 9 (7 USCA  181 et seq.), the Yards Company operates public stockyards in Chicago. The Hygrade Company in 1929 acquired and has since operated a packing plant that many years ago was established on the Chicago Junction Railway a short distance from the unloading pens in the stockyards. Tracks of the Junction Railway extend into, and are used to haul dead freight to and from, the Hygrade plant. The charge for switching live stock into the plant is $12 per car. To avoid that burden, the Hygrade Company elects, as did its predecessors, to have all live stock intended for slaughter at the plant shipped to the stockyards. These yards are live stock terminals of the carriers and are served by trains operated by them over the tracks of the Junction Railway. Each carrier's tariff specifies rates covering transportation of live stock to Chicago including delivery to consignee on the carrier's own line. But, as practically all shipments to Chicago are consigned to the public stockyards, there is little, if any, need or use of individual carrier unloading facilities.\n To cover the movement over the Junction Railway to the public stockyards, western carriers add to the Chicago rate $2.70 and eastern carriers $1.35 per car. No additional charge is made for unloading. The carriers employ and pay the Yards Company for unloading the live stock \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 196]\n\u00a0\n the amount, $1 per car, specified in its tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission. That work is accomplished by means of platforms and chutes down which the animals are driven from the cars into pens. These pens are not suitable places in which long to hold live stock. At peak periods of stock train arrivals these facilities are so much in use that the Yards Company is able to permit the animals to remain in the unloading pens only a short time; often not more than a few minutes. And, unless promptly taken away by consignee, the Yards Company transfers them to holding pens.\n About 85 per cent. of all consignments to the Hygrade Company are so transferred. The others are by it taken from the unloading pens and driven through ways or alleys within the extensive yards properties over scales, where for the purpose of computing freight charges they are weighed, to and along an elevated runway over pens in the yards and the tracks of the Junction Railway, thence to and through a tunnel, under the proposed extension of Pershing road (located along what was formerly a part of the Chicago river) ending at the Hygrade Company's plant which abuts on that highway. The Yards Company, in accordance with its tariffs filed with the Secretary of Agriculture, makes and collects a specified charge per head on all live stock received in the yards; being 35, 25, 12, and 8 cents, respectively, for cattle, calves, hogs, and sheep. These charges apply to animals taken by the consignee immediately from unloading pens to its plant as well as to those transferred by the Yards Company to the holding pens later to be taken by consignee. The tariffs of the Yards Company also specify charges for other services. \n1\n As to each carload, it makes a statement showing separately the carrier's charges and its own. It \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 197]\n\u00a0\n collects the total, accounts to the carriers for those covered by their tariffs filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission and retains the balance.\n The report of the Commission (195 I.C.C. 553) states: The stockyards are live stock terminals of the carriers. Consignees are entitled to delivery at suitable pens without charge for the mere placement therein of the live stock. The unloading pens are suitable for the accomplishment of proper delivery to consignee. The method of handling is efficient and satisfactory. The fact that the carriers have at Chicago destinations other places of delivery where no charge is made is not a legally sufficient reason for an extra charge at the stockyards. As to about 15 per cent. of all shipments consigned to complainant 'it has taken delivery before the animals were placed in holding pens.' There is no occasion for putting them in holding pens if prompt delivery is desired. The fact that other freight is subject to storage or demurrage charges only after the lapse of considerable time is not a sufficient reason why similar rules should apply in respect of yardage charges on live stock. After unloading, live stock requires unusual attention and care such as is not required by other freight.\n The Commission concluded: The switching charge is not shown to be unreasonable or otherwise unlawful.\n Prompt delivery does not require pens to be so equipped as to provide rest, feed, and water for live stock. If placement into pens that are so equipped is desired, an extra charge therefor is not within the inhibition of section 15.\n There are no services performed after unloading for which defendants may assess charges in instances where delivery is taken at the unloading pens. The live stock in carloads consigned to complainant at the yards is not subject to yardage charges in instances where delivery is so taken. Complainant is entitled to reparation.\n The Commission ordered that the carriers and Yards Company cease and desist from practices which subject \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 198]\n\u00a0\n complainant to payment of yardage charges on live stock, in instances where delivery is taken at the unloading pens, and that the proceeding may be reopened to ascertain the amount of reparation.\n Appellants contend that transportation ends with unloading of live stock into suitable pens, and that, for lack of essential findings of fact, the order is void.\n Transportation of ordinary live stock in carload lots from and to points other than public stockyards has always been deemed to include furnishing of facilities at the place of shipment for loading and at destination for unloading and suitable ways for convenient ingress and egress.

Indeed, October 21, 1921, the Interstate Commerce Commission, acting under authority of section 15(1) of the act, 49 USCA  15(1), and following a form of clause submitted by shippers and carriers, prescribed a uniform live stock contract containing section 4(a): 'The shipper at his own risk and expense shall load and unload the live stock into and out of cars, except in those instances where this duty is made obligatory upon the carrier by statute or \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 199]\n\u00a0\n is assumed by a lawful tariff provision.'

And the Yards Company has always collected a charge on all animals received in its yards. It may be assumed that shippers, commission men and packers including the Hygrade Company have had knowledge of this long-existing practice\n Paragraph (5) of section 15 was passed February 28, 1920, during and presumably with knowledge of the controversy later brought here in Adams v. Mills, supra. While declaring that transportation of live stock to public stockyards shall include unloading without extra charge, it left undisturbed the Yards Company's practice of making a charge for live stock received. \n2\n The Packers and Stockyards Act approved August 15, 1921 (7 USCA  181 et seq.), subjects public stock- \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 200]\n\u00a0\n yards to regulation by the Secretary of Agriculture. Section 301(b) of the act (7 USCA  201(b), defines stockyards services to include, among other things, facilities furnished at a stockyard in connection with the receiving, holding and delivery of live stock. \n3\n Section 406 (7 USCA  226) provides that the act shall not affect the jurisdiction of the Commission or confer upon the Secretary concurrent jurisdiction over any matter within the jurisdiction of the Commission. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n There is here involved no question as to the adequacy of individual carriers' unloading or other facilities for the delivery of live stock. The Hygrade Company did not seek and the Commission did not grant relief upon the ground that the carriers failed to provide egress from the unloading pens in the public stockyards to the city streets by means of which consignee's animals might be removed to its plant. Consignee sought free delivery in cars switched into its plant, but the Commission found the switching charge not unreasonable. Consignee also sought free use of the Yards Company's properties including the overhead runway to take its animals from holding pens as well as from unloading pens to its plant. The Commission held against it as to the first and in its favor as to the other of these demands.\n Long continued practice and special conditions made unloading at these yards a transportation service to be performed by the carrier. Adams v. Mills, supra, \n286 \nU.S. 397, 410\n, 52 S.Ct. 589. So the long established and uniform practice to provide a \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 201]\n\u00a0\n route via the overhead runway to the Hygrade plant distinguishes the use of the Yards Company's properties for this service from mere egress such as is included in transportation of live stock to destinations other than public yards. Plainly there is an essential difference between the route from unloading pens to consignee's plant and a mere way out to the public highways. Transportation does not include delivery within the Hygrade plant or the furnishing of the properties, overhead runway and all, that are used for that purpose. Usage and physical conditions combined definitely to end transportation, at least in respect of these shipments, with unloading into suitable pens as is now required by section 15(5). Like the railroads, public stockyards are public utilities subject to regulation in respect of services and charges. The statutes cited clearly disclose intention that jurisdiction of the Secretary shall not overlap that of the Commission. The boundary is the place where transportation ends.\n The Commission's ruling that the imposition of the yardage charge on animals taken by consignee from holding pens does not violate the act implies that as to those animals transportation ended at the unloading pens. On the other hand, its ruling that in the instances where consignee takes delivery at unloading pens the animals are not subject to the yardage charge suggests that delivery is not completed by unloading into suitable pens. That necessarily implies something more to be done or furnished by the carrier. But the Commission, in respect of the shipments covered by its order, made no definite finding as to what constitutes complete delivery or where transportation ends. Its report does not disclose the basic facts on which it made the challenged order. This court will not search the record to ascertain whether, by use of what there may be found, general and ambiguous statements in the report intended to serve as findings may by construction be given a meaning sufficiently definite and certain to \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 202]\n\u00a0\n constitute a valid basis for the order. In the absence of a finding of essential basic facts, the order cannot be sustained. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n, 51 S.Ct. 119. Recently this court has repelled the suggestion that lack of express finding by an administrative agency may be supplied by implication. Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388, 433\n, 55 S.Ct. 241. See Beaumont, S.L . & W. Ry. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74, 86\n, 51 S.Ct. 1; Inter. Com. Comm'n v. Chicago, B. & Q. R'd Co., \n186 \nU.S. 320, 341\n, 22 S.Ct. 824\n\n\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n The Interstate Commerce Commission found that the stockyards are the live stock terminals of the carriers; that a 'yardage charge' per animal is assessed on all shipments of live stock delivered by the carriers at the stockyards; that the charge is imposed whether the live stock is taken by the consignee directly from the unloading pens or from the holding pens, to which the animals are taken if not immediately removed by the consignee upon arrival; and that appellee removes about 15 per cent. of all shipments consigned to it directly from the unloading pens. Upon the basis of these findings the Commission concluded that the yardage charge upon live stock removed from the holding pens is proper, but that the charge is improper and unlawful when made upon live stock received by the consignee and removed immediately upon arrival from the unloading pens and the yards.\n These findings are thus the complete and obvious equivalent of a finding that a charge in addition to the scheduled tariff rate is imposed on consignees, including appellee, for the bare privilege of access to the unloaded live stock for the purpose of its immediate removal from the carriers' terminal. They are ample to raise the questions of law decided below and presented here, whether \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 203]\n\u00a0\n the charge is lawful and whether the Commission has jurisdiction to forbid it. The precise point in space at which delivery is complete, or where transportation ends, is immaterial. For whether it ends when the cattle are placed in the unloading pens or only when the consignee removes the live stock from the terminal, the questions remain whether a charge levied upon the privilege of removal from the carriers' terminal is lawful and whether, in any case, the Commission has jurisdiction.\n It appears that appellee drives the live stock to its place of business, in part over a viaduct, belonging to the stockyards, and in part through a tunnel, the ownership of which does not appear. But the order of the Commission does not require the use of either the viaduct or the tunnel for that purpose, or forbid a charge for their use. It only forbids yardage charges 'where delivery was or is taken at the unloading pens.' Appellants are thus left free, after removing the condemned charge, to provide any reasonable means of free access to the stock yards terminal for the purpose of proper removal of the live stock from the unloading pens. See Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 513\n, 51 S.Ct. 505; Chicago, Indianapolis & Louisville Ry. Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 287, 292\n, 293 S., 46 S.Ct. 226.\n In thus declaring that it is a part of the duty of a common carrier of live stock by rail to provide costless facilities for its delivery and immediate removal by the consignee on arrival at its destination, the Interstate Commerce Commission did not announce any novel rule of law. A carrier can no more lawfully add such a charge to the scheduled rate for the transportation service than it could demand a toll of a passenger, who had paid his fare, for alighting at or passing through its railway station upon arrival, or for removal of his hand bag delivered to him from its baggage car. This was specifically stated by this Court in Covington Stock- Yards v. Keith, 139 \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 204]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 128, 135, 11 S.Ct. 461, in declaring unreasonable and unlawful any charge for delivery and prompt receipt of the live stock, made by a company whose stockyards had been designated by the rail carrier as its delivery station.\n Section 1 of the Act to Regulate Commerce, as originally enacted in 1887, c. 104, 24 Stat. 379, continued this duty of common carriers by rail by providing that the charges for the transportation of passengers or property 'or for the receiving, delivering, storage, or handling of such property, shall be reasonable and just.' The act, as amended, amplifies this duty by providing in section 6(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  6(1), that rate schedules shall 'state separately all terminal charges,' and by section 6(7) of the act, 49 USCA  6(7), which prohibits rail carriers from receiving any greater or different compensation for transportation of passengers or property 'or for any service in connection therewith, between the points named in such tariffs than the rates' which are specified in the filed tariff. Section 1(3) of the act, 49 USCA  1(3), gives to the Commission jurisdiction over 'terminal facilities of every kind used or necessary in the transportation of the persons or property ... including all freight depots, yards, and grounds, used or necessary in the transportation or delivery of any such property,' and further provides that the term 'transportation' as used in the act, shall include 'all instrumentalities and facilities of shipment or carriage, irrespective of ownership or of any contract, express or implied, for the use thereof, and all services in connection with the receipt, delivery ... and handling of property transported.' The Commission is thus given jurisdiction over the terminal services of each carrier incidental to the transportation and delivery of freight which could in anywise affect the charges or rates for the transportation service which they undertake to render. Even storage of goods at destination is a part of the transportation service, in the sense of the federal act, \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 205]\n\u00a0\n and subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission. Southern Railway v. Prescott, \n240 \nU.S. 632, 637\n, 36 S.Ct. 469; Cleveland, C., C . & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Dettlebach, \n239 \nU.S. 588\n, 36 S.Ct. 177.\n When Congress enacted the Packers and Stock Yards Act of 1921, c. 64, 42 Stat. 159 (7 USCA  181 et seq.), it gave to the Secretary of Agriculture regulatory jurisdiction over public stockyards, including specified stockyard services, but it was provided by section 406 of the act (7 USCA  226), that 'nothing in this Act (chapter) shall affect the power or jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, nor confer upon the Secretary concurrent power or jurisdiction over any matter within the power or jurisdiction of such Commission.'\n This duty of the carrier, and the jurisdiction of the Commission to compel the performance of it, were recently recognized and reaffirmed by this Court in Adams v. Mills, \n286 U.S. 397\n, 409-415, 52 S.Ct. 589, upholding a reparation award by the Commission against the carrier and the Chicago Stock Yards for an unloading charge not absorbed by the carrier or included in its schedule of tariffs. It was held that the yards used by the carrier as a place of delivery were terminals of the railroad company regardless of their ownership, see Merchants' Warehouse Company v. United States, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 513\n, 51 S.Ct. 505, that unloading the live stock was a transportation service for which no charge could be made which was not designated in the filed tariffs, and that the Commission had jurisdiction to forbid the unlawful practice and to order reparations for the overcharge. See, also, Cleveland, C., C. & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Dettlebach, supra; Southern Railway Co. v. Prescott, supra.\n To avoid these plain provisions of the statutes of the United States, and the unambiguous definition by this Court of the duty of a rail carrier of live stock, appellants rely on an ingenious interpretation of section 15(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  15(5). This section, so far as now material, provides that transportation by railroad of ordinary \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 206]\n\u00a0\n live stock in carloads, received at public stockyards, shall include 'all necessary service of unloading and ... delivery at public stock yards of inbound shipments into suitable pens ... without extra charge therefor to the shipper, consignee or owner. ...' It is said that this legislation, by requiring the carrier to deliver the live stock into suitable pens and by prohibiting any extra charge for all necessary service of unloading the live stock, has left the carriers and the stockyards company, acting together or independently, free to charge the consignee or owner a toll for the privilege of removing his live stock from the stockyard terminal of the carriers.\n In view of the consistent policy of the law, and the persistent but unsuccessful efforts of carriers and stockyards to impose forbidden charges for carrier service attending the unloading and delivery of the live stock, it would seem that the words, 'all necessary service of unloading and ... delivery' of live stock at a stockyard might fairly be taken to include all those incidental services at a terminal which the carrier is bound to render for its scheduled tariff, and that 'suitable pens' to which the carrier must make the delivery must at least be taken to mean pens to which the consignees may gain unimpeded access for the purpose of removing their stock. But if such is not the meaning of its language, and the statute speaks only of delivery of the live stock into the pens capable of holding them, it is difficult to see upon what principle of statutory construction it can be said that the section, by forbidding one unlawful practice, sanctions another which it does not mention. Its purpose was remedial, to remove an old evil, and not to sanction a crop of new ones by giving stockyards and rail carriers of live stock carte blanche to impose vexatious charges which for more than thirty years had been condemned by this court as unlawful. \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 207]\n\u00a0\n The section was added by way of amendment to the bill which became the Transportation Act of 1920, c. 91, 41 Stat. 456, in consequence of representations made to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House in behalf of the American National Live Stock Association and the National Live Stock Shippers League. See 59 Cong.Rec. 674. Their representative made bitter complaint of the practices of carriers and stockyards, in adding terminal charges to the scheduled carrier rates, so that shippers could not know in advance the cost of the complete transportation service involved in taking live stock from the point of shipment into the hands of the consignee ready to receive it at point of delivery. The resolution of the associations asked the enactment, as a part of the Interstate Commerce Act of the rule of the Covington Stock- Yards Case, and specifically 'that there be one through rate on live stock for the whole services from point of origin to the destination at public stockyards ... which shall include unloading into suitable pens and delivery therein at such stockyards ... including such facilities as are necessary or in use for making such delivery.' See Hearings before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce on H.R. 4378, House of Representatives, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., pp. 139, 141, 874, 875, 881.\n In introducing the amendment in the Senate, Senator Cummins, chairman of the Interstate Commerce Committee, referred to the request of the Live Stock Association in emphasizing the purpose of the amendment, which he stated was to require the series of services rendered in connection with the transportation to be performed for a single scheduled rate. 59 Cong. Rec. 674. On the coming in of the conference report on the bill recommending it in its final form, the house managers made a statement that the purpose of the amendment was to provide that \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 208]\n\u00a0\n the 'through rates on live stock should include unloading and other incidental charges.' 59 Cong.Rec. 3264. The legislative history from beginning to end indicates unmistakably the single purpose to give the Commission authority to remove the very abuses described and forbidden by the Court in the Covington Stock-Yards Case. It would be an incongruous result of this legislation if, by forbidding an unlawful charge for putting the live stock into the unloading pens, it had made lawful the same charge for taking it out, and had thus condemned the aggrieved shippers and consignees to the limbo from which they were earnestly striving to escape. An interpretation of a statute leading to an absurd result is to be avoided where reasonably possible, as it plainly is here. See United States v. Katz, \n271 \nU.S. 354, 357\n, 46 S.Ct. 513; Hawaii v. Mankichi, \n190 \nU.S. 197, 212\n, 23 S.Ct. 787.\n It is true that yardage charges have been imposed by the appellant stockyard for many years. But, as already indicated, the Commission found that the charge is lawful when the live stock is removed from the unloading to the holding pens, as is done with most shipments. It does not appear how long and how extensively the charge has been applied to live stock immediately removed from the unloading pens by the consignees. In any case, long continuance of an unlawful practice can neither excuse nor sanction it. See Merchants' Warehouse Co. v. United States, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 501, 511\n, 51 S.Ct. 505; Louisville & Nashville Ry. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 740, 750\n, 759 S., 51 S.Ct. 297; American Express Co. v. United States, \n212 \nU.S. 522\n, 29 S.Ct. 315; Los Angeles Switching Case (Interstate Commerce Com. v. A., T. & S.F. R. Co.), \n234 \nU.S. 294, 312\n, 313 S., 34 S.Ct. 814. I think that the Commission was right, in forbidding the yardage charge as applied to live stock taken by the consignee from the unloading pens, and that its order should be left undisturbed.\n In the present state of the case it is unnecessary to consider whether the reparations part of the order was rightly \n\n[295 U.S. 193, 209]\n\u00a0\n directed to both the stockyards and the carriers, or should have been directed to the carriers alone.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] They include: Feed and feeding, bedding, dipping, and spraying, immunizing, and incidental care of swine, cattle testing, cleaning and disinfecting of pens, etc., branding, and other special services. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 15(5) of the Interstate Commerce Act, added by section 418 of the Transportation Act, 1920, 41 Stat. 486, provides:\n'Transportation wholly by railroad of ordinary livestock in carload lots destined to or received at public stockyards shall include all necessary service of unloading and reloading en route, delivery at public stockyards of inbound shipments into suitable pens, and receipt and loading at such yards of outbound shipments, without extra charge therefor to the shipper, consignee or owner, except in cases where the unloading or reloading en route is at the request of the shipper, consignee or owner, or to try an intermediate market, or to comply with quarantine regulations. The commission may prescribe or approve just and reasonable rules governing each of such excepted services. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the duties and liabilities of the carriers now existing (on February 28, 1920), by virtue of law respecting the transportation of other than ordinary live stock, or the duty of performing service as to shipments other than those to or from public stockyards.' 49 U.S.C.  15(5), 49 USCA  15(5). \n\n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] 'The term 'stockyard services' means services or facilities furnished at a stockyard in connection with the receiving, buying or selling on a commission basis or otherwise, marketing, feeding, watering, holding, delivery, shipment, weighing, or handling in commerce, of livestock.' 7 U.S.C.  201(b), 7 USCA  201(b). \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 'Nothing in this Act (chapter) shall affect the power or jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, nor confer upon the Secretary concurrent power or jurisdiction over any matter within the power or jurisdiction of such Commission.' 7 U.S.C.  226, 7 USCA  226. \n\n\n\n\n","11":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nATLANTA, B. & C.

Reorganization and Control of Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic Ry. Co., 117 I.C.C. 181; Id., 117 I.C.C. 439. That order authorized the new company to issue for the properties $5,180,300 in preferred stock and 150,000 shares of no-par common stock; and authorized the Atlantic Coast Line, in consideration of the transfer to if of all the common stock, to guarantee 5 per cent. dividends on the preferred and to agree to extinguish all prior liens on the property, which aggregated $4,248,413.76. See United States v. Atlanta, Birmingham & Coast R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 522\n, 51 S.Ct. 237. \n\n[296 U.S. 33, 35]\n\u00a0\n The accounting rules promulgated by the Commission July 1, 1914, pursuant to section 20 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  20), provide generally that the investment account shall show the 'actual money costs' to the 'accounting carrier'; and specifically as to Account 41, 'Cost of Road Purchased': 'This account shall include the cash cost of any road or portion thereof purchased. ... Where the consideration given for the property purchased is other than cash, such consideration shall be valued on a current cash basis.'\n In opening its books of account as of January 1, 1927, the company contended that the value of 'Road and Equipment' must be ascertained in the usual manner; and that the value should be entered at $24,010,135.47, which amount was (with net additions made thereafter) the final single sum value of the properties as of June 30, 1914, found by the Commission in its report made in the Valuation Proceeding (Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic R. Co., 75 I.C.C. 645) in 1923; and it presented to the Commission the following balance sheet:\nAssets: Account 701-Road and equipment $24,010,135.47 Other assets 2,698,817.73 ___ Total $26,708,953.20 Liabilities: Account 751-Capital stock account: Preferred stock $5,180,300.00 Common stock 21,528,653.20 ___ Total $26,708,953.20\n The Commission refused to approve the balance sheet proposed. Reorganization and Control of Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic Ry. Co., 158 I.C.C. 6. It insisted that the item 'Road and equipment' be reduced to $6, 729,896.03 and that the item 'Common stock' be reduced to $4,248,413.76; and it held that these reductions were \n\n[296 U.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n required by the following condition incorporated in the order of December 21, 1926, which authorized the issue of the stock. 'Provided, however, and authority to issue said stock is granted upon the express condition, that, for the purposes of the accounting as provided in the classification of investment in road and equipment in the text of account 41, 'Cost of road purchased,' the cash value of the preferred stock issued must, in stating the transactions in the accounts, be reckoned on a basis not in excess of its par value; and that the cash value of the common stock must be reckoned on a basis not in excess of the amount received therefor.'\n The company then brought the suit described in United States v. Atlanta, Birmingham & Coast R. Co., \n282 \nU.S. 522\n, 51 S.Ct. 237. The District Court sustained in that case the plaintiff's claim; but we held that its decree must be reversed and the bill dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, since no order requiring the accounting had been entered by the Commission. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Thereafter, on March 26, 1932, the Commission instituted, of its own motion, an enquiry into the methods to be employed by the company in accounting for its liability for capital stock and for its investment in road and equipment. The company renewed the contentions theretofore made by it. Much evidence bearing upon the value of the properties was introduced both by it and by the Commission. On June 9, 1934, the Commission entered the order here under review, accompanied by an elaborate report. It adhered to the view that the condition contained in the order of December 21, 1926, required that the common stock liability be limited to $4,248,413.76; and the value of 'Road and equipment' \n\n[296 U.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n be set at $6,729,896.03. But it nevertheless made a valuation of the properties based on the evidence introduced; and it added an independent ground for its decision: that, upon valuing the properties, it found that the market or fair cash value of the properties in question did not exceed the sum of $9,428,713.76, as of January 1, 1927; that sum being equal to the par value of the preferred ($5,180,300) and $4,248,413.76. The order entered required the company to state its accounts in accordance with the above findings.\n The plaintiff then brought this suit, claiming that the valuation thus made by the Commission is arbitrary, unreasonable, unsupported by the evidence, and contrary to the evidence; and that it is void, among other reasons, (a) because the Commission's valuation ignores the elements of value of the property for rate-making purposes; (b) that it ignores the reproduction value of the properties; and (c) that it violates paragraph ( i) of section 19a of the Act to Regulate Commerce as amended (49 USCA  19a, par. (i), which declares that 'all final valuations by the commission ... shall be prima facie evidence of the value of the property in all proceedings under the Act (this chapter).'\n The pleadings, with exhibits annexed, occupy 155 pages of the printed record in this Court; the narrative statement of the evidence 154 pages; and there are 15 other exhibits, most of them extensive. Besides, there is a stipulation of counsel by which reference may be made to much other evidence, including that in various proceedings before the Commission and in the federal courts concerning the properties now vested in the company and its relations to the Atlantic Coast Line. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[296 U.S. 33, 38]\n\u00a0\n The District Court, in dismissing the bill, declared that it was unnecessary to pass upon the soundness of the ground originally taken by the Commission, since, on the evidence in the proceeding under review, it had made a valuation of the properties as of January 1, 1927; had made that valuation an independent ground of its decision and order; and had appraised the properties 'at such a value as that subtraction of the par of the preferred stock gives the same figures for the common stock as were reached originally by the Commission.' The court added: 'We do not discover any breach of law in arriving at the value. As a finding of fact it is binding in this court. In either view of the transaction of reorganization, the figure set up by the Commission in the attacked order is unassailable.' We agree with the District Court.\n This Court is without power to weigh the evidence. Virginian Ry. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 665\n, 47 S.Ct. 222. The report of the Commission (Accounting for Capital Items, 201 I.C.C. 645-671) makes it clear that there was ample evidence to support its finding and order. It appeared, among other things, that the railroad had been an enterprise peculiarly disastrous to investors; that for the period from 1916 to 1926 the operating expenses had largely exceeded the operating revenues; that the net railway operating income for the year 1926 was the highest since 1917; and that these earnings, if capitalized at 5 per cent., would indicate a value of only $2,908,300. The Commission concluded that 'an immediate measure of value of the non-par stock would be the amount contemporaneously paid and agreed to be paid for it by the Coast Line Company.' Id., 201 I.C.C. 645, 665. In reaching its conclusion, it considered the report \n\n[296 U.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n filed in 1923 in the Valuation Proceeding, and also the evidence as to the cost of reproduction, and said: 'Clearly, the only pertinent value is that for purposes of sale or exchange. Cost of reproduction is to be given little, if any, weight in determining such value in the absence of evidence that a reasonably prudent man would purchase or undertake the construction of the properties at such a figure.'\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In that case, the applicable statutes, and the Commisson's rules governing the accounting involved, are set forth in detail. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Among these were Atlanta, Birmingham & Atlantic R.

Later the decree was reversed by this court without considering the evidence on the ground that the findings of the Commission were incomplete and inadequate. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119. Still later the Commission upon new evidence and new findings made the same order it had made before; this court confirming its action after appropriate proceedings. Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 603. The question now is whether restitution is owing from the carrier for the whole or any part of the rates collected from its customers while the first order was in force. The narrative must be expanded to bring us to an answer.\n For many years, beginning with 1903, the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company or its predecessor maintained a schedule of charges known as the Cummer scale for the transportation of logs in train and carload shipments within the state of Florida. In its inception this scale was established by agreement between the railroad company and one or more companies engaged in the sale of lumber. Later, in January, 1927, an order was made by the Railroad Commission of Florida whereby voluntary rates then in force, if not higher than the maximum rates approved by the Commission, were to be continued in effect as if officially prescribed. For the purpose of the present controversy, we assume that, by force of this order, the Cummer scale, even though less than compensatory, and even \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 306]\n\u00a0\n though voidable through appropriate action, must be deemed to have been fixed by law for intrastate transactions.\n In May, 1926, the Public Service Commission of Georgia filed a complaint against the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company with the Interstate Commerce Commission; the complaint being directed to the maintenance of the Cummer scale. In that proceeding the Railroad Commission of Florida intervened, and also important shippers affected by the challenged schedule. On August 2, 1928, the Interstate Commerce Commission made a decision (146 I.C.C. 717), amended and broadened on February 7, 1929, enjoining the maintenance of the schedule then in force on the ground (along with others) that the rates were so low as to result in unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. To avoid this discrimination, a new schedule was established. Florida and the intervening shippers brought suits in a federal District Court, made up of three judges in accordance with the statute (28 U.S.C.  47 (28 USCA  47 )), to vacate the orders of the Commission and restrain enforcement. The District Court dismissed the bills. 30 F.(2d) 116; Id. (D.C.) 31 F.(2d) 580. Upon appeal to this court the decrees were reversed on the ground that the report of the Commission did not contain the necessary findings. \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119. It was not enough to find that the intrastate rates were unreasonably low. \n282 U.S. 194\n, at page 214, 51 S.Ct. 119. It was not enough to state the conclusion that interstate commerce was unjustly affected. \n282 U.S. 194\n, at page 213, 51 S. Ct. 119. It was necessary to find the facts supporting the conclusion, as, for instance, that the revenues of interstate commerce would probably be increased if the rates for intrastate hauls were established at a higher level. 'In the absence of such findings, we are not called upon to examine the evidence in order to resolve opposing contentions as to what it shows or to spell out and state such conclusions of fact as it may permit.' \n282 U.S. 194\n, at page 215, 51 S.Ct. 119, 125. The Com- \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 307]\n\u00a0\n mission was to be free, however, to consider the facts anew and file its report in proper form. It 'is still at liberty, acting in accordance with the authority conferred by the statute, to make such determinations as the situation may require.' The mandate of reversal, giving effect to that decision, went down from this court on February 19, 1931, and on March 7, 1931 was filed in the court below.\n In the interval between February 8, 1929, the effective date of the new schedule, and March 7, 1931, the railroad company had made collections in accordance with the order of the Commission, discarding the Cummer scale. Indeed, the Florida commission, bowing to the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission, had made an order in January, 1929, amended in April of that year, whereby the Cummer scale was declared to be suspended so long as the decree of the District Court remained in effect and unreversed. After the mandate of reversal, the Interstate Commerce Commission listened to new evidence, made a new set of findings, and prescribed the same rate that it had put into effect before. 186 I.C.C. 157; 190 I.C.C. 588. The basis of the decision was the unjust discrimination suffered by interstate commerce through losses of revenue resulting from the local rates. Once more the order of the Commission ( dated July 5, 1932, but not effective till February 25, 1933) was assailed by Florida and by shippers through suits in the District Court. The bills were dismissed ((D.C.) 4 F.Supp. 477), and this court affirmed. \n292 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 603. Both the findings of the Commission and the evidence back of the findings were now held to be sufficient.\n In the meantime, other proceedings had been taken in the District Court with a view to giving effect more completely to the mandate of reversal. In February and March, 1931, shippers of lumber, interveners in the earlier suits, petitioned for a decree of restitution to the extent of the difference between the rates that had been \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 308]\n\u00a0\n paid from February 8, 1929, to March 7, 1931, under the order of the Commission, and the lower rates that would have been paid if there had been adherence to the Cummer scale. At the same time the state of Florida and its Railroad Commission petitioned for like relief in behalf of other shippers and consignees. An answer having been filed by the railroad company, the District Court appointed a master to take evidence and report. After intermediate proceedings which it is unnecessary to summarize, the master made a final report in March, 1933, recommending a decree of restitution for part, but only part, of the overcharges claimed. He found that the Cummer scale was unjust and noncompensatory, and, if enforced against the will of the carrier, would result in confiscation. He found that for the years in controversy a substituted rate should be established, and established at such a figure as would avoid unjust discrimination against interstate commerce. He found that this end could be attained by the adoption of a schedule higher than the Cummer scale but lower than the one promulgated by the Commission as operative thereafter. He advised restitution in the sum of $99,941.77, which was 34 per cent. of the amount ($293,946.38) demanded by the claimants. The District Court confirmed the report; one judge dissenting. The prevailing opinion gives expression to the hesitation of the court in thus departing from the findings of the federal Commission. It observes, however, that there would be hardship to shippers and consignees in a sharp and sudden change of rates directed to a business in which freight charges are so large a part of the value of the product. 'If the ideal rates be those fixed by the Commission, the ideal might with reason and justice have been approached less precipitately.' The case is here on cross-appeals. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., \n249 \nU.S. 134\n, 39 S.Ct. 237; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 781\n, 49 S.Ct. 492. In No. 344, the appellant is the \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 309]\n\u00a0\n railroad company which declares itself aggrieved because restitution was not denied altogether. In No. 345, the appellants are the state of Florida and intervening shippers, who declare themselves aggrieved because restitution was not awarded on the basis of the Cummer scale.\n Decisions of this court have given recognition to the rule as one of general application that what has been lost to a litigant under the compulsion of a judgment shall be restored thereafter, in the event of a reversal, by the litigants opposed to him, the beneficiaries of the error. Arkadelphia Milling Co. v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., supra; Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, \n139 \nU.S. 216\n, 11 S.Ct. 523; Ex parte Lincoln Gas & Electric Light Co., \n257 \nU.S. 6\n, 42 S.Ct. 2; cf. Haebler v. Myers, 132 N.Y. 363, 30 N.E. 963, 15 L.R.A. 588, 28 Am. St.Rep. 589. Indeed, the concept of compulsion has been extended to cases where the error of the decree was one of inaction rather than action, as where a court has failed to set aside the order of a commission or other administrative body; the constraint of the order being imputed in such circumstances to the refusal of the court to supply a corrective remedy. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. United States, supra. But the rule, even though general in its application, is not without exceptions. A cause of action for restitution is a type of the broader cause of action for money had and received, a remedy which is equitable in origin and function. Moses v. Macferlan, 2 Burr. 1005; Bize v. Dickason, 1 Term Rep. 285; Farmer v. Arundel, 2 Wm.Bl. 824; Kingston Bank v. Eltinge, 66 N.Y. 625.* The claimant, to prevail, must show that the money was received in such circumstances that the possessor will give offense to equity and good conscience if permitted to retain it. Schank v. Schuchman, 212 N.Y. 352, 358, 359, 106 N.E. 127; Western Assurance Co. v. Towle, 65 Wis. 247, 26 \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 310]\n\u00a0\n N.W. 104, 108. The question no longer is whether the law would put him in possession of the money if the transaction were a new one. The question is whether the law will take it out of his possession after he has been able to collect it. Cf. Tiffany v. Boatman's Sav. Institution, 18 Wall. 375, 385, 390. The ruling in Western Assurance Co. v. Towle, supra, gives point to the distinction. The plaintiff had paid money to the defendant upon a policy of insurance against fire. The payment was procured by false representations and false swearing as to the extent of the loss, which, if seasonably discovered, would have worked a forfeiture of the policy. The court held that, in an action for money had and received, the plaintiff could recover 'so much only as the amount paid exceeded the actual loss sustained by the insured'; in equity and good conscience the rest might be retained.\n Suits for restitution upon the reversal of a judgment have been subjected to the empire of that principle like suits for restitution generally. 'Restitution is not of mere right. It is ex gratia, resting in the exercise of a sound discretion; and the court will not order it where the justice of the case does not call for it nor where the process is set aside for a mere slip.' Gould v. McFall, 118 Pa. 455, 456, 12 A. 336, 337, 4 Am.St.Rep. 606, citing Harger v. Washington County, 12 Pa. 251. There are other decisions to the same effect. Alden v. Lee, 1 Yeates (Pa.) 160, 207; Green v. Stone, 1 Har. & J. (Md.) 405; State v. Horton, 70 Neb. 334, 97 N.W. 434; Teasdale v. Stoller, 133 Mo. 645, 652, 34 S.W. 873, 54 Am.St. Rep. 703. 'In such cases the simple but comprehensive question is whether the circumstances are such that equitably the defendant should restore to the plaintiff what he has received.' Johnston v. Miller, 31 Gel. & Russ. 83, 87.\n We are thus brought to the inquiry whether the rates under the new schedule were collected in such circumstances as to move a court of equity, finding the proceeds \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 311]\n\u00a0\n of collection in the possession of the carrier, to help the shippers and their representatives in getting the money back.\n This court has held that the Interstate Commerce Commission has jurisdiction exclusive of that of any court to set aside intrastate rates which discriminate unduly against interstate commerce. Board of Railroad Commissioners of North Dakota v. Great Northern R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 412\n, 50 S. Ct. 391. Even so, the substituted schedule is prospective only, and power has not been granted in such circumstances to give reparation for the past. \n281 U.S. 412\n, at page 423, 50 S.Ct. 391: Robinson v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 506, 511\n, 32 S.Ct. 114. What was done in this case must be considered in the light of that established rule. An order declaring the discrimination to be excessive and unjust was made by the Commission before the carrier attempted to collect the higher charges. Thereafter the order was adjudged void by a decision of this court (Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119; cf. United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454, 464\n, 55 S.Ct. 268; United States v. Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499\n, 55 S.Ct. 462, March 4, 1935), but void solely upon the ground that the facts supporting the conclusion were not embodied in the findings. Void in such a context is the equivalent of voidable. Toy Toy v. Hopkins, \n212 \nU.S. 542, 548\n, 29 S.Ct. 416; Weeks v. Bridgman, \n159 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 16 S.Ct. 72; Ewell v. Daggs, \n108 \nU.S. 143, 148\n, 149 S., 2 S.Ct. 408. The carrier was not at liberty to take the law into its own hands and refuse submission to the order without the sanction of a court. It would have exposed itself to suits and penalties, both criminal and civil, if it had followed such a path. See, e.g., Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C.  16(8)(9)(10)(11), 49 USCA  16 (8-11). Obedience was owing while the order was in force.\n By the time that the claim for restitution had been heard by the master and passed upon by the reviewing court, the Commission had cured the defects in the form of its earlier decision. During the years affected by the \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 312]\n\u00a0\n claim there existed in very truth the unjust discrimination against interstate commerce that the earlier decision had attempted to correct. If the processes of the law had been instantaneous or adequate, the attempt at correction would not have missed the mark. It was foiled through imperfections of form, through slips of procedure (Gould v. McFall, supra; Alden v. Lee, supra), as the sequel of events has shown them to be. Un just discrimination against interstate commerce, 'forbidden' by the statute, and there 'declared to be unlawful,' (Interstate Commerce Act  13(4) 49 USCA  13(4); Board of R.R. Commissioners of North Dakota v. Great Northern R. Co., supra, \n281 U.S. 412\n, at pages 425, 430, 50 S.Ct. 391; Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1, 5\n, 54 S.Ct. 603), does not lose its unjust quality because the evil is without a remedy until the Commission shall have spoken. The word when it goes forth invested with the forms of law may fix the consequences to be attributed to the conduct of the carrier in reliance upon an earlier word, defectively pronounced, but aimed at the self-same evil, there from the beginning. The Commission was without power to give reparation for the injustice of the past, but it was not without power to inquire whether injustice had been done and to make report accordingly. Indeed, without such an inquiry and appropriate evidence and findings, its order could not stand, though directed to the years to come. Obedient to this duty, the Commission looked into the past and ascertained the facts. In particular, it looked into the very years covered by the claims for restitution and found the inequality and injustice inherent in the Cummer rates during the years they were in suspense and during those they were in force. 186 I.C.C. 157, 166, 167, 168, 187. What it had stated in its first report (146 I.C.C. 717) was thus supplemented and confirmed by what it stated in the second. The two sets of findings tell us, when read together, that restitution is without support in equity and \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 313]\n\u00a0\n conscience, whatever support may come to it from procedural entanglements.\n The carrier's position takes on an added equity when the fact is borne in mind that the charges of the Cummer schedule are less than compensatory and would result in confiscation if enforced by the power of the state after challenge by the carrier in appropriate proceedings. What those proceedings are has been a subject of dispute under the Florida decisions. For many years it was believed that a carrier objecting to a schedule as unreasonably low might put another into effect without asking the consent of any one, and justify its conduct later if a contest should develop. Pensacola & A.R. Co. v. State, 25 Fla. 310, 5 So. 833, 3 L.R.A. 661; Cullen v. Seaboard Air Line R. Co., 63 Fla. 122, 58 So. 182. The shippers and the state of Florida contend that by a very recent decision this practice has been ended. Reinschmidt v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., 160 So. 69, Supreme Court of Florida, January 23, 1935. The present rule is said to be that the carrier must resort in the first place to an administrative remedy before the Railroad Commission of the state, and look to the courts afterwards. If all this be accepted, the conclusion does not follow that the confiscatory character of a schedule is not to be considered in determining the equity of the carrier's possession when higher rates have been collected under color of legal right and consignees or shippers are trying to regain what they have paid. In saying this, we do not forget that the Cummer scale of rates was voluntary in origin. Later, by an order of the state commission, it became a scale prescribed by law. Whatever voluntary quality it then retained must be deemed to have departed when the carrier made common cause with the critics of the scale in contesting its validity.\n The claim for restitution yields to the impact of these converging equities with all their cumulative power. It \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 314]\n\u00a0\n would yield to such an impact, though the action to which it is an incident were triable in a court of law. Moses v. Macferlan, supra; Schank v. Schuchman, supra. It must yield more swiftly and surely when the litigants are in a court of equity. Tiffany v. Boatman's Institution, supra; Willard v. Tayloe, 8 Wall. 557; Miss. & Mo. R. Co. v. Cromwell, \n91 U.S. 643\n, 645; Deweese v. Reinhard, \n165 \nU.S. 386, 390\n, 17 S.Ct. 340. The right that equity declines to further may have its origin in contract. But also, and in typical instances, it has its origin in statute. Tiffany v. Boatman's Institution, supra. The tests of conscience and fair dealing will be the same in either case. This District Court whose decree we are reviewing was organized to pass upon the question whether the challenged order of the Commission should be vacated or upheld. 28 U.S.C.  47, (28 USCA  47). Whatever power it has to compel restitution by the carrier of items subsequently collected derives from that primary jurisdiction and is ancillary thereto. In the exercise of that power it is not required to lend its aid in perpetuating a forbidden practice. Florida has no equity other than the equities of the consignees and shippers. The consignees and shippers have no equity that can override a prohibition and a policy declared by act of Congress. To prevail, the claimants must make out that in the circumstances here developed a fixed and certain duty has been laid upon a court of equity to make the carrier pay the price of the blunders of the commerce board in drawing up its findings. The blunders being now corrected, the verities of the transaction are revealed as they were from the beginning. We think the better view is that in the light of its present knowledge the court will stay its hand and leave the parties where it finds them.\n To this the claimants answer that inaction in such circumstances is an assumption by the federal court of legislative powers and an unconstitutional encroachment upon the powers of a sovereign state. The argument \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 315]\n\u00a0\n misses the significance of equitable remedies. The federal court by its inaction does not trench upon any jurisdiction, legislative or judicial, inherent in the state of Florida. It does not undertake to say that the rates collected by the carrier were lawful in the sense that a suit would lie to recover them if credit had been given to the shipper and a balance were now unpaid. All that the federal court does is to announce that it will stand aloof. It inquires whether anything has happened whereby a court of equity would be moved to impose equitable conditions upon equitable relief. In the course of that inquiry, it perceives that the charges were collected under color of legal right, in circumstances relieving the carrier of any stigma of extortion. It discovers through the evidence submitted to the Commission and renewed in the present record that what was charged would have been lawful as well as fair if there had been no blunders of procedure, no administrative delays. Learning those things, it says no more than this, that, irrespective of legal rights and remedies, it will not intervene affirmatively, in the exercise of its equitable and discretionary powers, to change the status quo. This is not usurpation. It is not action of any kind. It is mere inaction and passivity in line with the historic attitude of courts of equity for centuries.\n The claimants refer to cases in which this court has denied the power of the federal judiciary to take upon itself the functions of a rate- making body, charged with legislative duties. None of the cases cited controls the case at hand. A typical illustration is Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n290 \nU.S. 264\n, 54 S.Ct. 154. Rates prescribed by a state commission for the furnishing of gas were found by a federal court to be below the line of compensation. In the face of that finding, the decree refused relief unless the complainant would consent to abide by a new schedule established by the court itself. Upon appeal to this court, the condition was annulled. \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 316]\n\u00a0\n We gave explicit recognition to the power of a court of equity to subject an equitable remedy to equitable terms. We held, however, that full protection could be accorded to seller and consumer if the regulatory Commission were permitted to discharge its proper function of prescribing a just schedule after the unlawful one had fallen. 'In the circumstances there was no occasion for the court to draw upon its extraordinary equity powers to attach any condition to its decree, and the condition which it did attach was an unwarranted intrusion on the powers of the commission.' \n290 U.S. 264\n, at page 273, 54 S.Ct. 154, 158.\n A very different situation is shown to us here. A complex of colorable right and procedural mistake has brought about a situation in which the equities of the carrier, if they are not protected by the court, will be unprotected altogether. The rates now recognized as just are not a fabrication of the judges. They have not been fixed by a court to take effect thereafter. They are the rates prescribed for the future by the appointed administrative agency, and that on two occasions, after scrutiny and study of injustice suffered in the past. The court surveys the years and discerns the same injustice, dominant at the beginning as well as at the end. Indeed, nowhere in the record is there a suggestion on the part of any one that during this long litigation there has been any change of conditions whereby a discrimination against interstate commerce illegitimate at one time would be innocent at another. What was injustice at the date of the second order of the Commission is shown beyond a doubt to have been injustice also at the first. A situation so unique is a summons to a court of equity to mould its plastic remedies in adaptation to the instant need.\n The case up to this point has been dealt with on the assumption that the award upon restitution is to be for the whole demand or nothing. There is, however, a possi- \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 317]\n\u00a0\n bility between these two extremes, a possibility exemplified in the decree of the court below. The District Court, following the recommendation of the master, refused a decree of restitution for the full amount of the difference between the collections by the carrier and the rates of the Cummer scale, but did award restitution for 34 per cent. of that difference, or $99,941.77. We think the claim for restitution should have been rejected altogether. In thus holding we do not suggest that the determination of the Interstate Commerce Commission as to the rates to be operative thereafter had the force of res judicata in respect of past transactions. Cf. Arizona Grocery Co. v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 370, 389\n, 52 S.Ct. 183; State Corporation Commission v. Wichita Gas Co., \n290 \nU.S. 561, 569\n, 54 S.Ct. 321. None the less, as the court below conceded, it was entitled to great respect, representing, as it did, the opinion of a body of experts upon matters within the range of their special knowledge and experience. Illinois Central, etc., R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S.Ct. 700; Virginian R. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 665\n, 47 S.Ct. 222. This court has already held that their findings had support in the evidence before them. Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 54 S.Ct. 603\n\n\n The present record does not satisfy us that a new scale should be set up to govern claims for restitution. The field of inquiry is one in which the search for certainty is futile. Opinions will differ as to the qualifications of experts, the completeness of their inquiry into operating costs, the accuracy of their methods of computation, the soundness of their estimates. There is a zone of reasonableness within which judgment is at large. Banton v. Belt Line R. Co., \n268 \nU.S. 413, 422\n, 423 S., 45 S.Ct. 534. Only by accident perhaps would two courts or administrative bodies draw the line within the zone at precisely the same points. In a sense, then, it is true that there is \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 318]\n\u00a0\n support in fairness and reason for each of the two conclusions, the Commission's and the master's. More than this, however, must be made out to uphold the claims in suit. The claimants do not sustain the burden that is theirs by showing that the master set up a reasonable schedule. They must show that the other schedule, the one set up by the Commission, is unreasonable. In the absence of such a showing, the carrier does not offend against equity and conscience in standing on its possession and keeping what it got.\n The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded, with instructions to dismiss the claims.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n A tariff of rates for intrastate carriage of logs, known as the 'Cummer Scale,' was in effect over lines of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in Florida. The Interstate Commerce Commission, upon complaint that these rates unduly discriminated against interstate commerce, held an investigation which eventuated in an order effective February 8, 1929, increasing the rates for the future to a parity with interstate rates. A statutory District Court in the Northern District of Georgia dismissed a bill praying that it enjoin and set aside the order. This court reversed the decree, holding the order void for want of supporting findings, and the District Court then entered an injunction. As a consequence of the error of the court, the Coast Line collected the higher rates from February 8, 1929, to March 7, 1931. The state on behalf of shippers and certain shippers in their own right prayed an award of restitution by the court whose error made possible the collection of the unauthorized charges. They were awarded sums representing the difference between what they paid and what the court found would have been a reasonable and non-confiscatory rate during the period. They were denied the full difference between the established state rate and \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 319]\n\u00a0\n the unlawful rate fixed by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n I concur in the view that the decision below cannot stand, but think the direction to the District Court should be to enter judgment in favor of the claimants and against the railroad for the difference between the rates, exacted between February 8, 1929, and March 7, 1931, and the lawful Florida rates. To award less will, in my judgment, sanction unconstitutional encroachment by the federal government upon the sovereign rights of the state of Florida.\n First. The Cummer scale was, prior to the Interstate Commerce Commission's order, the lawful tariff for intrastate transportation in Florida. It had been in effect over portions of the lines of the Atlantic Coast Line in that state since 1903. It had been in force on all trackage of that railroad in Florida since 1914. Originally established by contract between the railroad and certain shippers, it was, in 1914, filed by the carrier as a rate schedule for trainload lots only. The Florida Railroad Commission disapproved the tariff as filed, and insisted that it apply also to carload lots. The Coast Line acquiesced and amended the tariff accordingly. In 1927 that commission, after notice and hearing, the Coast Line being represented, published a rule making all existing rates, whether voluntarily established or otherwise, commission rates, and prohibiting alteration or discontinuance of them save upon application to and approval by the commission. Compare Western & Atlantic Railroad v. Georgia Public Service Com., \n267 \nU.S. 493\n, 45 S.Ct. 409.\n As the statutes of Florida stood prior to 1913, rate schedules promulgated by the commission were merely prima facie evidence of reasonableness. If the carrier exacted more than the scheduled rate and was sued for overcharge, it might overcome the prima facie case made by proof of the commission rate, by showing that the \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 320]\n\u00a0\n amount collected was in fact reasonable. \n1\n By the Act of June 7, 1913,2 the law was amended. The Supreme Court of Florida has construed the amendment to make a rate prescribed after investigation and hearing the lawful rate, 3 and the only rate the carrier may charge so long as the commission's order remains in force. We are bound by this construction of the local law.\n Second. Since the federal courts respect a state law which requires persons to exhaust administrative remedies before resorting to the courts, they cannot, any more than can the state courts, inquire into the reasonableness of a Florida commission made rate in a litigation seeking the recovery of overcharges. This is not to say that, after the \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 321]\n\u00a0\n exhaustion of the administrative remedy, one aggrieved by a rate prescribed by state authority may not sue to set aside the rate as confiscatory. This he may do either in a state or a federal tribunal. \n4\n But such a suit is to set aside and enjoin the enforcement of the rate, which has the force of a statute until so overthrown. The carrier cannot avoid the mandatory quality of the state's regulation by pleading and proving in an action to recover overcharges that the rate in force at the time of the transaction was unreasonable, and that the higher charge exacted was in fact reasonable. A federal court is without power to fix reasonable rates; its jurisdiction ends with a decision that established rates are confiscatory and an injunction against their enforcement; it may not impose a different rate, since so to do would be to usurp the functions of the rate-making body established by state law. \n5\n This the court below essayed by substituting what it found to be reasonable rates for the established state rates which it thought unreasonably low, and awarding the claimants the difference between the rates so fixed and those collected under color of the void order.\n Third. The constitutional power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce and the incidental power to prevent unjust discrimination against that commerce by intrastate rates, is not self-executing, but must be exercised by appropriate legislation. Until Congress acts the states are free to regulate intrastate commerce as they see fit, subject only to the limitations set by the Four- \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 322]\n\u00a0\n teenth Amendment. By the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.) the regulation of interstate rates was vested exclusively in the interstate Commerce Commission. \n6\n This court held the legislation enabled the Commission to remove injurious discriminations against interstate traffic arising from the relation of intrastate to interstate rates, and in so doing the Commission might require interstate carriers not to charge higher rates for transportation between specified interstate points than between specified intrastate points. \n7\n In further exercise of the power to regulate interstate commerce, Congress, by section 416 of the Transportation Act of February 28, 1920, which added paragraph (4) to section 13 of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  13(4), has declared that, whenever the Commission finds that any intrastate rate causes an undue or unreasonable advantage, preference, or prejudice as between persons or localities in intrastate commerce on the one hand and interstate or foreign commerce on the other hand, or any undue, unreasonable, or unjust discrimination against interstate or foreign commerce, it shall prescribe the rate or charge, or the maximum or minimum, or maximum and minimum, thereafter to be charged, in order to remove the preference, prejudice, or discrimination, and that its orders in that behalf shall be obeyed by the carriers, the law of any state, or the order or decision of any state authority, to the contrary notwithstanding. The section authorizes, not only the removal of discrimination as between persons and places, but also such as imposes an undue revenue burden upon interstate commerce. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Congress has provided for the setting aside of unlawful orders of the Commission by suits in equity in District \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 323]\n\u00a0\n Courts of the United States;9 but it has never conferred upon any federal court jurisdiction to deal in the first instance with the matter of discrimination. \n10\n The federal courts lack power even to maintain by injunction a status or to enjoin a rate pending proceedings before the Commission looking to the entry of an order affecting intrastate rates. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. The order of the Interstate Commerce Commission of August 2, 1928, being null and void, could not justify the carrier in thereafter collecting the increased rates therein named. When in May, 1926, the Georgia Railroad Commission complained to the Commission that certain of the Coast Line's rates on logs between points in Florida were unduly low as compared with interstate rates, the Commission was without power to enter an interlocutory order raising the intrastate rates. It was bound by the provisions of the act to institute an inquiry, and could enter an order only upon adequate evidence and findings which should be prospective in operation. August 2, 1928, it made such an order, which it declared effective February 8, 1929. The state of Florida, by its Railroad Commission, recognized that, until that order was set aside, it must be obeyed, and consequently made its own orders No. 979 and No. 990, suspending the Cummer scale so long as federal Commission's order should remain in force. Notwithstanding that order and an amendatory order were unsupported by appropriate findings, the District Court which was asked to enjoin and set them aside held them valid. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 301, 324]\n\u00a0\n We reversed the decree and condemned the final order as void. \n13\n If the District Court had acted in accordance with law, it would have set aside the order. Had it done so, the Coast Line, in the absence of any action by the Florida commission fixing other rates, would have been bound to collect only those specified in the Cummer scale. In reliance upon the erroneous decision of the District Court, however, the railroad exacted the increased rates approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission. The state of Florida and shippers protested that these were not lawful and pressed with vigor to have them set aside. Our decision reversing the District Court's decree was rendered January 5, 1931. The Coast Line, taking the position that further action by the Interstate Commerce Commission might in some way cure the defect in its order, moved us to stay our mandate of reversal to the District Court, or, in the alternative, that we include in the mandate a direction to that court to maintain the status quo until the Commission should have opportunity to reopen its proceedings and properly determine the matter. We denied the motion, for the obvious reason that neither we nor the court below could authorize the railroad to persist in charging rates which had been fixed by a void order. Upon the going down of our mandate, the District Court entered it as its decree in the cause; and the Coast Line, as it was bound to do, immediately reduced its rates to the level of the Cummer scale. On April 6, 1931 the Commission reopened the proceedings, heard much new evidence in respect of the then existing situation (not that theretofore existing in May, 1926, the date of the original complaint), and upon adequate evidence and adequate findings ruled that the rates of the Cummer scale then were, and for the future would be, unjustly discriminatory against interstate com- \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 325]\n\u00a0\n merce. It entered an order July 5, 1932, raising the intrastate rates. \n14\n Thereupon the Coast Line put into force the higher rates prescribed. A statutory District Court refused to enjoin and set aside the order,15 and we affirmed its judgment. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth. Upon the entry of the decree in obedience to our mandate, the statutory District Court had jurisdiction to entertain a prayer for restitution of the excess charges paid by shippers, parties to or represented in the cause, solely by force of its original erroneous judgment. \n17\n If the Coast Line, due to that court's error, had collected more than the legal rate, it owed an obligation to restore the excess to each of the complaining shippers. To refuse to consider their prayer would be to remit each of them to his separate action against the carrier for an overcharge; and to insist upon such a multiplicity of actions in the circumstances would be tantamount to a denial of justice. \n18\n But the fact that the court had jurisdiction to entertain the omnibus claim for restitution in no wise alters the legal nature of the claim of each plaintiff or the measure of the respondent's obligation. If each of the shippers, instead of asking restitution of the District Court, had instituted his separate action either in a Florida state court or, because of diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy, in a federal District Court, he need only have offered the Cummer scale and the order of the Railroad Commission of Florida making it the lawful established tariff. This would have made a prima facie case for the recovery of all excess charged over the \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 326]\n\u00a0\n rates fixed by that scale. The defendant railroad company could not have offered the void decree of the Interstate Commerce Commission as an excuse for the overcharge. Neither a state court nor a federal court in such an action could have entertained a plea that some two years after the entry of the void order the Interstate Commerce Commission had made another based on new evidence, and prospective only in operation. These facts would not tend to prove that the lawfully established Florida intrastate rates unduly discriminated against interstate commerce at the time of the collection of the challenged charge, or were then confiscatory.\n As has been shown, the Cummer scale embodied the lawful rates for intrastate carriage. Until the federal Commission had raised those rates for the future by an order made in accordance with law, the scale remained in force, and the carrier was bound to observe it. The order of the Commission effective February 8, 1929, did not supersede it. The District Court has no power to disregard it or to fix rates other than those contained in it. The rights of intrastate shippers are fixed by that scale, have never been abrogated, and must be recognized in every court, state or federal. For the District Court or this court to refuse the complainants the full measure of those rights would be to set at naught the laws of Florida in violation of the Federal Constitution.\n Sixth. Moreover, this is not a case in which equitable considerations have any place. It is said that the Coast Line was compelled to exact the increased rates named in the Interstate Commerce Commission's order so long as that order stood unreversed, under pain of criminal prosecution, and that it would therefore be inequitable to compel it to restore what it thus unlawfully took. This argument overlooks the countervailing rights of the shippers and the state of Florida. The shippers, despite their efforts to set the order aside, were bound under similar pains \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 327]\n\u00a0\n and penalties to pay the increased rates. Had it not been for the unlawful order, they would have continued to pay rates named in the Cummer scale until the Florida commission had itself altered them, or a court of competent jurisdiction, upon a finding that they were confiscatory, had set them aside. No such procedure was initiated by the carrier. What of the rights of the state of Florida? Its duly constituted authorities had prescribed rates which had the force of a statute until repealed or set aside. These rates had been fixed, we must presume, with no thought of discrimination against interstate commerce. The federal court for Northern Georgia had erroneously approved the unlawful suspension of the state schedule. Has the state no equity to insist on behalf of its citizens that its rates shall be observed until they have been lawfully superseded?\n It is urged that it now appears the Interstate Commerce Commission was right in holding the Florida rates unjustly discriminated against interstate commerce, and the order consequent upon this right conclusion was voided merely because of a procedural error. The answer is that the evidence in the two Commission hearings was different, and we may not assume that, if the Commission had observed its duty to make adequate findings, it could have drawn support for such findings from the record on which the first order was based; and the second and valid order made in 1932 cannot apply retroactively to affect lawful state rates in force prior to its issuance. Nor is the contention sound that this court has now held the Commission's findings were supported by evidence. This is true with respect to the second order, but this court has never so held as to the first. In fact, we refused to analyze the evidence, because that was the duty of the Commission, not of this court. \n19\n Of course, that body properly may rely on the prior experience of carriers in making its orders for \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 328]\n\u00a0\n their future conduct; but this does not justify a court in relying on the evidence taken by the Commission in an independent trial of a wholly different issue.\n We are told that restitution is an equitable doctrine, and that as the court, upon consideration of all the facts, should hold there was no inequity in the carrier's retaining what it had collected, refusal of a decree is merely to withhold action, as a court of equity is always free to do in such circumstances. But the weakness of this argument is that by refusing relief the court in effect denies legal rights. It is not suggested that a dismissal of the motion will not be res judicata in any action hereafter brought to recover for overcharges; and, if so, the decision in this case is an adjudication by a federal court that the collection of the increased rate was lawful, the invalidity of the Commission's order and the law of Florida to the contrary notwithstanding.\n The burden is said to rest upon the claimants of restitution to show that the Interstate Commerce Commission's schedule was unreasonable. This is but to confuse the two orders. The first order was as matter of law unreasonable because without proper support. The second order was reasonable because it had such support in the record and findings. It confuses the issue to relate the propriety of the second order to the Commission's earlier void action. The same confusion persists in the carrier's assertion that section 13(4) denounces unjust discrimination and the injustice exists whether the Commission has so found or not. The answer is that Congress has not vested courts with jurisdiction to determine whether state rates discriminate against interstate commerce, and the statutory District Court had no more authority to investigate that question at the behest of any party before it than would any other state or federal court in an action for an overcharge. Congress has directed that the fact of \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 329]\n\u00a0\n discrimination shall be ascertained solely by the Commission.\n Finally, it is said that the Coast Line's equity is the greater because the state rates have been found to be confiscatory. No Florida court has so found. Confiscation was not and could not be the issue before the Interstate Commerce Commission in either the original or the reopened proceeding. Two scales of rates, both in themselves within the zone of reasonableness, may upon examination disclose undue discrimination. The confiscatory character of the intrastate rate may be and often is an element to be considered upon the issue of discrimination, but obviously the order of the Commission could not be based upon that alone. If the statement means that in the restitution proceeding the statutory District Court found the state rates were so low as to be confiscatory, the answer is that in a suit to recover overcharges the court had no jurisdiction to investigate a claim of confiscation under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The case is not to be decided according to the character ascribed the first order of the Commission. Whether called void or voidable, the order gave the railroad no right to collect the sums exacted. If, as must be conceded, the carrier took, under and by force of that order, money to which it was not in law entitled, the conclusion necessarily follows that it must restore what was so taken.\n To hold that the claimants may not have restitution is to say that invalid, void, or voidable orders of the Commission have precisely the same force and effect as orders lawfully made, if from extrinsic facts and matters not cognizable by the court the conclusion may be drawn that the Commission might have made a valid order in the circumstances. So to hold is to recognize in a restitution proceeding a jurisdiction which in no other circumstances and in no other case could a federal court exercise, \n\n[295 U.S. 301, 330]\n\u00a0\n and to permit that court to ignore and nullify action in a field within the state's sovereign power.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice STONE, concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n295 \nU.S. 769\n, 55 S.Ct. 918, 79 L.Ed. --.[ Atlantic Coast Line R.

Ettelson, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Daniel M. Healy, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here on certiorari, \n294 \nU.S. 703\n, 55 S.Ct. 545, 79 L. Ed. --, to review a determination of the Appellate Court, First District, of the state of Illinois, that respondent, a national banking association, has incurred no liability in consequence of the failure to perform its contract with the petitioner, declared by the court to be invalid because in violation of R.S.  5136, as amended February 25, 1927, c. 191,  2, 44 Stat. 1224, 1226 (see 12 USCA  24).\n On November 1, 1929, petitioner purchased of respondent at par thirty- five $1,000 mortgage bonds of the First National Company Collateral Trust. Contemporaneously with the purchase, and as an inducement and part consideration for it, respondent agreed in writing at petitioner's option to repurchase the bonds at maturity, at par and accrued interest. Petitioner's declaration in several counts set up, in special assumpsit, respondent's breach of the express contract to repurchase the bonds, and, in general assumpsit, the obligation of respondent to return the sum received for the bonds. Judgment of the trial court for petitioner on the pleadings, overruling the defense that the contract was ultra vires and void, was reversed by the Appellate Court, 275 Ill.App. 530, and the Supreme Court of the state denied leave to appeal. \n\n[295 U.S. 209, 211]\n\u00a0\n Revised Statutes,  5136, authorizes national banks to carry on a banking business and defines their powers. By the amendment of February 25, 1927, a proviso was added to paragraph (7), reading:\n'Provided, That the business of buying and selling investment securities shall hereafter be limited to buying and selling without recourse marketable obligations evidencing indebtedness of any person ... or corporation, in the form of bonds, notes and\/or debentures, commonly known as investment securities. ...'\n\n It is the contention of petitioner that respondent's contract to repurchase the bonds was incidental to its authority to do a banking business and was not forbidden by the proviso, that in any case respondent is estopped to set up its invalidity, and that, even if the contract is held to be invalid, respondent is bound to make restitution of the purchase price.\n\n 1. \nPetitioner insists that the words of the statute, 'without recourse,' must be taken to have only the technical legal significance in which they are used to limit the liability of an indorser of negotiable paper, as meaning without liability as an indorser or guarantor of the obligation of a third party, and that respondent did not assume that form of liability by agreeing to repurchase the bonds. But when the words are read in their context, and in the light of the evident purpose of the proviso, it is apparent that they were intended to have a broader meaning and one more consonant with all the different forms of business to which the proviso relates.\n The evil aimed at is concededly a consequence of either an indorsement or guaranty by the bank of the paper which it sells. Both are forms of contingent liability inimical to sound banking and perilous to the interest of depositors and the public. But the liability is the same, in point of substance and of consequences, whether it ensues from technical indorsements of negotiable paper which the bank has sold or from any other form of con- \n\n[295 U.S. 209, 212]\n\u00a0\n tract by which the bank assumes the risk of loss which would otherwise fall on the buyer of securities, or undertakes to insure to the seller the benefit of an increase in value of securities which would otherwise accrue to the bank. See Logan County National Bank v. Townsend, \n139 \nU.S. 67\n, 11 S. Ct. 496.\n The proviso was the first express recognition of the authority of national banks to engage in the business of dealing in securities (see H.R. Report No. 83, p. 3; Sen. Report No. 473, p. 7, 69th Cong. 1st Sess), and subjected the business to the limitation that it must be conducted without recourse. The limitation is expressly made applicable both to buying and selling 'marketable obligations evidencing indebtedness in the form of bonds, notes or debentures.' The words, if restricted in their meaning to the indorsement or guaranty of negotiable paper, could have no application to the purchase of such obligations, and normally would have none to the sale of bonds and debentures, which are usually negotiated without indorsement. A meaning is to be preferred, if reasonably admissible, which would permit their application, as the statute prescribes, to both forms of transactions and to all the specified classes of securities. Both the form and purpose of the statute impel the conclusion that the words were used in a broad and nontechnical sense, as precluding, at least, any form of arrangement or agreement in consequence of which the bank is obligated to save the purchaser harmless from loss incurred by reason of his purchase. See Knass v. Madison & Kedzie State Bank, 354 Ill. 554, 188 N.E. 836; Hoffman v. Sears Community State Bank, 356 Ill. 598, 191 N.E. 280; Lyons v. Fitzpatrick, 52 La.Ann. 697, 699, 27 So. 110; Greene v. First National Bank, 172 Minn. 310, 215 N.W. 213, 60 A.L.R. 814.\n Respondent, by agreeing to repurchase the bonds at the same price petitioner had paid for them, plus their ac- \n\n[295 U.S. 209, 213]\n\u00a0\n crued interest, undertook to save petitioner harmless for all risk of loss on his purchase, as effectively as if it had indorsed the bonds without restriction or had guaranteed their payment at maturity. The contract was therefore one which the statute prohibits and for the breach of which the law affords no remedy.\n\n 2. \nThe petitioner, who was chargeable with knowledge of the prohibition of the statute, may not invoke an estoppel to impose a liability which the statute forbids.

Wehrmann, \n202 \nU.S. 295, 302\n, 26 S.Ct. 613\n\n\n 3. The state court rejected the contention that it was the legal duty of respondent to make restitution to petitioner of the purchase price of the bonds which it had received in consideration of its invalid contract. We do not stop to consider how far the court, as is contended, based its decision upon procedural grounds, for it considered the merits and declared that no right arose upon an implied assumpsit, although respondent had received the benefit of a contract which was ultra vires and void.\n The opinion does not disclose whether this conclusion was rested upon the court's interpretation of rules of state law governing the quasi contractual right to compel restitution of the purchase price or upon the court's construction of R.S.  5136, as amended. If our jurisdiction depended upon its decision of the federal question, the opinion fails to reveal whether it is the federal or the state question which was decided, see Lynch v. New York, \n293 \nU.S. 52\n, 55 S.Ct. 16; compare Logan County Nat. Bank v. Townsend, supra, \n139 \nU.S. 67, 72\n, 73 S., 11 S.Ct. 496. But we have jurisdiction of the cause to review the ruling of the state court that the express contract was rendered invalid by the federal statute. While we may not properly exercise our jurisdiction to review or set aside \n\n[295 U.S. 209, 214]\n\u00a0\n the state court's application of local law to the quasi contractual demand, we may, in the present ambiguous state of the record, appropriately determine whether the federal statute precludes recovery of the purchase money. We think that such is its effect.\n The invalidity of the contract was not due to the mere absence of power in the bank to enter into it, in which case restitution, not inequitable to the bank or inimical to the public interest, might be compelled. See Logan County Nat. Bank v. Townsend, supra, \n139 \nU.S. 67, 74\n, 75 S., 11 S.Ct. 496; Hitchcock v. Galveston, \n96 U.S. 341\n, 350. The contract is invalid because it is within the broad sweep of the statute which by mandatory language sets up definite limits upon the liability which may be incurred by a national bank, in the course of its business of dealing in securities, by confining the business to buying and selling 'without recourse.' The phrase is broader than a mere limitation upon the power to contract, although embracing that limitation. It is a prohibition of liability, whatever its form, by way of 'recourse' growing out of the transaction of the business. See Bank of United States v. Owens, 2 Pet. 527, 537; Brown v. Tarkington, 3 Wall. 377, 381; Thomas v. City of Richmond, 12 Wall. 349, 356; Continental Wall-Paper Co. v. Louis Voight & Sons Co., \n212 \nU.S. 227, 262\n, 29 S.Ct. 280. National banks are public institutions, and the purpose and effect of the statute is to protect their depositors and stockholders and the public from the hazards of contingent liabilities, attendant upon the assumption by the bank of the risk of loss by its customers, resulting from the permitted dealing in securities by the bank. The prohibition would be nullified and the evil sought to be avoided would persist, if, notwithstanding the illegality of the contract to repurchase, the buyer, upon tender of the bonds, could recover all that he had paid for them. Such a construction of the statute is inadmissible.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","14":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBALDWIN v. G. A. F.

Laws 1933, c. 158; Laws 1934, c. 126 (Agriculture and Markets Law N.Y., Consol. Laws, c. 69,  252-258-r)) may be applied against a dealer who has acquired title to the milk as the result of a transaction in interstate commerce is the question here to be determined.\n G. A. F. Seelig, Inc. (appellee in No. 604 and appellant in No. 605) is engaged in business as a milk dealer in the city of New York. It buys its milk, including cream, in Fair Haven, Vt., from the Seelig Creamery Corporation, which in turn buys from the producers on the neighboring farms. The milk is transported to New York by rail in 40-quart cans; the daily shipment amounting to about 200 cans of milk and 20 cans of cream. Upon arrival in New York about 90 per cent. is sold to customers in the original cans; the buyers being chiefly hotels, restaurants, and stores. About 10 per cent. is bottled in New York, and sold to customers in bottles. By concession title passes from the Seelig Creamery to G. A. F. Seelig, Inc., at Fair Haven, Vt. For convenience the one company will be referred to as the Creamery and the other as Seelig. \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 519]\n\u00a0\n The New York Milk Control Act, with the aid of regulations made thereunder, has set up a system of minimum prices to be paid by dealers to producers. The validity of that system in its application to producers doing business in New York state has supported in our decisions. Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469; Hegeman Farms Corporation v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163\n, 55 S.Ct. 7. Cf. Borden's Farm Products Co., Inc., v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 194\n, 55 S. Ct. 187. From the farms of New York the inhabitants of the so-called Metropolitan milk district, comprising the city of New York and certain neighboring communities, derive about 70 per cent. of the milk requisite for their use. To keep the system unimpaired by competition from afar, the act has a provision whereby the protective prices are extended to that part of the supply (about 30 per cent.) which comes from other states. The substance of the provision is that, so far as such a prohibition is permitted by the Constitution, there shall be no sale within the state of milk bought outside unless the price paid to the producers was one that would be lawful upon a like transaction within the state. The statute, so far as pertinent, is quoted in the margin, together with supplementary regulations by the Board of Milk Control. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 511, 520]\n\u00a0\n Seelig buys its milk from the Creamery in Vermont at prices lower than the minimum payable to producers in New York. The Commissioner of Farms and Markets refuses to license the transaction of its business unless it signs an agreement to conform to the New York statute and regulations in the sale of the imported product. \n2\n This the applicant declines to do. Because of that refusal other public officers, parties to these appeals, announce a purpose to prosecute for trading without a license and to recover heavy penalties. This suit has been brought to restrain the enforcement of the act in its application to the complainant; repugnancy being charged between its provisions when so applied and limitations imposed by the Constitution of the United States. United States Consti- \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 521]\n\u00a0\n tution, art. 1,  8, cl. 3; Fourteenth Amendment,  1. A District Court of three judges, organized in accordance with section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380)), has granted a final decree restraining the enforcement of the act in so far as sales are made by the complainant while the milk is in the cans or other original packages in which it was brought into New York, but refusing an injunction as to milk taken out of the cans for bottling, and thereafter sold in bottles. See opinion on application for interlocutory injunction, 7 F.Supp. 776; and cf. \n293 \nU.S. 522\n, 55 S.Ct. 120, 79 L.Ed. --, October 15, 1934. The case is here on cross-appeals. 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380).\n First. An injunction was properly granted restraining the enforcement of the act in its application to sales in the original packages.\n New York has no power to project its legislation into Vermont by regulating the price to be paid in that state for milk acquired there. So much is not disputed. New York is equally without power to prohibit the introduction within her territory of milk of wholesome quality acquired in Vermont, whether at high prices or at low ones. This again is not disputed. Accepting those postulates, New York asserts her power to outlaw milk so introduced by prohibiting its sale thereafter if the price that has been paid for it to the farmers of Vermont is less than would be owing in like circumstances to farmers in New York. The importer in that view may keep his milk or drink it, but sell it he may not.\n Such a power, if exerted, will set a barrier to traffic between one state and another as effective as if customs duties, equal to the price differential, had been laid upon the thing transported. Imposts or duties upon commerce with other countries are placed, by an express prohibition of the Constitution, beyond the power of a state, 'except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspec- \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 522]\n\u00a0\n tion Laws.' Constitution, art. 1,  10, cl. 2; Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123. Imposts and duties upon interstate commerce are placed beyond the power of a state, without the mention of an exception, by the provision committing commerce of that order to the power of the Congress. Constitution, art. 1,  8, cl. 3. 'It is the established doctrine of this court that a state may not, in any form or under any guise, directly burden the prosecution of interstate business.' International Textbook Co. v. Pigg, \n217 \nU.S. 91, 112\n, 30 S.Ct. 481, 487, 27 L.R.A.(N.S.) 493, 18 Ann.Cas. 1103; and see Brennan v. Titusville, \n153 \nU.S. 289\n, 14 S. Ct. 829; Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622\n, 5 S.Ct. 1091; Webber v. Virginia, \n103 U.S. 344\n, 351; Kansas City Southern R. Co. v. Kaw Valley Drainage District, \n233 \nU.S. 75, 79\n, 34 S.Ct. 564. Nice distinctions have been made at times between direct and indirect burdens. They are irrelevant when the avowed purpose of the obstruction, as well as its necessary tendency, is to suppress or mitigate the consequences of competition between the states. Such an obstruction is direct by the very terms of the hypothesis. We are remainded in the opinion below that a chief occasion of the commerce clauses was 'the mutual jealousies and aggressions of the States, taking form in customs barriers and other economic retaliation.' Farrand, Records of the Federal Convention, vol. II, p. 308; vol. III, pp. 478, 547, 548; the Federalist, No. XLII; Curtis, History of the Constitution, vol. 1, p. 502; Story on the Constitution,  259. If New York, in order to promote the economic welfare of her farmers, may guard them against competition with the cheaper prices of Vermont, the door has been opened to rivalries and reprisals that were meant to be averted by subjecting commerce between the states to the power of the nation.\n The argument is pressed upon us, however, that the end to be served by the Milk Control Act is something more than the economic welfare of the farmers or of any other \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 523]\n\u00a0\n class or classes. The end to be served is the maintenance of a regular and adequate supply of pure and wholesome milk; the supply being put in jeopardy when the farmers of the state are unable to earn a living income. Nebbia v. New York, supra. Price security, we are told, is only a special form of sanitary security; the economic motive is secondary and subordinate; the state intervenes to make its inhabitants healthy, and not to make them rich. On that assumption we are asked to say that intervention will be upheld as a valid exercise by the state of its internal police power, though there is an incidental obstruction to commerce between one state and another. This would be to eat up the rule under the guise of an exception. Economic welfare is always related to health, for there can be no health if men are starving. Let such an exception be admitted, and all that a state will have to do in times of stress and strain is to say that its farmers and merchants and workmen must be protected against competition from without, lest they go upon the poor relief lists or perish altogether. To give entrance to that excuse would be to invite a speedy end of our national solidarity. The Constitution was framed under the dominion of a political philosophy less parochial in range. It was framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division.\n We have dwelt up to this point upon the argument of the state that economic security for farmers in the milk shed may be a means of assuring to consumers a steady supply of a food of prime necessity. There is, however, another argument which seeks to establish a relation between the well-being of the producer and the quality of the product. We are told that farmers who are underpaid will be tempted to save the expense or sanitary precautions. This temptation will affect the farmers outside \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 524]\n\u00a0\n New York as well as those within it. For that reason, the exclusion of milk paid for in Vermont below the New York minimum will tend, it is said, to impose a higher standard of quality and thereby promote health. We think the argument will not avail to justify impediments to commerce between the states. There is neither evidence nor presumption that the same minimum prices established by order of the board for producers in New York are necessary also for producers in Vermont. But apart from such defects of proof, the evils springing from uncared for cattle must be remedied by measures of repression more direct and certain than the creation of a parity of prices between New York and other states. Appropriate certificates may be exacted from farmers in Vermont and elsewhere (Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346\n, 53 S.Ct. 611; Reid v. Colorado, \n187 \nU.S. 137\n, 23 S.Ct. 92); milk may be excluded if necessary safeguards have been omitted; but commerce between the states is burdened unduly when one state regulates by indirection the prices to be paid to producers in another, in the faith that augmentation of prices will lift up the level of economic welfare, and that this will stimulate the observance of sanitary requirements in the preparation of the product. The next step would be to condition importation upon proof of a satisfactory wage scale in factory or shop, or even upon proof of the profits of the business. Whatever relation there may be between earnings and sanitation is too remote and indirect to justify obstructions to the normal flow of commerce in its movement between states. Cf. Asbell v. Kansas, \n209 \nU.S. 251, 256\n, 28 S.Ct. 485, 14 Ann.Cas. 1101; Hannibal & St. J. Railroad Co. v. Husen, \n95 U.S. 465\n, 472. One state may not put pressure of that sort upon others to reform their economic standards. If farmers or manufacturers in Vermont are abandoning farms or factories, or are failing to maintain them properly, the Legislature of Vermont and not that of New York must supply the fitting remedy. \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 525]\n\u00a0\n Many cases from our reports are cited by counsel for the state. They do not touch the case at hand. The line of division between direct and indirect restraints of commerce involves in its marking a reference to considerations of degree. Even so, the borderland is wide between the restraints upheld as incidental and those attempted here. Subject to the paramount power of the Congress, a state may regulate the importation of unhealthy swine or cattle (Asbell v. Kansas, supra; Mintz v. Baldwin, supra) or decayed or noxious foods. Crossman v. Lurman, \n192 \nU.S. 189\n, 24 S. Ct. 234; Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501\n, 32 S.Ct. 715; Price v. Illinois, \n238 \nU.S. 446\n, 35 S.Ct. 892. Things such as these are not proper subjects of commerce, and there is no unreasonable interference when they are inspected and excluded. So a state may protect its inhabitants against the fraudulent substitution, by deceptive coloring or otherwise, of one article for another. Plumley v. Massachusetts, \n155 \nU.S. 461\n, 15 S.Ct. 154; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297\n, 39 S.Ct. 125; Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497\n, 45 S.Ct. 141. It may give protection to travelers against the dangers of overcrowded highways (Bradley v. Public Utilities Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 92\n, 53 S.Ct. 577, 85 A.L.R. 1131) and protection to its residents against unnecessary noises. Hennington v. Georgia, \n163 \nU.S. 299\n, 16 S.Ct. 1086. Cf., however, Missouri, Kansas & Texas R. Co. v. Texas, \n245 \nU.S. 484, 488\n, 38 S. Ct. 178, L.R.A. 1918C, 535. At times there are border cases, such as People of State of New York ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, \n211 \nU.S. 31\n, 29 S.Ct. 10, where the decision in all likelihood was influenced, even if it is not wholly explained, by a recognition of the special and restricted nature of rights of property in game. Interference was there permitted with sale and importation, but interference for a closed season and no longer, and in aid of a policy of conservation common to many states. Cf. Geer v. Connecticut, \n161 \nU.S. 519\n, 16 S.Ct. 600; Foster-Fountain Packing Co. v. Haydel, \n278 \nU.S. 1, 11\n, 49 S.Ct. 1; People ex rel. Silz v. Hesterberg, 184 N.Y. 126, 131, 76 N.E. 1032, 3 L.R.A.(N.S.) 163, 128 Am.St.Rep. 528, 6 Ann.Cas. 353. None of these statutes-inspection laws, game laws, laws intended to curb fraud or exterminate disease-approaches in drastic quality the statute here in contro- \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 526]\n\u00a0\n versy which would neutralize the economic consequences of free trade among the states.\n Second. There was error in refusing an injunction to restrain the enforcement of the act in its application to milk in bottles to be sold by the importer.\n The test of the 'original package,' which came into our law with Brown v. Maryland, 12 Wheat. 419, is not inflexible and final for the transactions of interstate commerce, whatever may be its validity for commerce with other countries. Cf. Woodruff v. Parham, supra; Anglo- Chilean Nitrate Sales Corp. v. Alabama, \n288 \nU.S. 218, 226\n, 53 S.Ct. 373. There are purposes for which merchandise, transported from another state, will be treated as a part of the general mass of property at the state of destination though still in the original containers. This is so, for illustration, where merchandise so contained is subjected to a nondiscriminatory property tax which it bears equally with other merchandise produced within the state. Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.Ct. 643; Texas Co. v. Brown, \n258 \nU.S. 466, 475\n, 42 S.Ct. 375; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 \nU.S. 500\n, 24 S.Ct. 365. There are other purposes for which the same merchandise will have the benefit of the protection appropriate to interstate commerce, though the original packages have been broken and the contents subdivided. 'A state tax upon merchandise brought in from another state or upon its sales, whether in original packages or not, after it has reached its destination and is in a state of rest, is lawful only when the tax is not discriminating in its incidence against the merchandise because of its origin in another state.' Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, supra, at page 516 of 262 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 643, 646. Cf. McDermott v. Wisconsin, \n228 \nU.S. 115, 133\n, 33 S.Ct. 431, 47 L.R.A.(N.S.) 984, Ann.Cas. 1915A, 39; Bowman v. Chicago & N.W.R. Co., \n125 \nU.S. 465, 491\n, 8 S.Ct. 689, 1062; Brimmer v. Rebman, \n138 \nU.S. 78\n, 11 S.Ct. 213; Savage v. Jones, supra, at page 525 of 225 U.S., 32 S.Ct. 715; Western Union Tel. Co. v. Foster, \n247 \nU.S. 105, 114\n, 38 S.Ct. 438;, 1 A.L.R. 1278; Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 493\n, 52 S.Ct. 424. In brief, the test of the origi- \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 527]\n\u00a0\n nal package is not an ultimate principle. It is an illustration of a principle. Pennsylvania Gas Co. v. Public Service Commission, 225 N.Y. 397, 403, 122 N.E. 260. It marks a convenient boundary, and one sufficiently precise save in exceptional conditions. What is ultimate is the principle that one state in its dealings with another may not place itself in a position of economic isolation. Formulas and catchwords are subordinate to this overmastering requirement. Neither the power to tax nor the police power may be used by the state of destination with the aim and effect of establishing an economic barrier against competition with the products of another state or the labor of its residents. Restrictions so contrived are an unreasonable clog upon the mobility of commerce. They set up what is equivalent to a rampart of customs duties designed to neutralize advantages belonging to the place of origin. They are thus hostile in conception as well as burdensome in result. The form of the packages in such circumstances is immaterial, whether they are original or broken. The importer must be free from imposts framed for the very purpose of suppressing competition from without and leading inescapably to the suppression so intended.\n The statute here in controversy will not survive that test. A dealer in milk buys it in Vermont at prices there prevailing. He brings it to New York, and is told he may not sell it if he removes it from the can and pours it into bottles. He may not do this for the reason that milk in Vermont is cheaper than milk in New York at the regimented prices, and New York is moved by the desire to protect her inhabitants from the cut prices and other consequences of Vermont competition. To overcome that competition a common incident of ownership, the privilege of sale in convenient receptacles, is denied to one who has bought in interstate commerce. He may not sell on any terms to any one, whether the orders were given in \n\n[294 U.S. 511, 528]\n\u00a0\n advance or came to him thereafter. The decisions of this court as to the significance of the original package in interstate transactions were not meant to be a cover for retortion or suppression.\n The distinction is clear between a statute so designed and statutes of the type considered in Leisy v. Hardin, \n135 \nU.S. 100\n, 10 S.Ct. 681, to take one example out of many available. By the teaching of that decision intoxicating liquors are not subject to license or prohibition by the state of destination without congressional consent. \n3\n They become subject, however, to such laws when the packages are broken. There is little, if any, analogy between restrictions of that type and those in controversy here. In licensing or prohibiting the sale of intoxicating liquors a state does not attempt to neutralize economic advantages belonging to the place of origin. What it does is no more than to apply its domestic policy, rooted in its conceptions of morality and order, to property which for such a purpose may fairly be deemed to have passed out of commerce and to be commingled in an absorbing mass. So, also, the analogy is remote between restrictions like the present ones upon the sale of imported milk and restrictions affecting sales in unsanitary sweat- shops. It is one thing for a state to exact adherence by an importer to fitting standards of sanitation before the products of the farm or factory may be sold in its markets. It is a very different thing to establish a wage scale or a sacle of prices for use in other states, and to bar the sale of the products, whether in the original packages or in others, unless the scale has been observed.\n The decree in No. 604 is affirmed, and that in No. 605 reversed, and the cause remanded for proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 258-m(4), article 21-A, New York Agriculture and Markets Law, Laws 1934, c. 126, formerly section 312(g), article 25, Laws 1933, c. 158: 'It is the intent of the legislature that the instant, whenever that may be, that the handling within the state by a milk dealer of milk produced outside of the state becomes a subject of regulation by the state, in the exercise of its police powers, the restrictions set forth in this article respecting such milk so produced shall apply and the powers conferred by this article shall attach.

But the Court of Appeals ruled that under our decision in Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Company2 the direction must be for a new trial. We granted a petition by the defendant for certiorari because of the last ruling, and at the same time denied a petition by the plaintiff challenging the ruling on the insufficiency of the evidence. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution prescribes:\n'In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury \n\n[295 U.S. 654, 657]\n\u00a0\n shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re- examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.'\n\n The right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right which existed under the English common law when the amendment was adopted. The amendment not only preserves that right but discloses a studied purpose to protect it from indirect impairment through possible enlargements of the power of reexamination existing under the common law, and to that end declares that 'no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.'\n The aim of the amendment, as this Court has held, is to preserve the substance of the common-law right of trial by jury, as distinguished from mere matters of form or procedure, and particularly to retain the common- law distinction between the province of the court and that of the jury, whereby, in the absence of express or implied consent to the contrary, issues of law are to be resolved by the court and issues of fact are to be determined by the jury under appropriate instructions by the court. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n In Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Company, a jury trial in a federal court resulted in a general verdict for the plaintiff over the defendant's request that a verdict for it be directed. Judgment was entered on the verdict for the plaintiff, and the defendant obtained a review in the Court of Appeals. That court examined the evidence, concluded that it was insufficient to support the verdict, and on that basis reversed the judgment given to the plaintiff on the verdict, and directed that judgment be entered for the defendant. A writ of certiorari then brought the case here. The question presented to us was whether, in the \n\n[295 U.S. 654, 658]\n\u00a0\n situation disclosed, the direction for a judgment for the defendant was an infraction of the Seventh Amendment. We held it was, and that the direction should be for a new trial.\n It therefore is important to have in mind the situation to which our ruling applied. In, that case the defendant's request for a directed verdict was denied without any reservation of the question of the sufficiency of the evidence or of any other matter; and the verdict for the plaintiff was taken unconditionally, and not subject to the court's opinion on the sufficiency of the evidence. A statute of the state wherein the case was tried (Act April 22, 1905, p. 286,  1 (see 12 PS Pa.  681) made provision for reserving questions of law arising on a request for a directed verdict, but no reservation was made. The same statute also provided that, where a request for a directed verdict was denied, the party making the request could have the evidence made part of the record, and that, where this was done, the trial court, as also the appellate court, should be under a duty 'to ... enter such judgment as shall be warranted by the evidence.' It was in conformity with this part of the statute that the Court of Appeals directed a judgment for the defendant.\n We recognized that the state statute was applicable to trials in the federal courts in so far as its application would not effect an infraction of the Seventh Amendment, but held that there had been an infraction in that case, in that under the pertinent rules of the common law the Court of Appeals could set aside the verdict for error of law, such as the trial court's ruling respecting the sufficiency of the evidence, and direct a new trial, but could not itself determine the issues of fact and direct a judgment for the defendant, for this would cut off the plaintiff's unwaived right to have the issues of fact determined by a jury.\n A very different situation is disclosed in the present case. The trial court expressly reserved its ruling on the \n\n[295 U.S. 654, 659]\n\u00a0\n defendant's motions to dismiss and for a directed verdict, both of which were based on the asserted insufficiency of the evidence to support a verdict for the plaintiff. Whether the evidence was sufficient or otherwise was a question of law to be resolved by the court. The verdict for the plaintiff was taken pending the court's rulings on the motions and subject to those rulings. No objection was made to the reservation or this mode of proceeding, and they must be regarded as having the tacit consent of the parties. After the verdict was given, the court considered the motions pursuant to the reservation, held the evidence sufficient, and denied the motions.\n The Court of Appeals held that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict for the plaintiff, that the defendant's motion for a directed verdict was accordingly well taken, and therefore that the judgment for the plaintiff should be reversed. Thus far we think its decision was right. The remaining question relates to the direction which properly should be included in the judgment of reversal.\n At common law there was a well-established practice of reserving questions of law arising during trials by jury and of taking verdicts subject to the ultimate ruling on the questions reserved; and under this practice the reservation carried with it authority to make such ultimate disposition of the case as might be made essential by the ruling under the reservation, such as nonsuiting the plaintiff where he had obtained a verdict, entering a verdict or judgment for one party where the jury had given a verdict to the other, or making other essential adjustments. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 654, 660]\n\u00a0\n Fragmentary references to the origin and basis of the practice indicate that it came to be supported on the theory that it gave better opportunity for considered rulings, made new trials less frequent, and commanded such general approval that parties litigant assented to its application as a matter of course. But, whatever may have been its origin or theoretical basis, it undoubtedly was well established when the Seventh Amendment was adopted, and therefore must be regarded as a part of the common-law rules to which resort must be had in testing and measuring the right of trial by jury as preserved and protected by that amendment.\n This Court has distinctly recognized that a federal court may take a verdict subject to the opinion of the court on a question of law,6 and in one case where a verdict for the \n\n[295 U.S. 654, 661]\n\u00a0\n plaintiff was thus taken has reversed the judgment given on the verdict and directed a judgment for the defendant. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Some of the states have statutes embodying the chief features of the commonlaw practice which we have described. The state of New York, in which the trial was had, has such a statute; and the trial court, in reserving its decision on the motions which presented the question of the sufficiency of the evidence, and in taking the verdict of the jury subject to its opinion on that question, conformed to that statute and the practice under it as approved by the Court of Appeals of the state. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n In view of the common-law practice and the related state statute, we reach the conclusion that the judgment of reversal for the error in denying the motions should embody a direction for a judgment of dismissal on the merits, and not for a new trial. Such a judgment of dismissal will be the equivalent of a judgment for the defendant on a verdict directed in its favor.\n The Court of Appeals regarded the decision in Slocum v. New York Life Insurance Company as requiring that the direction be for a new trial. We already have pointed out the difference between that case and this. But it is true that some parts of the opinion in that case give color to the interpretation put on it by the Court of Appeals. In this they go beyond the case then under consideration and are not controlling. Not only so, but they must be regarded as qualified by what is said in this opinion.\n It results that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be modified by substituting a direction for a judgment of dismissal on the merits in place of the direction for a new trial, and, as so modified, should be affirmed.\n Judgment modified, and affirmed as modified. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 70 F.(2d) 635. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n228 \nU.S. 364\n, 33 S.Ct. 523, Ann.

An earlier suit brought for the same purpose was dismissed on the ground that the attempted reviver against the then Alien Property Custodian and Treasurer was too late. Becker Steel Co. v. Hicks (C.C.A.) 66 F.(2d) 497. Cf. Fix v. Philadelphia Barge Co., \n290 \nU.S. 530\n, 54 S.Ct. 270.\n The complaint alleges, among other things not now material, that the petitioner, owner of the shares seized, \n\n[296 U.S. 74, 77]\n\u00a0\n was not an enemy alien; that the Alien Property Custodian, predecessor in office of the Attorney General now acting in that capacity, sold the stock for $20,000, the balance of which, after paying expenses of the sale amounting to $3,887.84, he turned over to the petitioner. Judgment is demanded for the amount paid out as expenses.\n The District Court granted a motion to dismiss the bill of complaint for want of jurisdiction. 10 F.Supp. 343. Its order was affirmed by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit on the opinion of the District Court. 75 F.(2d) 1005. This court granted certiorari, \n295 \nU.S. 724\n, 55 S. Ct. 657, because of the nature and importance of the question involved and to resolve an alleged conflict of the decision below with that of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Vowinckel v. Sutherland, 24 F.(2d) 196. \n\n[296 U.S. 74, 78]\n\u00a0\n The trial court held, as is conceded here, that the suit brought against officers of the government in their official capacities is in substance a suit against the United States authorized, if at all, by section 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act. See Banco Mexicano de Commercio e Industria v. Deutsche Bank, \n263 \nU.S. 591\n, 44 S.Ct. 209; Henkels v. Sutherland, \n271 \nU.S. 298\n, 46 S.Ct. 524, 51 A.L.R. 229. That section provides that the nonenemy claimant 'may institute a suit in equity ... in the district court ... to establish the interest, right, title ... so claimed,' and that 'if so established the court shall order the payment, conveyance, transfer, assignment, or delivery to said claimant of the money or other property so held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer of the United States.' These provisions the District Court construed as granting the privilege of suit to a nonenemy only when the money or property demanded is 'held' by the Alien Property Custodian or the Treasurer of the United States at the time of suit, and concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to entertain the suit since the money demanded had been disbursed before suit.\n The government urges that these clauses must be read with the requirement of section 9(a) that after suit instituted the money or property claimed shall be retained in the custody of the Alien Property Custodian or of the Treasurer of the United States until final judgment and also with the provision in section 7(c) that the remedy given by the act 'in the event of sale or other disposition of such property by the Alien Property Custodian, shall be limited to and enforced against the net proceeds received therefrom and held by the Alien Property Custodian or by the Treasurer.'\n The question thus presented is not one of jurisdiction of the district court in the strict sense of its power or authority as a federal court to decide whether the suit would lie. Cf. Sperry Gyroscope Co. v. Arma Engineering Co., \n271 \nU.S. 232\n, 46 S.Ct. 505; Smyth v. Asphalt Belt Ry. Co., 267 \n\n[296 U.S. 74, 79]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 326, 45 S.Ct. 242; Timken Roller Bearing Co. v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., \n274 \nU.S. 181, 185\n, 47 S.Ct. 550; Binderup v. Pathe Exchange, \n263 \nU.S. 291, 305\n, 44 S.Ct. 96. It had power to determine whether the suit was one permitted by the statute and the only question presented now is whether its decision is erroneous.\n Section 7 of the Trading with the Enemy Act conferred on the Alien Property Custodian authority summarily to seize property upon his determination that it was enemy owned, and such a seizure was lawful even though the determination were erroneous. Central Trust Co. v. Garvan, \n254 \nU.S. 554\n, 41 S.Ct. 214; Stoehr v. Wallace, \n255 \nU.S. 239\n, 41 S.Ct. 293; Commercial Trust Co. v. Miller, \n262 \nU.S. 51\n, 43 S. Ct. 486. But in thus authorizing the seizure of property as a war measure Congress did not attempt the confiscation of the property of citizens or alien friends. See Henkels v. Sutherland, supra, \n271 \nU.S. 298, 301\n, 46 S.Ct. 524, 51 A.L.R. 229. Instead by section 9(a) it gave to the nonenemy owner the right to maintain a suit for the recovery of the seized property or its proceeds, and at the same time, by the all- inclusive language of section 7(c) it denied to him any other remedy.\n The seizure and detention which the statute commands and the denial of any remedy except that afforded by section 9(a) would be of doubtful constitutionality if the remedy given were inadequate to secure to the nonenemy owner either the return of his property or compensation for it. See Henkels v. Sutherland, supra; Central Union Trust Co. v. Garvan, Supra, \n254 \nU.S. 554, 566\n, 569 S., 41 S.Ct. 214; Stoehr v. Wallace, supra, \n255 \nU.S. 239, 246\n, 41 S.Ct. 293. Plainly inadequate would be a remedy which could be availed of only while the Custodian or Treasurer continued to retain possession of the seized property or its proceeds, and which would be lost whenever he disposed of the property and proceeds, whether lawfully or not. In determining whether the remedy given is thus restricted, it must be presumed that Congress intended that it should be constitutionally sufficient. The implication that by the appropriation of private property to public \n\n[296 U.S. 74, 80]\n\u00a0\n use the United States undertakes to make just compensation for it, see United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 471\n, 23 S.Ct. 349; Jacobs v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 13\n, 54 S.Ct. 26, 96 A.L.R. 1; Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330\n, 55 S.Ct. 432, 95 A. L.R. 1335; Brooks-Scanlon Corp. v. United States, \n265 \nU.S. 106\n, 44 S.Ct. 471, must likewise enter into the construction of a statute giving to a nonenemy a remedy for the seizure of his property as a war measure. Only compelling language in the congressional enactment will be construed as withdrawing or curtailing the privilege of suit against the government granted in recognition of an obligation imposed by the Constitution. See Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571, 586\n, 587 S., 54 S.Ct. 840; Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 481, 489\n, 51 S.Ct. 229. Hence section 9(a) must be broadly construed to give effect to its remedial purpose, see Miller v. Robertson, \n266 \nU.S. 243, 248\n, 45 S.Ct. 73; Behn, Meyer & Co. v. Miller, \n266 \nU.S. 457, 471\n, 472 S., 45 S.Ct. 165.\n In the present state of the record it is unnecessary to inquire whether the effect of the act is to sanction in every case the sale of the property of a nonenemy giving him recourse only to the proceeds of sale. See Sielcken-Schwarz v. American Factors (C.C.A.) 60 F.(2d) 43, 44. That question was not raised or considered below. The issue now presented is much narrower, whether the failure of the Custodian to retain possession of the seized property or its proceeds precludes all inquiry as to the propriety of the disposition which he has made of them. Such, we think, is not the effect of the provisions in sections 7 and 9, construed in the light of constitutional obligations which we must assume Congress did not intend to ignore. Section 9(a) is specific in permitting the nonenemy claimant to institute a suit to establish the interest, right, or title claimed. 'If so established' the court in terms is directed to order the satisfaction of the claim from property 'held' by the Custodian or Treasurer. But these words do not deny the right to establish the claim or to \n\n[296 U.S. 74, 81]\n\u00a0\n enter judgment upon it when established, even though the property is no longer held by the Custodian. Directions that the money or property be retained and used for satisfying the decree in a pending suit are not the equivalent of a command that the suit be dismissed if the property is not so retained. If they were we should be forced to the conclusion, although the court below did not go so far, that the claim could be defeated by the waste or dissipation of the seized property by the Custodian at any time before judgment, after suit brought, as well as before.\n Nor does the provision in section 7 that the remedy in the event of sale is to be limited to the net proceeds of sale 'received therefrom and held' by the Custodian preclude inquiry whether amounts expended were lawfully charged against the gross proceeds. Escher v. Woods, \n281 \nU.S. 379\n, 50 S.Ct. 337. 'Net proceeds of sale' thus means no more than gross proceeds less charges which may be rightly deducted and we think that the direction that the remedy is to be limited to net proceeds 'held' by the Custodian must be taken, not in the narrow and restricted sense as indicating only the proceeds retained by him at the precise moment of entering the decree, but as signifying proceeds held by him at any time and not lawfully disbursed. Such a construction does no violence to the language of the act and conforms to and is supported by its dominant purpose, often recognized by this Court, to give to citizens and alien friends an adequate remedy for invasions of their property rights in the exercise of the war powers of the government. Any other construction by denying such a remedy would raise grave doubts of the constitutionality of the statute as applied to nonenemies.\n In Escher v. Woods, supra, the Custodian had paid the proceeds of sale of nonenemy property into the treasury \n\n[296 U.S. 74, 82]\n\u00a0\n of the United States after deducting 2 per cent. which he had paid into a fund to be used for paying the expenses of his office during the period of administration; expenses not shown to be rightly chargeable against the proceeds of sale. In allowing recovery of the amount improperly deducted the right to recover was not thought to turn on whether the expenses had or had not been in fact paid out by the Custodian. This Court placed its decision on the broad ground that under the statute the unlawfulness of the charges made by the Custodian against the proceeds of sale of nonenemy owned property is open to judicial inquiry and that the limitation of recovery to net proceeds did not permit an unauthorized outlay to be deducted from the proceeds of sale.\n We intimate no opinion as to the lawfulness of the deducted expenditures. We decide only that the right to challenge them is not lost because they have been made.\n We do not pass upon the validity of the defense of the Statute of Limitations and others, the possibility of which is suggested by the allegations of the bill of complaint. Even if raised by the government's motion to dismiss for want of 'jurisdiction of the persons of the defendants or of the subject matter of the action,' they were not considered below or urged here. Whether, in a suit brought under the Trading with the Enemy Act against the Alien Property Custodian, these defenses go to the jurisdiction, as has been held in the case of the defense of the statute of limitations in a suit against the United States under the Tucker Act (28 USCA  41 (20), see Compagnie Generale Transatlantique v. United States (C.C.A.) 51 F.(2d) 1053, 1056; cf. Finn v. United States, \n123 \nU.S. 227\n, 8 S.Ct. 82, or whether they go only to the merits, are questions which have never been decided. They have not been argued here. We think we should not undertake to decide them in the present posture of the case. Scott v. Armstrong, \n146 \nU.S. 499, 512\n, 513 S., 13 S.Ct. 148\n\n\n Reversed. \n\n[296 U.S. 74, 83]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS.\n Although I do not disagree with opinion of the Court respecting the meaning of the word 'held' as found in section 9(a) of the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 USCA Appendix  9(a), I think we should not decide the point in this case. The order of the District Judge dismissing the action for want of jurisdiction was right notwithstanding he may have been in error as to the necessity of actual possession of the property or its proceeds by the government's representatives at the date of suit.\n The action is clearly one against the United States1 and consent to be sued evidenced by act of Congress is essential to jurisdiction. The question is whether such consent has been given. Whatever view may be taken of the nature of the action as disclosed by petitioner's pleading the answer must be in the negative.\n The government has consented to be sued as is evidenced by section 9( a). It appears by petitioner's own declaration, however, that it availed itself of the privilege of suit thus granted and recovered a judgment for the full amount of the proceeds of the stock which had been seized by the Alien Property Custodian. The present action is a second suit to recover another judgment for a portion of the same money embraced in the former judgment. I fail to find any indication in the act that Congress intended to afford a claimant two suits and two judgments for the same moneys.\n Entirely apart from the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, however, the District Court is without jurisdiction to permit a second action for a sum admittedly embraced in a judgment which is of record in that court. \n\n[296 U.S. 74, 84]\n\u00a0\n Suit cannot be maintained under the Tucker Act as amended. \n2\n the six- year limitation on suits against the government is not merely a defense to be pleaded or waived but is jurisdictional. \n3\n The sale of the property by the Custodian and the recovery of the first judgment for the proceeds of the sale both occurred more than six years prior to the institution of this action. Moreover, the express provision of section 7 of the Trading with the Enemy Act (50 USCA Appendix  7), that the sole relief and remedy of any person having a claim under the act shall be that afforded by the act, precludes a suit for the property or the proceeds of it under the Tucker Act. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The complaint asserts that the judgment recovered for the entire proceeds of the sale of plaintiff's stock has been formally released and satisfied. The satisfaction is said to have been obtained by duress. If the present proceeding be viewed as an action on the judgment the satisfaction is a bar to its maintenance; if treated as an appeal to the equity powers of the Court to set aside the release and satisfaction the Tucker Act is not a consent to the prosecution of such an action in the District Court. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n I think it idle to remand the case to the District Court merely because of an erroneous reason assigned in support of the order of dismissal, since the suit will again have to be dismissed for the lack of jurisdiction. I should, therefore, affirm the order of the District Court.\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND concurs in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Relevant portions of the Trading with the Enemy Act are:\n's 7 ...

LOUIS UNION TRUST CO.(1935)\nNo. 262\nArgued: October 25, 1935Decided: November 11, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 48, 49]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and David E. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Crawford Johnson, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The decedent in 1921 executed separate declarations of trust in favor of each of his four children, conveying to himself as trustee certain securities. He died in 1928, at which time the entire trust estate conveyed by the four trusts amounted to nearly a million dollars, which amount was included by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue as a part of the gross estate of the decedent and an additional estate tax assessed accordingly. The executors, having paid the additional tax, brought this action in a federal District Court sitting in Missouri to recover the amount. The District Court denied recovery upon the grounds that the transfer effected by each declaration of trust was made in contemplation of death, and that it was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after decedent's death.\n The Court of Appeals, after a very full review of the facts and authorities, reversed the judgment. 76 F.(2d) 851. The case is here on certiorari.\n The declarations of trust were in identical terms. By each the grantor declared that he held in trust for the person named certain property which was described. A copy of one of them is set forth in the opinion of the court below. The trust instrument gave the trustee usual discretionary power with respect to sale of the trust property, reinvestment of proceeds, collection of rents, income, and profits, payment of taxes and expenses incident to the \n\n[296 U.S. 48, 50]\n\u00a0\n care, preservation and management of the property; and provided that he should pay to the beneficiary an allowance of $300 a month, which might be increased or decreased from time to time in his discretion. Income not distributed was to be added to the principal. The final clause of the declaration provided: '6. (a) If the said beneficiary should die before my death, then this trust estate shall thereupon revert to me and become mine immediately and absolutely, or (b) if I should die before her death, then this property shall thereupon become hers immediately and absolutely and be turned over to her and in either case this trust shall cease.'\n The government presents for our determination two questions-whether, under the provisions of section 302(c), Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA  1094(c) a transfer of the property under each of the instruments here involved (1) was intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of the grantor; (2) was made in contemplation of death.\n First. The first of these questions is settled by our decision just rendered in the case of Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., et al., \n296 \nU.S. 39\n, 56 S.Ct. 74. By the declaration of trust here under review, the legal title, possession, and control of the trust estate passed irrevocably from the grantor as an individual to himself as trustee. The effect is no different than if the trustee had been another person. Cf. Reinecke v. Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A. L.R. 397. By the final paragraph of the declaration, quoted above, the grantor does not retain any interest in the property, but, recognizing the completeness of the transfer, he provides that the property shall revert to him in case the beneficiary shall predecease him. The provision that the trust estate shall 'revert' in case of the predecease of the beneficiary removes any doubt as to the completeness of the transfer, if otherwise there would be any. The \n\n[296 U.S. 48, 51]\n\u00a0\n question, therefore, is whether the mere possibility of a reverter stamps the transfer as one intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after the death of the grantor. The decision just rendered answers this question in the negative.\n Second. The transfer to the trustee was complete and became effective when made, seven years before the death of the decedent. The factor which brings a gift inter vivos within the reach of section 302(c) with respect to transfers made in contemplation of death is to be 'found in the transferor's motive.' United States v. Wells, \n283 \nU.S. 102, 117\n, 51 S.Ct. 446, 451. 'Death must be 'contemplated.' that is, the motive which induces the transfer must be of the sort which leads to testamentary disposition. ... The question, necessarily, is as to the state of mind of the donor. ... If it is the thought of death, as a controlling motive prompting the disposition of property, that affords the test, it follows that the statute does not embrace gifts inter vivos which spring from a different motive.' \n283 U.S. 102\n, at page 118, 51 S.Ct. 446, 451. The opinion proceeds to give illustrations of those motives which have reference to life rather than to death; as, for example, the desire to be relieved of responsibility; to have children independently established with competencies of their own. In each case the circumstances are to be scrutinized in order to discover the dominant motive of the donor in the light of his bodily and mental condition. \n283 U.S. 102\n, at page 119, 51 S.Ct. 446.\n In the present case, the District Court found that the motive of decedent was to decrease his income tax by distributing a portion of his property among the four trusts and, at the same time, to make provision for the distribution of the property to his children at decedent's death, and concluded therefrom that the transfer was made in contemplation of death. The Circuit Court of Appeals reached the opposite conclusion. It found on the evidence that the decedent, in making the trusts, was \n\n[296 U.S. 48, 52]\n\u00a0\n actuated by two motives: (1) To make his children independent; (2) to avoid high surtaxes on his income; and that both of these motives were associated with life. Evidence that the decedent was in any way influenced in what he did by the thought of death, that court said, was entirely lacking.\n It is true that the decedent at the time of making the trusts was 76 years of age. But the evidence shows clearly that he was in excellent health, attending regularly to business, apparently was not looking forward in any way to his death, came of a very long-lived family, expected to live well beyond the age of 90, and in fact lived seven years after making the trusts. The beneficiaries were all past 21 years of age, and the record shows only that the grantor's objects were to make them allowances in order to get rid of the nuisance of treating them as children, make them independent so they would know what they were to get each year, and, as he had ample income of his own, to avoid the high surtax and make each of his children pay a tax on the independent income received.\n We are unable to find anything in the record which conflicts with the statement of the court below that evidence that decedent was in any way influenced by the thought of death was wholly lacking. The government argues that the finding of the trial court in respect of the matter is the same as that of the Commissioner, and that this circumstance gives additional weight to that court's finding. Our attention has not been called to anything in the record which shows that the Commissioner's determination rested upon such a finding. The petitioner alleges that the reason which brought about the Commissioner's determination was that the transfer was one which 'did not take effect in possession or enjoyment until at or after the death of the decedent,' and that he so advised the respondents by letters. The answer affirmatively alleges that the Commissioner's rea- \n\n[296 U.S. 48, 53]\n\u00a0\n sons were 'that there had been no transfer of such property during the lifetime of the decedent; that such property was transferred at and as a result of the death of the decedent; and that such transfer was intended to take effect at or after the death of the decedent,' and that the Commissioner advised respondents accordingly. We are unable to find anything in the record which justifies the conclusion that the Commissioner specifically determined that the transfers were made in contemplation of death, or, indeed, that there was any evidence before him on that subject.\n In this state of the record it cannot be said that the finding of the trial court in this regard obtains any support from the determination of the Commissioner. The situation simply is that the findings of the lower courts upon the matter are in conflict; and a careful examination of the evidence contained in the record convinces us that the finding of the trial court was erroneous, and we so hold.\n Judgment affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO dissent for reasons stated in their dissent in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 39\n, 56 S.Ct. 74. \n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBERGER v. UNITED STATES(1935)\nNo. 544\nArgued: Decided: April 15, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 78, 79]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Justin Miller, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Nathan D. Perlman, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was indicted in a federal district court charged with having conspired with seven other persons named in the indictment to utter counterfeit notes pur- \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 80]\n\u00a0\n porting to be issued by designated federal reserve banks, with knowledge that they had been counterfeited. The indictment contained eight additional counts alleging substantive offenses. Among the persons named in the indictment were Katz, Rice, and Jones. Rice and Jones were convicted by the jury upon two of the substantive counts and the conspiracy count. Petitioner was convicted upon the conspiracy count only. Katz pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count, and testified for the government upon an arrangement that a nolle prosequi as to the substantive counts would be entered. It is not necessary now to refer to the evidence further than to say that it tended to establish not a single conspiracy as charged, but two conspiracies-one between Rice and Katz and another between Berger, Jones and Katz. The only connecting link between the two was that Katz was in both conspiracies and the same counterfeit money had to do with both. There was no evidence that Berger was a party to the conspiracy between Rice and Katz. During the trial, the United States attorney who prosecuted the case for the government was guilty of misconduct, both in connection with his cross-examination of witnesses and in his argument to the jury, the particulars of which we consider at a later point in this opinion. At the conclusion of the evidence, Berger moved to dismiss the indictment as to the conspiracy count, on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to support the charge. That motion was denied. Petitioner, Rice, Katz, and Jones were sentenced to terms of imprisonment.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, affirming the judgment, 73 F.(2d) 278, held that there was a variance between the allegations of the conspiracy count and the proof, but that it was not prejudicial; and that the conduct of the prosecuting attorney, although to be condemned, was not sufficiently grave to affect the fairness of the trial. We brought the case here on certiorari because of a conflict \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 81]\n\u00a0\n with other Circuit Courts of Appeals in respect of the effect of the alleged variance. \n293 \nU.S. 552\n, 55 S.Ct. 346, 79 L.Ed. --.\n\n 1. \nIt is settled by the great weight of authority that, although an indictment charges a conspiracy involving several persons and the proof establishes the conspiracy against some of them only, the variance is not material. But several circuit courts of appeals have held that if the indictment charges a single conspiracy, and the effect of the proof is to split the conspiracy into two, the variance is fatal. Thus it is said in Telman v. United States (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 716, 718: 'Where one large conspiracy is charged, proof of different and disconnected smaller ones will not sustain a conviction.' In support of that statement the various decisions upon which petitioner here relies are cited. This view, however, ignores the question of materiality; and should be so qualified as to make the result of the variance depend upon whether it has substantially injured the defendant.\n In the present case, the objection is not that the allegations of the indictment do not describe the conspiracy of which petitioner was convicted, but, in effect, it is that the proof includes more. If the proof had been confined to that conspiracy, the variance, as we have seen, would not have been fatal. Does it become so because, in addition to proof of the conspiracy with which petitioner was connected, proof of a conspiracy with which he was not connected was also furnished and made the basis of a verdict against others?\n Section 269 of the Judicial Code, as amended (28 U.S.C.  391 (28 usca  391)) provides:\n'On the hearing of any appeal, certiorari, writ of error, or motion for a new trial, in any case, civil or criminal, the court shall give judgment after an examination of the entire record before the court, without regard to technical errors, defects, or exceptions which do not affect the substantial rights of the parties.' \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 82]\n\u00a0\n The true inquiry, therefore, is not whether there has been a variance in proof, but whether there has been such a variance as to 'affect the substantial rights' of the accused. The general rule that allegations and proof must correspond is based upon the obvious requirements (1) that the accused shall be definitely informed as to the charges against him, so that he may be enabled to present his defense and not be taken by surprise by the evidence offered at the trial; and (2) that he may be protected against another prosecution for the same offense. Bennett v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 333, 338\n, 33 S.Ct. 288; Harrison v. United States ( C.C.A.) 200 F. 662, 673; United States v. Wills (C.C.A.) 36 F.(2d) 855, 856, 857. Cf. Hagner v. United States, \n285 U.S. 427\n, 431-433, 52 S.Ct. 417.\n\n Evidently Congress intended by the amendment to section 269 to put an end to the too rigid application, sometimes made, of the rule that error being shown, prejudice must be presumed: and to establish the more reasonable rule that if, upon an examination of the entire record, substantial prejudice does not appear, the error must be regarded as harmless. See Haywood v. United States (C.C.A.) 268 F. 795, 798; Rich v. United States (C.C.A.) 271 F. 566, 569, 570.\n The count in question here charges a conspiracy to utter false notes of one federal reserve bank each calling for $20, and those of another each calling for $100. The object of the utterance thus concerted is not stated; but the proof as to the conspiracies is that the one between Katz and Rice was with the purpose of uttering the false notes to buy rings from persons advertising them for sale, and the object of the other between Katz, Jones, and Berger was to pass the notes to tradesmen. Suppose the indictment had charged these two conspiracies in separate counts in identical terms, except that, in addition, it had specifically set forth the contemplated object \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 83]\n\u00a0\n of passing the notes, naming Berger, Katz, Rice, and Jones as the conspirators in each count. Suppose further that the proof had established both counts, connecting Berger with one but failing to connect him with the other, and thereupon he had been convicted of the former and acquitted of the latter. Plainly enough, his substantial rights would not have been affected. The situation supposed and that under consideration differ greatly in form; but do they differ in real substance? The proof here in respect of the conspiracy with which Berger was not connected may, as to him, be regarded as incompetent; but we are unable to find anything in the facts-which are fairly stated by the court below-or in the record from which it reasonably can be said that the proof operated to prejudice his case, or that it came as a surprise; and certainly the fact that the proof disclosed two conspiracies instead of one, each within the words of the indictment, cannot prejudice his defense of former acquittal of the one or former conviction of the other, if he should again be prosecuted.\n In Washington & Georgetown R'd v. Hickey, \n166 \nU.S. 521, 531\n, 17 S.Ct. 661, 665, this court said that 'no variance ought ever to be regarded as material where the allegation and proof substantially correspond, or where the variance was not of a character which could have misled the defendant at the trial.' This was said in a civil case, it is true, but it applies equally to a criminal case if there be added the further requisite that the variance be not such as to deprive the accused of his right to be protected against another prosecution for the same offense. See Meyers v. United States (C.C.A.) 3 F. (2d) 379, 380; Mansolilli v. United States (C.C.A.) 2 F.(2d) 42, 43.\n We do not mean to say that a variance such as that here dealt with might not be meterial in a different case. We simply hold, following the view of the court below, \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 84]\n\u00a0\n that, applying section 269 of the Judicial Code, as amended, to the circumstances of this case the variance was not prejudicial and hence not fatal.\n\n 2. \nThat the United States prosecuting attorney overstepped the bounds of that propriety and fairness which should characterize the conduct of such an officer in the prosecution of a criminal offense is clearly shown by the record. He was guilty of misstating the facts in his cross- examination of witnesses; of putting into the mouths of such witnesses things which they had not said; of suggesting by his questions that statements had been made to him personally out of court, in respect of which no proof was offered; of pretending to understand that a witness had said something which he had not said and persistently cross-examining the witness upon that basis; of assuming prejudicial facts not in evidence; of bullying and arguing with witnesses; and, in general, of conducting himself in a thoroughly indecorous and improper manner. We reproduce in the margin* a few excerpts \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 85]\n\u00a0\n from the record illustrating some of the various points of the foregoing summary. It is impossible, however, without reading the testimony at some length, and thereby obtaining a knowledge of the setting in which the objectionable matter occurred, to appreciate fully the extent of the misconduct. The trial judge, it is true, sustained objections to some of the questions, insinuations and misstatements, and instructed the jury to disregard them. But the situation was one which called for stern rebuke and repressive measures and, perhaps, if these were not successful, for the granting of a mistrial. It is impossible to say that the evil influence upon the jury of these acts of misconduct was removed by such mild judicial action as was taken.\n The prosecuting attorney's argument to the jury was undignified and intemperate, containing improper insinuations and assertions calculated to mislead the jury. A reading of the entire argument is necessary to an appreciation of these objectionable features. The following is an illustration: A witness by the name of Goldie Goldstein \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 86]\n\u00a0\n had been called by the prosecution to identify the petitioner. She apparently had difficulty in doing so. The prosecuting attorney, in the course of his argument, said (italics added).\n'Mrs. Goldie Goldstein takes the stand. She says she knows Jones, and you can bet your bottom dollar she knew Berger. She stood right where I am now and looked at him and was afraid to go over there, and when I waved my arm everybody started to holler, 'Don't point at him.' \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 87]\n\u00a0\n You know the rules of law. Well, it is the most complicated game in the world. I was examining a woman that I knew knew Berger and could identify him, she was standing right here looking at him, and I couldn't say, 'Isn't that the man?' Now, imagine that! But that is the rules of the game, and I have to play within those rules.' \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 88]\n\u00a0\n The jury was thus invited to conclude that the witness Goldstein knew Berger well but pretended otherwise; and that this was within the personal knowledge of the prosecuting attorney.\n\n Again, at another point in his argument, after suggesting that defendants' counsel had the advantage of being able to charge the district attorney with being unfair 'of trying to twist a witness,' he said:\n'But, oh, they can twist the questions, ... they can sit up in their offices and devise ways to pass counterfeit money; 'but don't let the Government touch me, that is unfair; please leave my client alone.\"\n\n The United States Attorney is the representative not of an ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done. As such, he is in a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer. He may prosecute with earnestness and vigor-indeed, he should do so. But, while he may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.\n It is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less degree, has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations, and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none. The court below said that the case against Berger was not strong; and from a careful examination of the record we agree. Indeed, the case against Berger, who was convicted only of conspiracy and not of any substantive offense as were \n\n[295 U.S. 78, 89]\n\u00a0\n the other defendants, we think may properly be characterized as weak- depending, as it did, upon the testimony of Katz, an accomplice with a long criminal record.\n In these circumstances prejudice to the cause of the accused is so highly probable that we are not justified in assuming its nonexistence. If the case against Berger had been strong, or, as some courts have said, the evidence of his guilt 'overwhelming,' a different conclusion might be reached. Compare Fitter v. United States (C.C.A.) 258 F. 567, 573; Johnson v. United States (C.C.A.) 215 F. 679, 685, L.R.A. 1915A, 862; People v. Malkin, 250 N.Y. 185, 201, 202, 164 N.E. 900; State of Iowa v. Roscum, 119 Iowa, 330, 333, 93 N.W. 295. Moreover, we have not here a case where the misconduct of the prosecuting attorney was slight or confined to a single instance, but one where such misconduct was pronounced and persistent, with a probable cumulative effect upon the jury which cannot be disregarded as inconsequential. A new trial must be awarded. Compare N.Y. Central R.R. Co. v. Johnson, \n279 U.S. 310\n, 316-318, 49 S.Ct. 300.\n The views we have expressed find support in many decisions, among which the following are good examples: People v. Malkin, supra; People v. Esposito, 224 N.Y. 370, 375-377, 121 N.E. 344; Johnson v. United States, supra; Cook v. Commonwealth, 86 Ky. 663, 665-667, 7 S.W. 155; Gale v. People, 26 Mich. 157; People v. Wells, 100 Cal. 459, 34 P. 1078. The case last cited is especially apposite.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] The defendant (petitioner) was on the stand; cross-examination by the United States attorney:\n'Q.

Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n\n[296 U.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the construction and constitutionality, as applied, of section 402(f) of the Revenue Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1097, 1098), which provides that the value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value, at the time of his death, of all property '(f) to the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life; and to the extent of the excess over $40,000 of the amount receivable by all other beneficiaries as insurance under policies taken out by the decedent upon his own life.' \n\n[296 U.S. 211, 217]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners are the executors of the will of King Upton, who died in 1921 while the act of 1918 was in force. His wife survived him. Long prior to the passage of the act, a number of life insurance policies were issued to the decedent, among them four issued by the Berkshire Life Insurance Company of Massachusetts, originally payable to his estate; and one issued in 1883 by the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company of Connecticut, payable to the wife of the decedent with a condition that in case of the predecease of the wife the amount of the policy should be payable to his children; or, if there be no children or descendants of children then living, to the legal representatives of the insured. In 1904, decedent assigned the four Berkshire policies to his wife, 'provided she survives me.' The decedent had no power, none being reserved, to change the beneficiaries, to pledge or assign the policies after the assignment to his wife, or revoke that assignment or surrender the policies without the consent of the beneficiaries. Central Bank of Washington v. Hume, \n128 \nU.S. 195, 205\n, 9 S.Ct. 41; Miles v. Connecticut Life Ins.

National Life Insurance Co., 144 Mass. 374, 382, 11 N.E. 562.\n After having deducted the specific exemption of $40,000, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue included the proceeds of these five policies in the decedent's gross estate, for the purpose of the federal estate tax. An action was brought in a Federal District Court to recover the amount of the tax resulting from the inclusion of these proceeds. That court rejected the view of the Commissioner and awarded judgment to the taxpayers upon the authority of Lewellyn v. Frick, \n268 \nU.S. 238\n, 45 S.Ct. 487, 488; Bingham v. United States, 7 F.Supp. 907.\n The Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the Frick Case was distinguishable. United States v. Bingham, 76 F.(2d) 573. We think the view taken by the District Court is the correct one. \n\n[296 U.S. 211, 218]\n\u00a0\n 1. Eleven policies were involved in the Frick Case, all antedating the passage of the Act. Among them was one issued by the Berkshire Company and another issued by the Connecticut Mutual. These policies in terms were identical with the corresponding policies in question here. The assignment of the Berkshire policy there was the same as the assignments here. This court applied the rule that Acts of Congress are to be construed, if possible, so as to avoid grave doubts as to their constitutionality; and said that such doubts were avoided by construing the statute as referring only to transactions taking place after it was passed. In that connection we invoked the general principle 'that laws are not to be considered as applying to cases which arose before their passage,' when to disregard it would be to impose an unexpected liability that, if known, might have been avoided by those concerned. The court below sought to distinguish the decision on the ground that this court did not refer to those specific provisions set forth in the policies and assignments which are pertinent here. (D.C.) 298 F. 803. The government makes the same point, and contends that since this court did not allude to these provisions in the opinion, the decision cannot be regarded as having passed on their effect. It is true that questions which merely lurk in the record, neither brought to the attention of the court nor ruled upon, are not to be considered as having been so decided as to constitute precedents. Webster v. Fall, \n266 \nU.S. 507, 511\n, 45 S.Ct. 148. That, however, is not the situation in the present case. In Lewellyn v. Frick the policies and assignments, in their entirety, were definitely before the court; and this necessarily included each of the provisions which they contained. Moreover, both in the appendix to the government's brief and in the main brief of the taxpayers, the attention of the court was distinctly called to all of the provisions which are now invoked. The latter brief summarized and described the provisions of the \n\n[296 U.S. 211, 219]\n\u00a0\n four classes of policies which were involved-one class being policies, it was pointed out, made payable to the Frick estate 'subsequently assigned by Mr. Frick to his wife or daughter if she survived him, without reserving power to revoke the assignments.' This court, without stopping to recite the various specific provisions that were thus clearly brought to its attention, held that the proceeds of none of the policies were subject to the estate tax under section 402(f). It fairly must be concluded that in reaching that result these provisions were considered, and that such of them as bore upon the problem, there as well as here presented, were found not to require a different determination. We think the points now urged by the government were decided in the Frick Case, and find no reason to reconsider them.\n\n 2. \nThe principles so recently announced by this court in Helvering v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. et al. (November 11, 1935) \n296 \nU.S. 39\n, 56 S.Ct. 74, and Becker v. St. Louis Union Trust Co. et al. (November 11, 1935), \n296 \nU.S. 48\n, 56 S.Ct. 78, are decisive of the case in favor of the taxpayers. Those principles establish that the title and possession of the beneficiary were fixed by the terms of the policies and assignments thereof, beyond the power of the insured to affect, many years before the act here in question was passed. No interest passed to the beneficiary as the result of the death of the insured. His death merely put an end to the possibility that the predecease of his wife would give a different direction to the payment of the policies.\n Judgment reversed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur on the first ground stated in this opinion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE concurs in this opinion, acquiescing in the second ground because of the recent decisions in the cases there mentioned. \n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBORAX CONSOLIDATED v.

Newlin, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for petitioners.\n Mr. Loren A. Butts, of Los Angeles, Cal., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The city of Los Angeles brought this suit to quiet title to land claimed to be tideland of Mormon Island situated in the inner bay of San Pedro now known as Los Angeles Harbor. The city asserted title under a legislative grant by the state. St. Cal. 1911, p. 1256; 1917, p. 159.1 \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 13]\n\u00a0\n Petitioners claimed under a pre-emption patent issued by the United States on December 30, 1881, to one William Banning. The District Court entered a decree, upon findings, dismissing the complaint upon the merits and adjudging that petitioner, Borax Consolidated, Limited, was the owner in fee simple and entitled to the possession of the property. 5 Fed.Supp. 281. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree. 74 F.(2d) 901. Because of the importance of the questions presented, and of an asserted conflict with decisions of this Court, we granted certiorari, June 3, 1935\n\n\n In May, 1880, one W. H. Norway, a deputy surveyor, acting under a contract with the Surveyor General of the United States for California, made a survey of Mormon Island. The surveyor's field notes and the corresponding plat of the island were approved by the Surveyor General and were returned to the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The latter, having found the survey to be correct, authorized the filing of the plat. The land which the patent to Banning purported to convey was described by reference to that plat as follows: 'Lot numbered one, of section eight, in township five south, of range thirteen west of San Bernardino Meridian, in California, containing eighteen acres, and eighty-eight hundredths of an acre, according to the Official Plat of the Survey of the said Lands, returned to the General Land Office by the Surveyor General.'\n The District Court found that the boundaries of 'lot one,' as thus conveyed, were those shown by the plat \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 14]\n\u00a0\n and field notes of the survey; that all the lands described in the complaint were embraced within that lot; and that no portion of the lot was or had been tideland or situated below the line of mean high tide of the Pacific Ocean or of Los Angeles Harbor. The District Court held that the complaint was a collateral, and hence unwarranted, attack upon the survey, the plat, and the patent; that the action of the General Land Office involved determinations of questions of fact which were within its jurisdiction and were specially committed to it by law for decision; and that its determinations, including that of the correctness of the survey, were final and were binding upon the state of California and the city of Los Angeles, as well as upon the United States.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed with this view as to the conclusiveness of the survey and the patent. The court held that the federal government had neither the power nor the intention to convey tideland to Banning, and that his rights were limited to the upland. The court also regarded the lines shown on the plat as being meander lines and the boundary line of the land conveyed as the shore line of Mormon Island. The court declined to pass upon petitioners' claim of estoppel in pais and by judgment upon the ground that the question was not presented to or considered by the trial court, and was also of the opinion that the various questions raised as to the failure of the city to allege and prove the boundary line of the island were important only from the standpoint of the new trial which the court directed. 74 F.(2d) 901, page 904. For the guidance of the trial court the Court of Appeals laid down the following rule: The 'mean high tide line' was to be taken as the boundary between the land conveyed and the tideland belonging to the State of California, and in the interest of certainty the court directed that 'an average for 18.6 \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 15]\n\u00a0\n years should be determined as near as possible by observation or calculation.' 74 F.(2d) 901, pages 906, 907.\n Petitioners contest these rulings of the Court of Appeals. With respect to the ascertainment of the shore line, they insist that the court erred in taking the 'mean high-tide line' and in rejecting 'neap tides' as the criterion for ordinary highwater mark.\n\n 1. \nThe controversy is limited by settled principles governing the title to tidelands. The soils under tidewaters within the original states were reserved to them respectively, and the states since admitted to the Union have the same sovereignty and jurisdiction in relation to such lands within their borders as the original states possessed. Martin v. Waddell, 16 Pet. 367, 410; Pollard v. Hagan, 3 How. 212, 229, 230; Goodtitle v. Kibbe, 9 How. 471, 478; Weber v. State Harbor Commissioners, 18 Wall. 57, 65, 66; Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 26 S., 14 S.Ct. 548. This doctrine applies to tidelands in California. Weber v. State Harbor Commissioners, supra; Shively v. Bowlby, supra, \n152 U.S. 1\n, pages 29, 30, 14 S.Ct. 548; United States v. Mission Rock Co., \n189 \nU.S. 391, 404\n, 405 S., 23 S.Ct. 606. Upon the acquisition of the territory from Mexico, the United States acquired the title to tidelands equally with the title to upland, but held the former only in trust for the future states that might be erected out of that territory. Knight v. United Land Association, \n142 \nU.S. 161, 183\n, 12 S.Ct. 258. There is the established qualification that this principle is not applicable to lands which had previously been granted by Mexico to other parties or subjected to trusts which required a different disposition-a limitation resulting from the duty resting upon the United States under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (9 Stat. 922), and also under principles of international law, to protect all rights of property which had emanated from the Mexican government prior to the treaty. San Francisco v. Le Roy, \n138 \nU.S. 656, 671\n, 11 S.Ct. 364; Knight v. United \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 16]\n\u00a0\n Land Association, supra, Shively v. Bowlby, supra. That limitation is not applicable here, as it is not contended that Mormon Island was included in any earlier grant. See De Guyer v. Banning, \n167 \nU.S. 723\n, 17 S.Ct. 937.\n It follows that if the land in question was tideland, the title passed to California at the time of her admission to the Union in 1850. That the federal government had no power to convey tidelands, which had thus vested in a state, was early determined. Pollard v. Hagan, supra; Goodtitle v. Kibbe, supra. In those cases, involving tidelands in Alabama, the plaintiffs claimed title under an inchoate Spanish Grant of 1809, an act of Congress confirming that title, passed July 2, 1836, and a patent from the United States, dated March 15, 1837. The Court held that the lands, found to be tidelands, had passed to Alabama at the time of her admission to the Union in 1819, that the Spanish grant had been ineffective, and that the confirming act of Congress and the patent conveyed no title. The Court said that: 'The right of the United States to the public lands, and the power of Congress to make all needful rules and regulations for the sale and disposition thereof, conferred no power to grant to the plaintiffs the land in controversy.' Pollard v. Hagan, supra. See, also, Shively v. Bowlby, supra, \n152 U.S. 1\n, at pages 27, 28, 14 S.Ct. 548; Mobile Transportation Company v. Mobile, \n187 \nU.S. 479, 490\n, 23 S.Ct. 170; Donnelly v. United States, \n228 \nU.S. 243, 260\n, 261 S., 33 S.Ct. 449, Ann.Cas. 1913E, 710.\n\n 2. \nAs to the land in suit, petitioners contend that the General Land Office had authority to determine the location of the boundary between upland and tideland and did determine it through the survey in 1880 and the consequent patent to Banning, and that this determination is conclusive against collateral attack; in short, that the land in controversy has been determined by competent authority not to be tideland and that the question is not open to re-examination. Petitioners thus invoke the rule \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 17]\n\u00a0\n that 'the power to make and correct surveys belongs to the political department of the government and that, whilst the lands are subject to the supervision of the General Land Office, the decisions of that bureau in all such cases, like that of other special tribunals upon matters within their exclusive jurisdiction, are unassailable by the courts, except by a direct proceeding.' R.S.,  453, 2395-2398, 2478, 43 U.S.C.  2, 751-754, 1201 (43 USCA  2, 751-754, 1201); Cragin v. Powell, \n128 \nU.S. 691, 698\n, 699 S., 9 S.Ct. 203; Heath v. Wallace, \n138 \nU.S. 573, 585\n, 11 S. Ct. 380; Knight v. United Land Association, supra; Stoneroad v. Stoneroad, \n158 \nU.S. 240, 250\n, 252 S., 15 S.Ct. 822; Russell v. Maxwell Land-Grant Company, \n158 \nU.S. 253, 256\n, 15 S.Ct. 827; United States v. Coronado Beach Co., \n255 \nU.S. 472, 487\n, 488 S., 41 S.Ct. 378.\n But this rule proceeds upon the assumption that the matter determined is within the jurisdiction of the Land Department. Cragin v. Powell, supra. So far as pertinent here, the jurisdiction of the Land Department extended only to 'the public lands of the United States.' The patent to Banning was issued under the pre-emption laws which expressly related to lands 'belonging to the United States.' Rev. St.  2257, 2259. Obviously these laws had no application to lands which belonged to the states. Specifically the term 'public lands' did not include tidelands. Mann v. Tacoma Land Company, \n153 \nU.S. 273, 284\n, 14 S.Ct. 820. 'The words 'public lands' are habitually used in our legislation to describe such as are subject to sale or other disposal under general laws.' Newhall v. Sanger, \n92 U.S. 761\n, 763; Barker v. Harvey, \n181 \nU.S. 481, 490\n, 21 S.Ct. 690; Union Pacific Railroad Company v. Harris, \n215 \nU.S. 386, 388\n, 30 S.Ct. 138.\n The question before us is not as to the general authority of the Land Department to make surveys, but as to its authority to make a survey, as a basis for a patent, which would preclude the state or its grantee from showing in an appropriate judicial proceeding that the survey was in- \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 18]\n\u00a0\n accurate and hence that the patent embraced land which the United States had no power to convey. Petitioners' argument in substance is that while the United States was powerless as against the state to pass title to tidelands in the absence of a survey (Pollard v. Hagan, supra), the question whether or not the land was tideland would be foreclosed by a departmental survey although erroneous. This contention encounters the principle that the question of jurisdiction, that is, of the competency of the Department to act upon the subject-matter, is always one for judicial determination. 'Of course,' said the Court in St. Louis Smelting & Ref. Company v. Kemp, \n104 U.S. 636\n, 641, 'when we speak of the conclusive presumptions attending a patent for lands, we assume that it was issued in a case where the department had jurisdiction to act and execute it; that is to say, in a case where the lands belonged to the United States, and provision had been made by law for their sale. If they never were public property, or had previously been disposed of, or if Congress had made no provision for their sale, or had reserved them, the department would have no jurisdiction to transfer them, and its attempted conveyance of them would be inoperative and void, no matter with what seeming regularity the forms of law may have been observed.' The Court added that questions of that sort 'may be considered by a court of law' for in such cases 'the objection to the patent reaches beyond the action of the special tribunal, and goes to the existence of a subject upon which it was competent to act.' Id. See, also, Polk v. Wendal, 9 Cranch, 87, 99; Moore v. Robbins, \n96 U.S. 530\n, 533; Wright v. Roseberry, \n121 \nU.S. 488, 519\n, 7 S.Ct. 985; Doolan v. Carr, \n125 \nU.S. 618, 625\n, 8 S.Ct. 1228; Hardin v. Jordan, \n140 \nU.S. 371, 401\n, 11 S.Ct. 838; Crowell v. Benson, \n285 \nU.S. 22, 58\n, 59 S., 52 S.Ct. 285. Here, the question goes to the existence of the subject upon which the Land Department was competent to act. Was it upland, which the United States could patent, or tideland, which \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 19]\n\u00a0\n it could not? Such a controversy as to title is appropriately one for judicial decision upon evidence, and we find no ground for the conclusion that it has been committed to the determination of administrative officers.\n Petitioners urge a distinction in that at the time of the survey no private right in the property had yet attached and the question lay between the federal government and the state of California. But the distinction is immaterial. If tideland, the title of the state was complete on admission to the Union. No transfer to private parties was necessary to perfect or assure that title and no power of disposition remained with the United States.\n To support their contention as to the conclusiveness of the survey and patent, petitioners largely rely upon our decision in Knight v. United Land Association, supra. But that decision is not in point as it related to land which, albeit tideland, had been the subject of a Mexican grant made prior to statehood. What had there been done by the federal government was found to be in pursuance of the duty of the United States, imposed by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the principles of international law, to protect the rights of property which had previously been created by the Mexican government. The contest related to land in Mission creek, an estuary of the Bay of San Francisco. The plaintiffs claimed under a tideland grant from the state. The defendant's claim rested upon the title of the city of San Francisco as successor to the Mexican pueblo of that name. Following the procedure prescribed by statute with respect to the confirmation of such titles (Acts of March 3, 1851, 9 Stat. 631; July 1, 1864, 13 Stat. 332), the city had obtained a confirmatory decree from the United States Circuit Court in May, 1865. The statutes required that such a decree should be followed by a survey under the supervision of the General Land Office and patent was to issue to the successful claimant when such survey had been finally ap- \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 20]\n\u00a0\n proved. Id. Accordingly, after the decree in favor of the city, a survey was made which was approved by the Surveyor General and the Commissioner of the General Land Office. The line of that survey ran along the line of ordinary high water mark of the bay of San Francisco, but in the case of the estuary followed the tide line up the creek and, crossing over, ran down on the other side. The city objected to that method, insisting that the line should have crossed the mouth of the estuary, and, on appeal, that contention was sustained by the Secretary of the Interior. A second survey was made pursuant to that decision and a patent was issued. Knight v. United Land Ass'n, \n142 U.S. 161\n, pages 162-172, 12 S.Ct. 258. The plaintiffs contended that the first survey was correct and the second unauthorized. Reviewing that branch of the case, the Court decided that the Secretary of the Interior had power to set aside the first survey and direct another, and that the departmental action in that particular was unassailable. But that conclusion was not sufficient to meet the plaintiffs' claim under the state grant, unless it could be held that title to the land had not passed to the state. Upon that question the court found that the case of San Francisco v. Le Roy, \n138 \nU.S. 656, 670\n, 672 S., 11 S.Ct. 364, was 'directly in point,' as the Court had there decided that 'if there were any tidelands within the pueblo, the power and duty of the United States under the treaty to protect the claims of the city of San Francisco as successor to the pueblo were superior to any subsequently acquired rights of California.' Knight v. United Land Ass'n, \n142 U.S. 161\n, pages 183-185, 12 S.Ct. 258, 265. In discharge of that duty provision had been made by Congress for the investigation and confirmation of the property rights of pueblos equally with those of individuals. The rights of the pueblo 'were dependent upon Mexican laws, and when Mexico established those laws she was the owner of tidelands as well as uplands, and could have placed the boundaries of her pueblos wherever she thought proper.' It was for the United States to ascertain those boundaries \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 21]\n\u00a0\n when fixing the limits of the claim of the city as successor to the pueblo. Id., \n142 U.S. 161\n, pages 186, 187, 12 S.Ct. 258, 266. The obligation of protection was 'political in its character, to be performed in such a manner and on such terms as the United States might direct.' Accordingly, Congress had established a special tribunal to consider claims derived from Mexico, had authorized determinations by the court upon appeal, and had 'designated the officers who should in all cases survey and measure off the land when the validity of the claim presented was finally determined.' Id., \n142 U.S. 161\n, pages 202, 203, 12 S.Ct. 258, 272. The survey upon which the patent rested in the Knight Case was thus made pursuant to the authority reserved to the United States to enable it to discharge its international duty with respect to land which, although tideland, had not passed to the state. See Shively v. Bowlby, supra, \n152 U.S. 1\n, pages 30, 31, 14 S.Ct. 548; United States v. Coronado Beach Company, supra.\n The distinguishing features of the instant case are apparent. No prior Mexican grant is here involved. We conclude that the state was not bound by the survey and patent, and that its grantee was entitled to show, if it could, that the land in question was tideland.\n In this view it is not necessary to consider whether the lines designated in the plat of the Norway survey as 'meander' lines were intended as boundaries.\n\n 3. \nAs the District Court fell into a fundamental error in treating the survey and patent as conclusive, it was not incumbent upon the Court of Appeals to review the evidence and decide whether it showed, or failed to show, that the land in question was tideland. The court remanded the cause for a new trial in which the issues as to the boundary between upland and tideland, and as to the defenses urged by petitioners, are to be determined. In that disposition of the case we find no error.\n\n 4. \nThere remains for our consideration, however, the ruling of the Court of Appeals in instructing the District \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 22]\n\u00a0\n Court to ascertain as the boundary 'the mean high-tide line' and in thus rejecting the line of 'neap tides.'\n Petitioners claim under a federal patent which, according to the plat, purported to convey land bordering on the Pacific Ocean. There is no question that the United States was free to convey the upland, and the patent affords no ground for holding that it did not convey all the title that the United States had in the premises. The question as to the extent of this federal grant, that is, as to the limit of the land conveyed, or the boundary between the upland and the tideland, is necessarily a federal question. It is a question which concerns the validity and effect of an act done by the United States; it involves the ascertainment of the essential basis of a right asserted under federal law. Packer v. Bird, \n137 \nU.S. 661, 669\n, 670 S., 11 S.Ct. 210; Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Company v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 87\n, 43 S.Ct. 60; United States v.

Rights and interests in the tideland, which is subject to the sovereignty of the state, are matters of local law. Barney v. Keokuk, \n94 U.S. 324\n, 338; Shively v.

Co., \n255 \nU.S. 56, 63\n, 41 S.Ct. 237.\n The tideland extends to the high-water mark. Hardin v. Jordan, supra; Shively v. Bowlby, supra; McGilvra v. Ross, \n215 \nU.S. 70, 79\n, 30 S.Ct. 27. This does not mean, as petitioners contend, a physical mark made upon the ground by the waters; it means the line of high water as determined by the course of the tides. By the civil law, the shore extends as far as the highest waves reach in winter. Inst. lib. 2, tit. 1,  3; Dig. lib. 50, tit. 16,  112. But by the common law, the shore 'is confined to the flux and reflux of the sea at ordinary tides.' Blundell v. Catterall, 5 B. & A. 268, 292. It is the land 'between ordinary high and low water mark, the land over which the daily tides \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 23]\n\u00a0\n ebb and flow. When, therefore, the sea, or a bay, is named as a boundary, the line of ordinary high-water mark is always intended where the common law prevails.' United States v. Pacheco, 2 Wall. 587, 590.\n The range of the tide at any given place varies from day to day, and the question is: How is the line of 'ordinary' high water to be determined? The range of the tide at times of new moon and full moon 'is greater than the average,' as 'high water then rises higher and low water falls lower than usual.' The tides at such times are called 'spring tides.' When the moon is in its first and third quarters, 'the tide does not rise as high nor fall as low as on the average.' At such times the tides are known as 'neap tides.' 'Tidal Datum Plane,' U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, Special Publication No. 135, p. 3.2 The view that 'neap tides' should be taken as the ordinary tides had its origin in the statement of Lord Hale. De Jure Maris, cap. VI; Hall on the Sea Shore, p. 10, App. xxiii, xxiv. In his classification, there are 'three sorts of shores, or littora marina, according to the various tides': (1) 'The high spring tides, which are the fluxes of the sea at those tides that happen at the two equinoxials.' (2) 'The spring tides, which happen twice \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 24]\n\u00a0\n every month at full and change of the moon.' And (3) 'ordinary tides, or nepe tides, which happen between the full and change of the moon.' The last kind of shore, said Lord Hale, 'is that which is properly littus maris.' He thus excluded the 'spring tides' of the mouth, assigning as the reason that 'for the most part the lands covered with these fluxes are dry and maniorable,' that is, not reached by the tides.\n The subject was thoroughly considered in the case of Attorney General v. Chambers, 4 De G.M. & G. 206. In that case Lord Chancellor Cranworth invited Mr. Baron Alderson and Mr. Justice Maule to assist in the determination of the question as to 'the extent of the right of the Crown to the seashore.' Those judges gave as their opinion that the average of the 'medium tides in each quarter of a lunar revolution during the year' fixed the limit of the shore. Adverting to the statement of Lord Hale, they thought that the reason he gave would be a guide to the proper determination. 'What,' they asked, are 'the lands which for the most part of the year are reached and covered by the tides?' They found that the same reason that excluded the highest tides of the month, the spring tides, also excluded the lowest high tides, the neaps, for 'the highest or spring- tides and the lowest high tides (those at the neaps) happen as often as each other.' Accordingly, the judges thought that 'the medium tides of each quarter of the tidal period' afforded the best criterion. They said: 'It is true of the limit of the shore reached by these tides that it is more frequently reached and covered by the tide than left uncovered by it. For about three days it is exceeded, and for about three days it is left short, and on one day it is reached. This point of the shore therefore is about four days in every week, i.e. for the most part of the year, reached and covered by the tides.' Id., 4 De G.M. & G. page 214. \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 25]\n\u00a0\n Having received this opinion, the Lord Chancellor stated his own. He thought that the authorities had left the question 'very much at large.' Looking at 'the principle of the rule which gives the shore to the Crown,' and finding that principle to be that 'it is land not capable of ordinary cultivation or occupation, and so is in the nature of unappropriated soil,' the Lord Chancellor thus stated his conclusion: 'Lord Hale gives as his reason for thinking that lands only covered by the high spring-tides do not belong to the Crown, that such lands are for the most part dry and maniorable; and taking this passage as the only authority at all capable of guiding us, the reasonable conclusion is that the Crown's right is limited to land which is for the most part not dry or maniorable. The learned Judges whose assistance I had in this very obscure question point out that the limit indicating such land is the line of the medium high tide between the springs and the neaps. All land below that line is more often than not covered at high water, and so may justly be said, in the language of Lord Hale, to be covered by the ordinary flux of the sea. This cannot be said of any land above that line.' The Lord Chancellor therefore concurred with the opinion of the judges 'in thinking that the medium line must be treated as bounding the right of the Crown.' Id., 4 De G.M. & G. page 217.3\n This conclusion appears to have been approved in Massachusetts. Commonwealth v. City of Roxbury, 9 Gray (Mass.) 451, 483; East Boston Company v. Commonwealth, 203 Mass. 68, 72, 89 N.E. 236, 17 Ann.Cas. 146. See, also, New Jersey Zinc & Iron Co. v. Morris Canal & Banking Co., 44 N.

In order to include the land that is thus covered, it is necessary to take the mean high-tide line which, as the Court of Appeals said, is neither the spring tide nor the neap tide, but a mean of all the high tides.\n In view of the definition of the mean high tide, as given by the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey,6 that 'Mean high water at any place is the average height of all the high waters at that place over a considerable \n\n[296 U.S. 10, 27]\n\u00a0\n period of time,' and the further observation that 'from theoretical considerations of an astronomical character' there should be 'a periodic variation in the rise of water above sea level having a period of 18.6 years,'7 the Court of Appeals directed that in order to ascertain the mean high-tide line with requisite certainty in fixing the boundary of valuable tidelands, such as those here in question appear to be, 'an average of 18. 6 years should be determined as near as possible.' We find no error in that instruction.\n The decree of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS is of opinion that Knight v. United Land Association, \n142 \nU.S. 161\n, 12 S.Ct. 258, is controlling and that the decree of the District Court should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n296 \nU.S. 664\n, 56 S.Ct. 304.[ Borax Consolidated v.

Its outstanding capital stock is $25,250,000 represented by 1,010,000 shares of $25 par value. On November 17, 1933, Joseph A. Broderick, as Superintendent of Banks of the State of New York, brought, in the Supreme Court of New Jersey, this action against 557 of its stockholders who are residents of New Jersey, to recover unpaid assessments levied by him upon them pursuant to law.\n The defendant moved to strike out the complaint on the ground, among others, that, by reason of section 94b of the Corporation Act of New Jersey (2 Comp. St. 1910, p. 1656), it failed to set out a cause of action enforceable in any court of that State. The section, first enacted March 30, 1897, provides: 'No action or proceeding shall be maintained in any court of law in this state against any stockholder, officer or director of any domestic or foreign corporation by or on behalf of any creditor of such corporation to enforce any statutory personal liability of such stockholder, officer or director for or upon any debt, default or obligation of such corporation, whether such statutory personal liability be deemed penal or contractual, if such statutory personal liability be created by or arise from the statutes or laws of any other state or foreign country, and no pending or future action or proceeding to enforce any such statutory personal liability shall be maintained in any court of this state other than in a nature of an equitable accounting for the proportionate benefit of all parties interested, to which such corporation and its legal representatives, if any, and all of its creditors and all of its stockholders shall be necessary parties.'\n Broderick seasonably claimed that to sustain the asserted bar of the statute would violate article 4,  1, of the Federal Constitution, which provides that, 'Full \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 639]\n\u00a0\n Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State,' and the legislation of Congress enacted pursuant thereto. The trial court sustained the motion to strike out the complaint, Broderick v. Abrams, 112 N.J. Law, 309, 170 A. 214, on the ground that the statute of the State constituted a bar to the action. Judgment against the plaintiff, with costs, was entered in favor of each of the defendants, and the judgment was affirmed by the Court of Errors and Appeals 'for the reasons expressed in the opinion' of the trial court. 113 N.J. Law, 305, 174 A. 507. An appeal to this Court was allowed. Broderick v. Rosner, 55 S.Ct. 218, 79 L.Ed. --.\n First. The conditions imposed by section 94b of the New Jersey statute upon the bringing of suits to enforce such assessments, as here applied, deny to the Superintendent the right to resort to the courts of the State to enforce the assessment of liability upon the stockholders there resident. The requirement that the proceeding be by bill in equity, instead of by an action at law, would, if standing alone, be no obstacle. But by withholding jurisdiction unless the proceeding be a suit for an equitable accounting to which the 'corporation and its legal representatives, if any, and all of its creditors and all of its stockholders shall be necessary parties,' it imposes a condition which, as here applied, is legally impossible of fulfillment. For it is not denied that according to the decisions of the New Jersey courts 'necessary parties' means those whose presence in a suit is essential as a jurisdictional prerequisite to the entry of judgment, so that no decree can be made respecting the subject-matter of litigation until they are before the court, Wilkinson v. Dodd, 40 N.J. Eq. 123, 130, 3 A. 360; In re Martin, 86 N.J. Eq. 265, 98 A. 510; McBride v. Garland, 89 N.J.Eq. 314, 104 A. 435; and that to secure jurisdiction personally over those who are not residents of New Jersey, or engaged in business there, is impossible. Pen- \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 640]\n\u00a0\n noyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n; Wilson v. American Palace Car Co ., 65 N.J.Eq. 730, 55 A. 997; Papp v. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 113 N.J.Eq. 522, 530, 167 A. 873. The corporation has no place of business in New Jersey; only a few of the many stockholders and creditors have either residence or place of business there.\n Moreover, even if it were legally possible to satisfy the statutory condition by making substituted service by publication upon nonresident stockholders and creditors (compare Kirkpatrick v. Post, 53 N.J.Eq. 591, 594, 32 A. 267; Id., 53 N.J.Eq. 641, 33 A. 1059), the cost would be prohibitive. The number of the stockholders is 20,843; the number of depositors and other creditors exceeds 400,000; and the amounts assessed against the individual defendants are relatively small-against some only $ 50. The aggregate of sheriff's fees alone as to the nonresident defendants, aside from expenses of publication and mailing, would exceed the aggregate amount due from the New Jersey stockholders. \n1\n The suggestion, in the opinion of the Supreme Court, that leave might be granted to file a bill in equity is, therefore, without legal significance.\n Second. But for the statute, the action would have been entertained. Compare Young v. Masci, 289 U.S. \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 641]\n\u00a0\n 253, 53 S.Ct. 599, 88 A.L.R. 170. New Jersey has provided courts with jurisdiction of suits of like nature and procedure otherwise appropriate for their determination. McDermott v. Woodhouse, 87 N.J. Eq. 615, 620, 101 A. 375; Graham v. Fleissner, 107 N.J. Law, 278, 153 A. 526; Western Nat. Bank v. Reckless (C.C.) 96 F. 70. Compare Cochrane v. Morris, 157 A. 652, 10 N.J.Misc. 82. The plaintiff is not, as in Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, a foreign receiver. He sues as an independent executive in whom has been vested by statute the cause of action sued on. Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 257\n, 32 S.Ct. 415. The complaint is in conformity to the state practice (see 112 N.J. Law, 309, 310, 170 A. 214; Beatty v. Lincoln Bus Co., 169 A. 286, 11 N.J.Misc. 938), and it sets forth the facts essential to a recovery against the stockholder under the law of New York. It shows that the requirements of a valid assessment and of the right to enforce the same by action at law have been complied with, alleging, among other things: That, on December 11, 1930, Broderick pursuant to section 57 of the New York Banking Law, took possession of the Bank's business and property; that since May 6, 1931, he has been engaged in liquidating the same; that prior to July 1, 1932, he determined, pursuant to sections 80 and 120, that the reasonable value of the assets of the Bank was not sufficient to pay the creditors in full and that there was due them $30,000,000 in excess of such reasonable value; that the deficiency then fixed and determined has continued ever since; that upon the Superintendent of Banks is imposed the duty of making assessment upon the stockholders and enforcing the liability of stockholders for the benefit of the creditors and that actions to enforce the liability are to be brought in the name of the Superintendent;2 that \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 642]\n\u00a0\n prior to July 1, 1932, he determined that an assessment of $25 against each stockholder for each share of stock held by him was required for the payment of the Bank's indebtedness; that he duly made upon each stockholder a demand for the payment thereof on August 8, 1932; and that among the stockholders upon whom such demand was made and who failed to pay are the several defendants.\n Third. The power of a State to determine the limits of the jurisdiction of its courts and the character of the controversies which shall be heard therein is subject to the limitations imposed by the Federal Constitution. McKnett v. St. Louis-San Francisco Ry., \n292 \nU.S. 230, 233\n, 54 S.Ct. 690. A 'State cannot escape its constitutional obligations (under the full faith and credit clause) by the simple device of denying jurisdiction in such cases to Courts otherwise competent.' Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 415\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 372.3 It is true that a State can legislate only with reference to its own jurisdiction, Bonaparte v. Tax Court, \n104 U.S. 592\n; Olmsted v. Olmsted, \n216 \nU.S. 386\n, 30 S.Ct. 292, 25 L.R. A.(N.S.) 1292; and that the full faith and credit clause does not require the enforcement of every right which has ripened into a judgment of another state or has been conferred by its statutes. See Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 160\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A. L.R. 696; Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 532\n, 55 S.Ct. 518. But the room left for the play of conflicting policies is a narrow one. One State need not enforce the penal laws of another. Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657\n, 13 S.Ct. 224. A State may \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 643]\n\u00a0\n adopt such system of courts and form of remedy as it sees fit. It may in appropriate cases apply the doctrine of forum non conveniens. Anglo- American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co. No. 1, \n191 \nU.S. 373\n, 24 S.Ct. 92. But it may not, under the guise of merely affecting the remedy, deny the enforcement of claims otherwise within the protection of the full faith and credit clause, when its courts have general jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties. Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290, 300. Compare Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. v. Sowers, \n213 \nU.S. 55\n, 29 S.Ct. 397; Tennessee Coal, Iron & Railroad Co. v. George, \n233 \nU.S. 354\n, 34 S.Ct. 587. For the States of the Union, the constitutional limitation imposed by the full faith and credit clause abolished, in large measure, the general principle of international law by which local policy is permitted to dominate rules of comity.\n Here the nature of the cause of action brings it within the scope of the full faith and credit clause. The atatutory liability sought to be enforced is contractual in character. The assessment is an incident of the incorporation. Thus the subject-matter is peculiarly within the regulatory power of New York, as the State of incorporation. 'So much so,' as was said in Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 260\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, 419, 'that no other state properly can be said to have any public policy thereon. And what the law of Wisconsin (New Jersey) may be respecting the relative rights and obligations of creditors and stockholders of corporations of its creation, and the mode and means of enforcing them, is apart from the question under consideration.' Compare Bernheimer v. Converse, \n206 \nU.S. 516, 532\n, 27 S.Ct. 755. In respect to the determination of liability for an assessment, the New Jersey stockholders submitted themselves to the jurisdiction of New York. For 'the act of becoming a member (of a corporation) is something more than a contract, it is entering into a complex and abiding relation, and as marriage looks to domicil, mem- \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 644]\n\u00a0\n bership looks to and must be governed by the law of the State granting the incorporation.' Modern Woodmen of America v. Mixer, \n267 \nU.S. 544, 551\n, 45 S.Ct. 389, 41 A.L.R. 1384. Compare Supreme Council of Royal Arcanum v. Green, \n237 \nU.S. 531\n, 35 S.Ct. 724, L.R.A. 1916A, 771; Hancock National Bank v. Farnum, \n176 \nU.S. 640\n, 20 S.Ct. 506; McDermott v. Woodhouse, 87 N.J.Eq. 615, 618, 619, 101 A. 375. 4 Obviously recognition could not be accorded to a local policy of New Jersey, if there really were one, of enabling all residents of the State to escape from the performance of a voluntarily assumed statutory obligation, consistent with morality, to contribute to the payment of the depositors of a bank of another State of which they were stockholders.\n Fourth. The fact that the assessment here in question was made under statutory direction by an administrative officer does not preclude the application of the full faith and credit clause. If the assessment had been made in a liquidation proceeding conducted by a court, New Jersey would have been obliged to enforce it, although the stockholders sued had not been made parties to the proceedings, and, being nonresidents, could not have been personally served with process. Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243, 252\n, 260 S., 32 S.Ct. 415. The reason why in that case the full faith and credit clause was held to require Wisconsin courts to enforce the assessment made in Minnesota was not because the determination was embodied in a judgment. Against the nonresident stockholders there had been no judgment in Minnesota. Wisconsin was required to enforce the Minnesota assessment because statutes are 'public acts' within the meaning of the clause, Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 155\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696; Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Commission, supra; \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 645]\n\u00a0\n and because the residents of Wisconsin had, by becoming stockholders of a Minnesota corporation, submitted themselves to that extent, to the jurisdiction and laws of the latter State. Where a State has had jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties, obligations validly imposed upon them by statute must, within the limitations above stated, be given full faith and credit by all the other States.\n The Superintendent is an independent executive on whom the Legislature has conferred large responsibilities (compare Isaac v. Marcus, 258 N.Y. 257, 263, 265, 179 N.E. 487; Matter of Broderick, 235 App.Div. 281, 257 N.Y.S. 382); among them, the determination of the questions involved in stockholders' liability. He must decide whether there is a deficiency of assets which requires resort to that liability; and if so, what proportion of the full liability it is necessary to enforce; and when the assessments shall be paid. It is urged that unlike the assessment involved in Converse v. Hamilton, supra, that laid by the New York Superintendent is not conclusive as to its propriety and amount. The contention rests primarily upon a misconception of a provision in section 80 of the Banking Law, to the effect that 'the written statement of the superintendent, under his hand and seal of office, reciting his determination to enforce the individual liability, or any part thereof, of such stockholders, and setting forth the value of the assets of such corporation and the liabilities thereof, as determined by him after examination and investigation, shall be presumptive evidence of such facts as therein stated.' This provision does not declare, as a rule of substantive law, that the determination is open to attack in an action to enforce the stockholders' liability. It merely provides, as in the case of other official acts, a method of proof without the calling of witnesses. Thus it prescribes a rule of evidence; and may possibly affect \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 646]\n\u00a0\n the manner of pleading. \n5\n But with such matters we have here no concern. It is enough, for present purposes, that a complaint alleging the stock ownership of the defendants, the assessment, the demand, and failure to pay, together with the determination of the value of assets and liabilities, referred to in section 80, sets forth a good cause of action. 6 Broderick v. Aaron, 147 Misc. 854, 264 N.Y.S. 15; Broderick v. Betco Corp., 149 Misc. 245, 267 N.Y.S. 139; Broderick v. American General Corp. ( C.C.A.) 71 F.(2d) 864, 94 A.L.R. 1359; compare Broderick v. Stephano, 314 Pa. 408, 171 A. 582; Broderick v. McGuire, 119 Conn. 83, 174 A. 314. Even if the administrative determination of the assessment made in New York is subject to attack in a suit brought there or in any other State, that fact would not justify New Jersey in denying to the Superintendent the right to bring this suit.\n Fifth. The Superintendent contends that his assessment is a 'public act' within the meaning of the full faith and credit clause, and is entitled to receive in every other State of the Union, the same recognition accorded to it by the laws of New York. He insists that, while under the law of New York defenses personal to individual stockholders are open to them whenever and wherever sued, Selig v. Hamilton, \n234 \nU.S. 652, 662\n, 663 S., 34 S.Ct. 926, his determinations as to the propriety and amount of the assessment, in so far as they involve merely the exercise of judgment, are conclusive; and are not subject to review by any court, except on grounds for which equity com- \n\n[294 U.S. 629, 647]\n\u00a0\n monly affords relief against administrative orders. He argues that his powers and duties in respect to the assessment of stockholders, and the proceeding to enforce liability therefor, are substantially the same as those imposed by the National Banking Act on the Comptroller of the Currency, Van Tuyl v. Scharmann, 208 N.Y. 53, 63, 101 N.E. 881; Matter of Union Bank of Brooklyn, 176 App.Div. 477, 485, 163 N.Y.S. 485; Broderick v. Aaron, 151 Misc. 516, 523, 272 N.Y.S. 219; and that, as to these, it has been settled by an unbroken line of authorities beginning with Kennedy v. Gibson, 8 Wall. 498, 505, that the Comptroller's determination is conclusive in an action at law to enforce the stockholders' liability; being subject, like other administrative orders, only to a direct attack for fraud or error of law by appropriate proceedings in equity. \n7\n United States v. Knox, \n102 U.S. 422\n, 425. Whether this contention is sound, we have no occasion to consider now. See Broderick v. Adamson, 148 Misc. 353, 369-371, 265 N.Y.S. 804. It is sufficient to decide that, since the New Jersey courts possess general jurisdiction of the subject-matter and the parties, and the subject-matter is not one as to which the alleged public policy of New Jersey could be controlling, the full faith and credit clause requires that this suit be entertained.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO is of the opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It is stated by counsel, without contradiction, that, under the New Jersey practice, before substituted service can ever be made, the sheriff must have made as to each nonresident defendant a return non est inventus. New Jersey P.L. 1922, c. 88 (Comp. St. Supp. N.J. 1924,  188-70), entitles the sheriff to a fee of $1.50 for making an affidavit of nonresidence as to each defendant. After such affidavit the plaintiff, it is said, would be required to make applications for leave to effect substituted service on each of the absent defendants and to present the essential facts showing the necessity therefor, setting forth residence and place of business of each. Besides notice sent to each, it would be necessary to publish the notice once a week during four consecutive weeks in some newspaper. N.J.P.L. 1912, c. 155,  13 (Comp. St. N.J. Supp. 1924 ,  33-13); N.J. Chancery Rules, 36-38. It is estimated that the 420,000 names of nonresident defendants would fill at least 80 newspaper pages of 8 columns each. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 80 of the New York Banking Law provides: 'In case any such stockholder shall fail or neglect to pay such assessment within the time fixed in said notice, the superintendent shall have a cause of action, in his own name as superintendent of banks, against such stockholder either severally or jointly with other stockholders of such corporation, for the amount of such unpaid assessment or assessments, together with interest thereon from the date when such assessment was, by the terms of said notice, due and payable.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Chambers v.

Morris, of Washington, D.C., for the United States. \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 251]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Archibald H. Bull died February 13, 1920. He had been a member of a partnership engaged in the business of ship-brokers. The agreement of association provided that in the event a partner died the survivors should continue the business for one year subsequent to his death, and his estate should 'receive the same interests, or participate in the losses to the same extent,' as the deceased partner would, if living, 'based on the usual method of ascertaining what the said profits or losses would be . ... Or the estate of the deceased partner shall have the option of withdrawing his interest from the firm within thirty days after the probate of will ... and all adjustments of profits or losses shall be made as of the date of such withdrawal.' The estate's representative did not exercise the option to withdraw in thirty days, and the business was conducted until December 31, 1920, as contemplated by the agreement.\n The enterprise required no capital and none was ever invested by the partners. Bull's share of profits from January 1, 1920, to the date of his death, February 13, 1920, was $24,124.20; he had no other accumulated profits \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 252]\n\u00a0\n and no interest in any tangible property belonging to the firm. Profits accruing to the estate for the period from the decedent's death to the end of 1920 were $212,718.79; $200,117.90 being paid during the year, and $12, 601.70 during the first two months of 1921\n\n\n The Court of Claims found:\n'When filing an estate tax return, the executor included the decedent's interest in the partnership at a value of $24,124.20, which represented the decedent's share of the earnings accrued to the date of death, whereas the Commissioner, in 1921, valued such interest at $235,202. 99, and subjected such increased value to the payment of an estate tax, which was paid in June and August, 1921. The lastmentioned amount was made up of the amount of $24,124.20 plus the amount of $212,718.79, hereinbefore mentioned. The estate tax on this increased amount was $41, 517.45.1\n\n'April 14, 1921, plaintiff filed an income tax return for the period February 13, 1920, to December 31, 1920, for the estate of the decedent, which return did not include, as income, the amount of $200,117.09 received as the share of the profits earned by the partnership during the period for which the return was filed. The estate employed the cash receipts and disbursement method of accounting.\n\n'Thereafter, in July, 1925, the Commissioner determined that the sum of $200,117.09 received in 1920 should have been returned by the executor as income to the estate for the period February 13 to December 31, 1920, and notified plaintiff of a deficiency in income tax due from the estate for that period of $261,212.65, which was due in part to the inclusion of that amount as taxable income and in part to adjustments not here in contro- \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 253]\n\u00a0\n versy. No deduction was allowed by the Commissioner from the amount of $ 200,117.09 on account of the value of the decedent's interest in the partnership at his death.' 6 F.Supp. 141, 142.\n\n September 5, 1925, the executor appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals from the deficiency of income tax so determined. The Board sustained the Commissioner's action in including the item of $200,117.99 without any reduction on account of the value of the decedent's interest in the partnership at the date of death,2 and determined a deficiency of $55,166. 49, which, with interest of $7,510.95, was paid April 14, 1928.\n July 11, 1928, the executor filed a claim for refund of this amount, setting forth that the $200,117.99, by reason of which the additional tax was assessed and paid, was corpus; that it was so originally determined by the Commissioner and the estate tax assessed thereon was paid by the executor; and that the subsequent assessment of an income tax against the estate for the receipt of the same sum was erroneous. The claim was rejected May 8, 1929. September 16, 1930, the executor brought suit in the Court of Claims, and in his petition, after setting forth the facts as he alleged them to be, prayed judgment in the alternative: (1) For the principal sum of $62,677.44, the amount paid April 14, 1928, as a deficiency of income tax unlawfully assessed and collected; or (2) for the sum of $47,643.44 on the theory that if the sum of $200,117.99 was income for the year 1920 and taxable as such, the United States should have credited against the income tax attributable to the receipt of this sum the overpayment of estate tax resulting from including the amount in the taxable estate-$34,035,3 with interest thereon. \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 254]\n\u00a0\n The Court of Claims held that the item was income and properly so taxed. With respect to the alternative relief sought, it said: 'We cannot consider whether the Commissioner correctly included the total amount received from the business in the net estate of the decedent subject to estate tax for the reason that the suit was not timely instituted.' Judgment went for the United States. \n4\n Because of the novelty and importance of the question presented we granted certiorari. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. \nWe concur in the view of the Court of Claims that the amount received from the partnership as profits earned prior to Bull's death was income earned by him in his lifetime and taxable to him as such; and that it was also corpus of his estate and as such to be included in his gross estate for computation of estate tax. We also agree that the sums paid his estate as profits earned after his death were not corpus but income received by his executor, and to be reckoned in computing income tax for the years 1920 and 1921. Where the effect of the contract is that the deceased partner's estate shall leave his interest in the business and the surviving partners shall acquire it by payments to the estate, the transaction is a sale, and payments made to the estate are for the account of the survivors. It results that the surviving partners are taxable upon firm profits and the estate is not. \n6\n Here, however, the survivors have purchased nothing belonging to the decedent, who had made no investment in the business and owned no tangible property connected with it. The portion of the profits paid his estate was therefore income and not corpus; and this is so whether we consider the executor a member of the old firm for the remainder \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 255]\n\u00a0\n of the year, or hold that the estate became a partner in a new association formed upon the decedent's demise.\n\n 2. \nA serious and difficult issue is raised by the claim that the same receipt has been made the basis of both income and estate tax, although the item cannot in the circumstances be both income and corpus; and that the alternative prayer of the petition required the court to render a judgment which would redress the illegality and injustice resulting from the erroneous inclusion of the sum in the gross estate for estate tax. The respondent presents two arguments in opposition, one addressed to the merits and the other to the bar of the statute of limitations.\n On the merits it is insisted that the government was entitled to both estate tax and income tax in virtue of the right conferred on the estate by the partnership agreement and the fruits of it. The position is that, as the contract gave Bull a valuable right which passed to his estate at his death, the Commissioner correctly included it for estate tax. And the propriety of treating the share of profits paid to the estate as income is said to be equally clear. The same sum of money in different aspects may be the basis of both forms of tax. An example is found in this estate. The decedent's share of profits accrued to the date of his death was $24,124. 20. This was income to him in his lifetime and his executor was bound to return it as such. But the sum was paid to the executor by the surviving partners, and thus became an asset of the estate; accordingly, the petitioner returned that amount as part of the gross estate for computation of estate tax and the Commissioner properly treated it as such.\n We are told that, since the right to profits is distinct from the profits actually collected, we cannot now say more than that perhaps the Commissioner put too high a value on the contract right when he valued it as equal to the amount \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 256]\n\u00a0\n of profits received-$212,718.99. This error, if error it was, the government says is now beyond correction.\n While, as we have said, the same sum may in different aspects be used for the computation of both an income and an estate tax, this fact will not here serve to justify the Commissioner's rulings. They were inconsistent. The identical money-not a right to receive the amount, on the one hand, and actual receipt resulting from that right on the other- was the basis of two assessments. The double taxation involved in this inconsistent treatment of that sum of money is made clear by the lower court's finding we have quoted. The Commissioner assessed estate tax on the total obtained by adding $24,124.20, the decedent's share of profits earned prior to his death, and $212,718.79, the estate's share of profits earned thereafter. He treated the two items as of like quality, considered them both as capital or corpus; and viewed neither as the measure of value of a right passing from the decedent at death. No other conclusion may be drawn from the finding of the Court of Claims.\n In the light of the facts it would not have been permissible to place a value of $212,718.99 or any other value on the mere right of continuance of the partnership relation inuring to Bull's estate. Had he lived, his share of profits would have been income. By the terms of the agreement his estate was to sustain precisely the same status quoad the firm as he had, in respect of profits and losses. Since the partners contributed no capital and owned no tangible property connected with the business, there is no justification for characterizing the right of a living partner to his share of earnings as part of his capital; and if the right was not capital to him, it could not be such to his estate. Let us suppose Bull had, while living, assigned his interest in the firm, with his partners' consent, to a third person for a valuable consideration, and in making return of income had valued or capitalized the right to profits which \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 257]\n\u00a0\n he had thus sold, had deducted such valuation from the consideration received, and returned the difference only as gain. We think the Commissioner would rightly have insisted that the entire amount received was income.\n Since the firm was a personal service concern and no tangible property was involved in its transactions, if it had not been for the terms of the agreement, no accounting would have ever been made upon Bull's death for anything other than his share of profits accrued to the date of his death-$24,124.20-and this would have been the only amount to be included in his estate in connection with his membership in the firm. As respects the status after death, the form of the stipulation is significant. The declaration is that the surviving partners 'are to be at liberty' to continue the business for a year, in the same relation with the deceased partner's estate as if it were in fact the decedent himself still alive and a member of the firm. His personal representative is given a veto which will prevent the continuance of the firm's business. The purpose may well have been to protect the good will of the enterprise in the interest of the survivors and to afford them a reasonable time in which to arrange for their future activities. But no sale of the decedent's interest or share in the good will can be spelled out. Indeed the government strenuously asserted, in supporting the treatment of the payments to the estate as income, that the estate sold nothing to the surviving partners; and we agree. An analogous situation would be presented if Bull had not died, but the partnership had terminated by limitation on February 13, 1920, and the agreement had provided that, if Bull's partners so desired, the relation should continue for another year. It could not successfully be contended that, in such case, Bull's share of profit for the additional year was capital.\n We think there was no estate tax due in respect of the $212,718.79 paid to the executor as profits for the period subsequent to the decedent's death. \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 258]\n\u00a0\n The government's second point is that if the use of profits accruing to the estate in computing estate tax was wrong, the statute of limitations bars correction of the error in the present action. So the Court of Claims thought. We hold otherwise.\n The petitioner included in his estate tax return, as the value of Bull's interest in the partnership, only $24,124.20, the profit accrued prior to his death. The Commissioner added $212,718.79, the sum received as profits after Bull's death, and determined the total represented the value of the interest. The petitioner acquiesced and paid the tax assessed in full in August, 1921. He had no reason to assume the Commissioner would adjudge the $212,718.79 income and taxable as such. Nor was this done until July, 1925. The petitioner thereupon asserted, as we think correctly, that the item could not be both corpus and income of the estate. The Commissioner apparently held a contrary view. The petitioner appealed to the Board of Tax Appeals from the proposed deficiency of income tax. His appeal was dismissed April 9, 1928. It was then too late to file a claim for refund of overpayment of estate tax due to the error of inclusion in the estate of its share of firm profits. \n7\n Inability to obtain a refund or credit, or to sue the United States, did not, however, alter the fact that if the government should insist on payment of the full deficiency of income tax, it would be in possession of some $41,000 in excess of the sum to which it was justly entitled. Payment was demanded. The petitioner paid April 14, 1928, and on June 11, 1928, presented a claim for refund, in which he still insisted the amount in question was corpus, had been so determined and estate tax paid on that basis, and should not be classified for taxation as income. The claim was rejected May 8, 1929, and the present action instituted September 16, 1930. \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 259]\n\u00a0\n The fact that the petitioner relied on the Commissioner's assessment for estate tax, and believed the inconsistent claim of deficiency of income tax was of no force, cannot avail to toll the statute of limitations, which forbade the bringing of any action in 1930 for refund of the estate tax payments made in 1921. As the income tax was properly collected, suit for the recovery of any part of the amount paid on that account was futile. Upon what theory, then, may the petitioner obtain redress in the present action for the unlawful retention of the money of the estate? Before an answer can be given the system of enforcing the government's claims for taxes must be considered in its relation to the problem.\n A tax is an exaction by the sovereign, and necessarily the sovereign has an enforceable claim against every one within the taxable class for the amount lawfully due from him. The statute prescribes the rule of taxation. Some machinery must be provided for applying the rule to the facts in each taxpayer's case, in order to ascertain the amount due. The chosen instrumentality for the purpose is an administrative agency whose action is called an assessment. The assessment may be a valuation of property subject to taxation, which valuation is to be multiplied by the statutory rate to ascertain the amount of tax. Or it may include the calculation and fix the amount of tax payable, and assessments of federal estate and income taxes are of this type. Once the tax is assessed, the taxpayer will owe the sovereign the amount when the date fixed by law for payment arrives. Default in meeting the obligation calls for some procedure whereby payment can be enforced. The statute might remit the government to an action at law wherein the taxpayer could offer such defense as he had. A judgment against him might be collected by the levy of an execution. But taxes are the lifeblood of government, and their prompt and certain availability an imperious need. Time out of mind, therefore, the sovereign has resorted to more drastic \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 260]\n\u00a0\n means of collection. The assessment is given the force of a judgment, and if the amount assessed is not paid when due, administrative officials may seize the debtor's property to satisfy the debt.\n In recognition of the fact that erroneous determinations and assessments will inevitably occur, the statutes, in a spirit of fairness, invariably afford the taxpayer an opportunity at some stage to have mistakes rectified. Often an administrative hearing is afforded before the assessment becomes final; or administrative machinery is provided whereby an erroneous collection may be refunded; in some instances both administrative relief and redress by an action against the sovereign in one of its courts are permitted methods of restitution of excessive or illegal exaction. Thus, the usual procedure for the recovery of debts is reversed in the field of taxation. Payment precedes defense, and the burden of proof, normally on the claimant, is shifted to the taxpayer. The assessment supersedes the pleading, proof, and judgment necessary in an action at law, and has the force of such a judgment. The ordinary defendant stands in judgment only after a hearing. The taxpayer often is afforded his hearing after judgment and after payment, and his only redress for unjust administrative action is the right to claim restitution. But these reversals of the normal process of collecting a claim cannot obscure the fact that after all what is being accomplished is the recovery of a just debt owed the sovereign. If that which the sovereign retains was unjustly taken in violation of its own statute, the withholding is wrongful. Restitution is owed the taxpayer. Nevertheless he may be without a remedy. But we think this is not true here.\n In a proceeding for the collection of estate tax, the United States through a palpable mistake took more than it was entitled to. Retention of the money was against morality and conscience. But claim for refund or credit \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 261]\n\u00a0\n was not presented or action instituted for restitution within the period fixed by the statute of limitations. If nothing further had occurred, congressional action would have been the sole avenue of redress.\n In July, 1925, the government brought a new proceeding arising out of the same transaction involved in the earlier proceeding. This time however, its claim was for income tax. The taxpayer opposed payment in full, by demanding recoupment of the amount mistakenly collected as estate tax and wrongfully retained. Had the government instituted an action at law, the defense would have been good. The United States, we have held, cannot, as against the claim of an innocent party, hold his money which has gone into its treasury by means of the fraud of their agent. United States v. State Bank, \n96 U.S. 30\n. While here the money was taken through mistake without any element of fraud, the unjust retention is immoral and amounts in law to a fraud on the taxpayer's rights. What was said in the State Bank Case applies with equal force to this situation. 'An action will lie whenever the defendant has received money which is the property of the plaintiff, and which the defendant is obliged by natural justice and equity to refund. The form of the indebtedness or the mode in which it was incurred is immaterial. ... In these cases (cited in the opinion), and many others that might be cited, the rules of law applicable to individuals were applied to the United States' 96 U.S. (pages 35, 36).8 A claim for recovery of money so held may not only be the subject of a suit in the Court of Claims, as shown by the authority referred to, but may be used by way of recoupment and credit in an action by the United States arising out of the same transaction. United States v. Macdaniel, 7 Pet. 1, 16, 17; United States v. Ringgold, 8 Pet. 150, 163, 164. In the \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 262]\n\u00a0\n latter case this language was used: 'No direct suit can be maintained against the United States; but when an action is brought by the United States, to recover money in the hands of a party, who has a legal claim against them, it would be a very rigid principle, to deny to him the right of setting up such claim in a court of justice, and turn him round to an application to congress. If the right of the party is fixed by the existing law, there can be no necessity for an application to congress, except for the purpose of remedy. And no such necessity can exist, when this right can properly be set up by way of defence, to a suit by the United States.' \n9\n If the claim for income tax deficiency had been the subject of a suit, any counter demand for recoupment of the overpayment of estate tax could have been asserted by way of defense and credit obtained, notwithstanding the statute of limitations had barred an independent suit against the government therefor. This is because recoupment is in the nature of a defense arising out of some feature of the transaction upon which the plaintiff's action is grounded. Such a defense is never barred by the statute of limitations so long as the main action itself is timely. \n 10\n\u00a0\n\n The circumstance that both claims, the one for estate tax and the other for income tax, were prosecuted to judgment and execution in summary form does not obscure the fact that in substance the proceedings were actions to collect debts alleged to be due the United States. It is \n\n[295 U.S. 247, 263]\n\u00a0\n immaterial that in the second case, owing to the summary nature of the remedy, the taxpayer was required to pay the tax and afterwards seek refundment. This procedural requirement does not obliterate his substantial right to rely on his cross-demand for credit of the amount which, if the United States had sued him for income tax, he could have recouped against his liability on that score.\n To the objection that the sovereign is not liable to respond to the petitioner the answer is that it has given him a right of credit or refund, which, though he could not assert it in an action brought by him in 1930, had accrued and was available to him, since it was actionable and not barred in 1925 when the government proceeded against him for the collection of income tax.\n The pleading was sufficient to put in issue the right to recoupment. The Court of Claims is not bound by any special rules of pleading;11 all that is required is that the petition shall contain a plain and concise statement of the facts relied on and give the United States reasonable notice of the matters it is called upon to meet. \n12\n And a prayer for alternative relief, based upon the facts set out in the petition, may be the basis of the judgment rendered. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n We are of opinion that the petitioner was entitled to have credited against the deficiency of income tax the amount of his overpayment of estate tax with interest, and that he should have been given judgment accordingly. The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] It will be noted there is an error in the figures set out in this finding, the total of the two smaller sums being $236,842.99, but the discrepancy is not material to any issue in the case. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Bull v.

Paragraphs (b)(4), (i)(1), and (i)(2), are specially relied upon. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Jacobus owned practically all shares of two corporations, herein designated A and B, which operated bus lines. The Public Service Corporation of New Jersey, the projector, desired to control these lines; and to that end engineered the following plan:\n Public Service Co-ordinated Transport Company, affiliated with the projector, caused the organization of C. Easman Jacobus, Inc., took all the stock, and paid therefor by transferring 2,500 of the projector's shares.\n Jacobus caused petitioner to be organized and acquired all its stock in exchange for all shares of A and B corporations. Thereafter, petitioner transferred to Public Service Co-ordinated Transport Company these A and B shares, and took all shares of C. Easman Jacobus, Inc.\n Thus, petitioner, through Jacobus, Inc., came to control 2,500 of the projector's shares; and Public Service \n\n[296 U.S. 391, 393]\n\u00a0\n Co-ordinated and Transport Company became owner of all shares of A and B corporations. Through these manipulations, the projector obtained indirect control of corporations A and B and the lines which they operate.\n The Commissioner, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the Circuit Court of Appeals all rightly concluded that petitioner was not party to a reorganization within the statute. Certain corporate shares owned by it were exchanged for shares which another corporation owned. Neither party to the exchange acquired any definite immediate interest in t e other. Nothing here, we think, even remotely resembles either merger or reorganization, as commonly understood. Pinellas Ice Co. v.

Following a trial, the District Court made findings of fact and entered a decree denying the relief prayed for, except that respondents were enjoined from so carrying into effect their operations as to reduce the level of Rogue river below a designated elevation above sea level, and in another particular not necessary to be stated. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decree, 73 F.(2d) 555, and we brought the case here on certiorari, \n294 \nU.S. 701\n, 55 S.Ct. 507, 79 L.Ed. --.\n Rogue river is a nonnavigable stream; and in its course flows through and between lands of petitioner on the east bank of the river and lands of respondents upon the west bank, the thread of the stream being the boundary between the two. Petitioner's lands were acquired by a predecessor in interest in 1885 by patent from the United States under the Homestead Act, May 20, 1862 (12 Stat. 392). The lands were purchased by petitioner and conveyed to it in 1921. Petitioner is a public service corporation engaged in manufacturing and supplying electrical current to its customers. The city of Gold Hill, a municipal corporation, owns the lands on the west side of the river, and the Beaver Portland Cement Company is in possession of them, together with certain adjudicated water rights and permits issued from the office of the state engineer, under a contract of sale from the city. The blasting complained of was all west of the thread of the stream, on respondents' property, and was for the double purpose of freeing the channel, incident to the use of the water rights adjudicated and permitted, and securing broken stone for a dam to be used in connection with a power plant which the cement company was about to build.\n Neither petitioner nor any of its predecessors in interest has ever diverted the waters of the river for beneficial use on the real property or sought to make an actual appropriation thereof. The sole claim is based upon the \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 152]\n\u00a0\n common-law rights of a riparian proprietor, which petitioner says attached to the lands when the patent was issued to its first predecessor in title.\n Petitioner insists that prior to the adoption of the Oregon Water Code of 1909 (Laws 1909, p. 319), infra, the common-law rule that the riparian owner was entitled to the natural flow of the stream across or along the border of his land in its accustomed channel was recognized and in full force in the state of Oregon. Respondents contend to the contrary. Both cite many Oregon decisions and argue the matter at length. But an examination of the authorities leaves the question in doubt. In dealing with cases where the parties making conflicting claims were both riparian owners, the doctrine of the common law seems to have been recognized. Other cases appear to accept what is called a modified form of the common- law rule; and still other decisions apparently enforce the rule of appropriation. It is suggested by respondent that, prior to the adoption of the Water Code in 1909, the policy in respect of water rights was developing and the law on the subject of riparian rights was in a state of flux. There appears to be reason in the suggestion. But, in view of the conclusion to which we have come, it is unnecessary to pursue the inquiry further.\n In 1909, the Water Code was adopted by the state Legislature. Or. Laws, 1909, c. 216 (page 319). The act provides that all water within the state shall be subject to appropriation for beneficial use; but nothing therein is to be construed to take away or impair any vested right. In respect of a riparian proprietor, a vested right is defined as an 'actual application of water to beneficial use prior to the passage of this act ... to the extent of the actual application to beneficial use.' Section 70, p. 340. The Code provides for the adjudication of water rights upon a petition to the state engineer. And any court in which suit is brought to determine such rights may, in its discretion, transfer \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 153]\n\u00a0\n the case to the state engineer for determination. But no decision of the state engineer is to become final until confirmed by the court designated as having jurisdiction under the act. The procedural provisions of the act have been sustained as constitutional by this court. Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Lewis, \n241 \nU.S. 440\n, 36 S.Ct. 637\n\n\n The court below held: (1) That the homestead patent of 1885 carried with it the common-law right to have the stream continue to flow in its accustomed channel, without substantial diminution; but (2) that, while this was a substantial property right which could not be arbitrarily destroyed, it nevertheless was subject to the police power of the state and might be modified by legislation passed in the interest of the general welfare; and upon the latter ground the Water Code was upheld and the claims of respondents sustained.\n First. The first question is of especial importance to the semiarid states of California, Oregon, and Washington, where climatic conditions in some sections so differ from those in others that the doctrine of the common law may be of advantage in one instance, and entirely unsuited to conditions in another. Probably, it was this diversity of conditions which gave rise to more or less confusion in the decisions, not only of Oregon, but of California, in respect of the subject. We have already spoken of the former; and one has only to compare the decision of the Supreme Court of California in Lux v. Haggin, 69 Cal. 255, 4 P. 919, 10 P. 674, with Modoc L. & L.S. CO. v. Booth, 102 Cal. 151, 36 P. 431, to realize that the rule with respect to the extent of the application of the common law of riparian rights is, likewise, far from being clear in the latter.\n The question with which we are here primarily concerned is whether-in the light of pertinent history, of the conditions which existed in the arid and semiarid land states, of the practice and attitude of the federal \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 154]\n\u00a0\n government, and of the congressional legislation prior to 1885-the homestead patent in question carried with it as part of the granted estate the common-law rights which attach to riparian proprietorship. If the answer be in the negative, it will be unnecessary to consider the second question decided by the court below.\n For many years prior to the passage of the Act of July 26, 1866, c. 262,  9, 14 Stat. 251, 253 (30 USCA  51 and note, 43 USCA  661, par. 1, and note), the right to the use of waters for mining and other beneficial purposes in California and the arid region generally was fixed and regulated by local rules and customs. The first appropriator of water for a beneficial use was uniformly recognized as having the better right to the extent of his actual use. The common law with respect to riparian rights was not considered applicable, or, if so, only to a limited degree. Water was carried by means of ditches and flumes great distances for consumption by those engaged in mining and agriculture. Jennison v. Kirk, \n98 \nU.S. 453, 457\n, 458 S.. The rule generally recognized throughout the states and territories of the arid region was that the acquisition of water by prior appropriation for a beneficial use was entitled to protection; and the rule applied whether the water was diverted for manufacturing, irrigation, or mining purposes. The rule was evidenced not alone by legislation and judicial decision, but by local and customary law and usage as well. Basey v. Gallagher, 20 Wall. 670, 683, 684; Atchison v. Peterson, 20 Wall. 507, 512, 513.\n This general policy was approved by the silent acquiescence of the federal government, until it received formal confirmation at the hands of Congress by the Act of 1866, supra. Atchison v. Peterson, supra. Section 9 of that act provides that: 'Whenever, by priority of possession, rights to the use of water for mining, agricultural, manufacturing, or other purposes, have vested and accrued, and the same \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 155]\n\u00a0\n are recognized and acknowledged by the local customs, laws, and the decisions of courts, the possessors and owners of such vested rights shall be maintained and protected in the same; and the right of way for the construction of ditches and canals for the purposes herein specified is acknowledged and confirmed. ...'\n This provision was 'rather a voluntary recognition of a pre-existing right of possession, constituting a valid claim to its continued use, than the establishment of a new one.' Broder v. Natoma Water & Min. Co., \n101 U.S. 274\n, 276; United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrig. Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 704\n, 705 S., 19 S.Ct. 770. And in order to make it clear that the grantees of the United States would take their lands charged with the existing servitude, the Act of July 9, 1870, c. 235,  17, 16 Stat. 217, 218 (30 USCA  52 and note, 43 USCA  661, par. 2 and note) amending the Act of 1866, provided that: '... All patents granted, or preemption or homesteads allowed, shall be subject to any vested and accrued water rights, or rights to ditches and reservoirs used in connection with such water rights, as may have been acquired under or recognized by the ninth section of the act of which this act is amendatory ( this section).'\n The effect of these acts is not limited to rights acquired before 1866. They reach into the future as well, and approve and confirm the policy of appropriation for a beneficial use, as recognized by local rules and customs, and the legislation and judicial decisions of the arid land states, as the test and measure of private rights in and to the nonnavigable waters on the public domain. Jones v. Adams, 19 Nev. 78, 86, 6 P. 442, 3 Am.St.Rep. 788; Jacob v. Lorenz, 98 Cal. 332, 335, 336, 33 P. 119.\n If the acts of 1866 and 1870 did not constitute an entire abandonment of the common-law rule of running waters in so far as the public lands and subsequent grantees thereof were concerned, they foreshadowed the more positive declarations of the Desert Land Act of 1877, which it is contended did bring about that result. That \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 156]\n\u00a0\n act allows the entry and reclamation of desert lands within the states of California, Oregon, and Nevada (to which Colorado was later added), and the then territories of Washington, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Arizona, New Mexico, and Dakota,1 with a proviso to the effect that the right to the use of waters by the claimant shall depend upon bona fide prior appropriation, not to exceed the amount of waters actually appropriated and necessarily used for the purpose of irrigation and reclamation. Then follows the clause of the proviso with which we are here concerned: '... All surplus water over and above such actual appropriation and use, together with the water of all lakes, rivers, and other sources of water supply upon the public lands and not navigable, shall remain and be held free for the appropriation and use of the public for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes subject to existing rights.' Act March 3, 1877, c. 107,  1, 19 Stat. 377 (43 USCA  321).\n For the light which it will reflect upon the meaning and scope of that provision and its bearing upon the present question, it is well to pause at this point to consider the then existing situation with respect to land and water rights in the states and territories named. These states and territories comprised the western third of the United States; a vast empire in extent, but still sparsely settled. From a line east of the Rocky Mountains almost to the Pacific Ocean, and from the Canadian border to the boundary of Mexico, an area greater than that of the original thireen area greater than that of the original thirteen in the main, constituted a desert, impossible of agricultural use without artificial irrigation.\n In the beginning, the task of reclaiming this area was left to the unaided efforts of the people who found their way by painful effort to its inhospitable solitudes. These \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 157]\n\u00a0\n western pioneers, emulating the spirit of so many others who had gone before them in similar ventures, faced the difficult problem of wresting a living and creating homes from the raw elements about them, and threw down the gage of battle to the forces of nature. With imperfect tools, they built dams, excavated canals, constructed ditches, plowed and cultivated the soil, and transformed dry and desolate lands into green fields and leafy orchards. In the success of that effort, the general government itself was greatly concerned, not only because, as owner, it was charged through Congress with the duty of disposing of the lands, but because the settlement and development of the country in which the lands lay was highly desirable.\n To these ends, prior to the summer of 1877, Congress had passed the mining laws, the homestead and pre-emption laws, and, finally, the Desert Land Act. It had encouraged and assisted, by making large land grants to aid the building of the Pacific railroads and in many other ways, the redemption of this immense landed estate. That body thoroughly understood that an enforcement of the common-law rule, by greatly retarding if not forbidding the diversion of waters from their accustomed channels, would disastrously affect the policy of dividing the public domain into small holdings and effecting their distribution among innumerable settlers. In respect of the area embraced by the desert land states, with the exception of a comparatively narrow strip along the Pacific seaboard, it had become evident to Congress, as it had to the inhabitants, that the future growth and well-being of the entire region depended upon a complete adherence to the rule of appropriation for a beneficial use as the exclusive criterion of the right to the use of water. The streams and other sources of supply from which this water must come was separated from one another by wide stretches of parched and barren land which never could be made to produce agricultural crops except by the \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 158]\n\u00a0\n transmission of water for long distances and its entire consumption in the processes of irrigation. Necessarily, that involved the complete subordination of the common-law doctrine of riparian rights to that of appropriation. And this substitution of the rule of appropriation for that of the common law was to have momentous consequences. It became the determining factor in the long struggle to expunge from our vocabulary the legend 'Great American Desert,' which was spread in large letters across the face of the old maps of the far west.\n In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Desert Land Act was passed, and in their light it must now be construed. By its terms, not only all surplus water over and above such as might be appropriated and used by the desert land entrymen, but 'the water of all lakes, rivers, and other sources of water supply upon the public lands and not navigable' were to remain 'free for the appropriation and use of the public for irrigation, mining and manufacturing purposes.' If this language is to be given its natural meaning, and we see no reason why it should not, it effected a severance of all waters upon the public domain, not theretofore appropriated, from the land itself. From that premise, it follows that a patent issued thereafter for lands in a desert land state or territory, under any of the land laws of the United States, carried with it, of its own force, no common-law right to the water flowing through or bordering upon the lands conveyed. While this court thus far has not found it necessary to determine that precise question, its words, so far as they go, tend strongly to support the conclusion which we have suggested.\n In United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation, Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690\n, 19 S.Ct. 770, the government sought to enjoin the irrigation company from constructing a dam across the Rio Grande river in the territory of New Mexico, and from appropriating the waters of that stream. The object of the com- \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 159]\n\u00a0\n pany was to impound the waters and distribute the same for a variety of purposes. The company defended on the ground that the site of the dam was within the arid region, and that it had fully complied with the water laws of the territory of New Mexico in which the dam was located and the waters were to be used. The Supreme Court of the territory affirmed a decree dismissing the bill. This court reversed and remanded the case, with instructions to inquire whether the construction of the dam and appropriation of water would substantially diminish the navigability of the stream, and, if so, to enter a decree restraining the acts of the appellees to the extent of the threatened diminution. The opinion, dealing with the question of riparian rights, said that it was within the power of any state to change the common-law rule and permit the appropriation of the flowing waters for any purposes it deemed wise. Whether a territory had the same power the court did not then decide. Two limitations of state power were suggested: First, in the absence of any specific authority from Congress, that a state could not by its legislation destroy the right of the United States as the owner of lands bordering on a stream to the continued flow, so far, at least, as might be necessary for the beneficial use of the government property; and, second, that its power was limited by that of the general government to secure the uninterrupted navigability of all navigable streams within the limits of the United States. With these exceptions, the court, however, thought (174 U.S. page 706, 19 S.Ct. 770, 776) that by the acts of 1866 and 1877 'Congress recognized and assented to the appropriation of water in contravention of the common-law rule as to continuous flow,' and that 'the obvious purpose of congress was to give its assent, so far as the public lands were concerned, to any system, although in contravention to the common-law rule, which permitted the appropriation of those waters for legitimate industries.' And see \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 160]\n\u00a0\n Bean v. Morris, \n221 \nU.S. 485, 487\n, 31 S.Ct. 703; Van Dyke v. Midnight Sun Mining & Ditch Co. (C.C.A.) 177 F. 85, 88-91.\n In Gutierres v. Albuquerque Land & Irr. Co., \n188 \nU.S. 545\n, 23 S.Ct. 338, it was held that the acts of 1866 and 1877 recognized, it respect of the public domain, the validity of the local customs, laws, and decisions of the territories as well as of the states in respect of the appropriation of waters, and granted the right to appropriate such quantity as might be necessarily used to irrigate and reclaim desert land, and the right of the public to use the surplus for irrigation, mining, and manufacturing purposes subject to existing rights.\n In Boquillas Land & Cattle Co. v. Curtis, \n213 \nU.S. 339\n, 29 S.Ct. 493, this court, while finding it unnecessary to decide whether lands in the arid regions patented after the Desert Land Act were accepted subject to the rule that priority of appropriation gives priority of right, said that the decision of the Supreme Court of Oregon to that effect in Hough v. Porter, 51 Or. 318, 95 P. 732, 98 P. 1083, 102 P. 728, proceeded 'on plausible grounds.'\n And in Schodde v. Twin Falls Land & Water Co., \n224 \nU.S. 107, 122\n, 32 S.Ct. 470, an Idaho case which shaprly presented conflicting claims under the common-law rule and the rule of appropriation, this court held that such common-law rights as were incompatible with the rule of prior appropriation for beneficial use could not coexist with the latter system.\n Only four of the desert land states have spoken upon the matter, and their decisions are not in harmony. The Supreme Court of Oregon in Hough v. Porter, 51 Or. 318, 95 P. 732, 98 P. 1083, 102 P. 728, held that the legal effect of the language already quoted from the Desert Land Act was to dedicate to the public all interest, riparian or otherwise, in the waters of the public domain, and to abrogate the common-law rule in respect of riparian rights as to all lands settled upon or entered after March 3, 1877. The supplemental opinion which deals with the subject beginning at page 382 is well reasoned, and \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 161]\n\u00a0\n we think reaches the right conclusion. Subsequent decisions in Oregon are to the same effect. Hedges v. Riddle, 63 Or. 257, 259, 260, 127 P. 548; Hill v. American Land & Livestock Co., 82 Or. 202, 207, 161 P. 403; Allen v. Magill, 96 Or. 610, 618, 619, 189 P. 986, 190 P. 726.\n This view was followed by the Supreme Court of South Dakota in Cook et al. v. Evans et al., 45 S.D. 31, 38, 185 N.W. 262, and Haaser v. Englebrecht, 45 S.D. 143, 146, 186 N.W. 572.\n The Supreme Court of Washington in Still v. Palouse Irr. & Power Co., 64 Wash. 606, 612, 117 P. 466, gave a more limited construction to the Desert recognized and assented to thereby Congress recognized and assented to the appropriation of water in contravention to the common-law right of the riparian owner only in respect of desert lands granted under the act. See, also, Bernot v. Morrison, 81 Wash. 538, 559, 560, 143 P. 104, Ann. Cas. 1916D, 290.\n In San Joaquin & Kings River Canal & Irrigation Co. v. Worswick, 187 Cal. 674, 690, 203 P. 999, the Supreme Court of California followed the Washington court in holding that the language of the Desert Land Act applied only to desert land entries.\n To accept the view of the Washington and California courts would, in large measure, be to subvert the policy which Congress had in mind; namely, to further the disposition and settlement of the public domain. It is safe to say that by far the greater part of the public lands in the desert land states and territories susceptible of reclamation in 1877 was remote from the natural sources of water supply. But these lands were subject to entry, not only under the Desert Land Act, but under other acts as well. Congress must have known that innumerable instances would arise where lands thereafter patented under the Desert Land Act and other lands patented under the pre-emption and homestead laws, would be in \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 162]\n\u00a0\n the same locality and would require water from the same natural sources of supply. In that view, it is inconceivable that Congress intended to abrogate the common-law right of the riparian patentee for the benefit of the desert landowner and keep it alive against the homestead or pre- emption claimant.\n As the owner of the public domain, the government possessed the power to dispose of land and water thereon together, or to dispose of them separately. Howell v. Johnson (C.C.) 89 F. 556, 558. The fair construction of the provision now under review is that Congress intended to establish the rule that for the future the land should be patented separately; and that all nonnavigable waters thereon should be reserved for the use of the public under the laws of the states and territories named. The words that the water of all sources of water supply upon the public lands and not navigable 'shall remain and be held free for the appropriation and use of the public' are not susceptible of any other construction. The only exception made is that in favor of existing rights; and the only rule spoken of is that of appropriation. It is hard to see how a more definite intention to sever the land and water could be evinced. The terms of the statute, thus construed, must be read into every patent thereafter issued, with the same force as though expressly incorporated therein, with the result that the grantee will take the legal title to the land conveyed, and such title, and only such title, to the flowing waters thereon as shall be fixed or acknowledged by the customs, laws, and judicial decisions of the state of their location. If it be conceded that in the absence of federal legislation the state would be powerless to affect the riparian rights of the United States or its grantees, still, the authority of Congress to vest such power in the state, and that it has done so by the legislation to which we have referred, cannot be doubted. \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 163]\n\u00a0\n The proceedings in connection with the adoption of the Desert Land Act bear out this view. The bill which subsequently became the act was called up for consideration in the Senate on February 27, 1877. The report of the committee, among other things, said that the larger portions of the lands bordering on the streams had been appropriated; that the provisions of the bill would enable settlers by combined efforts to construct more extensive works and reclaim lands now worthless; that a system had already grown up in the states and territories included in the bill which recognized priority of appropriation as the rule governing the right to the use of water, limiting the amount to that actually used, and thus avoiding waste. Senator Sargent of California, who was in charge of the bill, in the course of the debate said that one great difficulty had been that 'cattle-men go under a fictitious compliance with the terms of the pre-emption law and take their land along the margin of the streams, and then there is no possibility of getting water to the back country at all. I want to provide so that persons in the back country may go above such a person, for instance, on Humboldt River, and take the water out and conduct it on to the back lands.' Cong. Record, vol. V, pt. 3, 44th Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 1965-1966. There is nothing in the language of the act, or in the circumstances leading up to or accompanying its adoption, that indicates an intention on the part of Congress to confine the appropriation of water in contravention of the common-law doctrine to desert land entrymen.\n Second. Nothing we have said is meant to suggest that the act, as we construe it, has the effect of curtailing the power of the states affected to legislate in respect of waters and water rights as they deem wise in the public interest. What we hold is that following the act of 1877, if not before, all nonnavigable waters then a part of the public domain became publici juris, subject to the plenary \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 164]\n\u00a0\n control of the designated states, including those since created out of the territories named, with the right in each to determine for itself to what extent the rule of appropriation or the common-law rule in respect of riparian rights should obtain. For since 'Congress cannot enforce either rule upon any state,' State of Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 94\n, 27 S. Ct. 655, 666, the full power of choice must remain with the state. The Desert Land Act does not bind or purport to bind the states to any policy. It simply recognizes and gives sanction, in so far as the United States and its future grantees are concerned, to the state and local doctrine of appropriation, and seeks to remove what otherwise might be an impediment to its full and successful operation. See State of Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 465\n, 42 S.Ct. 552.2 \n\n[295 U.S. 142, 165]\n\u00a0\n The public interest in such state control in the arid land states is definite and substantial. In Clark v. Nash, \n198 \nU.S. 361, 370\n, 25 S.Ct. 676, 679, 4 Ann.Cas. 1171, this court accepted that view to the extent of holding that in the arid land states the use of water for irrigation, although by a private individual, is a public use; and sustained as constitutional a state statute which, for purposes of irrigation, permitted an individual to condemn a right of way for enlarging a ditch across the land of another. Mr. Justice Peckham, delivering the opinion of the court, said: 'The rights of a riparian owner in and to the use of the water flowing by his land are not the same in the arid and mountainous states of the West that they are in the states of the East. These rights have been altered by many of the Western states by their constitutions and laws, because of the totally different circumstances in which their inhabitants are placed, from those that exist in the states of the East, and such alterations have been made for the very purpose of thereby contributing to the growth and prosperity of those states, arising from mining and the cultivation of an otherwise valueless soil, by means of irrigation. This court must recognize the difference of climate and soil, which render necessary these different laws in the states so situated.'\n For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decree of the court below, passing without consideration the second question discussed by that court and upon which its decision rested, as to which we express no opinion.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Later to become the states of North and South Dakota. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In this connection it is not without significance that Congress, since the passage of the Desert Land Act, has repeatedly recognized the supremacy of state law in respect of the acquisition of water for the reclamation of public lands of the United States and lands of its Indian wards. Two examples may be cited:\n The Reclamation Act of 1902, c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388, directed the Secretary of the Interior (section 8 (43 USCA  383)) to proceed in conformity to the state laws in carrying out the provisions of the act, and provided that nothing in the act should be construed as affecting or intending to affect or in any way interfere with the laws of any state or territory 'relating to the control, appropriation, use, or distribution of water used in irrigation.'\n The Act of June 21, 1906, c. 3504, 34 Stat. 325, 375, made an appropriation for constructing irrigation systems to irrigate lands of the Uncompahgre, Uintah, and White River Utes in Utah, with the proviso that 'such irrigation systems shall be constructed and completed and held and operated, and water therefor appropriated under the laws of the State of Utah,' etc. This was amended by the Indian Appropriation Act of March 3, 1909, c. 263, 35 Stat. 781, 812, which again recognized the supremacy of the laws of Utah in respect of appropriation, and provided that the appropriation should 'be used only in the event of failure to procure from the State of Utah or its officers an extension of time in which to make final proof for waters appropriated for the benefit of the Indians.' \n\n\n\n\n","30":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCENTRAL VERMONT TRANSP.

An interlocutory order of the District Court restraining the seizure and forfeiture of the merchandise thus transported was reversed and set aside by the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, on the ground that the transportation was a plain violation of the statute. 71 F.(2d) 273. This Court granted certiorari, \n293 \nU.S. 542\n, 55 S.Ct. 100, 79 L.Ed. --, upon a petition which the government, considering the question one of importance, did not oppose.\n Petitioner is a Maine corporation, engaged in operating a steamship line on Long Island Sound between New London, Conn., and New York City, employing vessels built in the United States and documented under its laws. All of petitioner's shares of stock, with the exception of directors' qualifying shares, are owned and held by the Central Vermont Railway, Inc., a Vermont corporation, which is an interstate rail carrier, with its railroad extending northward from New London to points in Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont. The railway's stock, except directors' qualifying shares, is held in turn by the Canadian National Railway Company, a Canadian corporation. The acquisition of stock of petitioner by the Central Vermont Railway, Inc., and of the latter's stock by the Canadian National Railway Company were duly approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission. 40 I.C.C. 589; 158 I.C.C. 397, 405, 406.\n Petitioner and Central Vermont Railway, Inc., maintain a line for transportation of merchandise by rail and water, by continuous carriage, between points in the New England States and New York City. About two- thirds of the freight passing over the line either originates at points in the Northwestern States and is routed over Canadian rail lines and thence over the Central Vermont rail and water line to New York City or passes over the same route in the other direction. These through routes have been \n\n[294 U.S. 33, 36]\n\u00a0\n recognized by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and tariffs for them have been filed with the Commission. The remainder of the traffic originates in New England or New York City, and moves between those points. All the freight which moves by petitioner's boats between New London and New York City is therefore transported over the whole or some part of a through route recognized by the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Respondent has seized merchandise which had been shipped over the Central Vermont from St. Albans, Vt., to New London, and carried thence by petitioner's vessel to New York City, and threatens to seize other articles carried by petitioner's vessels upon shipments between points in New England and New York City. Petitioner contends that the threatened seizures, which will work irreparable injury to its business, are unauthorized by section 27, because: (a) Not within its prohibition; (b) it does not apply to petitioner or the merchandise which it transports, because of the paramount, and therefore exclusive, jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission over the traffic in which petitioner participates; and (c) if applicable to them, it infringes the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n\n 1. \nSection 27 of the Merchant Marine Act (46 USCA  883) prohibits the transportation of merchandise, under penalty of its forfeiture, 'by water, or by land and water,' between points in the United States 'in any other vessel than a vessel built in and documented under the laws of the United States and owned by persons who are citizens of the United States : ... Provided, That this section shall not apply to merchandise transporfed between points within the continental United States, excluding Alaska, over through routes (heretofore or hereafter) recognized by the Interstate Commerce Commission for which routes rate tariffs have been or shall (hereafter) be filed with said commission when such routes are in part over Canadian rail \n\n[294 U.S. 33, 37]\n\u00a0\n lines and their own or other connecting water facilities. ...'\n The vessels of petitioner are not owned by persons who are citizens of the United States within the meaning of the Merchant Marine Act. Section 38 (46 USCA  802), when read with section 37 (46 USCA  888), provides that within the meaning of the act 'no corporation ... shall be deemed a citizen of the United States unless the controlling interest therein is owned by citizens of the United States, ... but in the case of a corporation ... operating any vessel in the coastwise trade the amount of interest required to be owned by citizens of the United States shall be 75 per centum.' Subdivision (b) of the section (46 USCA  802(b) declares: 'The controlling interest in a corporation shall not be deemed to be owned by citizens of the United States (a) if the title to a majority of the stock thereof is not vested in such citizens free from any trust or fiduciary obligation in favor of any person not a citizen of the United States; or (b) if the majority of the voting power in such corporation is not vested in citizens of the United States; or (c) if through any contract or understanding it is so arranged that the majority of the voting power may be exercised, directly or indirectly, in behalf of any person who is not a citizen of the United States; or (d) if by any other means whatsoever control of the corporation is conferred upon or permitted to be exercised by any person who is not a citizen of the United States.' Under these provisions, the stock of petitioner, owned by a Vermont corporation, whose stock in turn is owned and its voting power vested in a Canadian corporation, is not 'owned by persons who are citizens of the United States.'\n It is said that the merchandise transported by petitioner's vessels is freed from the prohibition of section 27 by the proviso that it shall not apply to merchandise transported over through routes recognized by the Interstate Commerce Commission, where such routes are in part over \n\n[294 U.S. 33, 38]\n\u00a0\n Canadian rail lines. It is true that all merchandise transported on petitioner's vessels between New London and New York is transported over a part of such through routes as are exempted by the proviso. But the proviso does not speak of transportation merely over a domestic segment of a through route which elsewhere embraces Canadian rail lines. The immunity which it grants is to merchandise transported 'over' the through routes described. Even though the merchandise carried between points in New England and New York City by rail and water line might be said to be transported on a through route which embraces Canadian rail lines, it plainly is not transported over the route.\n The construction for which petitioner contends does violence to the words of the statute and would thwart its purpose. The policy declared by the enacting clause, and restated in the first section, of the Merchant Marine Act (46 USCA  861), is 'to provide for the promotion and maintenance of an American merchant marine.' The policy has found expression in the enactment of a series of statutes, beginning with the first year of the government, which have imposed restrictions of steadily increasing rigor on the transportation of freight in coastwise traffic by vessels not owned by citizens of the United States. \n1\n The Act of March 1, 1817, c. 31, 3 Stat. 351, forbade shipment in foreign vessels between ports in the United States. The Act of February 15, 1893, c. 117, 27 Stat. 455, prohibited shipment in foreign vessels from one part of the United States \n\n[294 U.S. 33, 39]\n\u00a0\n to another via a foreign port, and the Act of February 17, 1898, c. 26, 30 Stat. 248,  1 (46 USCA  290), forbade such shipments 'either directly or via a foreign port, or for any part of the voyage.' As these restrictions were thought not to include transportation that was partly by water and partly by land, see 30 Op.Attys.Gen. 3, the statute was amended by the addition in section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act (46 USCA  883) of the words 'or by land and water.' The bill for the amendment as originally introduced did not contain the proviso, which was later added in the conference committee. See Conference Report, H.R. No. 1093, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 12. The proviso has no other recorded legislative history, but its evident purpose was to avoid disturbance of established routes, recognized by the Interstate Commerce Commission as in the public interest, between the Northwestern and Eastern States through the lake ports. In these routes foreign owned water carriers participated as well as Canadian and American rail lines. See Application of Grand Trunk Ry. Co. of Canada, 43 I.C.C. 286; Rail-Lake-And-Rail Rates via Canada, 96 I.C.C. 633. The proviso obviously would enable American carriers, participating in such through routes, to retain the benefits of the traffic which in some instances might otherwise be diverted to all water transportation by foreign owned vessels between points in Canada and the United States.\n An interpretation of the proviso which would enable foreign owned vessels to carry merchandise in coastwise traffic, over routes wholly within the United States, by the expedient of filing tariffs showing participation in through routes extending over Canadian railways, would go beyond its purpose and in large measure defeat the prohibition of section 27. Both the words of the statute and the unmistakable policy of Congress compel the conclusion that the merchandise respondent has seized, and threatens to seize, is not within the immunity of the proviso. \n\n[294 U.S. 33, 40]\n\u00a0\n 2. The argument that section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act does not apply, because petitioner is under the paramount jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, is based on the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended, which provide (section 1, par. (1)(a), 41 Stat. 474, 49 USCA  1(1) (a) that the act shall apply to 'the transportation of passengers or property ... partly by railroad and partly by water when both are used under a common control, management, or arrangement for a continuous carriage or shipment,' and which authorize ( section 6(13)(b), 37 Stat. 568, 49 USCA  6(13)(b) the Commission to establish through routes and maximum joint rates over such rail and water lines and to determine the 'terms and conditions under which such lines shall be operated in the handling of the traffic embraced.' But these and other sections of the Interstate Commerce Act, c. 104, 27 Stat. 379, defining generally the Commission's authority, which by section 1, par. (1)( a), is extended over such water carriers, are not concerned with the subject-matter of section 27, and do not conflict with it. The application of its prohibition in terms to any part of the transportation 'by land and water,' by a foreign owned vessel, is not to be erased from the statute because the Interstate Commerce Commission was not given authority to enforce it. It is not to be supposed that Congress, by giving jurisdiction to the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish through routes and maximum joint rates for rail and water lines, intended to remove from them an unrelated prohibition enacted March 1, 1817, 3 Stat. 351, repeatedly re- enacted, and specifically made applicable in section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act (46 USCA  883) to the transportation of merchandise by foreign vessels in coastwise traffic 'by water, or by land and water.' We know of no principle of statutory construction which would admit of such a result.\n\n 3. \nPetitioner, in challenging the constitutionality of the statute, does not deny the power of Congress to exclude \n\n[294 U.S. 33, 41]\n\u00a0\n from coastwise traffic vessels which are foreign owned or controlled, regardless of the corporate form which that control may take. But it points to the loss of its business which will ensue if section 27 is applied to it, and to the fact that it established its business with the same corporate relationships which were only later defined so as to bring them within the prohibition re-enacted in section 27. Section 38 of the Merchant Marine Act (46 USCA  802), amending section 2 of the Shipping Act of 1916, c. 451, 39 Stat. 728, 729, and made applicable to the Merchant Marine Act by section 37 of the latter act (46 USCA  888). It insists that the prohibition of section 27, to which it was subjected by the amendment, deprives it of property without due process of law, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n This contention is answered by the numerous cases in which this Court has upheld regulations of interstate commerce which have compelled the rail carriers to discontinue parts of their business which had previously been lawful. New York, New Haven & Hartford R.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n200 \nU.S. 361\n, 26 S.Ct. 272; United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 415\n, 416 S., 29 S.Ct. 527; Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R.R. v. United States, \n231 \nU.S. 363, 369\n, 370 S., 34 S.Ct. 65; Assigned Car Cases, \n274 \nU.S. 564, 575\n, 47 S.Ct. 727. There has been no taking of petitioner's property. It established its business under foreign domination, subject to the power of Congress to regulate it, and in the face of a long- established national policy to restrict such foreign control of coastwise shipping. The amendment of the statute, so as to include within its prohibition the particular form of foreign control to which petitioner was subject, was no more arbitrary, burdensome, or unreasonable than that involved in the statutes prohibiting transportation by a railroad of its own commodities. See United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., supra, page 415 of 213 U.S., 29 S.Ct. 527; Delaware, Lackawanna & Western R.R. Co. v.

Oberlin, of Cleveland, Ohio, for petitioner.\n Mr. Dean S. Edmonds, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Brandtjen & Kluge, Inc., brought this suit in the District Court for Eastern New York against Joseph Freeman, Inc. The bill alleges that plaintiff is the owner of \n\n[296 U.S. 53, 55]\n\u00a0\n patent No. 1,363,200 for 'Improvements in Automatic Feed and Delivery for Platen Presses,' that defendant is using an infringing printing press, and prays injunction and accounting. Before answer by defendant, the Chandler & Price Company applied to the court for leave to intervene as a party defendant. The substance of the facts it alleges in order to show that it has an interest in the litigation (Equity Rule 37, 28 USCA following section 723) is as follows: Petitioner is engaged in manufacturing and selling printing presses. It made and sold to defendant the one of which the bill complains, and intends openly to defend this suit. After it put its machine upon the market, plaintiff threatened to sue users for infringement, and as a consequence petitioner's customers required it to give bonds for their protection. Before bringing this suit, plaintiff's counsel wrote defendant inclosing a copy of plaintiff's patent and asked defendant to respect their client's rights. That letter having been referred to petitioner, its counsel inquired of plaintiff's counsel whether suit would be brought against defendant (a user of one press) in the Eastern District of New York rather than directly against petitioner ( a manufacturer and seller) in the Northern District of Ohio. Plaintiff's counsel answered that decision to sue defendant in the New York district had been reached and promised to serve a copy of the bill upon petitioner's counsel. Shortly after commencement of suit that was done. Plaintiff's threats to bring infringement suits against users injured petitioner's business and unnecessarily harassed its customers. Although long before commencement of the suit its device had been shown to plaintiff's counsel and plaintiff knew that it was being sold throughout the United States, plaintiff did not sue petitioner. Defendant has not sufficient interest in the result of the litigation to defend this suit on its own account. Petitioner's intervention is necessary for the protection of its interest. \n\n[296 U.S. 53, 56]\n\u00a0\n Contrary to the better practice, the application for intervention did not present a proposed answer. Cf. Toler v. East Tennessee, V. & G. Ry. Co . (C.C.) 67 F. 168, 174; Stallings v. Conn (C.C.A.) 74 F.(2d) 189, 191. It did not suggest that, independently of defendant or otherwise, petitioner sought opportunity in this suit to enforce a claim for patent infringement against the plaintiff. After hearing, the court granted the leave applied for. Thereupon, the defendant and intervener filed an answer in which jointly they deny infringement and assert invalidity of plaintiff's patent. And in the same answer the intervener separately sets up a counterclaim against the plaintiff for infringement of patent No. 1,849,314 for 'Improvements in Sheet Transferring Mechanism for Printing Presses' owned solely by it, and prays decree against plaintiff for injunction and accounting. Maintaining that it states a cause of action to which the original defendant is a stranger, plaintiff moved to dismiss the intervener's counterclaim. The District Court granted the motion. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. Brandtjen & Kluge, Inc., v. Joseph Freeman, Inc., 75 F.(2d) 472.\n The order granting intervention is not here challenged. The sole question is whether intervener may bring into this suit a controversy between it and plaintiff in which defendant has no interest.\n Intervener insists that it, rather than the defendant sued, is the real party in interest, and that its counterclaim should be permitted so that the entire controversy between the real parties may be settled in a single suit. But intervener's legal position in relation to the case differs essentially from what it would have been had the bill named it as a defendant and alleged a cause of action against it in the infringement suit. Undoubtedly, in such a case the petitioner, whether or not suable in that district (section 48, Judicial Code, 28 USCA  109), would have had the right to enter its appearance and make its defense, and also to set up counterclaim against plaintiff. Leman v. Krentler- \n\n[296 U.S. 53, 57]\n\u00a0\n Arnold Hinge Last Co., \n284 \nU.S. 448, 451\n, 52 S.Ct. 238; General Elec. Co. v. Marvel Rare Metals Co., \n287 \nU.S. 430, 435\n, 53 S.Ct. 202. Here plaintiff's alleged cause of action is use by the defendant of a single machine alleged to infringe patent No. 1,363,200 belonging to plaintiff. Defendant has no interest in patent No. 1,849,314 owned by intervener and made the basis of the counterclaim in question. The bill neither alleges any cause of action nor prays judgment against the intervener. Petitioner was not sued, and, until granted leave to intervene, it was a stranger to the suit. The facts alleged in its application were not sufficient to show that as a matter of equitable right petitioner is entitled to intervene. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. United States & M.T. Co. (C.C.A.) 221 F. 545, 552; United States Trust Co. of New York v. Chicago Terminal T.R. Co. (C.C.A.) 188 F. 292, 296; Toler v. East Tennessee, V. & G. Ry. Co., supra (C.C.) 67 F. 168, 171, 172; Chester v. Life Ass'n of America (C.C.) 4 F. 487, 491. The showing presents a situation familiar in patent infringement cases brought against a user where the maker of the accused article is upon its application and in the discretion of the court permitted to intervene.

Anaconda Wire & Cable Co. (D.C.) 48 F.(2d) 612, 613. The record discloses no foundation for the claim that the defendant sued is not, or that the intervener is, the real defendant in interest.\n There is no suggestion that defendant has any interest in the counterclaim or that the issues between intervener and plaintiff that are tendered by, or that might possibly arise out of, the counterclaim may not be adjudged in a separate suit. The intervener was not entitled to come into the suit for the purpose of having adjudicated a con- \n\n[296 U.S. 53, 58]\n\u00a0\n troversy solely between it and plaintiff. Issues tendered by or arising out of plaintiff's bill may not by the intervener be so enlarged. It is limited to the field of litigation open to the original parties. Curran v. St. Charles Car Co. supra (C.C.) 32 F. 835, 837; Powell v. Leicester Mills ( C.C.) 92 F. 115; Atlas Underwear Co. v. Cooper Underwear Co. (D.C.) 210 F. 347, 355; Leaver v. K. & L. Box & Lumber Co.

Darby Petroleum Corporation (D.C.) 5 F.Supp. 445, 446. The decisions of the District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals in United States Expansion Bolt Co. v. H. G. Kroncke H. Co., 216 F. 186; Id., 234 F. 868, are disapproved to the extent, if at all, that they tend to support intervener's contention that it is entitled to set up the counterclaim.\n The intervener invokes Equity Rule 30 (28 USCA following section 723) and insists that counterclaims there referred to are not restricted to those required or permitted to be set up by a defendant sued in contradistinction to an intervener as party defendant under rule 37 (28 USCA following section 723). And it further insists that, by virtue of the leave to intervene and in view of the answer interposed, it is a defendant within the meaning of rule 30. That rule declares: 'The defendant by his answer shall set out ... his defense to each claim asserted in the bill . ... The answer must state ... any counterclaim arising out of the transaction which is the subject-matter of the suit, and may, without cross-bill, set up any set-off or counterclaim against the plaintiff which might be the subject of an independent suit in equity against him.' It is true, as suggested by the intervener, that this rule does not expressly make a distinction between a defendant named in the bill and one who, leave having been granted, intervenes as a party defendant. But the context makes \n\n[296 U.S. 53, 59]\n\u00a0\n against construing the word 'defendant' as used in the rule to include one permitted to intervene. See Allington v. Shevlin-Hixon Co. (D.C.) 2 F.(2d) 747, 749. The statement that defendant shall set up his 'defense to each claim asserted in the bill' is inconsistent with the construction for which the intervener here contends. Intervention necessarily is subsequent to the commencement of the suit. As shown above, this bill does not make the intervener a party or allege aught against it. It is plain that the rule does not authorize one given the privilege to intervene as party defendant to set up and enforce against the plaintiff a counterclaim not available to the original defendant and in which it had no interest. Construction of the rule that denies intervener the right to set up the counterclaim in question is supported by Equity Rule 37 (28 USCA following section 723), which declares: 'Anyone claiming an interest in the litigation may at any time be permitted to assert his right by intervention.' It is essential that the applicant shall claim an interest in the matters there in controversy between the plaintiff and original defendant. The purpose for which permission to intervene may be given is that the applicant may be put in position to assert in that suit a right of his in respect of something there in dispute between the original parties. Intervener's counterclaim, involving nothing in which defendant is concerned, does not constitute the interest referred to in rule 37.\n Exclusion from the litigation of that demand is consonant with reason and in the interest of justice. Introduction by intervention of issues outside those that properly may arise between the original parties complicates the suit and is liable to impose upon plaintiff a burden having no relation to the field of the litigation opened by his bill. Leaver v. K. & L. Box & Lumber Co., supra; Gregory v. Pike (C.C.A.) 67 F. 837, 845. In the absence of language definitely requiring it, the construction of rule \n\n[296 U.S. 53, 60]\n\u00a0\n 30 for which the intervener contends cannot reasonably be sustained. The counterclaim against the plaintiff was rightly dismissed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCHESAPEAKE & O. RY. CO. v.

Northeast Kentucky Coal Bureau v. Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Co., 201 I.C.C. 165; Id., 206 I.C.C. 445. Upon the hearing by the District Court, composed of three judges, the injunction was denied and the bill of complaint dismissed, but a restraining order was entered staying the enforcement of the Commission's order pending appeal to this Court. 11 F.Supp. 588. The railway company and intervening shippers appeal from so much of the decree as denied the injunction and dismissed the bill of complaint, and the United States, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and others appeal from that part of the decree which stayed the enforcement of the Commission's order.\n This Court, upon an examination of the record, agrees with the conclusion of the District Court that the order in question was sustained by findings of the Commission acting within its statutory authority and that these findings were adequately supported by evidence.

WILLIARD(1935)\nNo. 361\nArgued: January 11, 1935Decided: February 4, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edmond M. Cook and Reuel B. Cook, both of Davenport, Iowa, for petitioner.\n Mr. H. Leonard De Kalb, of Lewistown, Mont., for respondent. \n\n[294 U.S. 211, 212]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n What is before us is another chapter of a controversy that was here at the last term. Clark v. Williard, \n292 \nU.S. 112\n, 54 S.Ct. 615\n\n\n The controversy is the outcome of conflicting claims to the Montana assets of an Iowa corporation. On the one side is the petitioner, the insurance commissioner of Iowa, claiming as official liquidator. On the other side are the respondents, judgment creditors of the corporation, armed with an execution which they insist upon the right to levy. If the petitioner prevails, there is equal distribution; if the respondents prevail, the race is to the swift.\n When the case was here before, the Supreme Court of Montana had given priority to the judgment creditors, placing its ruling upon the ground that the petitioner, the foreign liquidator, was not a successor to the corporation, but a chancery receiver, with a title, if any, created by the Iowa decree. Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co., 94 Mont. 508, 23 P.(2d) 959. We held that under the statutes of Iowa the liquidator was the successor to the corporation, and not a mere custodian, and that in ruling to the contrary the Supreme Court of Montana had denied full faith and credit to the statutes of a sister state. \n292 \nU.S. 112, 121\n, 54 S.Ct. 615. The question was then an open one whether there was any local policy, expressed in statute or decision, whereby the title of a statutory successor was to be subordinated to later executions at the suit of local creditors. As to that question, the Supreme Court of Montana would speak the final word. \n292 \nU.S. 112, 123\n, 54 S.Ct. 615. The decree was accordingly \n\n[294 U.S. 211, 213]\n\u00a0\n vacated and the cause remitted to the state court to the end that the local policy might be made known through the one voice that could declare it with ultimate authority.\n The Supreme Court of Montana has reconsidered the conflicting claims of liquidator and creditors in the light of that decision. It has held ( the Chief Justice and an Associate Justice dissenting) that the local policy of the state permits attachments and executions against insolvent corporations, foreign and domestic; that the writs will not be halted though the effect of the levy may be waste or inequality; and that this rule will prevail against a statutory successor, clothed with title to the assets, just as much as against the corporation itself or the trustees upon dissolution or a chancery receiver. Mieyr v. Federal Surety Co. (Mont .) 34 P.(2d) 982. A writ of certiorari brings the case to us again.\n Every state has jurisdiction to determine for itself the liability of property within its territorial limits to seizure and sale under the process of its courts. Green v. Van Buskirk, 5 Wall. 307, 312; Id., 7 Wall. 139; Hervey v. Rhode Island Locomotive Works, \n93 U.S. 664\n, 671; Security Trust Co. v. Dodd, Mead & Co., \n173 \nU.S. 624, 628\n, 19 S.Ct. 545. Montana does not challenge the standing of this foreign liquidator as successor to the dissolved corporation or as owner of its assets. On the contrary, his standing and ownership are now explicitly conceded. All that Montana does by the decree under review is to impose upon such ownership the lien of judgments and executions in conformity with local law. In this there is no denial to the statutes of Iowa or to its judicial proceedings of the faith and credit owing to them under the Constitution of the United States. United States Constitution, article 4,  1.\n If the corporation were still in being, and still the owner of the assets, its ownership would be subordinate \n\n[294 U.S. 211, 214]\n\u00a0\n to the process of the local courts. So much would be conceded everywhere. If title had been conveyed to an assignee for the benefit of creditors by a common-law assignment or by insolvency proceedings, claimants in Montana might pursue their suits and remedies in derogation of the assignment when the law or policy of the locality ordained that this result should follow. So much, again, is settled by unimpeachable authority. Security Trust Co. v. Dodd, Mead & Co., supra; The Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, \n208 \nU.S. 570, 579\n, 580 S., 28 S.Ct. 337; Cole v.

W. 655, 79 Am.St.Rep. 486. The principle of these decisions applies with undiminished force to a statutory successor. In respect of his subjection to the power of the local law, his position is no better than that of the dissolved corporation to whose title he has succeeded or of its voluntary assignee upon a trust for all the creditors. He must submit, as must they, to the mandate of the sovereignty that has the physical control of what he would reduce to his possession. Cf. The Disconto Gesellschaft v. Umbreit, supra; City Bank Farmers Trust Co. v. Schnader, \n293 \nU.S. 112\n, 55 S.Ct. 29; Cooper v. Philadelphia Worsted Co., 68 N.J.Eq. 622, at page 629, 60 A. 352.\n This is not to say that any uniform policy prevails among the states when liquidators and creditors thus compete with one another. The diversity of practice was pointed out, with citation of the precedents, when the case was here before. \n292 U.S. 112\n, at page 122, 54 S.Ct. 615. Some states prefer a rule of equal distribution and compel the local suitor to yield to the statutory successor (Martyne v. American Union Fire Ins. Co., 216 N.Y. 183, 110 N.E. 502), though at times with precautionary conditions \n\n[294 U.S. 211, 215]\n\u00a0\n (\n292 U.S. 112\n, at page 129, 54 S.Ct. 615; People v. Granite State Provident Association, 161 N.Y. 492, 55 N.E. 1053). Other states give the local creditor a free hand, with the result that he may seize what he can find, though the assets of the debtor are dismembered in the process. Lackmann v. Supreme Council, 142 Cal. 22, 75 P. 583; Shloss v. Surety Co., 149 Iowa, 382, 128 N.W. 384; Zacher v. Fidelity Trust & Safety- Vault Co., 109 Ky. 441, 59 S.W. 493. Choice is uncontrolled, as between one policy and the other, so far as the Constitution of the Nation has any voice upon the subject. Iowa may say that one who is a liquidator with title, appointed by her statutes, shall be so recognized in Montana with whatever rights and privileges accompany such recognition according to Montana law. For failure to give adherence to that principle, we reversed and remanded when the case was last before us. Iowa may not say, however, that a liquidator with title who goes into Montana may set at naught Montana law as to the distribution of Montana assets, and carry over into another state the rule of distribution prescribed by the statutes of the domicile.\n Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann. Cas. 1913D, 1292, holds nothing to the contrary. A statutory liquidator of a Minnesota corporation brought suit in Wisconsin against defendants there residing to enforce their personal liability as stockholders in accordance with a Minnesota statute. The only question was whether the liquidator so appointed had capacity to sue. In the view of the court capacity and title were established by the laws of Minnesota. United States Constitution, article 4,  1. The ruling did not affect the power of Wisconsin to subject the proceeds of the cause of action or any other assets to the claims of local creditors. Nothing in the case suggests that creditors of the Minnesota corporation were suing in Wisconsin or that there was threat of suit thereafter. The problem now here was left untouched and unconsidered. \n\n[294 U.S. 211, 216]\n\u00a0\n The petitioner makes a point that the property or part of it subjected to the levy was not of such a nature as to have a situs in Montana or to be amenable to process issuing from her courts. No such point was made in the record of the proceedings in the court below. No such point was made in this court in the petition for certiorari to bring the case here for review. It will not be considered now. Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 98\n, 50 S.Ct. 231; Zellerbach Paper Co. v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 172, 182\n, 55 S.Ct. 127; Helvering v.

STATE OF ALABAMA EX REL. STATE DOCKS(1935)\nNo. 43\nArgued: November 15, 1935Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 261, 262]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Roscoe H. Hupper, of New York City, and Alexis T. Gresham, of Mobile, Ala., for appellant.\n Mr. S. Palmer Gaillard, Jr., of Mobile, Ala., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on appeal under section 237(a) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  344(a), 28 USCA  344(a), from a judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama, 229 Ala. 624, 159 So. 53, which affirmed a money judgment of the circuit court of Mobile county for the recovery of 'harbor fees' from appellant.\n Appellee, the State Docks Commission, is a state agency authorized to conduct 'the operation of all harbors and seaports within the State' and to 'adopt rules not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act for the purpose of regulating, controlling and conducting the said operation' and with power 'to fix from time to time reasonable rates of charges for all services and for the use of all improvements and facilities provided under the authority \n\n[296 U.S. 261, 263]\n\u00a0\n of this Act.' No. 303, Alabama Gen. Acts of 1923, p. 330; No. 1, Ala. Gen. Acts of 1927, pp. 1, 8, 12, 13.\n By resolution of March 5, 1924, appellee adopted rules and regulations for the Port of Mobile, for the control, under the direction of a 'chief wharfinger' or harbor master, of the movement, disposition, and anchorage of vessels passing in and out of and using the port. By resolution of February 11, 1928, these rules were readopted and a new rule was added prohibiting the discharge of fuel oil into the harbor by vessels and manufacturing plants. The rules also established a schedule of 'harbor fees,' for mooring and shifting vessels in the harbor, and for all vessels of specified classes entering the harbor, including a fee of $7,50 for vessels '500 tons and over.' Appellants operate vessels of more than 500 tons in the coastwise trade between New York and Mobile, and the present suit was brought by appellee to recover fees incurred by reason of the call of appellant's vessels at Mobile.\n The authority of appellee, under the laws and Constitution of the state, to adopt the harbor rules and schedule of fees is not questioned, and the reasonableness of the $7.50 fee is conceded. But appellant insists that its imposition is prohibited by article 1,  10, cl. 3, of the Constitution, which provides that 'no State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage,' and that it is a burden on interstate commerce forbidden by the commerce clause (Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 3).\n The Supreme Court of Alabama found that the contested fee was a charge made for the policing of the harbor under the rules adopted by the appellee to insure the safety of vessels and the dispatch of shipping within the port, by regulating the speed of vessels, their movement and anchorage, and by providing for their protection from danger of fire occasioned by the uncontrolled discharge of oil into the harbor. \n\n[296 U.S. 261, 264]\n\u00a0\n The record amply supports this conclusion. Appellee's resolution adopting the harbor fees declared that they were 'for the purpose of meeting the expense attendant upon the supervision of the port and the execution of the regulations and providing for the proper accommodation of vessels at this port.' The rules are plainly devised to insure the safety of vessels and to facilitate their use of the harbor. They regulate, within the harbor, the disposition of the rigging of sailing ships, the speed and mooring of vessels, the selection and change of their anchorage, their loading and unloading, and the use of lighters, barges, and rafts. They require the arrival of all vessels at the port to be reported to the chief wharfinger, and charge him with 'responsibility for selecting and changing anchorages of and for the movements of vessels into and out of slips or berths, and with all other ship movements that effect a fair joint use of the facilities of the port.' The evidence shows that ship movements within the port are carried on under his active supervision and control.\n The $7.50 fee is conceded not to be a charge for the use of the state docks or for mooring and shifting vessels, for which specific charges are levied. It is the only fee attributable to the general service rendered by the commission in securing the benefits and protection of the rules to shipping in the harbor. We accept the conclusion of the state court that it is charged for a policing service rendered by the state in the aid of the safe and efficient use of its port, and we address ourselves to the question whether such a fee is forbidden by the Constitution either because it is a 'duty of tonnage' or an unwarranted burden on interstate commerce.\n\n 1. \nIt seems clear that the prohibition against the imposition of any duty of tonnage was due to the desire of the framers to supplement article 1,  10, cl. 2, denying to the states power to lay duties on imports or exports, \n\n[296 U.S. 261, 265]\n\u00a0\n see Southern Steamship Co. v. Portwardens, 6 Wall. 31, 35; Keokuk Northern Line Packet Co. v. Keokuk, \n95 \nU.S. 80, 87\n, 88 S., by forbidding a corresponding tax on the privilege of access by vessels to the ports of a state, and to their doubts whether the commerce clause would accomplish that purpose. \n1\n If the states had been left free to tax the privilege of access by vessels to their harbors the prohibition against duties on imports and exports could have been nullified by taxing the vessels transporting the merchandise. At the time of the adoption of the Constitution 'tonnage' was a well-understood commercial term signifying in America the internal cubic capacity of a vessel. See Inman Steamship Co. v. Tinker, \n94 U.S. 238\n, 243. And duties of tonnage and duties on imports were known to commerce as levies upon the privilege of access by vessels or goods to the ports or to the territorial limits of a state and were distinct from fees or charges by authority of a state for services facilitating commerce, such as pilotage, towage, charges for loading and unloading cargoes, wharfage, storage, and the like. See Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 12 How. 299, 314; Inman Steamship Co. v. Tinker, supra, \n94 U.S. 238\n, 243.\n Hence the prohibition against tonnage duties has been deemed to embrace all taxes and duties regardless of their name or form, and even though not measured by the tonnage of the vessel, which operate to impose a charge for the \n\n[296 U.S. 261, 266]\n\u00a0\n privilege of entering, trading in, or lying in a port. Southern Steamship Co. v. Portwardens, supra; State Tonnage Tax Cases, 12 Wall. 204; Cannon v. New Orleans, 20 Wall. 577; Inman Steamship Co. v. Tinker, supra. And see Huse v. Glover, \n119 \nU.S. 543, 549\n, 550 S., 7 S.Ct. 313.

Board of Health, \n118 \nU.S. 455\n, 6 S.Ct. 1114.\n Appellant places its reliance on those cases in which a tax, levied in the guise of wharfage or a charge for medical inspection, was condemned because imposed on all vessels entering a port, whether receiving the benefit of the service or not. See Southern Steamship Co. v. Portwardens, supra; Cannon v. New Orleans, supra; Peete v. Morgan, 19 Wall. 581. It argues that the present fees must similarly be condemned because imposed on all vessels entering the port, and points out that appellant has neither asked nor received any police service such as that which the state court regarded as the basis for the charge.\n But the policing of a harbor so as to insure the safety and facility of movement of vessels using it differs from wharfage or other services which benefit only the particular vessels using them. It is not any the less a service beneficial to appellant because its vessels have not been given any special assistance. The benefits which flow from the enforcement of regulations, such as the present, to protect and facilitate traffic in a busy harbor inure to all who enter it. Upon this ground, among others, a \n\n[296 U.S. 261, 267]\n\u00a0\n fee for half pilotage imposed upon vessels such as were not required to take a pilot was upheld in Cooley v. Board of Wardens, supra, 12 How. 299, 312, 313. We conclude that a reasonable charge for a service such as the present is neither within the historic meaning of the phrase 'duty of tonnage' nor the purpose of the constitutional prohibition.\n It is unnecessary to consider other types of port charges, as for dredging or other forms of harbor improvement, with respect to which different considerations may apply.\n\n 2. \nThe present fee to defray the cost of a purely local regulation of harbor traffic is not an objectionable burden on commerce. State regulations of harbor traffic, although they incidentally affect commerce, interstate or foreign, are of local concern. So long as they do not impede the free flow of commerce and are not made the subject of regulation by Congress, they are not forbidden. Willson v. Black Bird Creek Marsh Co., i Pet. 245; Gibbons v.

And charges levied by state authority to defray the cost of regulation or of facilities afforded in aid of interstate or foreign commerce have consistently been held to be permissible. Such charges were considered and upheld in Keokuk Northern Line Packet Co. v. Keokuk, supra; Morgan's Louisiana & T.R. & S.S. Co. v. Board of Health, supra; Parkersburg & O.

A similar exercise of state power is the imposition of in- \n\n[296 U.S. 261, 268]\n\u00a0\n spection or license fees incident to or in support of local regulations of interstate commerce.

Despite the assertion that such works were peculiarly necessary in the Chesapeake, the convention proved hostile to state tonnage levies. There was uncertainty whether the commerce clause would forbid such duties: Gouverneur Morris said that it would not, Madison thought that it should, Sherman argued for a concurrent power over commerce with power in the United States to control state regulations. Whereupon the clause was added in its present form. See Madison's Notes of the Convention (for Sept. 15, 1787). \n\n\n\n\n","35":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOGGIN v.

Edgerton, of Rutland, Vt., for appellee.\n\n\n[296 U.S. 404, 416]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Vermont Income and Franchise Tax Act of 1931, Public Laws of Vermont, 1933,  872 et seq. (the pertinent provisions of which are copied in the margin1), imposes \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 417]\n\u00a0\n individual income taxes as follows: First, with respect to net income derived from salaries, wages, etc., denominated by the court below class A income, at the rate of 2 per cent.; second, with respect to income received on account of the ownership or use of or interest in any interest bearing security, denominated class B income, at the rate of 4 per cent., excluding, however, from such income (a) interest re- \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 418]\n\u00a0\n ceived on account of money loaned within the state at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent. per annum, evidenced by a promissory note, mortgage, or bond for a deed bearing a like rate of interest; (b) dividends on stocks of corporations subject to taxation under sections 887, 888 of the statute. If the income taxed is derived wholly from interest- bearing securities, there is allowed, in the case of a single individual, a personal exemption of $400, and, in the case of a head of a family or of a married individual living with husband or wife, a personal exemption of $ 800. If, however, either husband or wife shall receive any income other than that derived from such securities, then the personal exemption is not allowed. A distinct and larger personal exemption is allowed in the case of net income derived from salaries, wages, etc. (Section 880); namely, $1, 000 in the case of a single individual, and $2,000 in the case of a head of a family or a married individual living with husband or wife.\n Appellant is a resident of Vermont, married, and living with his wife. During the taxable year in question, he received both class A and class B income; but his class A income, although large, was absorbed by allowable deductions, so that there was no net income from that source, and consequently nothing subject to taxation. His class B income amounted to a larger sum, part of which consisted of interest on notes, mortgages, etc., representing money loaned outside the state of Vermont at not exceeding 5 per cent. per annum, and another part from taxable dividends received from corporations other than Vermont corporations. Upon these two sums a tax was assessed against him at the rate of 4 per cent. Under the statute, he was allowed no personal exemption whatever.\n The validity of the statute under the Federal Constitution was properly challenged. The grounds of attack, so far as necessary to be stated, are as follows: (1) The act imposes a tax upon dividends earned outside the state of \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 419]\n\u00a0\n Vermont, while exempting from the tax dividends earned within the state, thereby denying petitioner the equal protection of the laws in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; (2) the act, in violation of the same clause, discriminates in favor of money loaned within the state as against money loaned outside the state; (3) the act arbitrarily denies appellant the $ 800 exemption while giving it to other persons whose situation differed from his only in that they had no income from business, and thereby denies appellant the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment; and in each of these three particulars the act abridges the privileges and immunities of appellant as a citizen of the United States in contravention of the same amendment. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The court below denied the contentions of appellant, and sustained the validity of the act in every particular. 107 Vt. 28, 175 A. 352.\n First. Does the imposition of a tax upon dividends earned outside the state, from which tax dividends earned within the state are exempt, constitute, under the Fourteenth Amendment, an allowable classification? The basis of the classification rests in the consideration that by sections 887 and 888 a tax of 2 per cent., measured by net income, is imposed upon every corporation for the privilege of exer- \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 420]\n\u00a0\n cising its franchise in the state and of doing business therein. If the entire business of the corporation be transacted within the state, the amount of the tax is fixed with regard to the entire net income. If the entire business be not so transacted, the net income is calculated with respect to that part of the business done within the state, to be allocated so as fairly and justly to reflect such net income. Dividends upon shares of corporations which are subjected to this tax are exempted from the income tax. In addition to the 2 per cent. franchise tax, all tangible corporate property lying within the state is subjected to a property tax. The evident aim of the classification, therefore, is to produce equality and not inequality; and, obviously, that aim will become effective in fact, to a greater or less extent, in the administration of the legislation.\n The theory upon which the tax is laid upon dividends realized from out-of-state business while leaving dividends realized from domestic business untaxed, is that the 2 per cent. franchise tax, especially with the property tax added, has the effect of indirectly imposing a tax burden upon the latter measurably equivalent to that imposed directly upon the former. Thus, the tendency of the plan is to avoid taxing twice what is, in effect, the same thing. And conceding the power of the state to impose double or even multiple taxation, legislation which is calculated to avoid that undesirable result certainly cannot be condemned as arbitrary. Thus far, the question is settled in favor of the validity of the tax by prior decisions of this court. Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730\n, 23 S.Ct. 401; Darnell v. Indiana, \n226 \nU.S. 390, 398\n, 33 S.Ct. 120; Travelers' Ins. Co. v. Connecticut, \n185 \nU.S. 364\n, 22 S.Ct. 673; Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122, 124\n, 125 S., 41 S.Ct. 43; Lawrence v. State Tax Comm., \n286 \nU.S. 276, 284\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 87 A.L.R. 374. True, it well may be assumed that similar franchise and property taxes are imposed upon the outside corporations by other states; but the assumption is immaterial \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 421]\n\u00a0\n to the issue here involved. It is enough that such taxes are not imposed by the state of Vermont. It was so decided in Kidd v. Alabama, supra, where Mr. Justice Holmes, speaking for the court, said (\n188 U.S. 730\n, page 732, 23 S.Ct. 401, 402): 'The state of Alabama is not bound to make its laws harmonize in principle with those of other states. If property is untaxed by its laws, then for the purpose of its laws the property is not taxed at all.' And see Bacon v. Board of State Tax Com'rs, 126 Mich. 22, 25, 26, 85 N.W. 307, 60 L.R.A. 321, 86 Am.St.Rep. 524.\n Appellant urges that the franchise tax measured by the corporation's income is at the rate of 2 per cent., while the tax on dividends is at the rate of 4 per cent.; and concludes that this results in putting a burden on dividends directly taxed twice as great as that imposed indirectly by the franchise tax. But it is obvious that, since the 4 per cent. tax is imposed only upon such part of the corporate net income as passes to the shareholders in the form of dividends, and the 2 per cent. tax is measured by the entire net income of the corporation, this conclusion is erroneous. Corporations do not, at least as a general rule, pay out their entire net income in dividends. Something is reserved for future contingencies; and it may well result that a tax of 2 per cent. measured by the entire net income of the corporation will roughly approximate the amount imposed by a 4 per cent. tax on that part of the net income paid out as dividends. There is nothing in the equality clause of the Constitution which requires that the two sums shall be mathematically equivalent. Concordia Fire Ins. Co. v. Illinois, \n292 \nU.S. 535, 547\n, 54 S.Ct. 830. In Klein v. Board of Supervisors, \n282 \nU.S. 19\n, 51 S.Ct. 15, 73 A.L.R. 679, this court sustained an act exempting corporate shares from taxation where 75 per cent. of the total property of the corporation was taxable in the state and the taxes thereon were paid. It was said that this was plainly a reasonable effort to do justice to all in view of the way other assessments were made. \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 422]\n\u00a0\n It is impossible to say from the record before us that there is a greater disproportion here than was presented in the Klein Case, or to conclude that the disproportion is so great as to stamp the classification as wholly arbitrary or capricious. Moreover, as a general thing, a corporation subject to the 2 per cent. franchise tax will pay also a tax upon property located within the state, with the effect of still further narrowing, if not altogether extinguishing, the difference.\n This court has frequently said that absolute equality in taxation cannot be obtained, and is not required under the Fourteenth Amendment. This, of course, is not to say that, because some degree of inequality from the nature of things must be permitted, gross inequality must also be allowed. The boundary between what is permissible and what is forbidden by the constitutional requirement has never been precisely fixed, and is incapable of exact delimitation. In the great variety of cases which have arisen, decisions may seem to be difficult of reconcilement; but investigation will generally cause apparent conflicts to disappear when due weight is given to material circumstances which distinguish the cases. If the evident intent and general operation of the tax legislation is to adjust the burden with a fair and reasonable degree of equality, the constitutional requirement is satisfied. We think the provision now under consideration meets this test. Cf. State Railroad Tax Cases, \n92 U.S. 575\n, 612; Tappan v. Merchants' National Bank, 19 Wall. 490, 504; Merchants' & Manufacturers' Nat. Bank v. Pennsylvania, \n167 \nU.S. 461, 464\n, 17 S.Ct. 829.\n Second. It is settled beyond the admissibility of further inquiry that the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does pot preclude the states from resorting to classification for the purposes of legislation. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412, 415\n, 40 S.Ct. 560, 561. And 'the power of the state to classify for purposes of taxation is \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 423]\n\u00a0\n of wide range and flexibility.' Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 37\n, 48 S.Ct. 423, 425. But the classification 'must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.' Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, supra; Air-Way Electric Appliance Corp. v. Day, \n266 \nU.S. 71, 85\n, 45 S.Ct. 12; Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230, 240\n, 46 S.Ct. 260, 43 A.L.R. 1224. The classification, in order to avoid the constitutional prohibition, must be founded upon pertinent and real differences, as distinguished from irrelevant and artificial ones. The test to be applied in such cases as the present one is: Does the statute arbitrarily and without genuine reason impose a burden upon one group of taxpayers from which it exempts another group, both of them occupying substantially the same relation toward the subject-matter of the legislation? 'Mere difference is not enough.'\n Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, supra; Frost v. Corporation Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 515, 522\n, 49 S.Ct. 235.\n The question depends here upon whether the income taxed and the income exempted from taxation reasonably can be assigned to different classes. As the Supreme Court of Vermont itself has pointed out, in all such cases it must appear not only that a classification has been made, but that it is one based on some reasonable ground. State v. Hoyt, 71 Vt. 59, 64-66, 42 A. 973. The decision in that case held invalid a state statute the effect of which was to impose a tax upon sales of goods manufactured in the state, while leaving sales of goods manufactured in other states free from taxation. It was held that the classification could not be based on any difference in the goods, because there was none; nor on the fact that they were made in different states, for that bore no just and proper relation to the classification, but was purely arbitrary; nor on the difference of residence of the manufacturers, for the same reason. And clearly the view of the court was that \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 424]\n\u00a0\n a like discrimination against the products of another state would have been open to the same objections.\n Let us apply these principles to the statute creating the exemption now in question. Upon the face of the statute the classification is based upon a difference having no substantial or fair relation to the object of the act, which, so far as this question is concerned, simply is to secure revenue. The statute itself suggests no other public purpose which will be served by the exemption. The language creating the exemption is: '(a) Interest received on account of money loaned within this state, at a rate of interest not exceeding five per cent per annum.' The naked and complete test afforded by the statute is that the money shall be loaned within the state. What is to be done with the money, whether it is to be invested in the state or elsewhere, indeed, whether it is to be devoted to any useful purpose, are matters having nothing to do with the imposition of the tax or the exemption therefrom. If the statute had provided that interest on account of money so loaned when invested in property having a situs within the state shall be free from the tax, a different question as to classification might be presented. In that event the actual wealth of the state would be increased, and in addition, and as a consequence, opportunity to obtain additional revenue through taxation would result. But this exempting provision, we repeat, contains neither this qualification nor any other. Its terms are positive and all-inclusive, and will be fully satisfied whenever it appears that money has been loaned within the state. The Supreme Court of Vermont has not read into the statute a qualification that loans shall be deemed to be made within the state only if their proceeds be invested in the state. Obviously, this court cannot so read the provision, for that would be to amend and not to construe it. We are unable to find in the provision any public purpose which can be subserved by \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 425]\n\u00a0\n making the taxation of income from loans dependent merely upon the adventitious circumstance as to the place of making the loan.\n It is suggested, however, that, aside from anything in the statute, money loaned within the state generally will be invested therein. But there is nothing in the record to indicate that this will result; and for aught this court can know judicially, there is no warrant for saying either that it will or will not result. All we can say is that money so loaned may be invested in Vermont, or may be invested in some other state, for example, in property having a situs in New York, or may not be invested at all. If there be circumstances which will justify the exemption of any income derived from money loaned within the state while taxing the income from that loaned outside, it is for the state Legislature to point them out and limit the exemption accordingly. To import any such circumstances into the present situation is to indulge in pure speculation. Compare Travis v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., \n252 \nU.S. 60, 81\n, 40 S.Ct. 228.\n To assume that some unnamed public interest exists, which will sustain the discrimination, does not help the matter here; because the assumption can rest only upon surmise, with nothing concrete or explicit appearing to support it or to indicate a legislative intent to relate the exemption to any public purpose or to anything else beyond the mere fact that the favored loans are effected within the state. In principle, the classification is quite as arbitrary as that dealt with by this court in Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, supra, \n277 U.S. 32\n, pages 38, 39, 48 S.Ct. 423. If the exemption had been made to depend upon the time when the loan was made, instead of upon the locality where it was made, as, for example, a tax upon all income from loans except those made on Mondays, the arbitrary and capricious nature of the classification would scarcely be doubted, although a minute inspection of the field of \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 426]\n\u00a0\n possibilities might persuade an anxious mind, bent on sustaining the tax at all events, to the view that in some far-fetched way a loan made on Monday would further some public purpose, other than that of revenue, which a loan made on another day of the week would not.\n It is said that an exemption which may have for its aim the advancement of local interests can hardly be condemned under a Constitution which for a century has known a protective tariff. Considering the suggestion categorically, a pertinent answer to it is that while the general government may, for the benefit of national interests, exact impost duties which discriminate against foreign interests, one state, even for the advancement of its own interests, is not permitted to exact taxes discriminating against goods brought from a sister state. See, for example, Welton v. State of Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n; cf. Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 U.S. 378\n, 401, et seq., 53 S.Ct. 457, 86 A.L.R. 747.\n But, assuming that the state of Vermont is benefited by the exemption, the complete answer is that appellant is a citizen of the United States; and, quite apart from the equal protection of the laws clause, the suggestion is effectively met and overcome, and the fallacy of other attempts to sustain the validity of the exemption here under review clearly demonstrated, by reference to the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. 'For all the great purposes for which the Federal government was formed,' this court has said, 'we are one people, with one common country.' Crandall v. State of Nevada, 6 Wall. 35, 48, 49. As citizens of the United States we are members of a single great community consisting of all the states united, and not of distinct communities consisting of the states severally. No citizen of the United States is an alien in any state of the Union; and the very status of national citizenship connotes equality of rights and privileges, so far as they flow from such citizenship, everywhere within the limits of the \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 427]\n\u00a0\n United States. This fact is obvious and vital, and no elaboration is required to establish it.\n Section 2 of article 4 of the Constitution contains the provision, 'The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.' The Fourteenth Amendment, section 1, provides: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States.'\n Thus, the dual character of our citizenship is made plainly apparent. That is to say, a citizen of the United States is ipso facto and at the same time a citizen of the state in which he resides. And while the Fourteenth Amendment does not create a national citizenship, it has the effect of making that citizenship 'paramount and dominant' instead of 'derivative and dependent' upon state citizenship. \n3\n 'In reviewing the subject,' Chief Justice White said, in the Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 \nU.S. 366, 377\n, 388 S., 389, 38 S.Ct. 159, 165, L.R.A. 1918C, 361, Ann.Cas. 1918B, 856: 'We have hitherto considered it as it has been argued from the point of view of the Constitution as it stood prior to the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment. But to avoid all misapprehension we briefly direct attention to that (the fourteenth) amendment for the purpose of pointing out, as has been frequently done in the past, how completely it broadened the national scope of the government under the Constitution by causing citizenship of the United States to be paramount and dominant instead of being subordinate \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 428]\n\u00a0\n and derivative, and therefore operating as it does upon all the powers conferred by the Constitution leaves no possible support for the contentions made if their want of merit was otherwise not to clearly made manifest.'\n The result is that whatever latitude may be thought to exist in respect of state power under the Fourth Article, a state cannot, under the Fourteenth Amendment, abridge the privileges of a citizen of the United States, albeit he is at the same time a resident of the state which undertakes to do so. This is pointed out by Mr. Justice Bradley in the Slaughter House Case, Fed.Cas. No. 8,408, 1 Woods, 21, 28:\n'The 'privileges and immunities' secured by the original constitution, were only such as each state gave to its own citizens. Each was prohibited from discriminating in favor of its own citizens, and against the citizens of other states.\n\n'But the fourteenth amendment prohibits any state from abridging the privileges or immunities of the citizens of the United States, whether its own citizens or any others. It not merely requires equality of privileges; but it demands that the privileges and immunities of all citizens shall be absolutely unabridged, unimpaired.'\n\n The same distinction is made by this court in Bradwell v. State of Illinois, 16 Wall. 130, 138, where, speaking of the privileges and immunities provision of the Fourth Article, it was said: 'The protection designed by that clause, as has been repeatedly held, has no application to a citizen of the State whose laws are complained of. If the plaintiff was a citizen of the State of Illinois, that provision of the Constitution gave her no protection against its courts or its legislation.' \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[296 U.S. 404, 429]\n\u00a0\n But the court added that with respect to the Fourteenth Amendment 'there are certain privileges and immunities which belong to a citizen of the United States as such; otherwise it would be nonsense for the fourteenth amendment to prohibit a State from abridging them. ... We agree ... that there are privileges and immunities belonging to citizens of the United States, in that relation and character, and that it is these and these alone which a State is forbidden to abridge.' The governments of the United States and of each of the several states are distinct from one another. The rights of a citizen under one may be quite different from those which he has under the other. To each he owes an allegiance; and, in turn, he is entitled to the protection of each in respect of such rights as fall within its jurisdiction. United States v. Cruikshank, \n92 U.S. 542\n, 549.\n Under the Fourteenth Amendment, therefore, the simple inquiry is whether the privilege claimed is one which arises in virtue of national citizenship. If the privilege be of that character, no state can abridge it. No attempt has been made by the courts comprehensively to define or enumerate the privileges and immunities which the Fourteenth Amendment thus protects. \n5\n Among those privileges, however, undoubtedly is the right to pass freely from one state to another. Crandall v. State of Nevada, supra; Williams v. Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 270, 274\n, 21 S.Ct. 128. And that privilege, obviously, is as immune from abridgment by the state from which the citizen departs as it is from abridgment by the state which he seeks to enter. This results from the essential character of national citizenship. Cf. In re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 448\n, 10 S.Ct. 930; Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 14 S.Ct. 570; In re Quarles and Butler, \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 430]\n\u00a0\n \n158 \nU.S. 532, 536\n, 15 S.Ct. 959; United States v. Cruikshank, supra, \n92 U.S. 542\n, at page 552.\n In the Crandall Case, while the court at least gravely doubted whether a capitation tax imposed by the state of Nevada upon persons leaving the state by railroad or stagecoach violated the commerce clause ( 6 Wall. 35, page 43), it was distinctly held that the tax did affect the rights of citizens under the federal government so as to invalidate the act imposing the tax. The doubt as to the first point has been resolved in later cases against the power of the state (Helson and Randolph v. Kentucky, \n279 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, 49 S.Ct. 279); but the ruling on the second point has never been doubted, and was definitely approved in the Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36, 79, and the right described in the Crandall Case placed among the partially enumerated privileges and immunities 'which owe their existence to the Federal government, its National character, its Constitution, or its laws.' The opinions in both cases were delivered by the same eminent justice; and it is not without significance that while the first opinion was delivered before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the second one was delivered afterwards and with direct reference to the privileges and immunities clause of that amendment. The fact that we have since decided, and should now hold, that the Nevada act was in violation of the commerce clause, in no way detracts from the view that it also violates the privileges and immunities clause; but simply demonstrates that the same act of state legislation may contravene more than one provision of the Federal Constitution.\n The right of a citizen of the United States to engage in business, to transact any lawful business, or to make a lawful loan of money in any state other than that in which the citizen resides is a privilege equally attributable to his national citizenship. A state law prohibiting the exercise of any of these rights in another state would, \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 431]\n\u00a0\n therefore, be invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment. The imposition by one state of a discriminating tax upon a citizen resident in another state for trading in the territory of the former has been held invalid. Ward v. Maryland, 12 Wall. 418, 430. And, of course, conversely, a tax of that description is likewise void if imposed by one state upon a resident citizen of the United States for trading or doing business in the territory of another state. And such a tax is not justified because the taxing state will thereby help its domestic business.\n The purpose of the pertinent clause in the Fourth Article was to require each state to accord equality of treatment to the citizens of other states in respect of the privileges and immunities of state citizenship. It has always been so interpreted. One purpose and effect of the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, read in the light of this interpretation, was to bridge the gap left by that article so as also to safeguard citizens of the United States against any legislation of their own states having the effect of denying equality of treatment in respect of the exercise of their privileges of national citizenship in other states. A provision which thus extended and completed the shield of national protection between the citizen and hostile and discriminating state legislation cannot be lightly dismissed as a mere duplication, or of subordinate or no value, or as an almost forgotten clause of the Constitution.\n Reference has been made to numerous cases in which this court has rejected or ignored specific claims under the privileges and immunities clause; but since none of them relates to state legislation even remotely resembling the Vermont law here challenged, their collection and citation is without useful result, unless, as it seems to be thought, these numerous unsuccessful efforts to give the clause applications which fall outside its meaning show or tend to show that the clause itself has become a dead \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 432]\n\u00a0\n letter. Such a conclusion is, of course, inadmissible; for as we have already said, referring to the Bradwell Case, there are privileges and immunities which belong to a citizen of the United States as such; otherwise it would be nonsense to prohibit a state from abridging them. Some of these privileges and immunities we have already pointed out; others are enumerated in the cases cited under note 5.\n To these illustrations we may add another, which here is peculiarly pertinent. The business of insurance has grown to vast proportions. Insurance companies issuing policies are found in every state; and the activities of the larger companies overflow state lines and extend into every part of the country. But insurance is not commerce; and the right of a citizen to take out a policy in one state, insuring property in another where he resides, cannot be protected under the commerce clause. National protection, when appropriate, must be found in the Fourteenth Amendment. It well cannot be doubted that a citizen of the United States, residing and having property in Vermont, exercises a privilege of national citizenship when he negotiates and takes out in another state a policy insuring that property, or takes out in another state a policy insuring his life. There may be very cogent reasons, resting in the strength of the company, terms of the policy, and otherwise, making it desirable that he should do so. And it well cannot be doubted that legislation of one state denying the privilege or taxing the transaction when it occurs in another state, while leaving the transaction wholly free from taxation when it takes place in the former state, would abridge that privilege of citizenship. It would be no answer to say that thereby the former state was building up her local insurance companies and adding to the wealth of the state. Nor is it any answer to say that the citizen may resort to other clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment which will afford \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 433]\n\u00a0\n protection. The right of a citizen of the United States resident in one state to contract in another may be a liberty safeguarded by the due process of law clause, and at the same time, none the less, a privilege protected by the privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It such case he may invoke either or both. This seems to be recognized in Allgeyer v. Louisiana, \n165 U.S. 578\n, 589-592, 17 S.Ct. 427, where the court evidently thought that under circumstances not unlike those just suggested the words 'liberty' and 'privilege' were interchangeable terms.\n It follows from what has been said that when a citizen of the United States residing in Vermont goes into New Hampshire, he does not enter foreign territory, but passes from one field into another field of the same national domain. When he trades, buys, or sells, contracts or negotiates across the state line, when he loans money, or takes out insurance in New Hampshire, whether in doing so he remains in Vermont or not, he exercises rights of national citizenship which the law of neither state can abridge without coming into conflict with the supreme authority of the Federal Constitution.\n The statute, as here applied, says that if a citizen resident in Vermont loan his money at 5 per cent. or less in another state, he must pay a tax upon the income; but if he loan money in Vermont at the same rate, no tax whatever shall be imposed. The power to tax income here asserted by Vermont is, in the final analysis, the power to tax so heavily as to preclude loans outside the state altogether. It reasonably is not open to doubt that the discriminatory tax here imposed abridges the privilege of a citizen of the United States to loan his money and make contracts with respect thereto in any part of the United States.\n The tax on dividends, already discussed and upheld, rests in a different situation. Although dividends from outside investments are taxed, and those from state in- \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 434]\n\u00a0\n vestments in terms are exempt, they are, as already appears, in substance and effect treated alike; the one by a tax falling directly upon the income of the individual stockholders, and the other falling indirectly but no less definitely upon that income, in the form of a tax which is first inposed upon the corporation as a franchise tax measured by income, but the burden of which ultimately is borne by the stockholders. The effect is the same as though the tax were imposed generally upon corporate dividends without exception or discrimination. Travelers' Ins. Co. v. Connecticut, \n185 U.S. 364\n, 369 et seq., 22 S.Ct. 673. The same would be true of the tax on income from loans, if it had been imposed in respect of all loans wherever made, or if there had been some form of equalizing tax which would have compensated for the burden cast upon loans made in other states. But such is not the case. Income from loans made outside the state is taxed directly, while income from loans made within the state is not taxed directly or in any indirect way so as to equalize the burden. Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 140, dealt with a sales tax imposed upon all sales, whether made by a citizen of the state where the tax was imposed or a citien of another state; and whether the goods sold were the product of the state enacting the law or of some other state. This court upheld the tax upon the ground that it did not discriminate against the products of other state or affect the privileges or immunities of their citizens; but the court clearly stated that if it had done so it would be an infringement of the provisions of the Constitution relating to those subjects. The principle of that case is applicable here and has the effect of sustaining the tax in respect of loans. Compare Travis v. Yale & Towne Mfg. Co., supra.\n Third. The statute, so far as it applies to appellant, provides that if the income taxed be derived wholly from ownership of or interest in interest-bearing securities, there shall be allowed an exemption of $800. If the in- \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 435]\n\u00a0\n come be derived from other enumerated sources, an exemption is allowed of $ 2,000 against the 'aggregate net income.'\n It is manifest that if the legislation had provided that where the taxpayer shall have income from both of these general sources he shall not be entitled to both exemptions, the provision would have been open to no constitutional objection. Such legislation might properly permit him, in that contingency, to select which of the exemptions he will take; or, on the other hand, might properly specify which of the two exemptions shall be accorded him. In effect, though not in terms, it is the latter alternative which the statute adopts. In terms, the statute provides that if the taxpayer receive any income other than that derived from interest- bearing securities, the personal exemption applicable to the latter class of income shall not be allowed. But the right to the $2,000 exemption allowed in respect of class A income remains unaffected. The taxpayer who receives both classes of income, while thus compelled to forego the smaller exemption, is accorded the larger one; and it is impossible reasonably to find in this situation anything arbitrary or capricious. It is true that during the taxable year in question appellant had no net income because his gross income derived from salaries, etc., amounting to about $70,000, was entirely absorbed by allowable deductions; but this was an incident of the particular year in question, and might never happen again. He failed to obtain the advantage of the exemption, not because of any hostile statutory intent or hostile enforcement of the tax, but because of the collateral circumstance, peculiar, perhaps, to him alone and to the taxable year in question, that his entire gross income was absorbed by deductions, allowed by the statute as a matter of grace as is the exemption itself, so that nothing remained from which the amount of the exemption or any part of it could be subtracted. \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 436]\n\u00a0\n The question of equal protection must be decided in respect of the general classification rather than by the chance incidence of the tax in particular instances or with respect to particular taxpayers. 'And inequalities that result not from hostile discrimination, but occasionally and incidentally in the application of a system that is not arbitrary in its classification, are not sufficient to defeat the law.' Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 543\n, 40 S.Ct. 2, 7. 'The operation of a general rule will seldom be the same for every one. If the accidents of trade lead to inequality or hardship, the consequences must be accepted as inherent in government by law instead of government by edict.' Fox v. Standard Oil Co., \n294 \nU.S. 87, 102\n, 55 S.Ct. 333, 339. Cf. Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 145\n, 44 S.Ct. 257; Gant v. Oklahoma City, \n289 \nU.S. 98, 102\n, 53 S.Ct. 530; Storassli v. Minnesota, \n283 \nU.S. 57, 62\n, 51 S.Ct. 354.\n The general classification, namely, that the right to a partial exemption from a tax upon one class of income will depend upon whether the taxpayer is in receipt of income of another class with respect to which a different exemption applies, does not seem to us to be open to the objection that it is arbitrary or capricious, simply because, like any other general rule of taxation, its administration may involve incidental instances of inequality.\n We conclude that the taxing act is valid in respect of the first and third points which we have discussed, but invalid in respect of the second.\n Reversed and remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting in part).\n I think that the exemption, from the tax, of net income from money loaned within the state at not more than 5 per cent., like the exemption of income from dividends of \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 437]\n\u00a0\n corporations earned within the state, does not deny equal protection or infringe any privilege or immunity of citizens of the United States, and that the judgment should be affirmed in its entirety. Unless the constitutional validity of the exemptions is to turn upon the ground that we approve laws enacted to avoid taxing the same economic interest twice, but disapprove those to encourage residents to invest their funds at home, it would seem that the considerations which have led to upholding the one exemption would not admit of condemning the other. See Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 127\n, 30 S.Ct. 496.\n\n 1. \nIt is not denied that the effect of both exemptions is to place a burden on income derived from sources or investments made without the state which they do not place on income derived from like sources or investments made within it. But that affords no ground for saying that either is invalid. The equal protection clause does not forbid inequalities in state taxation. A state may select the objects to be taxed, and selection, which is but the converse of exemption, involves the imposition of a tax burden on some which is not placed on others. As this Court has repeatedly held, inequalities resulting from the singling out of one particular class for taxation or exemption, regardless of the reason for the choice, or even if there is no discernible reason, are not to be pronounced invalid where there is no clear indication that the purpose or effect is a hostile or oppressive discrimination against particular persons or classes. American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89\n, 21 S.Ct. 43; Board of Education v. Illinois, \n203 \nU.S. 553\n, 27 S.Ct. 171, 8 Ann.Cas.157; Beers v. Glynn (Lord v. Glynn), \n211 \nU.S. 477\n, 29 S.Ct. 186; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, supra; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S.Ct. 192; Citizens' Telephone Co. v. Fuller, \n229 \nU.S. 322\n, 33 S.Ct. 833; Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., \n260 \nU.S. 245\n, 43 S.Ct. 83; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276\n, 52 S.Ct. 556, 87 A.L.R. 374; Concordia Fire Insurance Co. v. Illinois, \n292 \nU.S. 535\n, 54 S.Ct. 830. \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 438]\n\u00a0\n The end sought by the classification is of significance in passing upon the constitutionality of the tax only in so far as it serves to show that the discrimination is not invidious. If it appears or may fairly be assumed that it is for the purpose of promoting a permissible public aim, it cannot be condemned because one class must pay a tax which another does not. Where the public interest is served, one business may be left untaxed and another taxed, in order to promote the one, American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, supra;Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., supra; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, \n295 \nU.S. 285\n, 55 S.Ct. 709; or to restrict or suppress the other, Maganano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40\n, 54 S.Ct. 599; Fox v. Standard Oil Co ., \n294 \nU.S. 87\n, 55 S.Ct. 333; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, supra; Singer Sewing Machine Co. v. Brickell, \n233 \nU.S. 304\n, 34 S.Ct. 493; Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 41 S.Ct. 219. But it is not necessary to go so far to support the present exemption. There is no serious contention that its purpose or effect is to suppress the lending of money without the state or to injure appellant or his fellow residents of Vermont who may prefer to invest their funds elsewhere. Nor can it be said that the exemption was not granted in furtherance of a permissible state policy, which was the legislative objective rather than an invidious discrimination against appellant and others similarly situated.\n It seems to be conceded that if the statute had placed upon the tax gatherers the burden of ascertaining whether money loaned within the state is invested in property there, and had limited the exemption to money so loaned and invested, the tax would be sustained because of the benefit which would result from the increase of wealth in the state and the enlarged opportunity to obtain additional revenue. The attack is thus narrowed to the single objection that there are exempted loans, some of which, although made within the state, are or may be withdrawn and used elsewhere. It is assumed that money thus loaned \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 439]\n\u00a0\n and withdrawn can be of no possible benefit to the state, and it is declared that since transactions may occur the Court cannot determine whether the exemption will have any beneficent effect and that it is therefore invalid.\n But there are benefits other than the increase of its taxable wealth which a state is at liberty to stimulate by its taxing policy, and exemptions have been sustained on the broader ground that they foster some form of domestic industry. People of State of New York ex rel. Parke, Davis & Co. v. Roberts, \n171 \nU.S. 658\n, 19 S.Ct. 70; Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra; Fox v. Standard Oil Co., supra; Aero Mayflower Transit Co. v. Georgia Public Service Commission, supra. If Vermont chooses to encourage, by tax exemption, loans at favorable rates of interest within the state, because it believes that local interests will be benefited, it can hardly be said for that reason to be contravening a Constitution that has known a protective tariff for more than 100 years. See Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products Co. v. Smith, supra, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 41 S.Ct. 219; Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 347\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, L.R.A. 1917A, 421, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 455. It is true that a state may not lay taxes on imports or burden interstate commerce, Welton v. Missouri, \n91 U.S. 275\n, but it is too late for this Court to declare that a state may not favor domestic interests by granting exemptions in the exercise of its taxing power.\n It is not for us to say that the Vermont Legislature was unmindful of these broader advantages, or to declare that the presence within the state of investment funds offered at 5 per cent. or less to borrowers there, including those who are carrying on the business and industry of the state, is not beneficial; or that if any loans made within the state are used elsewhere they are or ever would be more than negligible in amount; or if they were that they could not have a favorable effect on interest rates within the state, which is a matter of state concern. When the Vermont Legislature adopted the present exemption, it had before it the reports of two committees specially appointed to inves- \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 440]\n\u00a0\n tigate the tax system of the state, which clearly indicate their judgment, based on a study of conditions in the state, that the existing system was driving investment capital from the state or into secured and non- commercial loans, and that a tax exemption embracing both secured and commercial loans would tend to increase the supply of investment capital for both and to reduce interest rates in the state. \n1\n This Court has no basis for saying that those committees were wrong and no authority to say it. The state Supreme Court has stated in the present case that the Legislature did have in mind these broader advantages, for it rested its decision on the ground that the exemption was made 'in the interests of thrift and state development' and 'for the assistance of the agricultural and industrial interests of the state.' 107 Vt. 28, 175 A, 352, 357.\n If, in the face of so much which is persuasive of the legistimate purpose and effect of this legislation, we are to declare that we cannot say whether the benefits intended either will or will not result, it does not follow that the Vermont Legislature is similarly uninformed. We must assume that it is not, unless we are to discard the salutary principle of decision, that, out of a decent respect to an independent branch of the government, legislative acts must be taken to be based on facts which support their constitutional validity unless the contrary reasonably ap- \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 441]\n\u00a0\n pears. This Court, it is true, has held discriminations invalid where, upon the facts disclosed by the record or within the range of judicial notice, it has felt able to say that there could be no state of facts which could rationally support them. Royster Guano Co. v. Virginia, \n253 \nU.S. 412\n, 40 S.Ct. 560; Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S. Ct. 358; Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v.

But in no case has it rendered such a judgment where it has declared that it is unable to say that consequences which would justify the discrimination will not result. Erb v.

Unless, as we profess not to do, Standard Oil Co. v. City of Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582\n, 49 S.Ct. 430, we are to sit as a Superlegislature, or as triers of the facts on which a Legislature is to say what shall and what shall not be taxed, we are not free to say that the exemption will not induce residents to offer to lend their funds within the state and at lower interest rates than they otherwise would, or that opportunities thus afforded will not be availed of by borrowers requiring funds for carrying on the commerce and industry of the state.\n Even if we are to assume, in the absence of any actual knowledge, that money loaned in the state at favorable \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 442]\n\u00a0\n rates would not benefit it if used elsewhere, and, further, that in fact some money is so loaned and used, there is no discernible reason why those circumstances should be deemed to invalidate the tax, and none is stated by the Court. It is irrelevant that the state, which has selected domestic loans for exemption in furtherance of a state policy, has not excluded from the exemption every transaction which conceivably might not advance its purpose. Whether the legislative object is completely achieved is of no concern to this Court, once it appears that the exemption is made for a permissible end and bears some reasonable relation to that end. Purpose or motive of the selection of the objects of taxation and exemption is material only so far as it is needful to ascertain whether the discrimination is invidious. If the choice is not condemned for that reason, it has never been held that an exemption must fail because it may benefit some who do not advance the legislative purpose. A classification for a permissible end is not to be condemned because it operates to prohibit transactions in themselves harmless, or fails to reach others which are harmful. Powell v. Pennsylvania, \n127 \nU.S. 678\n, 8 S.Ct. 992, 1257; Purity Extract & Tonic Co. v. Lynch, \n226 \nU.S. 192\n, 33 S.Ct. 44; Hebe Co. v. Shaw, \n248 \nU.S. 297\n, 39 S.Ct. 125; Jacob Ruppert v.

Walker, \n232 \nU.S. 718\n, 34 S.Ct. 479.\n All taxes must of necessity be levied by general rules capable of practical administration. In drawing the line between the taxed and the untaxed, the equal protection clause does not command the impossible or the impractical. Unless the line which the state draws is so wide of the mark as palpably to have no reasonable relation to the legitimate end, it is not for the judicial power to reject it and say that another must be substituted.

State Tax Commission, \n278 \nU.S. 484\n, 49 S.Ct. 192; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann.Cas. 561; Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, supra; supra; Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533.\n As the purpose of the exemption appears to be to encourage the lending of money within Vermont by its residents, at low rates of interest, and as it appears reasonably calculated to have that effect, and as we cannot say that such loans will not be of benefit to the state by tending to establish the interest rate at 5 per cent. or less, and by stimulating loans to borrowers for the purpose of carrying on business and industry within the state, the conclusion seems inescapable that the equal protection clause does not forbid it.\n\n 2. \nFeeble indeed is an attack on a statute as denying equal protection which can gain any support from the almost forgotten privileges and immunities clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The notion that that clause could have application to any but the privileges and immunities peculiar to citizenship of the United States, as distinguished from those of citizens of states, has long since been rejected. Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36. It created no new privileges and immunities of United States citizenship, Bartemeyer v. Iowa, 18 Wall. 129, 133, and as they are derived exclusively from the Constitution and laws enacted under it, the states were powerless to abridge them before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment as well as after. See Crandall v. Nevada, 6 Wall. 35.\n Before the amendment the privilege of passing from state to state for the purpose of approaching the seat of the national government, of transacting business with it, and of gaining access to its courts, its public offices, and its ports, was declared in Crandall v. Nevada, supra, 6 Wall. 35, 44, to be a right of national citizenship which could be exercised independently of the will of the state. Upon this \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 444]\n\u00a0\n ground was placed he decision in that case that a state capitation tax on passengers transported out of the state by railroad or stagecoach infringed the Constitution. No one could doubt that if the decision had been made at any time after Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Co. v. Maryland, 21 Wall. 456, 472 (1874), and until the present moment, it would have been rested on the commerce clause. This Court has many times pointed out that movements of persons across state boundaries are a part of interestate commerce, subject to the regulation and entitled to the protection of the national government under the commerce clause. Caminetti v. United States, \n242 \nU.S. 470\n, 37 S.Ct. 192, L.R.A. 1917F, 502, Ann.Cas. 1917B, 1168; Hoke v. United States, \n227 \nU.S. 308\n, 33 S.Ct. 281, 43 L.R.A.

And it has specifically pointed out that Crandall v. Nevada, supra, is overruled so far as it referred the protection of such commerce to the privileges and immunities clause rather than to the commerce clause. Helson and Randolph v. Kentucky, \n279 \nU.S. 245, 251\n, 49 S.Ct. 279.\n The privileges and immunities clause has consistently been construed as protecting only interests, growing out of the relationship between the citizen and the national government, created by the Constitution and federal laws. Re Kemmler, \n136 \nU.S. 436, 448\n, 10 S.Ct. 930; McPherson v. Blacker, \n146 \nU.S. 1, 38\n, 13 S.Ct. 3; Giozza v. Tiernan, \n148 \nU.S. 657, 661\n, 13 S.Ct. 721; Duncan v. Missouri, \n152 \nU.S. 377, 382\n, 14 S.Ct. 570. Appeals to this Court to extend the clause beyond these limitations have uniformly been rejected and even those basic privileges and immunities secured against federal infringement by the first eight amendments have been held not to be protected from state action by the privileges and immunities clause. Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 U.S. 90\n; Presser v. Illinois, \n116 \nU.S. 252\n, 6 S.Ct. 580; O'Neil v. Vermont, \n144 \nU.S. 323\n, 12 S.Ct. 693; Maxwell v.

The protection and control of intercourse between the states, not carried on in pursuance of the relationship between the citizen and the national government, has been left to the interstate commerce clause, to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and to article 4,  2, guaranteeing to the citizens of each state the privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states. See Williams v. Fears, \n179 \nU.S. 270\n, 21 S.Ct. 128. In no case since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment has the privileges and immunities clause been held to afford any protection to movements of persons across state lines or other form of interstate transaction.\n The reason for this reluctance to enlarge the scope of the clause has been well understood since the decision of the Slaughter House Cases, supra. If its restraint upon state action were extended more than is needful to protect relationships between the citizen and the national government, and it did more than duplicate the protection of liberty and property secured to persons and citizens by the other provisions of the Constitution, it would enlarge judicial control of state action and multiply restrictions upon it to an extent difficult to define, but sufficient to cause serious apprehension for the rightful independence of local government. That was the issue fought out in the Slaughter House Cases, supra, with the decision against the enlargment. Since the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, at least 44 cases2 have been \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 446]\n\u00a0\n brought to this Court in which state statutes have been assailed as infringements of the privileges and immunities clause. Until today, none has held that state legislation infringed that clause.\n If its sweep were now to be broadened to include protection of every transaction across state lines, regardless of its connection with any relationship between the citizen and the national government, a step would be taken, the gravity of which might well give us concern. But it is necessary to go much further before the present tax can be condemned. If protection of the freedom of the citizen to pass from state to state were the object of our solicitude, that privilege is adequately protected by the commerce clause, even though the purpose of his going be to effect insurance or transact any other kind of business which is in itself not commerce. But protection of the citizen's freedom of movement, whether by the privileges and immunities clause or by the commerce clause, will afford appellant no relief from the present tax. The record does not show that he was ever outside the state of Vermont, and for aught that appears he acquired his extra-state investments, which are in the form of negoti- \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 447]\n\u00a0\n able corporate securities, by gift or purchase in Vermont. Nor does it appear that the physical securities or payments of income of which appellant has had the benefit have crossed state lines. He can be saved from the tax only by the extension of the immunity to his income merely because the property from which it has been derived, or the corporation paying it, is located in another state.\n Such is the contention now made; that the privilege of acquiring, owning, and receiving income from investments without the state is a privilege of federal citizenship. And the suggestion is that the privilege is infringed by taxing this income just as the commerce clause is infringed by state taxation burdening the privilege of carrying on commerce across state lines. In any case the privileges and immunities clause is said to be infringed by taxing this income at a different rate than income from investments made within the state.\n The novel application thus given to the clause, and the arguments used to support it, leave one in doubt whether it is thought to preclude all differences of taxation of the two classes of income, or only to forbid such inequality as is in some sense arbitrary and unreasonable. If the former, the clause becomes an inexhaustible source of immunities, incalculable in their benefit to taxpayers and in their harm to local government, by imposing on the states the heavy burden of an exact equality of taxation wherever transactions across state lines may be involved. If the latter, it would seem to add nothing to the guarantee of the equal protection clause, which extends to all 'persons,' including citizens of the United States. In that case, discourse upon the privileges and immunities clause would appear to be a gratuitous labor of supererogation.\n If the privilege of making investments without the state is one protected by the privileges and immunities clause \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 448]\n\u00a0\n and a tax upon the income derived from them is analogous to a tax upon the privilege of carrying on interstate commerce, we must not only accept the view that the privilege is infringed by the present tax, but it would follow that any taxation of the income is forbidden. The answer is, of course, that a state tax on net income derived from interstate commerce has never been regarded as a burden on commerce or as an infringement of the commerce clause. See United States Glue Co. v. Town of Oak Creek, \n247 \nU.S. 321\n, 38 S.Ct. 499, Ann.Cas. 1918E, 748; Shaffer v. Carter, \n252 \nU.S. 37\n, 40 S.Ct. 221; cf. Peck & Co. v. Lowe, \n247 \nU.S. 165\n, 38 S.Ct. 432; Wagner v. City of Covington, \n251 \nU.S. 95\n, 40 S.Ct. 93. Far less could it be thought that a tax on property, or income from it, is an interference with commerce because the property had at some time been, or might some time become, the subject of such commerce. Cf. Heisler v. Thomas Colliery Co., supra. In applying the privileges and immunities clause, as now interpreted, no ground is suggested, or well could be, for regarding a tax on income from investments without the state as infringing the privilege of carrying on interstate transactions, any more than a tax on net income derived from interstate commerce or from property which had at some time moved in interstate commerce infringes the commerce clause.\n The contention that a state tax indirectly affecting transactions carried on across state lines, not forbidden by the commerce clause (art. 1,  8, cl. 3) or by article 4,  2, can be condemned under the privileges and immunities clause, was definitely rejected by this Court in Williams v. Fears, supra. There a state occupation tax upon those engaged in hiring laborers for employment outside the state was held not to infringe the privileges and immunities clause or the equal protection clause.\n So far as the objection is addressed to bare inequality of taxation affecting interstate transactions, if valid, it must be accepted as compelling equality of taxation by \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 449]\n\u00a0\n the state of the citizen's residence and as well by the state into which the transaction extends. More than this, since the exercise of the privilege involves both states, it would seem to be infringed not only by an unequal tax imposed by either, but by any tax imposed at the normal rate by both.\n Starting with the dubious assumption that the protection of every movement of the citizen interstate, an acknowledged subject of the commerce clause, is independently a subject of the privileges and immunities clause, the protection afforded by the latter is expanded until it affords a refuge to the citizen from taxation which has no necessary relation to his movements interstate, and is in fact not shown to impose any restraint upon them. A tax immunity created avowedly for the protection of the citizen's privilege of movement from state to state is thus pressed far beyond the requirements of the interest put forward to justify it, and to a point which has never been thought needful or even desirable for the protection of the commerce of the nation. It is a transition effected only by ignoring the decision of this Court in Williams v. Fears, supra.\n If mere difference in taxation is made the test of infringement, the iron rule of equality of taxation which the equal protection and due process clauses have failed to impose, see Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533, is the first fruit of this expansion of the protection of the privileges and immunities clause. To gain the benefits of its shelter the citizen has only to acquire, by a transaction wholly intrastate, an investment outside his state. I can find in the language and history of the privileges and immunities clause no warrant for such a restriction upon local government and policy. Citizens of the United States are given no privilege not to pay taxes. It would seem that a subordination of state taxing power to the \n\n[296 U.S. 404, 450]\n\u00a0\n interests of the individual, of such debatable wisdom, could be justified only by a pointed command of the Constitution of plain import.\n If we turn from the reasoning by which this application of the privileges and immunities clause to state taxation is supported to the decision now actually made, it seems that the clause is thought to prohibit only these inequalities in taxation which are considered to be aribtrary and unreasonable. The exemption of dividends derived from corporate business carried on within the state, and the taxation of similar dividends from without the state, is held not to be an infringement of the clause. Exemption of income from investments in property within the state and taxation of like income from without the state is thought to be valid. But the privileges and immunities clause, it is declared, forbids any difference in the taxation of income from investment made within the state and income from investment made without, a conclusion which can only be attributed to the belief that this discrimination, as distinguished from the others, is arbitrary and unreasonable.\n We are thus returned to the point of beginning, to a discussion of the question whether the exemption in the present tax is so unreasonable, so without support of a permissible state policy, as to infringe constitutional limitations. If the exemption does not merit condemnation as a denial of the equal protection which the Fourteenth Amendment extends to every person, nothing can be added to the vehemence or effectiveness of the denunciation by invoking the command of the privileges and immunities clause.\n The judgment should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Chapter 39.\n'Sec. 873.

Basis on business within the state. If the entire business of the corporation be transacted within the state, the tax imposed shall be based upon the entire net income of such corporation for such fiscal or calendar year. If the entire business of the corporation be not transacted within the state and its gross income derived from business done both within and without the state, the determination of its net income shall be based upon the business done within the state and for the purpose of computing such net income the commissioner shall adopt such recommendations and regulations for the allocation of net income as will fairly and justly reflect the net income of that portion of the business done within the state.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The further point is made that the discrimination in respect of dividends and interest upon loans is a regulation of interstate commerce and therefore void under the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution. But we mention this latter claim only to reject it as without merit, since clearly a tax upon income is not an interference with interstate commerce simply because the income is derived from a source within another state; and, moreover, if there be any tendency to interfere with such commerce, it is purely collateral and incidental.

The bill alleged the insolvency of the association and a threatened race of diligence by its creditors to satisfy their claims from the assets of the corporation, and prayed the appointment of receivers for the corporation, the liquidation of its business and assets, and the usual injunction restraining creditors and others from interfering with or taking possession of its property. Thereupon, on the same day, and on the appearance of the defendant corporation, which interposed no objection, the District Judge appointed temporary receivers. No notice of the application was given to the corporation's creditors or other shareholders, or to the department of banking of the commonwealth. On the following day the corporation filed its answer, admitting the material allegations in the bill of complaint and joining in its prayer.\n On that day the secretary of banking informally requested the District Judge not to make the appointment of the receivers permanent and to allow the property of the defendant to be surrendered to the secretary, to be liquidated and administered in accordance with the state statutes. On March 27, 1933, the commonwealth filed its petition in the District Court, asking leave to intervene in the pending equity proceeding and for an order directing the receivers to surrender the assets \n\n[294 U.S. 176, 179]\n\u00a0\n of the defendant association to the state secretary of banking. In addition to the matters already stated, the petition alleged the further facts, which are admitted or established: That the association, organized as a building and loan association, is subject to the supervision of the state department of banking, as provided by the Banking Act of June 15, 1923, P.L. 809, as amended (7 PS Pa.  1 et seq.); that the statutes of the commonwealth afford a complete, comprehensive, and economical scheme for liquidation by the secretary of banking of such a building and loan association, when insolvent or in a financial unsound condition; that section 21 of the statute, as amended by act May 5, 1927, P.L. 765,  7 (7 PS Pa.  21), providing that the secretary, after notice and hearing, may, with the consent of the Attorney General, take possession of the business and property of a building and loan association when it appears to be in an 'unsafe or unsound condition to continue business,' specifically authorizes the secretary to take possession of the property of the association when it is 'in the hands of a receiver appointed by any court'; that upon taking such possession the secretary is required, by section 22 ( 7 PS Pa.  22), to issue and file his certificate to that effect; that, pursuant to the requirements of the statute, the secretary, after the prescribed hearing, had found the defendant insolvent and in the hands of a receiver; and that, with the consent of the Attorney General, he had on February 17, 1933, duly made and filed his certificate, 'taking possession' of the property and appointing a special deputy as agent to assist in liquidating the defendant's business and property.\n The District Court denied the petition of the commonwealth, and later appointed the temporary receivers, with another, as permanent receivers, who are respondents here. It treated the case as though it were one of the rival claims of a state and a federal court to jurisdiction over the same subject-matter and property, see Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36\n, 48 S.Ct. 268, and held that the jurisdiction of \n\n[294 U.S. 176, 180]\n\u00a0\n the District Court had attached when the bill of complaint was filed, and that it was the duty of the court, under the laws and the Constitution of the United States, to retain that jurisdiction and to proceed with the liquidation to the exclusion of the state authorities. Elson v. Mortgage Bldg. & Loan Ass'n., 4 F.Supp. 779. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed upon like grounds. Com. of Pennsylvania v. Williams, 72 F.( 2d) 509.\n The Attorney General of the commonwealth argues here, as he did in both courts below: (a) That the federal court is without jurisdiction to direct the liquidation in a suit brought against the corporation by a shareholder, since both parties are subject to, and bound by, the local law, which provides for liquidation of a domestic corporation exclusively through the agency of a state supervisory officer; and (b) that, in any event, the court in its discretion should have refused the appointment of receivers or, having appointed them, it should have granted the petition of the commonwealth and directed the receivers to surrender the property of the association to the state official.\n\n 1. \nThe statutes of the United States, as incorporated in the Judicial Code, c. 231,  24(1), 36 Stat. 1087, 1091, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 USCA  41(1), provide that District Courts shall have original jurisdiction 'of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity, ... where the matter in controversy exceeds, exclusive of interest and costs, the sum or value of $3,000, and ... is between citizens of different States.' We do not doubt that the allegations in the present bill of complaint are sufficient to establish the jurisdiction of the District Court as a federal court; that is to say, it properly invokes the power and the authority, conferred upon the District Court by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, to entertain the suit. The bill alleges diversity of citizenship and the requisite jurisdictional amount, both of which allegations stand unchallenged, see Philadelphia, Wilmington \n\n[294 U.S. 176, 181]\n\u00a0\n & Baltimore R. Co. v. Quigley, 21 How. 202, 214; Deputron v. Young, \n134 \nU.S. 241, 251\n, 10 S.Ct. 539; Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263, 271\n, 54 S.Ct. 700, and prays relief which a federal court of equity is competent to give, see Duignan v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 195, 199\n, 47 S.Ct. 566.\n Although, as will presently appear, the District Judge in the exercise of his discretion might appropriately have given notice, to the officers of the department of banking, of the application for the appointment of receivers, such notice was not prerequisite to the exercise of its jurisdiction. See Harkin v. Brundage, supra; In re Metropolitan Railway Receivership, \n208 \nU.S. 90\n, 28 S.Ct. 219. Cf. Marin v. Augedahl, \n247 \nU.S. 142\n, 38 S.Ct. 452\n\n\n The objection that the suit was brought by a shareholder of the insolvant corporation rather than by its judgment creditor, see Burnrite Coal Briquette Co. v. Riggs, \n274 \nU.S. 208\n, 47 S.Ct. 578, as well as the opposing contention that under Pennsylvania law the present shareholder has the status of a creditor, see Nice Ball Bearing Co. v. Mortgage Building & Loan Association, 310 Pa. 560, 166 A. 239, need not now be considered. Even if valid, it does not go to the jurisdiction of the District Court as a federal court, but only to the propriety of its action as a court of equity. See Smith v. McKay, \n161 \nU.S. 355, 358\n, 359 S., 16 S.Ct. 490; Blythe v. Hinckley, \n173 \nU.S. 501, 507\n, 19 S.Ct. 497; Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, \n261 \nU.S. 491, 500\n, 43 S. Ct. 454; Twist v. Prairie Oil & Gas Co., \n274 \nU.S. 684, 690\n, 47 S.Ct. 755. Unlike the objection that the court is without jurisdiction as a federal court, see Mansfield, C. & L.M.R. Co. v. Swan, \n111 \nU.S. 379, 382\n, 4 S.Ct. 510, the parties may waive their objections to the equity jurisdiction by consent, Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371, 380\n, 14 S.Ct. 127; In re Metropolitan Railway Receivership, supra, \n208 \nU.S. 109, 110\n, 28 S.Ct. 219, or by failure to take it seasonably, Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. Lake Superior Iron Co., \n134 \nU.S. 530, 535\n, 536 S., 10 S.Ct. 604; Southern Pacific R. Co. v. United States (No. 1), \n200 \nU.S. 341, 349\n, 26 S.Ct. 296. Even if \n\n[294 U.S. 176, 182]\n\u00a0\n the present objection be regarded as valid and as one which, in some circumstances, the court should take sua sponte at any stage of the proceedings, despite the waiver by the parties, compare Harkin v. Brundage, supra, \n276 \nU.S. 52\n, 48 S.Ct. 268; Lewis v. Cocks, 23 Wall. 466, 470, the District Court was not without jurisdiction as a federal court, for these are questions which it is competent to decide. It was therefore invested with authority to hear and make disposition of the cause, which is not open to collateral attack, see Bryan v. Kennett, \n113 \nU.S. 179, 198\n, 5 S.Ct. 407; Johnson v. Manhattan R. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 479, 496\n, 50 S.Ct. 721, or subject to diminution or control by state statutes, see United States v. Howland, 4 Wheat. 108, 115; Neves v. Scott, 13 How. 268, 272; Mississippi Mills v. Cohn, \n150 U.S. 202\n, 204-206, 14 S.Ct. 75; Mason v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 545, 557\n, 43 S.Ct. 200. Error in the exercise of that jurisdiction can be remedied only by appeal. See Smith v. McKay, supra, \n161 \nU.S. 358, 359\n, 16 S.Ct. 490.\n\n 2. \nThe question remains whether, in the special circumstances of the case, the District Court rightly retained its jurisdiction. The relief prayed in the bill of complaint is equitable in its nature, and the prayer was addressed to the sound discretion which is the controlling guide of judicial action in every phase of a suit in equity. The relief sought, an injunction and the appointment of receivers, was aimed at the prevention of irreparable injury, from the waste of the assets of the insolvent corporation which would ensue from a race of creditors to secure payment of their claims by forced sale of the corporate property. By local statutes elaborate provision is made for accomplishing the same end, through the action of a state officer, in substantially the same manner and without substantially different results from those to be attained in receivership proceedings in the federal courts. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 176, 183]\n\u00a0\n There is no allegation or contention that the procedure thus provided is inadequate, or that it will not be diligently and honestly followed. In such circumstances the discretion of the District Court, invoked by the petition of the commonwealth, should have been exercised to relinquish the jurisdiction in favor of the statutory administration of the corporate assets by the state officer.\n The question is not the ordinary one of comity between a federal and a state court, each asserting jurisdiction over the same subject-matter and the same property and where there are shown no special reasons addressed to the discretion of the court first acquiring jurisdiction for relinquishing its jurisdiction in favor of the other. Compare McClellan v. Carland, \n217 \nU.S. 268, 281\n, 282 S., 30 S.Ct. 501;\n___ The secretary, after giving notice to all persons holding assets of the association (section 25, as amended (7 PS Pa.  25)), and after taking an inventory of the assets (section 26 (7 PS Pa.  26)), may either suspend or continue the business pending determination of whether or not to liquidate the affairs of the association (section 27 (7 PS Pa.  27)). By section 28, as amended by Act May 28, 1931, P.L. 193,  1, the secretary is authorized to surrender possession upon the resumption of business by the association or the sale of its assets to a successor or independent corporation. Although the authority of the secretary is not derived from the action of any court, section 29, as amended by Act July 20, 1932, P.L. 7 (Ex. Sess.)  1, gives him, 'except as herein otherwise provided,' the status and powers of a receiver of a court of equity. The court having jurisdiction is given, by section 30, as amended (7 PS Pa.  30), power to enforce orders of the secretary. \nUnder section 31, 7 PS Pa.  31, and as amended by Act May 28, 1931, P.L. 197,  2, his possession continues until liquidation, resumption of business by the association, surrender under section 28, the substitution of liquidating trustees elected by shareholders or appointed by the court as provided in section 50 (7 PS Pa.  50), or payment of the creditors in full. The secretary is authorized to compromise claims (section 34, as amended (7 PS Pa.  34)) and to prosecute or defend suits (section 35 (7 PS Pa.  35)). During his possession, no lien shall attach or execution issue against the property of the corporation, and no pledgee shall, without permission of the secretary or order of the court, sell the collateral or pledge (section 36, as amended by Act June 12, 1931, P.L. 563). b \n\n[294 U.S. 176, 184]\n\u00a0\n Hyde v. Stone, 20 How. 170, 175; Chicot County v. Sherwood, \n148 \nU.S. 529, 534\n, 13 S.Ct. 695; In re Chetwod, \n165 \nU.S. 443, 460\n, 17 S.Ct. 385, with Harkin v. Brundage, supra; Rogers v. Guaranty Trust Co., \n288 \nU.S. 123\n, 53 S.Ct. 295, 89 A.L.R. 720; Kansas City Pipe Line Co. v. Fidelity Title & Trust Co., 217 F. 187 ( C.C.A. 8th); First National Bank of Memphis v. Horuff, 65 F.(2d) 319 (C.C. A. 5th). Here no state court is asserting jurisdiction, but the state officer, charged by the statutes of the state with the duty of supervising its own building and loan associations and of liquidating them by an adequate procedure when insolvent, asks to proceed with the liquidation. See amos v. Trust Co. of Florida, 54 F.(2d) 286, 288 (C.C.A. 5th).\n___ Before liquidation, the secretary must give notice to creditors and depositors (section 41, as amended by Act May 28, 1931, P.L. 198,  4) and have an inventory and appraisement made by disinterested persons (section 38, as amended (7 PS Pa. 38)). By section 45, as amended by Act May 28, 1931, P.L. 199,  6, the secretary must submit a final or partial account of claims allowed or rejected, and any party in interest may file objections in the court; if no account is submitted within one year, a court order directing its submission may be obtained. Section 46 as amended (7 PS Pa.  46) provides that the account is binding and conclusive, except as to those parts to which objection has been made in court, and directs distribution in accordance therewith. If the account were partial, its confirmation is not conclusive on claims specified in subsequent accounts (section 47, as amended (7 PS Pa.  47)). The court is to hear and determine matters in controversy (section 48, as amended (7 PS Pa.  48)). Expenses of administration are to be paid out of the association's funds, and are subject to the approval of the court (section 49 (7 PS Pa.  49)). Section 50 (7 PS Pa.  50) provides for the election of liquidating trustees by the shareholders, or appointment by the court in default of election, if a balance remains after the final account has been filed and the creditors paid in full. \n\n[294 U.S. 176, 185]\n\u00a0\n A court of equity, which in its discretion may refuse to protect private rights when the exercise of its jurisdiction would be prejudicial to the public interest, see United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, \n289 \nU.S. 352, 359\n, 360 S., 53 S.Ct. 614, or deny relief upon performance of a condition which will safeguard the public interest and secure substantial justice to the complainant, see Harrisonville v. W.S. Dickey Clay Mfg. Co., \n289 \nU.S. 334, 338\n, 53 S.Ct. 602, would seem bound to stay its hand in the public interest, where it reasonably appears that the private right will not suffer. It is in the public interest that federal courts of equity should exercise their discretionary power with proper regard for the rightful independence of state governments in carrying out their domestic policy. Fenner v. Boykin, \n271 \nU.S. 240, 243\n, 244 S., 46 S.Ct. 492; Massachusetts State Grange v. Benton, \n272 \nU.S. 525, 527\n, 47 S.Ct. 189; Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521, 525\n, 52 S.Ct. 217. Cf. Central kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n290 \nU.S. 264, 273\n, 54 S.Ct. 154. It has long been accepted practice for the federal courts to relinquish their jurisdiction in favor of the state courts, where its exercise would involve control of or interference with the internal affairs of a domestic corporation of the state. See Rogers v. Guaranty Trust Company, supra, \n288 \nU.S. 130, 131\n, 53 S.Ct. 295, 89 A.L.R. 720. Compare Burnrite Coal Briquette Co. v. Riggs, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 212, 213\n, 47 S.Ct. 578; Canada Malting Co., Ltd., v. Paterson Steamships, Ltd., \n285 U.S. 413\n, 419-423, 52 S.Ct. 413; Langnes v. Green, \n282 \nU.S. 531, 541\n, 51 S.Ct. 243. There are stronger reasons for adopting a like practice where the exercise of jurisdiction involves an unnecessary interference by injunction with the lawful action of state officers. Matthews v. Rodgers, supra, \n284 \nU.S. 525\n, 52 S.Ct. 217.\n Here, upon presentation of the application for appointment of receivers, which would involve such an interference, the District Judge might appropriately have required notice of the application to be given to the state officers. It was his duty to do so if satisfied that the delay \n\n[294 U.S. 176, 186]\n\u00a0\n involved in adopting that course would not result in the sacrifice of any vital interest of the insolvent corporation, its creditors or its stockholders. On the showing that their interests would be adequately protected by liquidation under the direction of the secretary of banking, the District Judge should have denied the application for the appointment of receivers, or, if he had already appointed them, should have discharged the receivers, and directed the surrender of the property in their possession to the secretary in order that the liquidation might proceed under the state statutes.\n That course should be pursued now. For that purpose the decree will be reversed and the cause remanded. The District Court will direct that all assets and property in the possession of the receivers be, with all convenient speed, surrendered to the secretary of banking, the receivers retaining only sufficient of the assets of the defendant association to pay their reasonable fees and any obligations lawfully incurred by them. Jurisdiction will be retained by the district court only for that purpose and for the purpose of promptly discharging the receivers and settling their accounts, after which the suit will be dismissed. See Harkin v. Brundage, supra, \n276 \nU.S. 57, 58\n, 48 S.Ct. 268.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Pennsylvania Banking Act of 1923, P.L. 809, as amended by the Acts of 1927, P.L. 762, 1931, P.L. 193, 563, 1932 (Ex. Sess.) P.L. 7 (7 PS Pa.  1 et seq.), provides for the regulation and supervision of financial institutions, including building and loan associations. Section 21, as amended (7 PS Pa.  21) authorizes the secretary to take possession of the business and property of a building and loan association if its condition is 'unsafe or unsound,' or if the association has violated the law or an order of the secretary; he can take possession only after notice and hearing and after securing the approval of the Attorney General. Section 22 (7 PS Pa.  22) requires the secretary to file a certificate in his office and in that of the prothonotary of the court having jurisdiction ( by section 19 (7 PS Pa.  19) the court of common pleas of Dauphin county or of the county in which the corporation is located), stating that he has taken possession of the business and property of the association.

General Mortgage Bonds.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On June 7, 1933, the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Co. filed a petition seeking a reorganization under \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 657]\n\u00a0\n section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  205), in the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division, alleging that it was 'unable to meet its debts as they mature.' Nine of the debtor's subsidiaries thereafter joined in the proceedings as permitted by subdivision (a) of the section. On September 26, 1933, the debtor filed a petition for instructions which alleged that it had outstanding collateral notes secured by mortgage bonds, part of which were issued by it, part by corporations forming a part of the system; that it had been unable to pay interest on its funded debt secured by mortgage liens on various portions of its property; that it would be obliged to default on interest about to become due on other mortgage bonds of the system; that the value of the collaterial securing each of the outstanding notes is substantially in excess of the loan thereby secured; that if holders of the notes should sell the collateral it would cause a substantial and irreparable loss to the trust estate; and that a forced sale of the collateral at the present time might result in a substantial deficiency judgment against the debtor and the depletion of the respective interests in the trust estate of all creditors in proportion to the rank and lien of the obligations by which their claims or interests therein are evidenced. The petition prayed that the court determine whether it should enjoin the holders of the collateral notes, in the event of a default, from selling any of the collateral.\n Practically all of the collateral held by the banks and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation consists of bonds of the debtor and its subsidiaries. These bonds are secured by mortgages on the property of the system; and the collateral, therefore, constitutes fractional interests in the liens created thereby. The collateral pledged to the banks consists of bonds of the Rock Island or of bonds (guaranteed by the debtor) of one of the subsidiary corporations, wholly owned and operated under lease by the \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 658]\n\u00a0\n debtor. Six of the collateral notes, aggregating.$13,659,877.58, are held by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and are secured by collateral of the face value of $41,702,465.85.1 The remaining notes, aggregating $4,125, 000 in amount, and secured by collateral of the face \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 659]\n\u00a0\n value of $14,409,000,2 are held severally by five banks: The Chase National Bank and the New York Trust Company, of New York City, the Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Company and Harris Trust &\n___ Trinity & Brazos Valley Receiver's Certificates 747,492.51 Trinity & Brazos Valley First Mortgage Bonds (now pledged under Colorado & Southern Mortgage; C., R.

Each of the collateral notes contains a provision that it shall become due in case of, among other events, (1) nonpayment of interest, (2) insolvency of the debtor, (3) appointment of a receiver for the debtor. Each note held by a bank provides also that it shall become due in case of nonpayment of interest on any of the notes held by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. And all the outstanding notes provide that: 'Upon default of any kind hereunder, the payee may sell in ... New York City, or elsewhere ... all or any of the security held for the payment of this note, at any broker's board or at public or private sale, without ... notice .... And the payee may be the purchaser of any or all property, rights and\/or interests so sold ....'\n None of the noteholders was a party to the proceeding. No noteholder was ever served with process; and only the two Chicago banks were residents of the district. But notice of the intention to present the petition for instructions had been sent by registered mail to each of the noteholders, and also to the five protective committees representing security holders of the system. \n3\n All of these parties were represented at the hearing. The holders of the collateral notes appeared specially, and objected to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that (1) it had no jurisdiction of the person; (2) no jurisdiction over, or possession of, the property, the sale of which was about to \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 661]\n\u00a0\n be restrained; and (3) no jurisdiction to grant in a summary proceeding the injunction suggested; but it was stipulated that the noteholders might present argument and file briefs on the merits without waiving their special appearances. The Chairman of the Protective Committee of the First and Refunding Bonds of the Debtor set forth the facts relied upon as showing that unless the sale of the collateral was enjoined, it would be impossible to prepare, and secure approval of, a plan of reorganization. All of the appellants contend that the injunction entered, as hereinafter stated, was without legal justification. Only the banks renew here the challenge to the jurisdiction of the court to make the order in this proceeding.\n The Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific system comprises over 8,000 miles of line, extending into more than one-fourth of the states of the Union, and into 20 federal judicial districts. At the commencement of this reorganization proceeding, its capitalization outstanding in the hands of the public was $459,059,808. Of this, $128,909,211 was in preferred and common stocks; $312,365,720 in bonded indebtedness; and $17,784,877 in the collateral notes here in question. In addition to the above, there were pledged as security for some issues of its funded debt bonds and stocks of the system aggregating $145,749,050; and as security for the collateral notes, the bonds and stocks above mentioned, aggregating $54,711,465. If, pending the reorganization, trustees for the bondholders and these noteholders should sell the pledged securities, the capitalization outstanding in the hands of the public would to that extent be expanded; and the aggregate capitalization might thereby become as much as $659,520, 323.\n By the Act of March 3, 1933, c. 204, 47 Stat. 1467 (see 11 USCA  201 and note, 202-205), original jurisdiction, in addition to that theretofore exercised in voluntary and involuntary proceedings to adjudge persons bankrupt, was conferred upon courts of bank- \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 662]\n\u00a0\n ruptcy 'in proceedings for the relief of debtors,' as provided in sections 74, 75 and 77 of the act (11 USCA  202, 203, and 205). We are here concerned only with section 77 (11 USCA  205). That section contains provisions for the reorganization of railroads engaged in interstate commerce. It permits any railroad corporation which is insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature to effect a plan of reorganization.\n It provides for the filing of a petition by the railroad corporation in a court designated by the act. If the petition be approved, the court, during the pendency of the proceedings, is given exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property wherever located. The act requires that the railroad corporation shall be referred to in the proceedings as a 'debtor,' and permits any corporation, the majority of the capital stock of which is owned, or substantially all of whose properties are operated, by the debtor under lease or operating agreement, also to file a petition in the same proceeding stating that it is insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature and that it desires to effect a plan of reorganization in connection with the plan of the original debtor.\n Other provisions of the section direct that a plan of reorganization shall include a proposal to modify or alter the rights of creditors generally or of any class of them, secured or unsecured, either through the issuance of new securities or otherwise; that it shall provide adequate means for its execution; that the term 'creditor' includes 'all holders of claims, interests, or securities of whatever character against the debtor or its property,' 11 USCA  205(b)(4); and that, if the plan is not proposed or accepted or confirmed within a reasonable time to be fixed by the judge, he may dismiss the proceeding.\n Before acceptance of any plan, the Interstate Commerce Commission is directed to hold a public hearing, following which it shall render a report recommending a plan which 'will, in its opinion be equitable, will not \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 663]\n\u00a0\n discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors or stockholders, will be financially advisable ... and will be compatible with the public interest.' 11 USCA  205(d). The commission is required to state fully the reasons for its conclusions. The plan is then to be submitted to the creditors and stockholders of the debtor for acceptance or rejection. No plan may be finally approved by the commission until it has been accepted in writing by or on behalf of creditors holding two-thirds in amount of the claims of each class affected by the plan, and by or on behalf of stockholders holding two-thirds of the stock of each class.\n Upon approval by the commission, the judge, after hearing, shall confirm the plan if satisfied, among other things, that the plan affords adequate protection for the realization by creditors of the value of their securities, liens and claims in one of the ways pointed out by the section. Upon confirmation of the plan, it is to be binding not only upon corporation and all stockholders and creditors generally, but upon all secured creditors of each class of which two-thirds in amount shall have accepted the plan. For convenient reference, various pertinent excerpts from section 77 (11 USCA  205) are reproduced in the margin. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 648, 664]\n\u00a0\n On November 22, 1933, the district court, after a hearing, entered an order reciting that each of the collateral notes contained provisions that, in case of the insolvency\n___ by any railroad corporation filing a petition as a debtor under this section, or substantially all of whose properties are operated by such a debtor under lease or operating agreement may file, with the court in which such other debtor had filed such a petition, and in the proceeding upon such petition under this section, a petition stating that it is insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature and that it desires to effect a plan of reorganization in connection with, or as a part of, the plan of reorganization of such other debtor; and thereupon such court shall have the same jurisdiction with respect to it, its property and its creditors and stockholders as the court has with respect to such other debtor. ...\n'(b) A plan of reorganization within the meaning of this section (1) shall include a proposal to modify or alter the rights of creditors generally, or of any class of them, secured or unsecured, either through the issuance of new securities of any character or otherwise; ... (3) shall provide adequate means for the execution of the plan, which may, so far as may be consistent with the provisions of sections 1 and 5 of the Interstate Commerce Act as amended (Title 49), include the transfer or conveyance of all or any part of the property of the debtor to another corporation or to other corporations or the consolidation of the properties of the debtor with those of another railroad corporation, or the merger of the debtor with any other railroad corporation and the issuance of securities of either the debtor or any such corporation or corporations, for cash, or in exchange for existing securities, or in satisfaction of claims or rights, or for other appropriate purposes. ... The term 'creditors' shall, except as otherwise specifically provided in this section, include, for all purposes of this section and of the reorganization plan, its acceptance and confirmation, all holders of claims, interests, or securities of whatever character against the debtor or its property. ...\n\n'(c) Upon approving the petition as properly filed the judge ... (7) if a plan of reorganization is not proposed or accepted, or, if proposed and accepted, is not confirmed, within such reasonable time as the judge may, upon cause shown and after considering any recommendation which has been filed by the commission, allow, may dismiss the proceeding. ...\n\n'(d) Before creditors and stockholders of the debtor are asked finally to accept any plan of reorganization, the Interstate Com- \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 665]\n\u00a0\n of the railway company or the appointment of a receiver or the nonpayment of interest when due, the holder thereof might sell and dispose of the collateral; that there was\n\n___ merce Commission shall after due notice hold a public hearing at which the debtor shall present its plan of reorganization and at which, also, such a plan may be presented by the trustee or trustees, or by or on behalf of creditors of the debtor, being not less than 10 per centum in amount of any class of creditors. Following such hearing, the commission shall render a report in which it shall recommend a plan of reorganization ( which may be different from any which has been proposed) that will, in its opinion be equitable, will not discriminate unfairly in favor of any class of creditors or stockholders, will be financially advisable, will meet with the requirements of subdivision (g) of this section, and will be compatible with the public interest. In such report the commission shall state fully the reasons for its conclusions. ... Thereafter the plan of reorganization recommended by the commission shall be submitted in such manner as the commission may direct to the creditors and stockholders of the debtor for acceptance or rejection, together with the report or reports of the commission thereon. ...\n'(e) A plan of reorganization shall not be finally approved by the commission until it has been accepted in writing and such acceptance has been filed in the proceeding by or on behalf of creditors holding two- thirds in amount of the claims of each class whose claims or interests would be affected by the plan, and by or on behalf of stockholders of the debtor holding two-thirds of the stock of each class: Provided, however, That if adequate provision is made in the plan for the protection of the interests, claims, and liens of any class of creditors or stockholders in the manner provided in clauses (5) and (6) of subdivision (g), of this section, then the acceptance of the plan by such class of creditor or stockholders shall not be requisite to the approval of the plan. ...\n\n'(g) Upon such approval by the commission, and after hearing such objections as may be made to the approved plan, the judge shall confirm the plan if satisfied that ... (6) the plan provides with respect to any class of creditors the acceptance of which is requisite to the confirmation of the plan, and who would not become bound by the plan under the provisions of subdivision (h) of this section, adequate protection for the realization by them of the value of their securities, liens, and claims, either (a) by the sale of such property subject to their liens, if any, or (b) by the sale free of such liens at not less than \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 666]\n\u00a0\n danger that the holders would claim that one or more of the events entitling them to sell such collateral had occurred; that a sale of the collateral or any part thereof by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation or by the banks would be inconsistent with the purposes of section 77 and would hinder, impede, obstruct, delay, and, in effect, prevent the orderly preparation and consummation of a plan of reorganization; that the district court, under section 77, had exclusive jurisdiction of the debtor and its property wherever located; that under paragraph 15 of section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  11(15), the court had power to make such orders, issue such process, and enter such judgments as might be necessary for the enforcement of the act; and that it was\n\n___ a fair upset price, and the transfer of such liens to the proceeds of such sale, or (c) by appraisal and payment in cash of either the value of such liens and claims or, at the objecting creditors' election, the value of the securities allotted to such liens and claims under the plan. Section 57, clause (h), of this Act (section 93, clause (h) of this title) shall be applicable to the appraisal of securities under this section, and the value of the unpaid balance shall be appraised as an unsecured claim. ...\n'(h) Upon such confirmation the provisions of the plan shall be binding upon ... (7) all secured creditors of each class of which two- thirds in amount shall have accepted the plan. ...\n\n'(i) In addition to the provisions of section 11 of this Act (section 29 of this title) for the staying of pending suits against the debtor, such suits shall be further stayed until after final decree (and) the judge may, upon notice and for cause shown, enjoin or stay the commencement or continuance of any judicial proceeding to enforce any lien upon the estate until after final decree. ...\n\n'(n) In proceedings under this section and consistent with the provisions thereof, the jurisdiction and powers of the court, the duties of the debtor and the rights and liabilities of creditors, and of all persons with respect to the debtor and his property, shall be the same as if a voluntary petition for adjudication had been filed and a decree of adjudication had been entered on the day when the debtor's petition was filed. ...' \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 667]\n\u00a0\n necessary for the enforcement of section 77 that the holders of the collateral be enjoined and restrained from selling or disposing of the same pending the preparation and consummation of a reorganization plan. Following these recitals, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the banks were restrained and enjoined from converting, selling, or otherwise disposing of the collateral or any part thereof until further order of the court.\n\n An appeal followed to the circuit court of appeals where, upon full consideration, the decree of the district court was affirmed. 72 F.(2d) 443. The case was brought here on certiorari. \n293 \nU.S. 550\n, 55 S.Ct. 213, 79 L.Ed. --.\n The questions which we are called upon to determine relate to the construction of section 77 in certain particulars; to its constitutionality; and to the powers of the district court which were here asserted and exercised.\n First. The constitutional validity of the section in its general scope and application is not assailed, the subject being passed without discussion by any of the parties. Never-theless, grave doubt has been expressed in respect of that question; and since the question is inherently fundamental, we deem it necessary to consider and dispose of it in limine-postponing, however, for later consideration the limited contention of the banks, in which the Reconstruction Finance Corporation seems not to join, that the due process clause of the Constitution is infringed by the special application made of section 77 in respect of the injunction.\n Article 1,  8, cl. 4, of the Federal Constitution vests Congress with the power 'to establish ... uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States'; and the simple question is: - Does section 77 constitute a law on the subject of bankruptcies? While attempts have been made to formulate a distinction between bankruptcy and insolvency, it long has been settled that, \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 668]\n\u00a0\n within the meaning of the constitutional provision, the terms are convertible. As early as 1833, Mr. Justice Story said that whatever might have been the rule of the English law on the subject, Congress might pass an act authorizing a commission of bankruptcy at the petition of the debtor; and that no distinction, practically or even theoretically, could be made between bankruptcies and insolvencies. 2 Story on the Constitution ( 4th Ed.)  1111. From the beginning, the tendency of legislation and of judicial interpretation has been uniformly in the direction of progressive liberalization in respect of the operation of the bankruptcy power.\n The English law of bankruptcy, as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, was conceived wholly in the interest of the creditor and proceeded upon the assumption that the debtor was necessarily to be dealt with as an offender. Anything in the nature of voluntary bankruptcy was unknown to that system. The persons who were permitted to fall within the term 'bankrupt' were limited to traders. But the notion that the framers of the Constitution, by the bankruptcy clause, intended to limit the power of Congress to the then existing English law and practice upon the subject long since has been dispelled.\n In Waring v. Clarke, 5 How. 441, this court held that the grant extending the judicial power to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction was not limited to, and was not to be interpreted by, what were cases of admiralty jurisdiction in England when the Constitution was adopted. Nor is the implied power of Congress over the subject arising from that jurisdictional clause and the general coefficient clause ( article 1,  8, cl. 18) of the Constitution to be thus confined. Detroit Trust Co. v. The Thomas Barlum, \n293 U.S. 21\n, 42-43, 55 S.Ct. 31; Panama R.R. Co. v. Johnson, \n264 U.S. 375\n, 385-387, 44 S.Ct. 391. \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 669]\n\u00a0\n The same, it was said in the Waring Case, is true in respect of other grants of power; and the bankruptcy clause was cited, page 458 of 5 How., as an example. In the Matter of Edward Klein, decided by Mr. Justice Catron sitting on circuit and printed in 1 How. (42 U.S.) 277, Note, Fed. Cas. No. 7865, it was definitely decided that the extent of the power of Congress was not limited to the principle upon which the English bankruptcy system was founded; and that decision was cited with approval by this court in Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, \n186 \nU.S. 181, 186\n, 22 S. Ct. 857. Whether a clause in the Constitution is to be restricted by the rules of the English law as they existed when the Constitution was adopted depends upon the terms or the nature of the particular clause in question. Certainly, these rules have no such restrictive effect in respect of any constitutional grant of governmental power (Waring v. Clarke, supra), though they do, at least in some instances, operate restrictively in respect of clauses of the Constitution which guarantee and safeguard the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual, the best examples of which, perhaps, are the Sixth and Seventh Amendments, which guarantee the right of trial by jury. That guaranty has always been construed to mean a trial in the mode and according to the settled rules of the common law, including all the essential elements recognized in this country and England when the Constitution was adopted. Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263, and cases cited. See, also, Callan v. Wilson, \n127 \nU.S. 540, 549\n, 8 S.Ct. 1301; Dimick v. Schiedt, \n293 \nU.S. 474, 476\n, 487 S., 55 S.Ct. 296, 95 A.L.R. 1150; West v. Gammon et al. (C.C.A.) 98 F. 426.\n But, while it is true that the power of Congress under the bankruptcy clause is not to be limited by the English or Colonial law in force when the Constitution was adopted, it does not follow that the power has no limitations. Those limitations have never been explicitly defined, and any attempt to do so now would result in little \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 670]\n\u00a0\n more than a paraphrase of the language of the Constitution without advancing far toward its full meaning. Judge Cowen, in Kunzler v. Kohaus, 5 Hill (N.Y) 317, 321, a decision which was approved by this court in Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra, said that the power was the same as though Congress had been authorized 'to establish uniform laws on the subject of any person's general inability to pay his debts. ...' Probably the most satisfactory approach to the problem of interpretation here involved is to examine it in the light of the acts, and the history of the acts, of Congress which have from time to time been passed on the subject; for, like many other provisions of the Constitution, the nature of this power and the extent of it can best be fixed by the gradual process of historical and judicial 'inclusion and exclusion.' Compare Davidson v. New Orleans, \n96 U.S. 97\n, 104; Fed. Trade Comm. v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 648\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191\n\n\n The first act, that of 1800 (2 Stat. 19) so far ignored the English law, which was confined to traders, as to include bankers, brokers, and underwriters as well. The act of 1841 (5 Stat. 440) added merchants; and other additions have been made by later acts until now practically all classes of persons and corporations are included. See Friday v. Hall & Kaul Co., \n216 \nU.S. 449, 454\n, 30 S.Ct. 261, 26 L.R.A. (N.S.) 475. The act of 1800 was one exclusively in the interest of the creditor. But the act of 1841 took what then must have been regarded as a radical step forward by conferring upon the debtor the right by voluntary petition to surrender his property, with some exceptions, and relieve himself of all future liability in respect of past debts. The act of 1800, like the English law, was conceived in the view that the bankrupt was dishonest; while the act of 1841 and the later acts proceeded upon the assumption that he might be honest but unfortunate. One of the primary purposes of these acts was to 'relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness, and permit him to start afresh free from the obligations \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 671]\n\u00a0\n and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes,' and to give him 'a new opportunity in life and a clear filed for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt.' Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234, 244\n, 54 S.Ct. 695, 699, 93 A.L.R. 195.\n By the Act March 2, 1867, p. 567,  43, as amended by the Act of 1874, c. 390,  17, 18 Stat. 178, 182, the debtor for the first time was permitted, either before or after an adjudication in bankruptcy, to propose terms of composition to his creditors to become binding upon their acceptance by a designated majority and confirmation by the judge.\n The fundamental and radically progressive nature of these extensions becomes apparent upon their mere statement; but all have been judicially approved or accepted as falling within the power conferred by the bankruptcy clause of the Constitution. Taken altogether, they demonstrate in a very striking way the capacity of the bankruptcy clause to meet new conditions as they have been disclosed as a result of the tremendous growth of business and development of human activities from 1800 to the present day. And these acts, far-reaching though they be, have not gone beyond the limit of congressional power; but rather have constituted extensions into a field whose boundaries may not yet be fully revealed.\n Section 77 advances another step in the direction of liberalizing the law on the subject of bankruptices. Railway corporations had been definitely excluded from the operation of the law in 1910 (chapter 412,  4, 36 Stat. 838, 839, 11 USCA  22), probably because such corporations could not be liquidated in the ordinary way or by a distribution of assets. A railway is a unit; it can not be divided up and disposed of piecemeal like a stock of goods. It must be sold, if sold at all, as a unit and as a going concern. Its activities can not be halted because its continuous, uninterrupted operation is necessary in the public interest; and, for the preservation of that interest, as well as for the pro- \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 672]\n\u00a0\n tection of the various private interests involved, reorganization was evidently regarded as the most feasible solution whenever the corporation had become 'insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature.'\n Equity receiverships, resorted to for that purpose, have never been satisfactory for many reasons. Partly, no doubt, in recognition of that situation, Congress, by section 77, added railroad corporations to the category of those who might have relief by legislation passed in virtue of the bankruptcy clause of the Constitution; and determined, after consideration, that such relief to be effectual should take the form of a reorganization, and should extend to cases where the corporation is 'unable to meet its debts as they mature.' The last phrase, since it is used as an alternative for the word 'insolvent,' obviously means something less than a condition of 'bankruptcy' or 'insolvency' as those words are employed in the law. See Bankruptcy Act,  1(15), 11 USCA  1(15), which defines an 'insolvent' as one whose assets, at a fair valuation, are not sufficient to pay his debts. It may be construed to include a debtor who, although unable to pay promptly, may be able to pay if time to do so be sufficiently extended. Obviously, section 77 does no more than follow the line of historical and progressive development projected by previous acts.\n As outlined by that section, a plan of reorganization, when confirmed, cannot be distinguished in principle from the composition with creditors authorized by the act of 1867, as amended by the act of 1874. It is not necessary to the validity of either that the proceeding should result in an adjudication of bankruptcy. The constitutionality of the old provision for a composition is not open to doubt. In re Reiman, 20 Fed. Cas. pages 490, 496, 497, No. 11,673, cited with approval in Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra. That provision was there sustained upon the broad ground that the 'subject of bankruptcies' was \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 673]\n\u00a0\n nothing less than 'the subject of the relations between an insolvent or non-paying or fraudulent debtor, and his creditors, extending to his and their relief.' That it was not necessary for the proceedings to be carried through in bankruptcy was held not to warrant the objection that the provision did not constitute a law on the subject of bankruptcies. The same view sustains the validity of section 77. Both contemplate an adjustment of a failing debtor's obligations; and although actual bankruptcy may not supervene in either, they are none the less laws on the subject of bankruptcies. With due regard for consistency, the constitutional validity of the one cannot well be sustained and that of the other denied, as this court quite evidently recognized in Canada Southern R. Co. v. Gebhard, \n109 \nU.S. 527\n, 3 S.Ct. 363, 366.\n That case involved an act of the Canadian Parliament by which railway companies unable to meet their engagements might unite with their creditors in the preparation of 'schemes of arrangement' to be filed in the court of chancery. A scheme was deemed agreed to by the holders of mortgages, bonds, stocks, rent charges, and preferred shares when assented to in writing by a designated majority of the holders of each class of security. The scheme when confirmed by the court became binding upon the nonassenting minority and this court held it to be thus binding upon bondholders who were citizens of the United States and who sued in courts of the United States to recover on their bonds. The 'scheme' of the Canadian law was not unlike the 'plan' of section 77. The significant part of the court's opinion, so far as the question now under discussion is concerned, is the following, which appears at page 536 of 109 U.S., 3 S.Ct. 363, 369: 'The confirmation and legalization of 'a scheme of arrangement' under such circumstances is no more than is done in bankruptcy when a 'composition' agreement with the bankrupt debtor, if assented to by the required ma- \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 674]\n\u00a0\n jority of creditors, is made binding on the non-assenting minority. In no just sense do such governmental regulations deprive a person of his property without due process of law. They simply require each individual to so conduct himself for the general good as not unnecessarily to injure another. Bankrupt laws have been in force in England for more than three centuries, and they had their origin in the Roman law. The constitution expressly empowers the congress of the United States to establish such laws. Every member of a political community must necessarily part with some of the rights which, as an individual, not affected by his relation to others, he might have retained. Such concessions make up the consideration he gives for the obligation of the body politic to protect him in life, liberty, and property. Bankrupt laws, whatever may be the form they assume, are of that character.'\n After pointing out that the Canadian law was in accordance with the policy of the English and Canadian governments in dealing with embarrassed and insolvent railway companies; that it took the place in England and Canada of foreclosure sales in the United States 'which in general accomplish substantially the same result with more expense and greater delay,' the court added (page 539 of 109 U.S., 3 S.Ct. 363, 371): '... It is in entire harmony with the spirit of bankrupt laws, the binding force of which, upon those who are subject to the jurisdiction, is recognized by all civilized nations. It is not in conflict with the Constitution of the United States, which, although prohibiting states from passing laws impairing the obligation of contracts, allows congress 'to establish ... uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcy throughout the United States.' Unless all parties in interest, wherever they reside, can be bound by the arrangement which it is sought to have legalized, the scheme may fail.' \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 675]\n\u00a0\n It is unnecessary to consider the criticism, sometimes made, that these excerpts are dicta merely, since we are of opinion that they are sound in principle.\n It follows, from what has now been said, that section 77, in its general scope and aim, is within the power conferred by the bankruptcy clause of the Constitution; and we so hold.\n Second. Under section 77 does the bankruptcy court have authority to enjoin the sale of the collateral here in question if a sale would so hinder, obstruct and delay the preparation and consummation of a plan of reorganization as probably to prevent it? By section 2 of the Bankruptcy Act (U.S.C. title 11,  11, 11 USCA  11), courts of bankruptcy are invested 'with such jurisdiction at law and in equity as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings.' They are essentially courts of equity, and their proceedings inherently proceedings in equity, the words 'at law' probably having been inserted only with regard to clause (4) of section 2, 11 USCA  11(4), which confers authority to arraign, try, and punish bankrupts and others for violations of the act. Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234, 240\n, 54 S.Ct. 695, 93 A.L.R. 195. Their adjudications and orders constitute in all essential particulars decrees in equity. Id., page 241 of 292 U.S., 54 S. Ct. 695. The power to issue an injunction when necessary to prevent the defeat or impairment of its jurisdiction is, therefore, inherent in a court of bankruptcy, as it is in a duly established court of equity. Section 262 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  377), which authorizes the United States courts 'to issue all writs not specifically provided for by statute, which may be necessary for the exercise of their respective jurisdictions' recognizes and declares the principle. An example of its application is found in Kline v. Burke Constr. Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226, 229\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A.L.R. 1077, where we held that a federal court, having first acquired jurisdiction of the subject matter, could enjoin the parties from proceeding in a state court of concurrent jurisdiction 'where the effect of the \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 676]\n\u00a0\n action would be to defeat or impair the jurisdiction of the federal court.' An injunction may be issued in such circumstances for the purpose of protecting and preserving the jurisdiction of the court 'until the object of the suit is accomplished and complete justice done between the parties.' Looney v. Eastern Texas R.R. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 214, 221\n, 38 S.Ct. 460, 462.\n Moreover, by section 2(15) of the Bankruptcy Act (U.S.C. title 11,  11, 11 USCA  11(15), courts of bankruptcy are invested with such authority in equity as will enable them to exercise original jurisdiction in bankruptcy proceedings, including the power to 'make such orders, issue such process, and enter such judgments in addition to those specifically provided for as may be necessary for the enforcement of the provisions of this act (title).' It may be that in an ordinary bankruptcy proceeding the issue of an injunction in the circumstances here presented would not be sustained. As to that it is not necessary to express an opinion. But a proceeding under section 77 (11 USCA  205) is not an ordinary proceeding in bankruptcy. It is a special proceeding which seeks only to bring about a reorganization, if a satisfactory plan to that end can be devised. And to prevent the attainment of that object is to defeat the very end the accomplishment of which was the sole aim of the section, and thereby to render its provisions futile.\n The bankruptcy court, in granting the injunction, was well within its power, either as a virtual court of equity, or under the broad provisions of section 2(15) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  11(15), or of section 262 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  377).\n The injunction does not infringe section 67d, U.S.C. title 11,  107( d), 11 USCA  107(d). The substance of that provision is that bona fide liens shall not be affected by anything contained in the Bankruptcy Act. The injunction here in no way impairs the lien, or disturbs the preferred rank of the pledgees. It does no more than suspend the enforcement of the lien by a sale of the collateral pending \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 677]\n\u00a0\n further action. It may be, as suggested, that during the period of restraint the collateral will decline in value; but the same may be said in respect of an injunction against the sale of real estate upon foreclosure of a mortgage; and such an injunction may issue in an ordinary proceeding in bankruptcy. Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 318, 321\n, 51 S.Ct. 465, and cases cited. A claim that injurious consequences will result to the pledgee or the mortgagee may not, of course, be disregarded by the district court; but it presents a question addressed not to the power of the court but to its discretion-a matter not subject to the interference of an appellate court unless such discretion be improvidently exercised. So far as constitutional power is concerned, there is no difference between an injunction restraining the enforcement of a real estate mortgage and one restraining the enforcement of a pledge by the sale of collateral security. Such differences as exist affect not the power but the propriety of its exercise-that is to say, the discretion of the court. Such an injunction, as just indicated, is within the contemplation of section 77, and we need not inquire whether it would be admissible under the act in force prior to the adoption of that section. Compare Straton v. New, supra. Nor does section 57h, 11 U.S.C.  93(h), 11 USCA  93(h), also invoked by petitioners, have any pertinent application to the question under discussion in the light of the provisions, purpose and aim of section 77.\n Petitioners urge that the injunction is precluded by a consideration of subdivision (l) of section 77, 11 USCA  205(l), which confers authority upon the court to enjoin or stay the commencement or continuance of any judicial proceeding to enforce any lien upon the estate until after final decree. The point made is that the granting of this express power to enjoin judicial proceedings brought to enforce liens negatives the authority to stay the enforcement of liens by nonjudicial proceedings, in accordance with the maxim, 'Expressio unius est exclusio alterius.' But clause (15) of \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 678]\n\u00a0\n section 2 is still in the act; and it would be an unwarranted use of the maxim, which is only an aid to construction, to apply it in such a way as to work a destruction, pro tanto, not only of that clause, but of section 262, Judicial Code (28 USCA  377), and of the general principle upon which both are based.\n Third. It is evident that the effect here wrought by the menace of impending sales of the collateral would seriously embarrass and probably prevent the formulation and consummation of a plan of reorganization. Both courts below so found. The findings of the district court are in the form of recitals in the order, but are nevertheless in substance and in effect findings of fact. The circuit court of appeals (72 F.(2d) 443, 452) approved these findings, and added that without some control over the disposition of the collateral, 'the presentation of a satisfactory plan of reorganization might as well be abandoned.' These concurrent findings of the two courts, as this court has often held, should be accepted as conclusive unless clearly erroneous. United States v. Commercial Credit Co ., \n286 \nU.S. 63, 67\n, 52 S.Ct. 467; Stuart v. Hayden, \n169 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 18 S.Ct. 274; Dun v. Lumbermen's Credit Ass'n, \n209 U.S. 20\n, 23-24, 28 S.Ct. 335, 14 Ann.Cas. 501.\n We are not impressed with the attempt of petitioners to show that the record entirely fails to justify the conclusion of the courts below in that regard. It must be borne in mind that, in addition to the collateral aggregating more than $54,000,000, held by petitioners, there was outstanding additional collateral pledged as security in the sum of over $ 145,000,000, bringing the total up to approximately $200,000,000, a sum equal to nearly half of the capital then issued and in the hands of the public. At the time the injunction was applied for, there was danger that the noteholders would claim that the right of sale under the terms of the collateral notes had been brought into existence; and with the pendency of the reorganization proceedings and the suspension of the payment of interest, it well cannot be doubted that there also was danger that the noteholders would proceed to exercise \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 679]\n\u00a0\n their rights of sale under the collateral notes. Such action on the part of these noteholders might well precipitate similar action by other holders of pledged collateral.\n It is necessary, under section 77, first to prepare a plan and then to submit it, perhaps with other suggested plans, to the Interstate Commerce Commission for consideration and recommendation. The plan having been assented to by two-thirds of each class of the stockholders and creditors and approved by the commission, must then, and only then, be submitted for approval to the district court. In the reorganization of a great railroad system like that here concerned, these various steps call for a degree of consideration and an extent of detailed work almost beyond the power of appreciation. The sale of the collateral securities from time to time during the progress of this consideration and work well might require such changes of detail in the plan, entailing new and perhaps difficult reconcilements of views among many and conflicting interests, as to force an abandonment of the proceeding.\n It must be apparent, if we consider only the impressive facts set forth in the forepart of this opinion in respect of the extensive operations of the railway company and its subsidiaries, the extent, multiplicity and variety of their obligations, the complicated nature of their capital structure, the great volume of their securities held as collateral by many and widely separated creditors, and other circumstances, that without the maintenance of the status quo for a reasonable length of time no satisfactory plan could be worked out. The preparation of any plan the important details of which could survive the changes in, and the consequent fluctuation and disturbance of, the financial structure, brought about by recurring sales of collateral, would seem to be a practical impossibility. Under all the circumstances, we are of opinion that the district court properly exercised its discretion in favor of respondents. \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 680]\n\u00a0\n Fourth. We find no substance in the contention of the petitioning banks that section 77, as applied by the court below to permit an injunction restraining the sale of the collateral, violates the Fifth Amendment. The basis of the contention is that since, by the terms of the pledge, the pledgees are empowered on default to sell the collateral at such times as they may select, section 77, as thus applied, deprives them of their property-that is to say, impairs or destroys their contractual rights-without due process of law.\n The Constitution, as it many times has been pointed out, does not in terms prohibit Congress from impairing the obligation of contracts as it does the states. But as far back as Calder v. Bull, 3 Dall. 386, 388, it was said that among other acts which Congress could not pass without exceeding its authority was 'a law that destroys or impairs the lawful private contracts of citizens.' The broad reach of that statement has been restricted (Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 549, 550); but the principle which it includes has never been repudiated, although the extent to which it may be carried has not been definitely fixed. Speaking generally, it may be said that Congress, while without power to impair the obligation of contracts by laws acting directly and independently to that end, undeniably, has authority to pass legislation pertinent to any of the powers conferred by the Constitution however it may operate collaterally or incidentally to impair or destroy the obligation of private contracts. Legal Tender Cases, supra; Louisville & Nashville R.R. v. Mottley, \n219 U.S. 467\n, 480-482, 484, 31 S.Ct. 265, 34 L.R.A. (N.S.) 671; Highland v. Russell Car & Snowplow Co., \n279 \nU.S. 253, 261\n, 49 S.Ct. 314. And under the express power to pass uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies, the legislation is valid though drawn with the direct aim and effect of relieving insolvent persons in whole or in part from the payment of their debts. See Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, supra, at page 188 of 186 U.S., 34 L.R.A.(N. S.) 671; Highland \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 681]\n\u00a0\n from the nature of the power, and this must have been within the contemplation of the framers of the Constitution when the power was granted.\n The injunction here goes no further than to delay the enforcement of the contract. It affects only the remedy. As already appears, this court has upheld the power of a court of bankruptcy to stay the enforcement of the remedy under a real-estate mortgage; and the remedy under a pledge, so far as constitutional power is here concerned, presents a situation strictly analogous in character.\n Fifth. It is next contended that the court was without power to issue the injunction in a summary proceeding. Obviously, an application for an injunction against the immediate enforcement of a remedy is not the assertion of an adverse claim. The bonds deposited as collateral were not in the hands of purchasers, but in the hands of creditors as security. That the equity which the debtor retained was a property interest was not and could not be disputed by the creditors; nor was the claim of the creditors in respect of their rights in the collateral security or the rank of their liens questioned by the debtor. In short, no adverse claim was brought forward by either of the parties to the controversy. The only question was in respect of the creditors' remedy; and the sole point is as to the authority of the bankruptcy court to delay for a reasonable time an interference with the reorganization proceeding which would result from an immediate sale of the collateral. The court below dealt adequately with the situation, and its conclusions find ample support in the decisions. See, for example, In re Purkett, Douglas & Co. (D.C.) 50 F.(2d) 435, 438; John Matthews, Inc., v. Knickerbocker Trust Co. (C.C.A.) 192 F. 557; Allebach v. Thomas (C.C.A.) 16 F.(2d) 853.\n The Reconstruction Finance Corporation raised the question in the district court by a demurrer, asserting that the allegations of the debtor's petition were insufficient. \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 682]\n\u00a0\n But in a summary proceeding, as the term itself implies, the merits of the controversy are determined without the formality in respect of pleadings which is required in actions at law or suits in equity. In such a proceeding we see no reason why the allegations of the petition may not be helped out by timely affidavits. Doubt has been expressed by lower federal courts as to the propriety of a demurrer in such a proceeding. In re Snelling (D.C.) 202 F. 258, Judge Morton aptly said: 'Summary procedure implies, I think, a single hearing ... at which the merits of the controversy are investigated and decided, without much regard to the formal pleadings.' See, also, In re Rockford Produce & Sales Co. (C.C.A.) 275 F. 811, 813. In any event, we think, as against demurrer, conceding its propriety, the petition is sufficient. Pertinent allegations are epitomized in the early part of this opinion.\n The contention of the petitioners that they were not given sufficient notice or a full opportunity to be heard is quite evidently without merit. They had ten days' previous notice by registered mail of the application for the injunction. All appeared specially and participated in the hearings, for which ample time was allowed. Briefs were filed on both sides, and additional memoranda were presented to the court by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and one of the banks.\n Sixth. The territorial jurisdiction of the district court is assailed by three of the banks on the ground that they were located outside the Northern District of Illinois. The contention is that the district court was without power to issue its process for service outside the district. Section 77(a), 11 USCA  205(a), provides that after the petition of the railroad company is approved, 'the court in which such order approving the petition is entered shall, during the pendency of the proceedings under this section and for the purposes thereof, have exclusive jurisdiction of the \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 683]\n\u00a0\n debtor and its property wherever located.' Congress may authorize the civil process of a federal district court to be served upon persons in any other district. Toland v. Sprague, 12 Pet. 300, 328; United States v. Congress Const. Co., \n222 \nU.S. 199, 203\n, 204 S., 32 S.Ct. 44; First Natl. Bank v. Williams, \n252 \nU.S. 504, 510\n, 40 S.Ct. 372. There are other cases to the same effect, but it is unnecessary to cite them. Section 77 deals with railway corporations whose lines and activities are not confined to a single district or a single state, but in numerous instances reach into many districts and many states. The lines of the Rock Island system extend into twenty districts and fourteen states. Jurisdiction over reorganization proceedings, however extensive the railway lines may be, is conferred upon a single district court. The usefulness of the section would be greatly minimized and in some instances destroyed if that court were powerless to send its process into any state when necessary to effectuate the purposes of the law. As has already been shown, the equity in the collateral remaining in the railroad company is property; and over this property, wherever located, the federal district court is given exclusive jurisdiction by the precise language of section 77, just quoted. As a necessary consequence of that jurisdiction, the court must have the power to preserve and safeguard the property for the benefit of the trust estate so far as that is compatible with the rights of the pledgees. Jurisdiction over the property wherever located carries with it jurisdiction to enjoin, in a proper case, interferences with the property, and that includes, by necessary inference, the power to send process to that end for service upon the persons to be enjoined wherever they may be found within the United States.\n It is said that the words 'wherever located' mean wherever located within the district. But considering the nature of the property involved, the number of districts and states over which it is distributed, and the \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 684]\n\u00a0\n manifest policy of avoiding ancillary administration as far as possible, a construction so narrow must be rejected as at war with the whole spirit and purpose of the law.\n Seventh. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation contends that sections 77 and 2(15) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 USCA  205 and 11(15) must be limited by the provisions of section 5 of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act (c. 8, 47 Stat. 5 (see 15 USCA  605)), which empowers the corporation to take over and liquidate collateral accepted by it as security. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation Act creates a corporation and vests it with designated powers. Its entire stock is subscribed by the government, but it is none the less a corporation, limited by its charter and by the general law. The act does not give it greater rights as to the enforcement of its outstanding credits than are enjoyed by other persons or corporations in the event of proceedings under the Bankruptcy Act. The provisions and principles of enforcement of the Bankruptcy Act, including section 77, are binding upon the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, in the absence of some pertinent statutory exception, as they are upon other corporations. We are unable to find such an exception in the authority to liquidate collateral held as security-an authority enjoyed in common with any other lender of money who has taken the trouble to provide for it in his contract with the borrower. What is given to the lender in either event is a remedy which, when subject to the control of the bankruptcy court under given circumstances in the one case, is equally so in the other.\n Finally. Petitioners insist, with much force, that the injunction, granted in November, 1933, and still operative, is likely, if continued, to result in irreparable injury. We do not interpret the order, as suggested by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, as continuing the injunction in force until a plan of reorganization is effected or the proceeding under section 77 dismissed. On the contrary, \n\n[294 U.S. 648, 685]\n\u00a0\n we understand that the injunction may at any time be dissolved upon application and proper notice and showing. It contemplates, as we have already suggested, only reasonable delay.\n It is true that no plan has yet been consummated; and, so far as the record shows, none has been prepared or is in the course of preparation. If this long delay were without adequate excuse, the retention of the injunction for the long period which has intervened since it was granted could not be justified. But the delay is obviously due to the many doubts and uncertainties arising from the present litigation. Until they are finally resolved, the consummation, or even the preparation, of any definite plan is plainly impracticable. With those doubts and uncertainties now removed, the proceeding should go forward to completion without further delay, or be dismissed.\n The delay and expense incident to railroad receiverships and foreclosure sales constituted, probably, the chief reasons which induced the passage of section 77; and to permit the perpetuation of either of these evils under this new legislation would be subversive of the spirit in which it was conceived and adopted. Not only are those who institute the proceeding and those who carry it forward bound to exercise the highest degree of diligence, but it is the duty of the court and of the Interstate Commerce Commission to see that they do. Proceedings of this character, involving public and private interests of such magnitude, should, so far as practicable, be given the right of way both by the court and by the commission, to the end that they may be speedily determined.\n Decree affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The collateral pledged with the notes held by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation consists of the following securities:\n Listed collateral: Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway Company First and Refunding 4% Gold Bonds $7,575,000.00 St. Paul & Kansas City Short Line Railroad Company First Mortgage 4 1\/2% Gold Bonds 9,374,500.00 Rock Island, Arkansas & Louisiana Railroad Company First Mortgage 4 1\/2% Gold Bonds 3,862,000.00 ___\n Total $20,811,500.00 Unlisted collateral: Chicago, Rock Island & Gulf Railway Company Extension First Mortgage 5% Bonds $6,927,000.00 Chicago, Rock Island & Gulf Railway Company Carrollton Branch 6% Bonds 331,000.00 Kankakee & Seneca Railroad Company 4 1\/2% Bonds 352,000.00 Rock Island & Dardanelle Railway Company First Mortgage 5% Bonds 100,000.00 Rock Island Memphis Terminal Depot First Mortgage 5% Bonds 900,000.00 Rock Island Memphis Terminal First Mortgage 5% Bonds 400,000.00 Rock Island Omaha Terminal First Mortgage 5% Bonds 906,000.00 Rock Island Improvement Company: Blue Island Shops Bonds 199,000.00 Cedar Rapids Terminal Bonds 369,732.99 Little Rock Mortgage Bonds 278,492.49 Peoria Terminal Mortgage Bonds 290,247.86 First and Collateral 5% Bonds 3,310,000.00 \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Protective Committee for the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway General Mortgage 4% Bonds; Protective Committee for the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway First and Refunding 4% Gold Bonds and Secured 4 1\/2% Gold Bonds Series A; Protective Committee for the St. Paul & Kansas City Short Line 4 1\/2% Gold Bonds and Rock Island, Arkansas & Louisiana 4 1\/2% Gold Bonds; Protective Committee of the Burlington, Cedar Rapids & Northern Consolidated 5% Gold Bonds; Protective Committee for the Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railway, 30-year 4 1\/2% Convertible Bonds. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] '(a) Any railroad corporation may file a petition stating that the railroad corporation is insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature and that it desires to effect a plan of reorganization.

Brock, of Denver, Colo., for appellee. \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 385]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company brought this suit to restrain the enforcement of two acts of the legislature of Montana imposing annual license taxes. The first act is chapter 174 of the Laws of 1933 prescribing a tax, to be paid on or before January first, for each telephone instrument used in the conduct of the business of operating or maintaining telephone lines and furnishing telephone service in the state of Montana. The tax is not to be imposed on telephone instruments where the rate charged to the customer does not exceed specified monthly amounts. The second act, chapter 54 of the Laws of 1933-34, Ex. Sess., amended the first act with respect to the amount of the tax, the date of payment, and other particulars, and continued the first act in force as to taxes already accrued. The text of the acts is set forth in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 384, 386]\n\u00a0\n The acts were assailed as repugnant to both the Federal and State Constitutions. One of these grounds, that the acts were invalid under the Commerce Clause of the Fed- \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 387]\n\u00a0\n eral Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3), was sustained by the District Court of three judges (28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380)) which entered a final decree permanently enjoining enforcement. 7 F.Supp. 12. The defendants, state officers, bring this appeal.\n The District Court received evidence and made findings of fact substantially as follows: Plaintiff is a Colorado corporation operating a statewide telephone system in Montana; it furnishes telephone service of an interstate and intrastate character; its system extends throughout Mon- \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 388]\n\u00a0\n tana, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Arizona, New Mexico, and a part of Texas; its telephone instruments in Montana are an integral part of its system, and are a part of a still greater system extending throughout the United States and to many foreign countries, so that each of the telephones in Montana (except 45 not affected by the statute) is available for interstate and foreign communication by connection with many millions of telephones; the statute in question affects over 34,000 of the telephones in Montana, and, of these, more than 10,000 have actually been used in interstate and foreign commerce since the statute was enacted, and it is reasonably likely that all plaintiff's telephone instruments in Montana will be so used; plaintiff pays the usual property taxes in Montana and also the corporation license or occupation taxes, which are a percentage of its intrastate revenues; all its telephones are instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce and plaintiff 'could not discontinue its intrastate business and operations in Montana without virtually destroying and being compelled to abandon and withdraw from its interstate and foreign business.'\n Appellants contend that the taxes are imposed solely upon intrastate commerce and do not burden interstate commerce. They insist that the taxes are laid upon the intrastate business measured by the number of telephones in intrastate use. Appellants challenge the findings that all of appellee's telephones in Montana are instrumentalities of interstate and foreign commerce, and that appellee could not discontinue its intrastate business without being compelled to withdraw from its interstate and foreign business, as being unsupported by the evidence.\n\n 1. \nIt does not appear that these acts have been construed by any decision of the state courts. Appellants cite a decision of the Supreme Court of Montana construing section 4071 of the Political Code of 1895, as amended by the Laws of 1897, p. 202,  1, which provided for a tax on tele- \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 389]\n\u00a0\n phone companies doing business in the state of a certain amount per year for each instrument in use. State v. Rocky Mountain Bell Telephone Co., 27 Mont. 394, 71 P. 311. In view of the terms of that statute, the court concluded that the Legislature intended to impose a license tax 'on each telephone instrument used in purely local or intrastate business, and that as to instruments used in interstate business it was intended to have no application whatever.' Id., page 404 of 27 Mont., 71 P. 311, 315. Compare Ogden City v. Crossman, 17 Utah, 66, 53 P. 985. A few days later, the Supreme Court of Montana decided the case of State v. Northern Pacific Express Co., 27 Mont. 419, 71 P. 404, 94 Am.St.Rep. 824, and held that the occupation tax imposed by section 4074 of the Political Code of the State, as applied to an express company, offended against the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution. The court distinguished its ruling in the case of the Rocky Mountain Bell Telephone Co. because the statute there 'by express terms' had discriminated 'between local and interstate commerce' and the intention that 'only local business' should be subject to the license tax 'was clearly expressed.' The court thus stated the principle which it considered to be applicable (Id., page 422 of 27 Mont., 71 P. 404, 405): 'If, however, the terms of the statute are general, and the license fee a unit charged against the business of the carrier as such,-as strictly an occupation tax,-and no attempt is made by the language of the statute to discriminate between the local and interstate business, but the license is required as a condition precedent to the carrier's commencing or conducting business, then the imposition of the tax will be deemed an interference with and an attempt to regulate interstate commerce, and for that reason void.' Applying that principle, the court found the tax upon the express company to be invalid as the statute did not 'by its terms, attempt to make any discrimination between the local and interstate business of the decedent company, and no such \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 390]\n\u00a0\n discrimination can be made under any fair construction of the language employed.' Id., page 427 of 27 Mont., 71 P. 404, 407. It is evident that these decisions of the state court do not aid appellants' contention.\n The tax is a privilege, or occupation, tax. The terms of the acts are explicit with respect to the incidence of the tax. Chapter 174 of the Laws of 1933 (section 1) provides that every corporation 'engaged in the business of operating or maintaining telephone lines and furnishing telephone service in the State of Montana ... shall pay ... a license tax ... for each telephone instrument used, controlled and operated by it in the conduct of such business.' The business is the maintaining of telephone lines and the furnishing of telephone service in the state. No distinction is made between interstate and intrastate service. The tax is then stated to be 'for each telephone instrument used, controlled and operated.' Again, there is no limitation as to use, control or operation in intrastate business. The tax is 'based upon the number of telephone instruments owned, controlled and operated' during all or any part of the calendar year. A 'telephone instrument' is defined in section 2 of the act as 'a transmitter and receiver capable of use in the transmitting and receiving of telephone communications.' The tax is thus laid simply by reason of the fact that the company is furnishing telephone service and is based upon the number of telephone instruments used in that service without regard to its character whether intrastate or interstate. The provision of the second tax act, chapter 54 of the Laws of 1933-34, is in this respect substantially the same.\n To support their contention, appellants point to the proviso, in the first act, that the tax 'shall not be imposed on any telephone instrument where the rate charged the customer therefor does not exceed Two Dollars ($ 2.00) per month for residence phone, or Three Dollars ($3.00) per month for business house or office phone.' There is a cor- \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 391]\n\u00a0\n responding exclusion in the second act. 2 But these are merely exempting provisions. They carve out of the statute telephone instruments for which certain monthly rates are paid. The question is not as to the instruments that are not taxed, but as to those which are taxed. All the telephone instruments, not excepted, whether they are used in intrastate or interstate commerce and however the service is paid for, are left subject to the tax. It is urged that monthly rates are charged to the customer for merely local service and are distinct from toll rates or charges for long distance calls which, whether intrastate or interstate, are on a 'board to board' basis. But the tax is not laid on revenues. It is not laid on revenue derived from monthly rates as distinguished from toll charges. It is not imposed with respect either to the nature of the revenue, or to the character of the service from which the revenue is derived, or to the manner in which the charges for the service are fixed.\n The evidence supports the findings that these telephone instruments are available for interstate and foreign communications. Appellants contend that a 'potential use, or even an occasional use for interstate or foreign commerce, is too remote, indefinite and indirect to permit such instruments to be classified as instrumentalities of interstate or foreign commerce, when, in fact, such instruments are used exclusively or almost exclusively for intrastate commerce.' But the telephone instruments constitute a class of facilities, which, as such, are subject to the tax, and the findings, based on evidence, show that the interstate use is actual, not merely potential; substantial, not negligible. More than 10, 000 of these instruments have actually been used in interstate and foreign commerce since the tax was laid. The evidence also shows that the same telephones, the same signaling apparatus, the same \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 392]\n\u00a0\n wires, land, buildings, central office equipment, and operating organization are used in common for all services, interstate as well as intrastate. It was in this view that the District Court held that it was not feasible to provide separate state-wide systems for intrastate and interstate telephones. But, apart from that question, it appears that in the operation of this unified system, the telephone instruments are the means by which the customers command at their pleasure the service they desire whether intrastate or interstate. And, so far as the instruments are not excepted, the tax is laid indiscriminatory with respect to each of these facilities, regardless of the nature of their use.\n\n 2. \nThere is no question that the state may require payment of an occupation tax from one engaged in both intrastate and interstate commerce. 3 But a state cannot tax interstate commerce; it cannot lay a tax upon the business which constitutes such commerce or the privilege of engaging in it. \n4\n And the fact that a portion of a business is intrastate and therefore taxable does not justify a tax \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 393]\n\u00a0\n either upon the interstate business or upon the whole business without discrimination. Leloup v. Port of Mobile, \n127 \nU.S. 640\n, 8 S.Ct. 1380. There are 'sufficient modes' in which the local business may be taxed without the imposition of a tax 'which covers the entire operations.' Id., page 647 of 127 U.S., 8 S.Ct. 1380, 1383. See Williams v. Talladega, \n226 \nU.S. 404, 419\n, 33 S.Ct. 116. Where the tax is exacted from one doing both an interstate and intrastate business, it must appear that it is imposed solely on account of the letter; that the amount exacted is not increased because of the interstate business done; that one engaged exclusively in interstate commerce would not be subject to the tax; and that the one who is taxed could discontinue the intrastate business without also withdrawing from the interstate business. Sprout v. South Bend, Ind., \n277 \nU.S. 163, 171\n, 48 S.Ct. 502, 62 A.L.R. 45; East Ohio Gas Co. v. Tax Commission, \n283 \nU.S. 465, 470\n, 51 S.Ct. 499\n\n\n A privilege or occupation tax which a state imposes with respect to both interstate and intrastate business, through an indiscriminate application to instrumentalities common to both sorts of commerce, has frequently been held to be invalid. Leloup v. Port of Mobile, supra; Pickard v. Pullman Southern Car Co., \n117 \nU.S. 34, 46\n, 6 S.Ct. 635; Crutcher v. Kentucky, \n141 \nU.S. 47, 59\n, 11 S.Ct. 851; Adams Express Co. v. New York, \n232 \nU.S. 14, 29\n, 31 S., 34 S.Ct. 203; United States Express Co. v. New York, \n232 \nU.S. 35, 36\n, 34 S.Ct. 209; Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., \n256 \nU.S. 642, 647\n, 648 S., 41 S. Ct. 606, 608. In the cases of the express companies, the principle was applied to a privilege tax imposed alike with respect to wagons used in the movement of both interstate and intrastate shipments. The local shipments 'were handled in the same vehicles, and by the same men' that were employed in connection with the interstate transportation and it was impracticable to effect a separation. Adams Express Co. v. New York, supra; United States Express Co. v. New York, supra. In Bowman v. Continental Oil Co., supra, the question arose under a statute of New Mexico laying an annual license tax of \n\n[294 U.S. 384, 394]\n\u00a0\n fifty dollars for each station distributing gasoline. The Court pointed out the distinction between an excise tax on sales of gasoline where, as the subject-matter was separable, full protection could be afforded by enjoining enforcement as to the interstate business, and the license tax which with its prohibition fell upon the business as a whole. The Court said: 'But with the license tax it is otherwise. If the statute is inseparable, then both by its terms and by its legal operation and effect this tax is imposed generally upon the entire business conducted, including interstate commerce as well as domestic; and the tax is void.' The difficulty, continued the Court, 'is that, since plaintiff, so far as appears, necessarily conducts its interstate and domestic commerce in gasoline indiscriminately at the same stations and by the same agencies, the license tax cannot be enforced at all without interfering with interstate commerce unless it be enforced otherwise than as prescribed by the statute-that is to say, without authority of law. Hence it cannot be enforced at all.'\n In the instant case, the tax, being indivisible and indiscriminate in its application, necessarily burdens interstate commerce. We do not pass upon the other question presented.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 174 of the Laws of 1933, approved March 16, 1933, provides:\n'Section 1.

CARY(1935)\nNo. 124\nArgued: December 13, 1935Decided: December 23, 1935\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Western District of Oklahoma. \n\n[296 U.S. 452, 453]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Holmes Baldridge, of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellants.\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 452, 454]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Streeter B. Flynn and Robert M. Rainey, both of Oklahoma City, Okl., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 452, 457]\n\u00a0\n\n PER CURIAM.\n This suit was brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma to restrain the enforcement of an order of the Corporation Commission of that state reducing gas rates. Plaintiff, trustee of the properties of the Consolidated Gas Service Company, alleged that the order was confiscatory and violated the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Application for an interlocutory injunction was brought before the District Court composed of three judges. 28 U.S.C.  380 (28 U.S.C.A.  380). Defendants, the Corporation Commission and its members, moved to dismiss the complaint upon the ground that the court was without jurisdiction, by reason of the terms of the Act of Congress of May 14, 1934 (48 Stat. 775, 28 U.S.C.A.  41(1, 1a) which provide that no District Court shall have jurisdiction to restrain the enforcement of an order of an administrative board or commission of a State, 'where jurisdiction is based solely upon the ground of diversity of citizenship, or the repugnance of such order to the Constitution of the United States, where such order (1) affects rates chargeable by a public utility, (2) does not interfere with interstate commerce, and (3) has been made after reasonable notice and hearing, and where a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may be had at law or in equity in the courts of such State.'\n Plaintiff contended that the Constitution and laws of Oklahoma did not afford an opportunity for judicial review in the courts of the state of orders affecting rates for the transportation and sale of gas. The District Court considered the provision of the Constitution of Oklahoma creating the Corporation Commission and providing for review of its orders ( Const.Okl. art. 9,  20, 23, 35), \n\n[296 U.S. 452, 458]\n\u00a0\n the state legislation with respect to appeals from orders affecting gas rates (Laws Okl. 1913, c. 93,  5), and the pertinent decisions of the Supreme Court of the state. The District Court found that it had been repeatedly held by the state court that the reviewing power conferred upon it by the provision of the State Constitution was legislative in character ( compare Oklahoma Natural Gas Company v. Russell, \n261 \nU.S. 290, 291\n, 43 S. Ct. 353), and upon the question whether any opportunity was afforded in the courts of the state for a judicial review of an order of the Commission, the District Court found serious uncertainty because of 'diametrically opposed decisions' of the state court. And as it did not appear that 'a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy' could be had 'at law or in equity in the courts of such State,' the District Court took jurisdiction and granted an injunction pending a hearing upon the merits. 9 F.Supp. 709, 710.\n We find no error in that action. An examination of the decisions of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma confirms the conclusion reached by the court below as to the uncertainty with which it was confronted and the consequent lack of the effective judicial remedy in the state cou ts which was contemplated by the Act of May 14, 1934. The question presented on this appeal from the interlocutory order is whether the District Court had jurisdiction and, if so, whether it abused its discretion in issuing the injunction.

Appellants' counsel invoke the decision of the Supreme Court of Oklahoma in Oklahoma Cotton Ginners' Association v. State, 51 P.(2d) 327, but it is unnecessary to analyze that decision or to attempt to determine its import in relation to subsequent litigation, as the decision was rendered after this suit was brought and the interlocutory injunction had been \n\n[296 U.S. 452, 459]\n\u00a0\n granted. The jurisdiction of the District Court had already attached, and there is no ground for concluding that the granting of the injunction was an improvident exercise of judicial discretion.\n The decree is affirmed. \n\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDEL VECCHIO v. BOWERS(1935)\nNo. 37\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 280, 281]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James E. McCabe, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n Mr. John H. Burnett, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case involves the application of sections 3(b) and 20(d) of the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act,1 to the respondent's claim of compensation for the death of her husband, Jeff Bowers, who died \n\n[296 U.S. 280, 282]\n\u00a0\n from a bullet wound inflicted while he was on duty in Del Vecchio's store in the District of Columbia. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n Evidence adduced at the hearing before a Deputy Compensation Commissioner tended to establish the following facts: On the morning of September 10, 1931, Bowers discovered a broken fastening on a door leading into an alley in the rear of the premises and engaged a carpenter to make repairs. The latter, while so occupied, hearing a sound like the bursting of an electric light bulb, followed by groans, entered the store and found Bowers lying on the floor. Death ensued without recovery of consciousness. An automatic pistol, owned by the decedent, which he kept in a drawer under a counter, was found in the partly closed drawer. There was blood in the drawer and on the counter near it. The bullet had entered the chest about three and one-half inches to the left of the median line and one inch above the nipple, emerged from the back of the body approximately in line with the point of entrance, and lodged in a paint can on a shelf behind the drawer about five feet above the floor. The ejected shell lay some twelve feet to the left of the drawer where it would naturally fall if the decedent had stood in front of the drawer, between the counter and the shelf, and held the pistol in his right hand pointing at his chest. Ballistic tests traced shell and bullet to the pistol. There were no identifiable finger-prints upon the weapon, but an indistinct print of the side of a finger was discernible. The front of Bowers' shirt bore grains of unburned powder which, with the condition of the material about the hole in the garment, indicated that the muzzle of the weapon had been held within two or three inches of the body. No rags or other material were discovered such as would suggest that Bowers was \n\n[296 U.S. 280, 283]\n\u00a0\n cleaning the pistol. The victim of such a wound could have taken the few steps from the place where the gun was found to that where his body lay.\n The parties agree the injury was self-inflicted, but are in controversy as to whether it was accidental or intentional. According to the respondent's evidence, Bowers was in good health, of a happy disposition, and in good financial condition; his accounts were in order; on the evening before his death he had written to his mother a cheerful letter in which he stated he would soon write her again; and the same evening he had promised a friend to bring him from the store some goods which the friend desired to purchase. The petitioners adduced evidence that Bowers had suffered from an infection of the ear and undergone a mastoid operation; about ten days before his death he visited a specialist to whom he complained of pain in the ear and headaches which seemed to be increasing. He was advised another mastoid operation might be necessary and was sent to a hospital for an X-ray examination. He submitted to the examination, which disclosed the presence of pus in the middle ear, but did not thereafter return to the physician whom he had consulted.\n The Deputy Commissioner denied an award of compensation, holding claimant had failed to establish that Bowers' duties required the use of a weapon and there was therefore no showing that his injury arose out of his employment. Upon a bill filed3 the Supreme Court of the District set aside the order, holding the keeping of the pistol in the store, although unknown to the employer, was in furtherance of the latter's interest, the find- \n\n[296 U.S. 280, 284]\n\u00a0\n ing to the contrary was wholly unsupported, and the evidence tended to prove the death was due to accident. The Court of Appeals concurred in the view that an award should not have been refused on the ground that the injury did not arise out of the employment; but as the case was tried on the theory of suicide, and the Deputy Commissioner had made no finding upon this issue, remanded the cause for further findings. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The Deputy Commissioner reconsidered the case upon the record as originally made before him and, finding the death suicidal, again refused an award. The respondent then instituted the present proceeding to have this action set aside. The Supreme Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals reversed, 5 declaring the finding of suicide not to be in accordance with law because, though the act withholds compensation where an employee willfully kills himself,6 section 20(d) creates a presumption, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, that the injury was not willfully inflicted. \n7\n The court found the evidence as consistent with accident as with suicide and said that in such circumstances the presumption required a finding in favor of the claimant; adding that whatever measure of proof may generally suffice to support other findings of a deputy commissioner, a finding of suicide, in the absence of substantial evidence, is not in accord- \n\n[296 U.S. 280, 285]\n\u00a0\n ance with law. Substantial evidence, said the court, must be such as to induce conviction and the evidence upon which the officer here acted did not reach that standard.\n In the view that the case does not fall within rule 38 [28 USCA following section 354], the respondent opposed the issuance of a writ of certiorari. The objection might be valid if the statute were confined in its operation to the District of Columbia. We will not ordinarily review decisions of the United States Court of Appeals, which are based upon statutes so limited or which declare the common law of the District. The Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, however, is national in scope, and a decision with respect to its enforcement constitutes a precedent of general application. We therefore granted the writ because of the important question as to the effect of section 20(d).\n We hold that the decision of the Deputy Commissioner should not have been annulled. The relevant substantive section of the act directs that no compensation shall be payable if the injury was occasioned by the willful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself; the adjective section creates a presumption that the injury was not so occasioned, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. The question is whether, as the court below thought, the presumption has the quality of affirmative evidence. The answer must be that it has not.\n When a trier of facts is to be persuaded of the truth of a disputed proposition, one or the other of the parties, the proponent or the opponent, has the burden of going forward with evidence. In the present instance, the fact that the wound was self-inflicted permits but one of two conclusions; either the decedent accidentally killed himself, or he committed suicide. Considerations of fairness and experience in human affairs induce fact-finding bodies, where there is a balance of probability, to \n\n[296 U.S. 280, 286]\n\u00a0\n adopt a working assumption as the basis of a conclusion, unless and until the facts are developed by evidence. \n8\n The natural love of life, the comparative infrequency of suicide as contrasted with accident, and the likelihood that testimony as to the cause of death would be more readily available to the employer than to the claimant justify a presumption, which the law indulges in such a case, that the death was accidental. \n9\n The act under consideration, however, does not leave the matter to be determined by the general principles of law, but announces its own rule, to the effect that the claimant, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, shall have the benefit of the presumption of accidental death. The employer must rebut this prima facies. The statement in the act that the evidence to overcome the effect of the presumption must be substantial adds nothing to the well-understood principle that a finding must be supported by evidence. \n10\n Once the employer has carried his burden by offering testimony sufficient to justify a finding of suicide, the presumption falls out of the case. It never had and cannot acquire the attribute of evidence in the claimant's favor. \n11\n Its only office is to control the result where there is an entire lack of competent evidence. If the employer alone adduces evidence which tends to support the theory of suicide, the case must be decided upon that evidence. Where the claimant offers substantial evidence in opposi- \n\n[296 U.S. 280, 287]\n\u00a0\n tion, as was the case here, the issue must be resolved upon the whole body of proof pro and con;12 and if it permits an inference either way upon the question of suicide, the Deputy Commissioner and he alone is empowered to draw the inference; his decision as to the weight of the evidence may not be disturbed by the court. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n For these reasons, we are of opinion the Court of Appeals erred in holding that as the evidence on the issue of accident or suicide was, in its judgment, evenly balanced, the presumption must tip the scales in favor of accident. The only matter for decision was whether the affirmative finding of suicide was supported by evidence. It is clear that it was so supported and that the court should therefore not have set aside the Deputy Commissioner's order.\n The judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] March 4, 1927, c. 509, 44 Stat. 1424, 1426, 1436, U.S.C. tit. 33,  903(b), 920(d), 33 USCA  903(b), 920(d). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The statute is made a workmen's compensation law for the District of Columbia by the Act of May 17, 1928, c. 612, 45 Stat. 600 (D.C.

CORPORATION TAX APPEAL BOARD(1935)\nNo. 272\nArgued: December 14, 1934Decided: January 14, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Victor Klein, of Detroit, Mich., Alfred A. Cook, of New York City, and Thomas G. Long, of Detroit, Mich., for appellant.\n Messrs. Patrick H. O'Brien and Alice E. Alexander, both of Lansing, Mich., for respondent. \n\n[294 U.S. 83, 84]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant, incorporated under the laws of Michigan, owns and operates an international highway bridge across the Detroit river. That State demanded that it pay, for 1933, the tax laid by the Act of 1921 as amended ( No. 85,  4, 5, Public Acts 1921, as amended by No. 175, Public Acts 1929) which requires that 'every corporation organized or doing business under the laws of this state ... shall ... for the privilege of exercising its franchise and of transacting its business within this state, pay ... an annual fee ... upon each dollar of its paid-up capital and surplus ...'; but no property or capital located without the state 'and none of the capital or surplus of such corporation represented by property exclusively used in interstate commerce, shall in any case enter into the computation. ...'\n The Supreme Court of the State sustained the tax. A reversal is sought upon two grounds.\n That 'the only power it (the corporation) has is to engage exclusively in foreign commerce'; to tax the privilege of doing this would burden such commerce and offend the Federal Constitution.\n Also, that if the corporation is subject to the challenged tax, the statute requires the capital represented by the bridge structure to be excluded from the computation since this is used exclusively in foreign commerce.\n The imposition has been characterized by the court below as 'a privilege tax imposed as an incident to the right to be a corporation, and exercise corporate functions by means of paid-up capital and surplus.' In re Detroit & Windsor Ferry Co., 232 Mich. 574, 205 N.W. 102, 103; In re Detroit International Bridge Co., 257 Mich. 52, 240 N.W. 68; Michigan v. Michigan Trust Co., \n286 \nU.S. 334\n, 52 S.Ct. 512; Anglo- Chilean Nitrate Sales Corp. v. Alabama, \n288 \nU.S. 218\n, 53 S.Ct. 373. It held the provision of the statute excluding from the computation all property used exclusively in interstate \n\n[294 U.S. 83, 85]\n\u00a0\n commerce (and foreign commerce) inapplicable, since the company 'is not engaged in foreign commerce and its property is not so used by it.'\n In Detroit International Bridge Co. v. Corporation Tax Appeal Board, \n287 \nU.S. 295\n, 53 S.Ct. 137, 138, we considered appellant's claim to exemption from the demand for 1930, under the same statute. It there appeared that in addition to general power to own and operate the bridge, and do whatever is related to that enterprise, the corporation had authority to carry on other business in Michigan and elsewhere. 'It has failed to establish that it has no power to carry on any business that is not within the protection of the commerce clause.' Consequently we did not consider whether it was engaging in foreign commerce, but affirmed the judgment below upholding the tax.\n Subsequent to our decision, and prior to the tax year 1933, the corporate charter was amended. The powers were limited and stated thus:\n'To operate the highway bridge, known as the Ambassador Bridge, across the Detroit River from Detroit, Michigan, to Sandwich, Province of Ontario, Canada, and the approaches and the appurtenances thereto, and to own all or part of said bridge and approaches and appurtenances thereto.\n\n'To maintain and operate said bridge and approaches and appurtenances thereto for the use of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and to charge and collect tolls for such use.'\n\n The record discloses that the appellant owns, maintains, and operates a bridge between Michigan and Canada across the Detroit river; that for passing over this it demands and collects tolls from vehicles and pedestrians. It 'conveys no persons or goods across the international boundary line. It merely collects tolls from such persons as use it (the bridge). It provides an instrumentality which others may use in conducting foreign commerce.' \n\n[294 U.S. 83, 86]\n\u00a0\n Unless, by reason of what appellant is now shown to do, it engages in foreign commerce, then, considering our ruling upon the appeal challenging the tax for 1930 (\n287 \nU.S. 295\n, 53 S.Ct. 137), clearly, the judgment below must be affirmed. The argument for reversal is, of course, ineffective if ownership and operation of the bridge do not constitute foreign commerce.\n After much consideration, and notwithstanding emphatic dissent, Henderson Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, \n166 \nU.S. 150\n, 17 S.Ct. 532, held that a Kentucky corporation which owned and operated a bridge over the Ohio river between that State and Indiana, and collected compensation from railroads using the structure, was not engaged in interstate commerce. By Chief Justice Fuller this court said (page 153 of 166 U.S., 17 S.Ct. 532, 533):\n'The company was chartered by the state of Kentucky to build and operate a bridge, and the state could properly include the franchises it had granted in the valuation of the company's property for taxation. Central Pacific Railroad v. California, \n162 \nU.S. 91\n, 16 S.Ct. 766 (40 L.Ed. 903). The regulation of tolls for transportation over the bridge considered in Covington & Cincinnati Bridge Co. v. Kentucky, \n154 \nU.S. 204\n, 14 S.Ct. 1087 (38 L.Ed. 962), presented an entirely different question.\n\n'Clearly, the tax was not a tax on the interstate business carried on over or by means of the bridge, because the bridge company did not transact such business. That business was carried on by the persons and corporations which paid the bridge company tolls for the privilege of using the bridge.'\n\n We find no adequate reason for departing from the view so expressed. The judgment of the court below must be affirmed.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in the result. \n\n\n\n","44":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDI GIOVANNI v. CAMDEN FIRE INS. ASS'N(1935)\nNo. 28\nArgued: October 23, 1935Decided: November 11, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Harry L. Jacobs, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioners.\n Messrs. Fenton Hume and Hume & Raymond, all of Kansas City, Mo., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit in equity, brought in the District Court for Western Missouri by respondent, a New Jersey fire insurance company, against petitioners, citizens of Missouri, to cancel two insurance policies. One, for $3,000, was issued to petitioners, who are husband and wife, to insure them against loss by fire of a building which they held as tenants by the entirety. The other, for $1,500, was issued to the husband to insure his personal property located in the building. On motion to dismiss the bill of complaint for want of equity and want of jurisdiction, the District Court dismissed the suit on the ground that the amount in controversy did not exceed $3,000. Its decree was reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 75 F.(2d) 808. This Court granted certiorari, \n295 \nU.S. 728\n, 55 S.Ct. 834, to settle an important question of federal law affecting the jurisdiction of federal courts.\n The bill of complaint alleges that the petitioners procured the two policies from respondent by representing \n\n[296 U.S. 64, 67]\n\u00a0\n that they would not effect insurance on the property in excess of a stated amount; that thereafter they did effect insurance with respondent and other companies in excess of that amount, and in excess of the value of the insured property, and then caused the property to be destroyed by fire, all in execution of a conspiracy between them. It avers that petitioners have filed proofs of loss with respondent, and that they threaten to and are about to begin suits at law against respondent to recover the full amounts of its policies.\n As the two policies are separate contracts, with different beneficiaries, insuring different properties, it is conceded that no suit at law could be maintained upon them in the federal courts, since neither exceeds $3,000, the amount requisite for the jurisdiction of the federal courts, and the two independent causes of action upon them could not be joined in a single suit at law. The Court of Appeals held that the jurisdictional requirement was satisfied by the expedient of seeking cancellation of the two policies in a single suit in equity, wherein their amounts might be united. It recognized that jurisdiction cannot ordinarily be conferred on a federal court by joining in a single suit separate causes of action in none of which is the amount involved more than $3,000, although their aggregate exceeds that sum. Walter v. Northeastern Railroad Co., \n147 \nU.S. 370\n, 13 S.Ct. 348; Citizens Bank of Louisiana v. Cannon, \n164 \nU.S. 319\n, 17 S.Ct. 89. But it applied the doctrine sanctioned by this Court in Woodmen of the World v. O'Neill, \n266 \nU.S. 292\n, 45 S.Ct. 49; and McDaniel v. Traylor, \n212 \nU.S. 428\n, 29 S.Ct. 343, that, in a bill to restrain the maintenance of vexatious suits by numerous parties pursuant to a conspiracy among them, the allegations of conspiracy are sufficient to 'tie together' the amounts involved in the several suits so that their aggregate is deemed to be the amount in controversy. The Court of Appeals thought that the equity powers of the District Court were rightly invoked by the allegations that \n\n[296 U.S. 64, 68]\n\u00a0\n the two policies were obtained by fraud, and by the prayer for their cancellation; and that the right to this relief was not defeated by the existence of an adequate remedy at law, since it would be necessary to establish the defense to the policies in two suits at law instead of in one in equity, and more especially because the adequate remedy at law which will prevent resort to equity in the federal courts is that available in the federal courts at law, where the suits could not be heard for want of the jurisdictional amount.\n We address ourselves only to the question whether the equitable relief is warranted, leaving aside doubts whether the present case, by the allegation that the insurance was effected and the loss caused pursuant to a conspiracy, is brought within the peculiar doctrine of Woodmen of the World v. O'Neill, supra, where the conspiracy was to abuse the processes of the courts by the prosecution of groundless suits.\n\n 1. \nThis Court has recently pointed out that equity will not compel the cancellation and surrender of an insurance policy procured by fraud where the loss has occurred and a suit at law to recover the amount of the loss is pending or threatened. Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n293 \nU.S. 379\n, 55 S.Ct. 310. The alleged fraud of petitioners, as well as their alleged destruction of the property insured, are defenses available in suits at law upon the policies. While equity may afford relief quia timet by way of cancellation of a document if there is a danger that the defense to an action at law upon it may be lost or prejudiced, no such danger is apparent where, as respondent's bill affirmatively shows, the loss has occurred and suits at law on the policies are imminent, and there is no showing that the defenses cannot be set up and litigated as readily in a suit at law as in equity. See Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., supra, \n293 \nU.S. 379, 384\n, 385 S., 55 S.Ct. 310. \n\n[296 U.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n 2. Section 24 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41 (28 USCA  41), restricts the jurisdiction of the Districk Courts whether at law or in equity to controversies in which the amount involved exceeds $3,000. Section 267 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  384 (28 USCA  384), forbids the maintenance of suits in equity in the courts of the United States 'in any case where a plain, adequate, and complete remedy may be had at law.' It is true, as this Court has often pointed out, that the inadequacy prerequisite to relief in a federal court of equity is measured by the character of remedy afforded in federal rather than in state courts of law. See Henrietta Mills v. Rutherford County, \n281 \nU.S. 121\n, 50 S.Ct. 270; Smyth v. Ames, \n169 \nU.S. 466\n, 18 S.Ct. 418; Risty v. Chicago, Rock Island & P.R. Co., \n270 \nU.S. 378\n, 46 S.Ct. 236. This follows from the nature of 'equity jurisdiction' of the federal courts. Whether a suitor is entitled to equitable relief in the federal courts, other jurisdictional requirements being satisfied, is strictly not a question of jurisdiction in the sense of the power of a federal court to act. It is a question only of the merits; whether the case is one for the peculiar type of relief which a court of equity is competent to give. See Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176, 181\n, 182 S., 55 S.Ct. 380, 96 A.L.R. 1166. If a plaintiff is entitled to be heard in the federal courts he may resort to equity when the remedy at law there is inadequate, regardless of the adequacy of the legal remedy which the state courts may afford. Otherwise, the suitor in the federal courts might be entitled to a remedy in equity which the federal courts of law are competent to give, or on the other hand, be obliged to forego his right to be heard in the federal courts in order to secure an equitable remedy which state courts of law do, but the federal courts of law do not, give. See Stratton v. St. Louis Southwestern R. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 530, 533\n, 534 S., 52 S.Ct. 222; Matthews v. Rodgers, \n284 \nU.S. 521, 529\n, 52 S.Ct. 217. But want of the jurisdictional amount in controversy which deprives \n\n[296 U.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n a federal court of its authority to act at law is not ground for invoking its equity powers. The statute forbids resort to equity in the federal courts when they afford adequate legal relief. It does not purport to command that equitable relief shall be given in every case in which they fail to do so. Plainly it does not so command when the want of legal remedy is due to the express prohibition of Congress, applicable alike to suits at law and in equity. See Healy v. Ratta, \n292 \nU.S. 263\n, 54 S.Ct. 700\n\n\n 3. As the nature of the relief sought, cancellation of the insurance policies and the inability of the federal courts to hear the suits at law for want of the jurisdictional amount do not warrant equitable relief, it is evident that the remedy which respondent seeks depends on the slender thread of its right to ask the federal court of equity to save it the possible inconvenience of trying two lawsuits instead of one. Avoidance of the burden of numerous suits at law between the same or different parties, where the issues are substantially the same, is a recognized ground for equitable relief in the federal courts. See Ogden City v. Armstrong, \n168 \nU.S. 224\n, 18 S.Ct. 98; Hale v. Allinson, \n188 \nU.S. 56\n, 23 S.Ct. 244. But the award of this remedy, as of other forms of equitable relief, is not controlled by rigid rules rigidly adhered to, regardless of the end to be attained and the consequences of granting the relief sought. It rests in the sound discretion of a court of equity, and a theoretical inadequacy of the legal remedy may be outweighed by other considerations. In Hale v. Allinson, supra, where this Court denied relief to a single plaintiff who sought to unite in a suit in equity claims founded upon the statutory liability of numerous stockholders of a corporation, it was careful to point out, \n188 U.S. 56\n, at page 72-78, 23 S. Ct. 244, 250: 'In any case where the facts bring it within the possible jurisdiction of the court, ... the decision must depend largely upon the question of the reasonable con- \n\n[296 U.S. 64, 71]\n\u00a0\n venience of the remedy, its effectiveness, and the inadequacy of the remedy at law. ... Each case, if not brought directly within the principle of some preceding case, must, as we think, be decided upon its own merits and upon a survey of the real and substantial convenience of all parties, the adequacy of the legal remedy, the situations of the different parties, the points to be contested and the result which would follow if jurisdiction should be assumed or denied. ... The single fact that a multiplicity of suits may be prevented by this assumption of jurisdiction is not in all cases enough to sustain it. It might be that the exercise of equitable jurisdiction on this ground, while preventing a formal multiplicity of suits, would nevertheless be attended with more and deeper inconvenience to the defendants than would be compensated for by the convenience of a single plaintifff and where the case is not covered by any controlling precedent the inconvenience might constitute good ground for denying jurisdiction.'\n Lord Hardwick, in laying down the principles which should guide the award of a bill of peace, the progenitor of the modern bill to avoid multiplicity of suits, thought that there was no occasion for the relief where the asserted right could be established by 'one or two actions at law.' Lord Tenham v. Herbert, 2 Atk. 483. While it need not be said that under no circumstances could the maintenance of two suits with common issues be so burdensome or inconvenient as to justify equitable relief, see McHenry v. Hazard, 45 N.Y. 580; compare Empire Engineering Corporation v. Mack, 217 N.Y. 85, 95, 111 N.E. 475, it is nevertheless true that the necessity of maintaining two suits involving the same issue seems rarely to have been burdensome enough to impel a plaintiff to seek equitable relief. Equity not infrequently withholds relief which it is accustomed to give where it would be burdensome to the defendant and of little advantage to the plain- \n\n[296 U.S. 64, 72]\n\u00a0\n tiff. See Harrisonville v. Dickey Clay Co., \n289 \nU.S. 334, 335\n, 338 S., 53 S. Ct. 602, and cases cited; cf. Willard v. Tayloe, 8 Wall. 557; Hennessy v. Woolworth, \n128 \nU.S. 438\n, 9 S.Ct. 109; McCabe v. Matthews, \n155 \nU.S. 550, 553\n, 15 S.Ct. 190. The present case is different from Woodmen of the World v. O'Neill, supra, where 25 groundless suits were being prosecuted against the complainant, and relief of the respondent from the not very certain risk that it may have to try two suits at law upon its two contracts would, without more, hardly compensate for depriving the petitioners of their right to a trial by jury.\n The bare fact that a plaintiff is threatened with two suits on the same document and having common issues has been held not to be enough to call for their trial in a single suit in equity. Druon v. Sullivan, 66 Vt. 609, 30 A. 98. There appears to be no case in this court where the relief has been granted in such a case, and there are numerous cases where equitable considerations were thought to require denial of the relief even though more than two suits were involved. See Matthews v. Rodgers, supra, \n284 \nU.S. 521, 529\n, 530 S., 52 S.Ct. 217, and cases cited.\n The grounds for relief to a single plaintiff which will deprive two or more defendants of their right to a jury trial must be real and substantial, and its necessity must affirmatively appear. See Boise Artesian Hot & Cold Water Co. v. Boise City, \n213 \nU.S. 276, 285\n, 286 S., 29 S. Ct. 426; Dalton Adding Machine Co. v. State Corporation Commission, \n236 \nU.S. 699, 700\n, 701 S., 35 S.Ct. 480. Respondent's bill of complaint does not show that petitioners are unwilling to abide the result of a trial of one suit as controlling both; or unwilling to try first the suit in which they would be joint plaintiffs, or that in that case the judgment would not be res adjudicata in a subsequent suit, or in any case would not suffice to dispose of both; or that upon appropriate application the state court would not direct the trial of the controlling case first. Where the burden of which the plaintiff com- \n\n[296 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n plains is so slight he should make a more persuasive showing that it can be avoided only by resort to equity. See Galion Iron Works v. Ohio Corrugated Culvert Co. (C.C.A.) 244 F. 427.\n Finally it is to be noted that this tenuous ground for the exercise of equity powers is put forward as the sole medium by which suits may be withdrawn from the jurisdiction of the state courts which could not have been removed to or otherwise brought into the federal courts. While the consequences of the court's grant of equitable relief cannot affect its power, they nevertheless have an important bearing on the exercise of the judicial discretion which must guide a court of equity in determining whether it should grant or withhold a remedy which it is within its power to give. Its discretion may properly be influenced by considerations of the public interests involved. See United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, \n289 \nU.S. 352\n, 53 S.Ct. 614, and cases cited. The power reserved to the states under the Constitution to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts may be restricted only by the action of Congress in conformity to the judicial sections of the Constitution. Congress, by its legislation, has declared its policy that cases involving less than the jurisdictional amount be left exclusively to the state courts, except that a judgment of the highest court of the state adjudicating a federal right may be reviewed by this Court. See Healy v. Ratta, supra, \n292 \nU.S. 263, 269\n, 270 S., 54 S.Ct. 700. Courts of equity, in the exercise of their discretionary powers, should recognize this policy by scrupulous regard for the rightful independence of the state governments and a remedy infringing that independence, which might otherwise be given, should be withheld if sought on slight or inconsequential grounds. See Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176, 185\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, 96 A.L.R. 1166; Matthews v. Rodgers, supra, \n284 \nU.S. 521\n, 52 S.Ct. 217; cf. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n290 U.S. 264\n, 271-273, 54 S.Ct. 154; United States ex rel. Kennedy v. Tyler, \n269 \nU.S. 13\n, 46 S.Ct. 1. \n\n[296 U.S. 64, 74]\n\u00a0\n We think the threatened injury to respondent is of too slight moment to justify a federal court of equity, in the exercise of its discretion, in according a remedy which would entail denial of a jury trial to the petitioners and withdraw from the jurisdiction of the state courts suits which could not otherwise be brought into the federal courts.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","45":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDIMICK v. SCHIEDT(1935)\nNo. 78\nArgued: November 9, 1934Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 474, 475]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. David H. Fulton and Leo M. Harlow, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. John G. Palfrey, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought by respondent (plaintiff) against petitioner (defendant) in the federal District Court for the District of Massachusetts to recover damages for a personal injury resulting from the alleged negligent operation of an automobile on a public highway in Massachusetts. The jury returned a verdict in favor of respondent for the sum of $500. Respondent moved for a new trial on the grounds that the verdict was contrary to the weight of the evidence, that it was a compromise verdict, and that the damages allowed were inadequate. The trial court ordered a new trial upon the last-named \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 476]\n\u00a0\n ground, unless petitioner would consent to an increase of the damages to the sum of $1,500. Respondent's consent was neither required nor given. Petitioner, however, consented to the increase, and, in accordance with the order of the court, a denial of the motion for new trial automatically followed. Respondent appealed to the Circuit Court of Appeals, where the judgment was reversed; the court holding that the conditional order violated the Seventh Amendment of the Federal Constitution in respect of the right of trial by jury. 70 F.(2d) 558, 562. That court recognized the doctrine, frequently stated by this court, that in the case of an excessive verdict it is within the power of the trial court to grant defendant's motion for a new trial unless plaintiff remit the amount deemed to be excessive, but held that the trial court was without power to condition the allowance of plaintiff's motion for a new trial upon the refusal of defendant to consent to an increase in the amount of damages.\n The Seventh Amendment provides:\n'In suits at common law, where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.'\n\n Section 269 of the Judicial Code, as amended, U.S.C. title 28,  391 ( 28 USCA  391), confers upon all federal courts power to grant new trials 'in cases where there has been a trial by jury, for reasons for which new trials have usually been granted in the courts of law. ...'\n In order to ascertain the scope and meaning of the Seventh Amendment, resort must be had to the appropriate rules of the common law established at the time of the adoption of that constitutional provision in 1791. Thompson v. Utah, \n170 \nU.S. 343, 350\n, 18 S.Ct. 620; Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263. A careful examination of the English reports prior to that time fails to disclose any \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 477]\n\u00a0\n authoritative decision sustaining the power of an English court to increase, either absolutely or conditionally, the amount fixed by the verdict of a jury in an action at law, with certain exceptions.\n\n 1. \nIn actions for mayhem, there are numerous ancient cases to be found in the year books, and occasional cases at a somewhat later period, in which the right of the court to increase damages awarded plaintiff, super visum vulneris, is recognized. We deem it unnecessary to catalogue or review these cases. Many of them are referred to in 2 Bacon's Abridgment (7th Ed.) 611, and Sayer's Law of Damages (1770) p. 173 et seq. The last case called to our attention or that we have been able to find that recognized the rule is that of Brown v. Seymour (1742) 1 Wils. 5, where the court, while conceding its power to increase damages upon view of the party maimed, refused to exercise it, holding the damages awarded were sufficient. We have found no case where the power was exercised affirmatively since Burton v. Baynes (1733), reported in Barne's Practice Cases, 153, where the court, upon view of the injury, increased the damages from 11, 14 s., to 50. The power of the trial court to increase damages in such cases was seldom exercised; and it seems quite clear, from an examination of the decisions and of the English Abridgments, that the generally approved practice confined its exercise to the court sitting en banc. Moreover, the application for the increase was made by the plaintiff, considered upon a view of his wound, and, when favorably acted upon, granted absolutely and not as a condition upon which to base a denial of a new trial. Indeed, the practice of granting new trials in such cases did not come into operation until a later date. In any event, the rule was obsolete in England at the time of the adoption of the Constitution; and we are unable to find that it ever was acted upon or accepted in the colonies, or by any of the federal or state courts since the adoption of the Constitu- \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 478]\n\u00a0\n tion. It was expressly rejected in an early case in South Carolina. McCoy v. Lemon, 11 Rich. 165, 70 Am.Dec. 246. There the plaintiff, as a result of an altercation with the defendant, lost an eye and the use of one thumb. The jury returned a verdict for $30. The trial court, although conceding the inadequacy of the damages, held that no court possessed the power to bring about an increase or decrease of the amount found by a jury in any other way than by granting a new trial. The Court of Appeals sustained the trial court. 'Not a single case,' the appellate court said, 'has been found in any book of American Reports in support of the present motion, notwithstanding the great research displayed by counsel. Neither has there been for a period of more than a century any recognition of the rule by any adjudged case in England to which we have been able to procure access.' After pointing out the jealous regard of the American people, as evidenced by constitutions and legislation, for the right of jury trial, the court said that the judgment of the jury had been incorporated as an indispensable element in the judicial administration of the country; that in all cases sounding in damages these damages must be assessed by the jury and not by the court independently thereof; and that, where the verdict was excessive or trifling, the remedy was to submit the case to the judgment of another jury. In Mayne's Treatise on Damages (9th Ed.) the first edition of which appeared in 1856, after referring to the long current of English decisions in respect of the power of the court to increase damages in mayhem cases, the author (page 571) said he was not aware of an instance in which such a jurisdiction had been exercised in modern times. And see Union Pacific Railway Co. v. Botsford, \n141 \nU.S. 250, 252\n, 11 S.Ct. 1000.\n\n 2. \nThe power of the court to increase or diminish damages assessed upon a writ of inquiry was likewise upheld; but this upon the ground that the justices might themselves have awarded damages without the writ, and the \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 479]\n\u00a0\n inquisition, therefore, was nothing more than an inquest for their information. Sayer's Law of Damages, 194; Beardmore v. Carrington, 2 Wils. 244, 248; Brooke's New Cases, March's Translation, 56, 57; 2 Bacon's Abridgement (7th Ed.) 612. But even this rule seems long since to have fallen into disuse; the more modern practice being to award a new writ of inquiry in all cases in which the court would award a new trial. Mayne's Treatise on Damages, 572, 573, citing Chitty's Practice (14th Ed.) p. 1326\n\n\n 3. So it was held in some of the old cases that, where the amount of plaintiff's demand was certain, as, for example, in an action of debt, the court had authority to increase or abridge the verdict of the jury. Mayne's Treatise on Damages, 571; Sayer's Law of Damages, 177.\n In Beardmore v. Carrington, supra, decided in 1764, the court reviewed the subject and reached the conclusion that the English courts were without power to either increase or abridge damages in any action for a personal tort, unless in the exceptional cases just noted. The decision is most instructive, as a brief quotation will show (the italics are in the original):\n'It is clear,' the court said at page 248 of 2 Wils., 'that the practice of granting new trials in modern, and that courts anciently never exercised this power, but in some particular cases they corrected the damages from evidence laid before them. There is great difference between cases of damages which (may) be certainly seen, and such as are ideal, as between assumpsit, trespass for goods where the sum and value may be measured, and actions of imprisonment, malicious prosecution, slander and other personal torts, where the damages are matter of opinion, speculation, ideal; there is also a difference between a principal verdict of a jury, and a writ of inquiry of damages, the latter being only an inquest of office to inform the conscience of the court, and which they might have assessed \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 480]\n\u00a0\n themselves without any inquest at all; only in the case of maihem, courts have in all ages interposed in that single instance only; as to the case of the writ of inquiry in the year-book of H.4, we doubt whether what is said by the court in that case be right, That they would abridge the damages unless the plaintiff would release part thereof, because there is not one case to be found in the year-books wherever the court abridged the damages after a principal verdict, and this is clear down to the time of Palmer's Rep. 314. much less have they interposed in increasing damages, except in the case of maihem. ...'\n\n Sayer, writing between 1765 and 1770 (Sayer's Law of Damages, 173) says that the power of increasing or abridging damages which have been assessed by the jury 'has not for many years been exercised by courts in any action except in an action for a corporal hurt'; by which he means, as appears further along, in cases of mayhem. Mayne, in the treatise already cited, says (page 571) that it was always admitted 'that in cases where the amount of damages was uncertain their assessment was a matter so peculiarly within the province of the jury that the Court should not alter it.' Recent English decisions fully confirm this view in respect of the common-law rule as it existed at the time of the adoption of the Constitution. Thus Mayne (page 580) says:\n'When an excessive verdict is given, it is usual for the judge to suggest to counsel to agree on a sum, to prevent the necessity of a new trial. In the absence of agreement the Court has no power to reduce the damages to a reasonable sum instead of ordering a new trial. It would seem also from what was said in the case in which this was recently decided, that where the damages are too small, the Court cannot with the defendant's consent increase them, if the plaintiff asks for a new trial.'\n\n It is true that Belt v. Lawes, L.R. 12 Q.B.Div. 356, upheld the authority of the court to deny a new trial \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 481]\n\u00a0\n upon the consent of the plaintiff to reduce the damages to an amount which the court would consider not excessive had they been given by the jury; and that the Master of the Rolls in his opinion declared that he was by no means prepared to say that the court might not refuse a new trial if a defendant would agree that the damages should be larger. But this doctrine was expressly repudiated by the House of Lords in Watt v. Watt, L.R. (1905) A.C. 115; and Belt v. Lawes was definitely overruled.\n In the Watt Case, the principal opinion (Pages 119, 120 of (1905) A.C .) pointed out that the notion that the court with the consent of the plaintiff could reduce the amount of the damages probably arose from the fact that in the old cases the courts had 'adopted the somewhat unconstitutional proceeding of refusal to give the plaintiff judgment unless he would consent to reduce his claim to what ought to be considered reasonable'; that this indirect method shows that the plaintiff's assent was required; and that, since the defendant was not likely to refuse his assent to a proceeding intended for his benefit, the theory of the cases seems to have been that the right of the court to interfere with the verdict depended upon the assent of both parties. It was conceded in the opinions delivered to the House that there had been a certain amount of practice in accordance with the course complained of, but in principle, it was said, this practice was indefensible, and that no reasoned vindication of it had been found. The prevailing opinions in Barbour & Co. v. Deutsche Bank, L.R. (1919) A.C. 304, while distinguishing the case then under review, are (as all the opinions are) in full accord with the decision in the Watt Case. Lord Phillimore, in the course of his opinion (page 335 of L.R. (1919) A.C.) characterized that decision as one of inconvenient rigor but nevertheless unimpeachable and logical. The principle established, he said, was this: \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 482]\n\u00a0\n 'Where damages are at large and the Court of Appeal is of opinion that the sum awarded is so unreasonable as to show that the jury has not approached the subject in a proper judicial temper, has admitted considerations which it ought not to have admitted, or rejected or neglected considerations which it ought to have applied, it is the right of the party aggrieved to have a new trial. He is not to be put off by the Court saying that it will form its opinion as to the proper sum to be awarded, and reduce or enlarge the damages accordingly. He is entitled to an assessment by a jury which acts properly. He is not to be put off by a composite decision, or I might describe it as a resultant of two imperfect forces-an assessment partly made by a jury which has acted improperly and partly by a tribunal which has no power to assess.'\n From the foregoing, and from many other English authorities which we have examined but deem it unnecessary to cite, we conclude that, while there was some practice to the contrary in respect of decreasing damages, the established practice and the rule of the common law, as it existed in England at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, forbade the court to increase the amount of damages awarded by a jury in actions such as that here under consideration.\n We could well rest this opinion upon that conclusion, were it not for the contention that our federal courts from a very early day have upheld the authority of a trial court to deny a motion for new trial because damages were found to be excessive, if plaintiff would consent to remit the excessive amount, and that this holding requires us to recognize a similar rule in respect of increasing damages found to be grossly inadequate. There is a decision by Mr. Justice Story, sitting on circuit, authorizing such a remittitur, as early as 1822. Blunt v. Little, Fed. Cas. No. 1,578, 3 Mason, 102. There, the jury returned a verdict \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 483]\n\u00a0\n for $2,000 damages, suffered as a result of a malicious arrest. Defendant moved for a new trial on the ground that the damages were excessive. The court asserted its power to grant a new trial upon that ground, but directed that the cause should be submitted to another jury unless plaintiff was willing to remit $500 of the damages. This view of the matter was accepted by this court in Northern Pacific R.R. .co. v. Herbert, \n116 \nU.S. 642, 646\n, 647 S., 6 S.Ct. 590, and has been many times reiterated. See, for example, Arkansas Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann, \n130 \nU.S. 69, 73\n, 9 S.Ct. 458; Kennon v. Gilmer, \n131 \nU.S. 22, 29\n, 9 S.Ct. 696; Koenigsberger v. Richmond Silver Min. Co., \n158 \nU.S. 41, 52\n, 15 S.Ct. 751; German Alliance Ins. Co. v. Hale, \n219 \nU.S. 307, 312\n, 31 S.Ct. 246; Gila Valley Ry. Co. v. Hall, \n232 U.S. 94\n, 103-105, 34 S.Ct. 229.\n Since the decision of Mr. Justice Story in 1822, this court has never expressed doubt in respect of the rule, and it has been uniformly applied by the lower federal courts. It is, however, remarkable that in none of these cases was there any real attempt to ascertain the common-law rule on the subject. Mr. Justice Story, in the Blunt Case, cited two English cases antedating the Constitution in support simply of his conclusion that the court had power to grant a new trial for excessive damages, and thereupon announced without more that, unless the plaintiff should be willing to remit $500 of his damages, the cause would be submitted to another jury. For the latter conclusion, no authority whatever was cited. The plaintiff remitted the amount, and the motion was overruled. The opinion in the Herbert Case was delivered by Mr. Justice Field. Upon the question now under consideration, the opinion does no more than declare that the exaction, as a condition of refusing a new trial, that plaintiff should remit a portion of the amount awarded by the verdict, was a matter within the discretion of the court, in support of which two American state cases and \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 484]\n\u00a0\n the Blunt Case are cited. The common law in respect of the matter is not referred to. The state cases cited are equally silent in respect of the common-law rule.\n The nearest approach to a reasoned opinion on the subject in any of the decisions is found in Arkansas Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann, supra. In that opinion, the court states the contention to be that to make the decision of the motion for new trial depend upon a remission of part of the verdict is in effect a re-examination by the court in a mode not known at the common law of facts tried by the jury, and therefore a violation of the Seventh Amendment. The court decided against this contention upon the authority of the Blunt Case, the Herbert Case, and certain American state decisions. English cases were referred to only upon the point that the court had authority to set aside the verdict and grant a new trial where the damages are palpably or outrageously excessive. No attempt was made to seek the common-law rule, in respect of the precise contention which was made, by an examination of the English decisions or of the English practice prior to the adoption of the Constitution.\n In the last analysis, the sole support for the decisions of this court and that of Mr. Justice Story, so far as they are pertinent to cases like that now in hand, must rest upon the practice of some of the English judges-a practice which has been condemned as opposed to the principles of the common law by every reasoned English decision, both before and after the adoption of the Federal Constitution, which we have been able to find.\n In the light reflected by the foregoing review of the English decisions and commentators, it therefore may be that, if the question of remittitur were now before us for the first time, it would be decided otherwise. But, first announced by Mr. Justice Story in 1822, the doctrine has been accepted as the law for more than a hundred years and uniformly applied in the federal courts \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 485]\n\u00a0\n during that time. And, as it finds some support in the practice of the English courts prior to the adoption of the Constitution, we may assume that in a case involving a remittitur, which this case does not, the doctrine would not be reconsidered or disturbed at this late day.\n Nevertheless, this court in a very special sense is charged with the duty of construing and upholding the Constitution; and, in the discharge of that important duty, it ever must be alert to see that a doubtful precedent be not extended by mere analogy to a different case if the result will be to weaken or subvert what it conceives to be a principle of the fundamental law of the land. Compare Judson v. Gray, 11 N.Y. 408, 412.\n That rule applies with peculiar force to the present case, since, accepting Arkansas Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann, supra, and like cases, as settling the precise question there involved, they do not conclude the question here presented; that is to say, the power to conditionally increase the verdict of a jury does not follow as a necessary corollary from the power to conditionally decrease it. As the court below correctly pointed out. in the case of a conditional remittitur, 'a jury has already awarded a sum in excess of that fixed by the court as a basis for a remittitur, which, at least, finds some support in the early English practice; while in the second case no jury has ever passed on the increased amount, and the practice has no precedent according to the rules of the common law.'\n The right of trial by jury is of ancient origin, characterized by Blackstone as 'the glory of the English law' and 'the most transcendent privilege which any subject can enjoy' (Bk. 3, p. 379); and, as Justice Story said (2 Story on the Constitution,  1779), '... the Constitution would have been justly obnoxious to the most conclusive objection if it had not recognized and confirmed it in the most solemn terms.' With, perhaps, some exceptions, trial by jury has always been, and still is, generally re- \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 486]\n\u00a0\n garded as the normal and preferable mode of disposing of issues of fact in civil cases at law as well as in criminal cases. Maintenance of the jury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and occupies so firm a place in our history and jurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a jury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care. Compare Patton v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 276, 312\n, 50 S.Ct. 253, 70 A.L.R. 263.\n The controlling distinction between the power of the court and that of the jury is that the former is the power to determine the law and the latter to determine the facts. In dealing with questions like the one now under consideration, that distinction must be borne steadily in mind. Where the verdict returned by a jury is palpably and grossly inadequate or excessive, it should not be permitted to stand; but, in that event, both parties remain entitled, as they were entitled in the first instance, to have a jury properly determine the question of liability and the extent of the injury by an assessment of damages. Both are questions of fact. Where the verdict is excessive, the practice of substituting a remission of the excess for a new trial is not without plausible support in the view that what remains is included in the verdict along with the unlawful excess-in that sense that it has been found by the jury-and that the remittitur has the effect of merely lopping off an excrescence. But, where the verdict is too small, an increase by the court is a bald addition of something which in no sense can be said to be included in the verdict. When, therefore, the trial court here found that the damages awarded by the jury were so inadequate as to entitle plaintiff to a new trial, how can it be held, with any semblance of reason, that that court, with the consent of the defendant only, may, by assessing an additional amount of damages, bring the constitutional right of the plaintiff to a jury trial to an end in respect of a matter of fact which no jury has ever passed upon either explicitly \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 487]\n\u00a0\n or by implication? To so hold is obviously to compel the plaintiff to forego his constitutional right to the verdict of a jury and accept 'an assessment partly made by a jury which has acted improperly, and partly by a tribunal which has no power to assess.'\n It is said that the common law is susceptible of growth and adaptation to new circumstances and situations, and that the courts have power to declare and effectuate what is the present rule in respect of a given subject without regard to the old rule; and some attempt is made to apply that principle here. The common law is not immutable, but flexible, and upon its own principles adapts itself to varying conditions. Funk v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 371\n, 54 S.Ct. 212, 93 A.L.R. 1136. But here we are dealing with a constitutional provision which has in effect adopted the rules of the common law in respect of trial by jury as these rules existed in 1791. To effectuate any change in these rules is not to deal with the common law, qua common law, but to alter the Constitution. The distinction is fundamental, and has been clearly pointed out by Judge Cooley in 1 Const. Limitations (8th Ed.) 124.\n It is worthy of note that, while for more than a century the federal courts have followed the approved practice of conditioning the allowance of a new trial on the consent of plaintiff to remit excessive damages, no federal court, so far as we can discover, has ever undertaken similarly to increase the damages, although there are numerous cases where motions for new trial have been made and granted on the ground that the verdict was inadequate. See, for example, Carter v. Wells, Fargo & Co. (C.C.) 64 F. 1005; Usher v. Scranton Ry. Co. (C.C.) 132 F. 405; Glenwood Irr. Co. v. Vallery (C.C.A.) 248 F. 483; United Press Ass'ns v. National Newspapers Ass'n (C.C.A.) 254 F. 284; Stetson v. Stindt et al. (C.C.A.) 279 F. 209. This, it is true, is but negative evidence; but it is negative evidence of more than ordinary value. For, when we consider that during \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 488]\n\u00a0\n the great length of time mentioned the federal courts were constantly applying the rule in respect of the remission of excessive damages, the circumstance that the practice here in question in respect of inadequate damages was never followed or, apparently, its approval even suggested, seems highly significant as indicating a lack of judicial belief in the existence of the power.\n State decisions in respect of the matter have been brought to our attention and have received consideration. They embody rulings both ways. A review of them, we think, would serve no useful purpose.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be reversed.\n What the trial court has done is to deny a motion for a new trial, for what seemed to it a good reason: That the defendant had given his binding consent to an increased recovery, which the court thought to be adequate, and thus to remove any substantial ground for awarding a new trial. In denying the motion, the trial judge relied on two rules of the common law which have received complete acceptance for centuries. One is that the court has power to act upon a motion to set aside the verdict of a jury because inadequate or excessive, and in its discretion to grant or deny a new trial. New York C. & H. Railroad Co. v. Fraloff, \n100 U.S. 24\n, 31; Wilson v. Everett, \n139 \nU.S. 616, 621\n, 11 S.Ct. 664; Lincoln v. Power, \n151 \nU.S. 436, 438\n, 14 S.Ct. 387. The other, which is implicit in the first, is that it has power to determine, as a matter of law, the upper and lower limits within which recovery by a plaintiff will be permitted and the authority to set aside a verdict which is not within those limits. Arkansas Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann, \n130 \nU.S. 69, 74\n, 9 S.Ct. 458. Cf. Southern Ry. Carolina Division v. Bennett, \n233 \nU.S. 80, 87\n, 34 S.Ct. 566. \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 489]\n\u00a0\n As a corollary to these rules is the further one of the common law, long accepted in the federal courts, that the exercise of judicial discretion in denying a motion for a new trial, on the ground that the verdict is too small or too large, is not subject to review on writ of error or appeal. New York C. & H. Railroad Co. v. Fraloff, supra, \n100 U.S. 31\n; Wabash Ry. Co. v. McDaniels, \n107 \nU.S. 454, 456\n, 2 S.Ct. 932; Fitzgerald & Mallory Const. Co. v. Fitzgerald, \n137 \nU.S. 98, 113\n, 11 S.Ct. 36; Wilson v. Everett, supra, \n139 \nU.S. 621\n, 11 S.Ct. 664; Lincoln v. Power, supra, \n151 \nU.S. 438\n, 14 S.Ct. 387; Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 533, 540\n, 47 S.Ct. 186. This is but a special application of the more general rule that an appellate court will not re-examine the facts which induced the trial court to grant or deny a new trial. \n1\n Barr v. Gratz, 4 Wheat. 213, 220; The Abbotsford, \n98 U.S. 440\n, 445; Railroad Co. v. Fraloff, supra, \n100 U.S. 31\n; Terre Haute & Indiana Ry. Co. v. Struble, \n109 \nU.S. 381, 384\n, 385 S., 3 S.Ct. 270; Fishburn v. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co., \n137 \nU.S. 60, 61\n, 11 S.Ct. 8; Ayers v. Watson, \n137 \nU.S. 584, 597\n, 11 S. Ct. 201; Wilson v. Everett, supra, \n139 \nU.S. 621\n, 11 S.Ct. 664; Luckenbach S.S. Co. v. United States, supra, \n272 \nU.S. 540\n, 47 S.Ct. 186.\n If the effect of what is now decided is to liberalize the traditional common-law practice so that the denial of a motion for a new trial, made on the ground that the verdict is excessive or inadequate, is subject to some sort of appellate review, the change need not be regarded as unwelcome, even though no statute has authorized it. But the question remains whether, in exercising this power of review, the trial judge should be reversed.\n The decision of the Court is rested on the ground that the Constitution prohibits the trial judge from adopting \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 490]\n\u00a0\n the practice. Accordingly, I address myself to the question of power without stopping to comment on the generally recognized advantages of the practice as a means of securing substantial justice and bringing the litigation to a more speedy and economical conclusion than would be possible by a new trial to a jury, or the extent to which that or analogous practice has been adopted and found useful in the courts of the several states. See Correction of Damage Verdicts by Remittitur and Additur, 44 Yale Law J. 318. The question is a narrow one: Whether there is anything in the Seventh Amendment or in the rules of the common law, as it had developed before the adoption of the amendment, which would require a federal appellate court to set aside the denial of the motion merely because the particular reasons which moved the trial judge to deny it are not shown to have similarly moved any English judge before 1791.\n The Seventh Amendment commands that 'in suits at common law' the right to trial by jury shall be preserved, and that 'no fact tried by a jury shall be otherwise re-examined by any court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law.' Such a provision of a great instrument of government, intended to endure for unnumbered generations, is concerned with substance and not with form. There is nothing in its history or language to suggest that the amendment had any purpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial as it was known to the common law before the adoption of the Constitution. For that reason this Court has often refused to construe it as intended to perpetuate in changeless form the minutiae of trial practice as it existed in the English courts in 1791. From the beginning, its language has been regarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the amendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 491]\n\u00a0\n trial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them from suits in equity and admiralty, see Parsons v. Bedford, 3 Pet. 433, 446, and to safeguard the jury's function from any encroachment which the common law did not permit.\n Thus interpreted. The Seventh Amendment guarantees that suitors in actions at law shall have the benefits of trial of issues of fact by a jury, but it does not prescribe any particular procedure by which these benefits shall be obtained, or forbid any which does not curtail the function of the jury to decide questions of fact as it did before the adoption of the amendment. It does not restrict the court's control of the jury's verdict, as it had previously been exercised, and it does not confine the trial judge, in determining what issues are for the jury and what for the court, to the particular forms of trial practice in vogue in 1791.\n Thus this Court has held that a federal court, without the consent of the parties, may constitutionally appoint auditors to hear testimony, examine books and accounts, and frame and report upon issues of fact, as an aid to the jury in arriving at its verdict, Ex parte Peterson, \n253 \nU.S. 300\n, 40 S.Ct. 543; it may require both a general and a special verdict and set aside the general verdict for the plaintiff and direct a verdict for the defendant on the basis of the facts specially found, Walker v. New Mexico & Southern Pacific R. Co., \n165 \nU.S. 593\n, 17 S. Ct. 421; and it may accept so much of the verdict as declares that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, and set aside so much of it as fixes the amount of the damages, and order a new trial of that issue alone, Gasoline Products Co., Inc., v. Champlin Refining Co., \n283 \nU.S. 494\n, 51 S.Ct. 513. Yet none of these procedures was known to the common law. In fact, the very practice, so firmly imbedded in federal procedure, of making a motion for a new trial directly to the trial judge, instead \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 492]\n\u00a0\n of to the court en banc, was never adopted by the common law. \n2\n But this Court has found in the Seventh Amendment no bar to the adoption by the federal courts of these novel methods of dealing with the verdict of a jury, for they left unimpaired the function of the jury to decide issues of fact, which it had exercised before the adoption of the amendment. Compare Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Ry. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 264\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 87 A.L.R. 1191.\n If we apply that test to the present case, it is evident that the jury's function has not been curtailed. After the issues of fact had been submitted to the jury and its verdict taken, the trial judge was authorized to entertain a motion to set aside the verdict and, as an incident, to determine the legal limits of a proper verdict. A denial of the motion out of hand, however inadequate the verdict, was not an encroachment upon the province of the jury as the common law defined it. It would seem not to be any the more so here because the exercise of the judge's discretion was affected by his knowledge of the fact that a proper recovery had been assured to the plaintiff by the consent of the defendant. Thus the plaintiff has suffered no infringement of a right by the denial of his motion. The defendant has suffered none because he has con- \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 493]\n\u00a0\n sented to the increased recovery, of which he does not complain.\n It is upon these grounds, as well as the further one that the denial of a new trial may not be reviewed upon appeal, see Arkansas Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann, supra, \n130 \nU.S. 75\n, 9 S.Ct. 458, that this Court has upheld the practice of the remittitur. Recognized more than a century ago by Mr. Justice Story in Blunt v. Little, Fed. Cas.

In Arkansas Valley Land & Cattle Co. v. Mann, supra, 130 U.S. at page 74, 9 S.Ct. 458, 459, in considering at length the constitutional question, this Court said:\n'The practice which this court approved in Northern Pacific Railroad v. Herbert is sustained by sound reason, and does not, in any just sense, impair the constitutional right of trial by jury. It cannot be disputed that the court is within the limits of its authority when it sets aside the verdict of the jury, and grants a new trial, where the damages are palpably or outrageously excessive. Ducker v. Wood, 1 Term R. 277; Hewlett v. Cruchley, 5 Taunt. 277, 281; authorities cited in Sedg. Dam (6th Ed.) 762, note 2. But, in considering whether a new trial should be granted upon that ground, the court necessarily determines, in its own mind, whether a verdict for a given amount would be liable to the objection that it was excessive. The authority of the court to determine whether the damages are excessive implies authority to \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 494]\n\u00a0\n determine when they are not of that character. To indicate, before passing upon the motion for a new trial, its opinion that the damages are excessive, and to require a plaintiff to submit to a new trial, unless, by remitting a part of the verdict, he removes that objection, certainly does not deprive the defendant of any right, or give him any cause for complaint.'\n\n See, also, Kennon v. Gilmer, supra, \n131 \nU.S. 29\n, 9 S.Ct. 696; Clark v. Sidway, supra, \n142 \nU.S. 690\n, 12 S.Ct. 327; Gila Valley R. Co. v. Hall, supra, \n232 \nU.S. 104\n, 34 S.Ct. 229; Belt v. Lawes, L.R. 12 Q.B.D. 356, 358.\n All that was there said is equally applicable to the present denial of a motion to set aside the verdict as inadequate. The defendant, who has formally consented to pay the increased amount, cannot complain. The plaintiff has suffered no denial of a right because the court, staying its hand, has left the verdict undisturbed, as it lawfully might have done if the defendant had refused to pay more than the verdict. The fact that in one case the recovery is less than the amount of the verdict, and that in the other it is greater, would seem to be without significance. For in neither does the jury return a verdict for the amount actually recovered, and in both the amount of recovery was fixed, not by the verdict, but by the consent of the party resisting the motion for a new trial.\n The question with which we are now concerned-what considerations shall govern an appellate review of this discretionary action of the trial court-is one unknown to the common law, which provided for no such review. We are afforded but a meager and fragmentary guide if our review is to be controlled by the Seventh Amendment, read as though it had incorporated by reference the particular details of English trial practice exhibited by the law books in 1791. We know that as late as the middle of the eighteenth century the English courts, by directing an increase of the judgment where the verdict was thought to be inadequate, had exercised an extraordinary measure \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 495]\n\u00a0\n of control over the verdict of the jury in cases of mayhem and battery; and that the practice of denying a new trial upon a remittitur had received some recognition in the English courts. Belt v. Lawes, supra, 359 of L.R. 12 Q.B.D.; Watt v. Watt, (1905) A.C. 115, 122. But in no recorded case does it appear that any English judge had considered the possibility of denying a new trial where the defendant had consented to increase the amount of recovery.\n If our only guide is to be this scant record of the practice of controlling the jury's verdict, however fragmentary the state of its development at this period, and if we must deny any possibility of change, development, or improvement, then it must be admitted that search of the legal scrap heap of a century and a half ago may commit us to the incongruous position in which we are left by the present decision: A federal trial court may deny a motion for a new trial where the plaintiff consents to decrease the judgment to a proper amount, but it is powerless to deny the motion if its judgment is influenced by the defendant's consent to a comparable increase in the recovery.\n But I cannot agree that we are circumscribed by so narrow and rigid a conception of the common law. The Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 73, which impliedly adopted the common-law rules of evidence for criminal trials in federal courts, and which gave to the federal courts jurisdiction of equity as it had then been developed in England, and the state constitutions which adopted the common law as affording rules for judicial decision, have never been construed as accepting only those rules which could then be found in the English precedents. When the Constitution was adopted, the common law was something more than a miscellaneous collection of precedents. It was a system, then a growth of some five centuries, to guide judicial decision. One of its principles, certainly as important as any other, and that which assured the possibility of the continuing vitality and usefulness of the \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 496]\n\u00a0\n system, was its capacity for growth and development, and its adaptability to every new situation to which it might be needful to apply it. 'This flexibility and capacity for growth and adaptation is,' as the Court declared in Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 530\n, 4 S.Ct. 111, 118, 'the peculiar boast and excellence of the common law.' See, also, Holden v. Hardy, \n169 U.S. 366\n, 385-387, 18 S.Ct. 383; Twining v. New Jersey, \n211 \nU.S. 78, 101\n, 29 S.Ct. 14; Funk v. United States, \n290 U.S. 371\n, 380-386, 54 S.Ct. 212, 93 A.L.R. 1136.\n This Court has recently had occasion to point out that the common-law rules, governing the admissibility of evidence and the competency of witnesses in the federal courts are not the particular rules which were in force in 1791, but are those rules adapted to present day conditions, 'in accordance with presentday standards of wisdom and justice rather than in accordance with some outworn and antiquated rule of the past.' Funk v. United States, supra, \n290 \nU.S. 382\n, 54 S.Ct. 212, 215, 93 A. L.R. 1136; see also Wolfle v. United States, \n291 \nU.S. 7, 12\n, 54 S.Ct. 279; Holden v. Hardy, supra, \n169 U.S. 385\n-387, 18 S.Ct. 383.\n The common law is not one system when it, or some part of it, is adopted by the Judiciary Act and another if it is taken over by the Seventh Amendment. If this Court could thus, in conformity to common law, substitute a new rule for an old one because it was more consonant with modern conditions, it would seem that no violence would be done to the common law by extending the principle of the remittitur to the case where the verdict is inadequate, although the common law had made no rule on the subject in 1791; and that we could not rightly refuse to apply to either the principle of general application, that it is competent to exercise a discretionary power to grant or withhold relief in any way which is not unjust. See Belt v. Lawes, supra, 358 of L.R. 12 Q.B.D.\n Appellate federal courts, although without common-law precedent, have not hesitated to resort to the remittitur where, by its use, the necessity of a new trial could justly \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 497]\n\u00a0\n be avoided. Bank of Kentucky v. Ashley, 2 Pet. 327, 329; Phillips & Colby Construction Co. v. Seymour, \n91 U.S. 646\n, 656; Hopkins v. Orr, \n124 \nU.S. 510, 514\n, 8 S.Ct. 590; Washington & Georgetown R. Co. v. Harmon, \n147 \nU.S. 571, 590\n, 13 S.Ct. 557; Hansen v. Boyd, \n161 \nU.S. 397, 411\n, 412 S., 16 S.Ct. 571. The trial judge who denies a motion for a new trial, because the plaintiff has consented to reduce, or a defendant has consented to increase, the amount of the recovery, does no more than when, sitting in equity, he withholds relief upon the compliance with a condition, the performance of which will do substantial justice. See Harrisonville v. Dickey Clay Co., \n289 \nU.S. 334, 338\n, 53 S.Ct. 602.\n To me it seems an indefensible anachronism for the law to reject the like principle of decision, in reviewing on appeal denials of motions for new trial, where the plaintiff has consented to decrease the judgment or the defendant has consented to increase it by the proper amount, or to apply it in the one case and reject it in the other. It is difficult to see upon what principle the denial of a motion for a new trial, which for centuries has been regarded as so much a matter of discretion that it is not disturbed when its only support may be a bad or inadequate reason, may nevertheless be set aside on appeal when it is supported by a good one: That the defendant has bound himself to pay an increased amount of damages which the court judicially knows is within the limits of a proper verdict.\n On this question the decisions of the English courts since the adoption of the Constitution do not have the force of precedents; they are of weight only so far as they are persuasive. It is enough to say that when in 1905 the House of Lords in Watt v. Watt, supra, overruled Belt v. Lawes, supra, and terminated the practice of the remittitur, it did not comment on the fact that it was reviewing an exercise of discretion in the denial of a new trial. So far as appears, it did not consider, in the \n\n[293 U.S. 474, 498]\n\u00a0\n light of any legal analogy, whether the denial of the motion because of the plaintiff's consent could be deemed in any proper sense an abuse of discretion.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The power of the English appellate courts to review such action has been enlarged by statute, and the motion itself must be made to the Court of Appeal.

He left surviving him his widow, and, as his heirs at law and next of kin, a brother and a dependent father, who is his administrator. The widow elected to receive compensation from the employer under the provisions of the Compensation Act. The father elected not to receive compensation and brought the present suit as administrator to recover for the death under the provisions of the Wrongful Death Act of the District. Code of Law for the District of Columbia. 1929, Title 21,  1-3. A like suit, brought by the employer against the respondent, is also pending. The Supreme Court of the District gave judgment for the defendant, sustaining a plea in abatement which set up the pendency of the suit brought by the employer and that the right to recover for the wrongful death had been assigned to the employer by operation v. Moses, \n287 \nU.S. 530\n, 53 S.Ct. 231, 77 L.Ed. The Court of Appeals affirmed, 64 App.D.C. 25, 73 F.(2d) 842, relying in part on its construction of the relevant provisions of section 33 of the Compensation Act and in part on our decision in AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, \n287 \nU.S. 53\n, 53 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 647.\n The Compensation Act establishes a scheme for compensation of an injured employee by the employer, and for the payment of benefits to a specified class of his dependents when the injury causes death. Where some person \n\n[295 U.S. 221, 223]\n\u00a0\n other than the employer is liable for damages for the injury, compensation is governed by section 33.1 Section 33(a) of the act (33 USCA  933(a) \n\n[295 U.S. 221, 224]\n\u00a0\n authorizes 'the person entitled to such compensation' to elect to receive compensation or to recover damages 'against such third person,' and section 33(b) of the act (33 USCA  933(b) provides that acceptance of such compensation 'shall operate as an assignment to the employer of all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person.'\n In AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, supra, the widow of an employee who was killed in the course of his employment, and who was also his administratrix and the sole beneficiary under both the Compensation and the Wrongful Death Acts, elected to receive compensation. It was conceded that the widow, before her election, was alone entitled to the benefit of the Wrongful Death Act, and the question was who, in consequence of her election, was the proper plaintiff to bring the action. This Court held, construing section 33(a) and (b), that the Compensation Act, called into action by her election, operated to transfer to the employer all her right of recovery under the Wrongful Death Act. Since the transfer of her entire interest was effected by section 33(b), which in terms declared that acceptance of compensation by the dependent 'shall operate as an assignment,' we thought that a complete and unqualified transfer was intended, which would authorize the employer to maintain the suit in his own name, without necessity of suing in the name of the administratrix as in the case of an assignment of a chose in action at common law.\n Similarly, section 33(c) of the act (33 USCA  933(c) provides in terms for the transfer to the employer of 'all right of the legal representative' of the deceased employee to recover for the wrongful death, where the deputy commissioner for the compensation district determines that there is no person under the Compensation Act entitled to compensation, and the employer makes the payment of $1,000 into the special compensation fund as prescribed by section 44 of the act (33 USCA  944). \n\n[295 U.S. 221, 225]\n\u00a0\n A different question is presented where the dependent who has elected to receive compensation is entitled to only a partial interest in the amount to be recovered for the death. Such is the case here. For the widow alone has elected to take compensation, and under the Wrongful Death Act,  3 (D.C. Code 1929, T. 21,  3), the proceeds of the recovery are required to be distributed among the next of kin, which includes both the widow and the father, where the decedent leaves no surviving child. Title 29, D.C. Code 1929,  284, 285, 288.\n The right of the employer to reimbursement from the recovery is derived from his subrogation, under section 33(b) of the Compensation Act, to the rights of the dependent widow to whom he is bound to pay compensation. Apart from statute, the indemnitor's right by subrogation to stand in the place of his indemnitee, who is entitled to a part only of the proceeds of a single cause of action, does not carry with it any authority to maintain the action in his own name. See Mandeville v. Welch, 5 Wheat. 277, 286; Shankland v. Washington, 5 Pet. 390; Vinal v. West Virginia Oil & Oil Land Co., \n110 \nU.S. 215\n, 4 S.Ct. 4. He is in the position of a partial assignee of the chose in action, and as such is entitled to his share of the proceeds of the action when recovered and may secure their recovery by resort to equity, in a suit joining proper parties, to compel action by the legal owner and appropriate distribution of the proceeds. See Peugh v. Porter, \n112 \nU.S. 737, 742\n, 5 S.Ct. 361; Fourth Street Bank v. Yardley, \n165 \nU.S. 634, 644\n, 17 S.Ct. 439; AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, supra, \n287 \nU.S. 530, 542\n, 53 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 647, n. 3.\n .section 33(b) purports only to assign to the employer 'all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person.' It operates to transfer to the employer only such rights as the dependent has. We do not doubt that this section, interpreted in the light of the indemnitor's common-law right of subrogation, confirms that right and is sufficient to give \n\n[295 U.S. 221, 226]\n\u00a0\n the employer as indemnity all the rights which the dependents electing to receive compensation otherwise would have to share in the benefits of the Wrongful Death Act. If they are entitled to the whole recovery, the employer may maintain the suit as in AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, supra. If their interest is less than the whole, the employer is entitled to receive their share in the proceeds of recovery and, if necessary, by appropriate proceedings to compel the administrator to bring the suit and account for its proceeds. But the section does not purport to split the cause of action. A purpose to do violence to the firmly grounded tradition of the unity of a cause of action at law, by casting on the defendant the burden of defending two suits, is hardly to be implied. See Mandeville v. Welch, supra.\n Nor, on the other hand, does the language of the section admit of a construction which would operate to transfer rights in the chose in action which the dependent electing to receive compensation did not have, or to confer upon the employer the benefit of any part of the proceeds of the recovery for wrongful death which the dependent receiving compensation could not have demanded. If section 33(d) and (e) of the act (33 USCA  933(d, e) refer, as the court below thought, to an assignment to the employer in the circumstances mentioned in section 33(b) as well as in section 33(c), they do not support any construction of section 33(b) different from that already indicated. Section 33(d) authorizes the employer, 'on account of such assignment,' to compromise the claim for damages or to institute proceedings upon it. Its provisions are permissive only. It would plainly sanction a compromise or a suit by the employer in the case where the injury did not result in death or where, as in AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, supra, the entire interest in the right to recover is vested in the employer by operation of section 33(b). But in a case like the present, where the right assigned to the employer is to receive a part only of the \n\n[295 U.S. 221, 227]\n\u00a0\n proceeds of recovery for the wrongful death, the language falls short of conferring upon him authority to compromise or sue upon claims which 'such assignment' does not operate to transfer. This conclusion is supported, if not compelled, by the clause of section 33(a), which authorizes a dependent2 of the deceased employee to elect whether to receive compensation or to recover damages against a third person, and by section 33(e), which gives to the employer as indemnity the full benefit of 'any amount recovered' by him, before turning over the balance to the personal representative of the deceased. There may be next of kin of the decedent entitled to share in the recovery for wrongful death who are not entitled to compensation, and others who elect, as provided in section 33(a) to take their share of the recovery for wrongful death instead of compensation. A construction of section 33 which would require the use of their shares to indemnify the employer, for payments to others who have elected to receive compensation, is not to be favored in the absence of language plainly requiring it.\n It is true that in the case where the injury causes the death of an employee having no dependents, and the employer pays $1,000 into the special compensation fund as required by section 44, the right of the legal representative to recover for the wrongful death is in terms assigned by section 33(c) to the employer who is authorized by section 33( e) to indemnify himself from the proceeds of recovery. \n\n[295 U.S. 221, 228]\n\u00a0\n Whatever purpose may have inspired these provisions of section 33(c),3 explicitly limited to the single case of the payment by the employer of the $1,000 into the special fund, we can find in them no warrant for giving to section 33(b) a construction which its language does not admit and which would authorize the employer to indemnify himself for payments to dependents, not necessarily limited to $1,000, at the expense of the next of kin who receive no benefit of the compensation payments.\n We conclude that where the employer is given anything to recover by a suit brought directly against the wrongdoer, it is the full recovery to which the injured employee or his personal representative would be entitled. See AEtna Life Insurance Co. v. Moses, supra, \n287 \nU.S. 530, 540\n, 53 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 647. But where the right of the dependent, to which the employer is subrogated by section 33(b), is only to a share of the proceeds of the recovery, the employer is not authorized to amintain the action for wrongful death. As statutory assignee of the rights of the dependent receiving compensation, he acquires only the rights of his assignor to compel the executor or administrator, by appropriate proceedings, to maintain the suit and to share in the proceeds of the recovery. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 221, 229]\n\u00a0\n While it seems beyond the resources of judicial ingenuity to construe the statute so as to give it a wholly consistent and harmonious operation, we think the construction which we adopt conforms to its language and to the principles of the common law, in the light of which it must be interpreted. It does not deny to the employer subrogation to the rights, of those dependents receiving compensation, to share in the recovery for wrongful death, but it leaves undisturbed the rights of the next of kin who, as section 33(a) permits, elect to receive the benefits of the Wrongful Death Act rather than compensation.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 33. (a) If on account of a disability or death for which compensation is payable under this Act (chapter) the person entitled to such compensation determines that some person other than the employer is liable in damages, he may elect, by giving notice to the deputy commissioner in such manner as the commission may provide, to receive such compensation or to recover damages against such third person.\n'(b) Acceptance of such compensation shall operate as an assignment to the employer of all right of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person, whether or not the person entitled to compensation has notified the deputy commissioner of his election.\n\n'(c) The payment of such compensation into the fund established in section 44 (section 944 of this chapter) shall operate as an assignment to the employer of all right of the legal representative of the deceased ( hereinafter referred to as 'representative') to recover damages against such third person, whether or not the representative has notified the deputy commissioner of his election.\n\n'(d) Such employer on account of such assignment may either institute proceedings for the recovery of such damages or may compromise with such third person either without or after instituting such proceeding.\n\n'(e) Any amount recovered by such employer on account of such assignment, whether or not as the result of a compromise, shall be distributed as follows:\n\n'(1) The employer shall retain an amount equal to-\n\n'(A) The expenses incurred by him in respect of such proceedings or compromise (including a reasonable attorney's fee as determined by the deputy commissioner).\n\n'(B) The cost of all benefits actually furnished by him to the employee under section 7 (section 907 of this chapter).\n\n'(C) All amounts paid as compensation, and the present value of all amounts payable as compensation, such present value to be computed in accordance with a schedule prepared by the commission, and the amounts so computed to be retained by the employer as a trust fund to pay such compensation as it becomes due and to pay any sum, in excess of such compensation, to the person entitled to compensation or to the representative; and\n\n'(2) The employer shall pay any excess to the person entitled to compensation or to the representative. ...' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 33(a) gives the election to 'the person entitled to such compensation,' and makes no express provision for the case where there is more than one dependent. Since the statute preserves to 'the' dependent the right of election to recover damages against the third person, and does not in terms give one dependent the right to elect for all, it must be deemed to give each dependent the right of election independently of the others, and the phrase 'the person entitled to such compensation' must be taken to mean each or any dependent. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] It is to be noted that in the case of assignments under section 33( c) indemnity to the employer cannot be at the expense of the dependents of the deceased. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] A like construction has been given to the similar, but not identical, compensation statute of New York. If the persons receiving compensation do not include all of the next of kin who are beneficiaries under the Wrongful Death Act, the employer or insurance carrier must prosecute his claim to share in the proceeds through the administrator as statutory trustee, and may compromise or release his own interest, but no other.

Fiddler, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent, a national banking association whose principal office and place of business is in New York, ap- \n\n[294 U.S. 199, 201]\n\u00a0\n plied for and obtained authority to operate branches in Puerto Rico, pursuant to section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act as amended (12 USCA  601).1 In 1932 the bank, as required by local law, filed with the petitioner a sworn statement of assets as a basis of assessment for taxation. By request, but under protest, it attached a memorandum stated to be for information only, in which was set forth the amount of its total assets, to sum of its capital, surplus, and undivided profits, the percentage the latter was of the former, and the value of the assets in Puerto Rico. The Treasurer considered the same percentage of the assets in Puerto Rico fairly represented the capital there employed. The amount thus ascertained was $2,439,200, which he divided into three items-real property and buildings, $732,560; other personal property, $1,611,400; and tangible personal property, $95,240. Applying the statutory rate to $2,439, 200, he fixed the tax at $62,122.98. Upon appeal the Board of Equalization sustained the Treasurer's action. The bank voluntarily paid $17,700.24, the amount attributable to real property and buildings, but paid under protest the balance of $44,422.74 demanded in respect of the personal property, and brought suit in the United States District Court for Puerto Rico to recover the amount. Judgment in favor of the Treasurer was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. We granted a writ of certiorari, 2 because the case involves the application and scope of acts of Congress and their effect upon the taxing power of insular possessions of the United States. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 199, 202]\n\u00a0\n Respondent concedes the competence of the island government to tax generally, 4 but asserts that R.S.  5219, as amended,5 prohibits a levy on the capital of a national bank. The further point is made that section 320 of the Political Code of Puerto Rico,6 to which the petitioner refers \n\n[294 U.S. 199, 203]\n\u00a0\n as his authority, does not justify the imposition of the tax in question. This the petitioner denies, and adds that the point was not presented below, and cannot, therefore, be mooted here. In addition to contending that section 5219 as amended never extended to Puerto Rico, he claims that, in any event, the section was rendered inoperative in the island by section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 199, 204]\n\u00a0\n We find it unnecessary to determine whether the tax was authorized by section 320 of the Political Code, since we are of opinion that Rev. St.  5219 forbids its collection.\n Taxation of a bank's branch is taxation of the bank itself. \n8\n The system of national banks was intended to be coextensive with the territorial limits of the United States, and, while the consent to taxation given by section 5219 refers in terms only to the states, it extends also to territorial governments and sets the limits of their exercise of the power. \n9\n The form of taxation here imposed is not permitted by the section. \n10\n The organization of a national bank in Puerto Rico is within the contemplation of the National Banking Act; but, if there were doubt concerning the proposition, it finds support in legislation extending applicable laws of the United States to the island. \n11\n Although the maintenance of branch banks is prohibited by the National Banking Act save under narrowly limited conditions,12 their establishment in foreign countries, dependencies, and insular possessions is authorized. \n13\n Puerto Rico, an island possession, like a territory, is an agency of the federal government, having no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state in virtue of which taxes may be levied. Authority to tax must be derived \n\n[294 U.S. 199, 205]\n\u00a0\n from the United States. But like a state, though for a different reason, such an agency may not tax a federal instrumentality. A state, though a sovereign, is precluded from so doing because the Constitution requires that there be no interference by a state with the powers granted to the federal government. \n14\n A territory or a possession may not do so because the dependency may not tax its sovereign. True the Congress may consent to such taxation; but the grant to the island of a general power to tax should not be construed as a consent. Nothing less than an act of Congress clearly and explicitly conferring the privilege will suffice. Not only do we find no such statutory consent, but we are confronted by Rev. St.  5219 as amended, which proprio vigore extends to territories, and the congressional declaration that it, like other statutes of the United States, shall, if not locally inapplicable,15 apply to Puerto Rico.\n The petitioner insists that this section is locally inapplicable for two reasons. The first is that the section was intended to apply only to taxation by the state, territory, or governmental agency within whose borders the bank has its principal place of business. The argument is that Puerto Rico cannot avail itself of the consent to the taxing of respondent's shares, or the dividends thereon, since the shares have no situs except New York, which is, in contemplation of law, the association's home. The position is that the section must be available in its entirety or else wholly inapplicable. We think otherwise. If Puerto Rico can and does collect taxes of any of the types mentioned in Rev. Stat .  5219, as amended, the mere fact that the situation prevents resort to one of the other kinds thereby \n\n[294 U.S. 199, 206]\n\u00a0\n permitted does not make the statute a nullity in the island. The record discloses that there has been assessed and collected a tax on the bank's local real estate, as permitted by paragraph 3 of Rev. St.  5219, as amended, and in addition an income tax upon the local income,16 as permitted by paragraph 1(c). These seem to afford appropriate and equitable methods of taxation in respect of the association's local branches and business.\n Secondly, petitioner says section 25 of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended, 17 exhibits an intention on the part of Congress that for purposes of taxation branches in dependencies or insular possessions shall be treated as if they were branches established in foreign countries. The argument is that, as all are mentioned several times in the section as 'foreign branches,' and since confessedly the United States cannot limit or control the method or manner of taxation of foreign branches, the purpose was not to do so with respect to those in an insular possession. We think the contention unsound. It does not follow from the lack of power of the United States in the one case that it did not intend to exercise its undoubted power in the other.\n We are of opinion that section 5219 prohibits the imposition of the tax in question. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Infra, note 7. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n293 \nU.S. 549\n, 55 S.Ct. 140, 79 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See Rule 38, par. 5(b), 28 USCA  354: 'Where a Circuit Court of Appeals ... has decided an important question of federal law which has not been, but should be, settled by this court.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The Organic Act for Puerto Rico (March 2, 1917, c. 145,  3, 39 Stat. 951, 953, as amended by the Act of February 3, 1921, c. 34,  2, 41 Stat. 1096 (48 USCA  741) provides: 'No export duties shall be levied or collected on exports from Porto Rico, but taxes and assessments on property, internal revenue, and license fees, and royalties for franchises, privileges, and concessions may be imposed for the purposes of the insular and municipal governments respectively, as may be provided and defined by the legislature of Porto Rico. ...'

LOVE(1935)\nNo. 585\nArgued: Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 64, 65]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles S. Mitchell, of Tupelo, Miss., and Elmer C. Sharp, of Booneville, Miss., for appellants.\n Messrs. H. H. Creekmore, of Jackson, Miss., and C. R. Bolton, of Tupelo, Miss., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n A statute of Mississippi, adopted in 1932 (Laws 1932, c. 251), permits the reopening of closed banks upon terms proposed by three-fourths of the creditors in number or in value if the plan is approved by the superintendent of banks and confirmed by the court of chancery. A bank has been reopened in accordance with this statute. The question is whether contractual rights have been impaired or rights of property annulled in contravention of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States.\n The People's Bank & Trust Company of Tupelo, Miss., closed its doors on December 24, 1930. In accordance with the statutes then in force (Code 1930,  3817), the superintendent of banks took charge of the business and proceeded to liquidate it; his action being \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 66]\n\u00a0\n subject at all times to the supervision of the court of chancery. The bank owed about $200,000 for public moneys on deposit. These were preferred claims under the laws of Mississippi, and were paid in full. It owed for bills payable and rediscounts $457,500, amply secured by collateral. These also were paid in full; the security being unaffected by liquidation or insolvency. Out of the remaining assets, so far as they would serve, the liquidator would have to pay the general deposits (about $1,450,000) as well as any other debts. There was also available for the protection of depositors the personal liability of the shareholders to the extent of the par value of their shares, a liability which under the statute was to be 'enforced in a suit at law or in equity by any such bank in process of liquidation, or by the superintendent of banks, or other officer succeeding to the legal rights of said bank.' Mississippi Code,  3815. The share capital of the bank was $200,000, and the personal liability of the shareholders would have added a like amount to the assets if all the shareholders had paid in full.\n In the fall of 1932 after about two years of liquidation by the superintendent of banks, a movement was started by a large number of depositors to set the bank upon its feet. For help in that endeavor, they had recourse to methods made available by a statute adopted in May, 1932, which is quoted in the margin. \n1\n Laws Missis \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 67]\n\u00a0\n sippi 1932, c. 251, Mississippi Code Supp. 1933,  3817-1. The substance of the statute is that the court of chancery shall have power to reopen a closed \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 68]\n\u00a0\n bank in accordance with a plan proposed by at least three-fourths of the creditors and recommended by the superintendent, if the court is satisfied that the plan is feasible and just. Upon the approval of such a plan, assenting and nonassenting creditors shall be required to accept payment in accordance with its terms. The superintendent shall have no power to diminish to the prejudice of creditors any assets that otherwise would be available for payment. Liquidation by the bank itself, though in a reorganized form, is to be substituted for liquidation at the hands of a statutory receiver.\n Resorting to that statute, about 80 per cent. of the creditors signed a 'freezing-of-deposits agreement' prescribing a time and method for the payment of the debts. The bank, when reorganized, was to have a capital of $ 55,000 and a surplus of $45,000, a total capital and surplus of $100,000. Shareholders of the old bank, having shares of the par value of $110,000, were to contribute the new capital ($55,000, or 50 per cent. of their old holdings) in cash or its equivalent. In consideration of this payment, they were to be released from any other liability on the old shares, though the statutory liability would attach automatically to the new ones if the reorganized bank were to go under. Shareholders not contributing to capital (representing $90,000 of the old shares) were to remain personally liable as if no plan had been adopted. Of the claims against the old bank as distinguished from those against the shareholders, 25 per cent. were to be assumed by the reopened bank; 75 per cent. were to be a charge upon certain assets which were \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 69]\n\u00a0\n to be placed in a pool and made to realize what they could. Assets having an estimated value in excess of the liabilities assumed were to be turned over to the reopened bank to enable it to make good its promise. This was the primary source of payment, though the covenant of assumption was to be back of it. Out of the assets so delivered, deposits of $5 or less, amounting in all to $3,649.87, were to be paid in full. All other claims then outstanding for deposits or other debts were to be ratably satisfied up to the limit of 25 per cent., 5 per cent. at once, and the remaining 20 per cent. in 5 per cent. installments as the assets turned over to the reopened bank were converted into cash, the process of conversion being subject to the supervision of the court. Proceeds of collection in excess of the 25 per cent. were not to be retained, but were to be paid into the pool. Certain other assets having an estimated value of $45,000 were turned over to the reopened bank for surplus or reserve. This amount was to be repaid out of the net earnings at the rate of $7,500 a year by additions to the pool. No dividends were to be declared upon the shares of the reopened bank till all the liabilities assumed by it had been satisfied completely. The assets deposited in the pool were to be administered by the bank as a trust for the benefit of creditors. Many other details would have to be stated to exhibit the plan fully. For an understanding of the objections the outline given will suffice.\n The superintendent of banks filed a petition in the court of chancery approving the plan and recommending its adoption. Notice of hearing was served by publication upon the 5,000 creditors affected, as well as personally upon some of them selected by the court as representing the interests of all. Only a few creditors opposed the granting of the petition. Some of these withdrew their objections at the close of the hearing with the result that the number of opponents was reduced to six. After \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 70]\n\u00a0\n full consideration, the court on May 15, 1933, entered a decree overruling the objections and reopening the bank in accordance with the plan. Two of the objecting creditors appealed to the Supreme Court of the state, invoking the protection of article 1,  10, and the Fourteenth Amendment, of the Federal Constitution. The decree was affirmed, one judge dissenting. Dunn v. Love (Miss.) 155 So. 331, 92 A.L.R. 1323. The case is here upon appeal. Judicial Code,  237, 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 USCA  344).\n If we look to the surface of the statute and no farther, there is not even colorable basis for the argument that the Constitution is infringed. All that the statute does upon its face is to change the method of liquidation. The assets of the business are to be devoted without impairment or diversion to the payment of the debts. As to this the statute is explicit. Act of 1932, c. 251,  3. In the discretion of the court of chancery a reopened bank is to take the place of the state superintendent for the purpose of gathering in the assets and discharging liabilities. The substitution may not be made unless the court is satisfied that the reopened bank is solvent and able to satisfy the debts to be assumed. Payment of the creditors is still the end to be attained, and resumption of business a means and nothing more. If debts are thereby swollen or assets made to shrink, the outcome is an unlooked-for incident of a method of administration conceived to be more efficient than present sale and distribution. The Constitution of the United States does not confer upon the depositors a vested right to liquidation at the hands of a state official. Gibbes v. Zimmerman, \n290 \nU.S. 326, 332\n, 54 S.Ct. 140.\n The argument will not hold that the necessary operation of the statute is to subject dissenting creditors, who may be as many as one- fourth, to the will or the whim of the assenting three-fourths. The creditors favoring reorganization, though they be 99 per cent., have no power under the statute to impose their wil on a minority. \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 71]\n\u00a0\n They may advise and recommend, but they are powerless to coerce. Their recommendation will be ineffective unless approved by the superintendent. Even if approved by him, it will be ineffective unless the court after a hearing shall find it to be wise and just. Upon such a hearing every objection to the plan in point of law or policy may be submitted and considered. The decree when made by the chancellor will represent his own unfettered judgment. The judicial power has not been delegated to nonjudicial agencies or to persons or factions interested in the event. Like statutes have been upheld by the courts of other states. Dorman v. Dell, 245 Ky. 34, 52 S.W. (2d) 892; Milner v. Gibson, 249 Ky. 594, 61 S.W.( 2d) 273; Nagel v. Ghingher, 166 Md. 231, 171 A. 65, 92 A.L.R. 1315; McConville v.

Farmers' & Merchants' State Bank, 187 Minn. 411, 245 N.W. 832, 84 A.L.R. 1466\n\n\n The act of 1932 being valid on the surface, the question remains whether it has been so applied or interpreted in the adoption of this plan as to bring out defects that were lurking underneath. Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant, \n257 \nU.S. 282, 289\n, 42 S.Ct. 106; Merchants' National Bank of Richmond v. Richmond, \n256 \nU.S. 635, 637\n, 41 S. Ct. 619; Kansas City So. R. Co. v. Road Improvement District No. 6, \n256 \nU.S. 658, 659\n, 41 S.Ct. 604.\n The argument is made that some of the assets of the old bank are placed at the risk of the business of the new one. All this was done for the protection of existing creditors. The finding is that collections are made more promptly and readily by a going concern than by one in liquidation. Cf. Christensen v. Merchants' & Marine Bank of Pascagoula, 168 Miss. 43, 57, 150 So. 375. For illustration, a live bank is much more efficient than a closed one in selling parcels of real estate or in carrying them while unsold at profitable rentals. Adequate pre- \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 72]\n\u00a0\n cautions are embodied in the plan to assure the enjoyment of these benefits by the creditors, and not by others. It is one of the terms of the decree that none of the profits of the business may be used for the new shareholders until every dollar's worth of assets turned over by the superintendent has been paid to the creditors or delivered to the pool. The court may intervene upon a showing of unreasonable delay. There is no need to consider whether any of these safeguards might have been omitted without invalidating the plan. We take the record as we find it.\n The argument is made that a cause of action upon contract has been destroyed or given away to the prejudice of depositors, in that shareholders have been released from their personal liability in return for a contribution of capital to the regenerated business. This is said to constitute a denial of due process or an impairment of contract within the doctrine of Ettor v. Tacoma, \n228 \nU.S. 148\n, 33 S.Ct. 428, and Coombes v. Getz, \n285 \nU.S. 434\n, 52 S.Ct. 435. The answer is much the same as to the argument last considered. The effect of the release has been to make it possible for the bank to be reopened with the result to the creditors of economies and other benefits that would otherwise be lost. During about two years and a half of liquidation, there had been collected from the whole body of the shareholders, representing 2, 000 shares, a small percentage only of the total liability. The superintendent expressed the belief that it might be possible in the course of many years and with great expense and labor to bring collections from these sources to a total of $75,000. Through the method called for by the plan, capital in the sum of $55,000 became available at once as additional security for the obligations assumed by the reorganized business. This capital was supplied by the holders of 1,100 shares, whose maximum liability was $110,000. The liability of \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 73]\n\u00a0\n the other shareholders ($90,000 at the maximum) continued unimpaired for whatever it was worth. The chancellor found from the evidence that in all probability the moneys thus obtained as contributions to capital could not have been collected by judgment and execution, and that the depositors would be the gainers by the substituted form of payment. He reached that conclusion after a trial in the county of the vicinage with his finger on the pulse of neighborhood conditions. On appeal to the Supreme Court his findings were confirmed. Cf. Smith v. Texley, supra, at page 195 of 55 S.D ., 225 N.W. 307.\n In such circumstances it is idle to speak of the release of liability as a gift or a sacrifice of valuable assets. The release was none of that, but a compromise of a liability of uncertain value upon terms beneficial to the creditors. So the trier of the facts has found. The title to the extinguished cause of action was not in the depositors, but in the superintendent or the bank. If there had been no plan to reorganize, the superintendent like a receiver might have compromised the cause of action and released it with the approval of the court. His authority was no less because the release was incidental to a project to rehabilitate a business for the good of all concerned. The jurisdiction of the court of chancery to give approval to a settlement by a receiver or other officer did not have its genesis in the act of 1932 or in the procedure there prescribed. It existed in like measure when the liquidation of this bank was begun in 1930 and for many years before. Depositors were chargeable with notice of that power and became subject to its exercise in making their deposits.\n In last analysis, then, the appellants' grievance, if they have any, is this and nothing more, that there was error of judgment to their prejudice in the approval of the plan with the compromise of liability as one of its important \n\n[295 U.S. 64, 74]\n\u00a0\n features. They refer us to nothing in the record to give support to that contention. The testimony as to the probable results of liquidation without the aid of a reopened bank was not contradicted or discredited. But the result would not be changed if the record in that respect were different. Error of judgment in the compromise of liabilities is not a taking of property or an impairment of contract in derogation of the restraints of the Constitution of the United States.\n The appellants make the point that by the act of 1932 a preference was accorded to the claims of correspondent banks, though such a preference did not exist under the statutes in force when the superintendent went into possession. A sufficient answer is that in this case the correspondent banks were protected by collateral security which apart from the new preference would have required them to be paid in full.\n The appellants also say that their constitutional rights were infringed by those provisions of the plan whereby a preference was granted to the holders of small claims. None of these claims ($3,649.87 in the aggregate) was for more than $5, and many, we were informed upon the argument, were for only a few cents. The chancellor found by his decree that it would be more economical to pay these accounts in full than to incur the bookkeeping expenses incidental to a calculation of percentages whenever dividends were paid to others. Cf. Nagel v. Chingher, supra, 166 Md. 231, 171 A. 65, at page 69, 92 A.L.R. 1315. The objecting creditors have not been damaged by that feature of the plan.\n Finally, the appellants say that the proceedings in the court of chancery are void for insufficient notice to the depositors and others. A sufficient answer is that the appellants appeared generally and were fully heard upon the merits.\n The decree should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Section 1. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of Mississippi, That the Superintendent of Banks of the State of Mississippi be authorized to reopen any closed bank, with the approval of the Chancery Court of the county in which the bank is situated, or of the Chancellor in vacation, when at least three-fourths of the general depositors and creditors therein, or any number of the general depositors and creditors therein provided they own at least three-fourths of the deposits in or claims against such bank, agree to the reopening thereof and sign what is commonly termed a 'freezing-of-deposits agreement,' under which they agree to accept repayment of their deposits and claims over a period of years, for the full amount thereof or in reduced amounts, with or without interest, the period over which the deposits and claims are to be repaid and the rate of payment, together with the interest rate, if any, to be determined by the Superintendent of Banks, provided the Superintendent of Banks is convinced that such bank is in solvent condition and can repay the depositors the amounts of their deposits in accordance with the terms of the agreement for the repayment of same. But, before any such bank shall be reopened, the entire plan for the reopening of same, and all facts in connection therewith, shall be submitted by the Superintendent of Banks to the Chancery Court of the county in which the bank is situated, or to the Chancellor in vacation, by proper petition, duly verified, such petition to contain a statement of the assets and liabilities of the bank and such other information as may be necessary to convey to the court or Chancellor the true facts with reference to the condition of such bank, and a decree of the court or of the Chancellor in vacation obtained approving the plan agreed upon for the reopening of such bank and authorizing the same to be reopened. \n'Sec. 2.

CUNNINGHAM(1935)\nNo. 519\nArgued: January 18, 1935Decided: February 4, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Cedric W. Porter and George P. Dike, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioners.\n Mr. Edmund A. Whitman, of Boston, Mass., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioners brought a suit in equity against the respondents in the District Court for Massachusetts, \n\n[294 U.S. 207, 208]\n\u00a0\n charging infringement of copyright, praying an injunction, an accounting and award of profits, and damages, or 'in lieu of actual damages or profits such damages as to this court shall appear to be just and proper within the provisions of the Act of Congress in such cases made and provided.' The respondents answered and the cause came on for hearing. Admissions in the pleadings, concessions by the respondents, and evidence taken, disclose the relevant facts.\n Douglas wrote an original story which was accepted, copyrighted, and published by The American Mercury, Inc. The rights in the story under the copyright were assigned to Douglas. Thereafter Cunningham wrote for the Post Publishing Company, and the latter published in some 384,000 copies of a Sunday edition of the Boston Post, an article which was a clear appropriation of Douglas' story. Testimony was presented with respect to the value of the story, but at the close of the trial the petitioners admitted inability to prove actual damages. The Publishing Company acted innocently in accepting the article from Cunningham, and the latter testified that he had procured the material for its from an acquaintance, believed the facts related to him were actual happenings, and was ignorant of Douglas' production. The trial judge ruled that no actual damage had been shown, but in lieu thereof granted the petitioners $5,000 and a counsel fee. Upon appeal the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained an assignment of error which asserted the judge had abused his discretion in making the award, reversed the decree, and set the damages at $250.\n The sole question presented by the petition for certiorari is whether consistently with section 25(b) of the Act of 1909,1 an appellate court may review the action of \n\n[294 U.S. 207, 209]\n\u00a0\n a trial judge in assessing an amount in lieu of actual damages, where the amount awarded is within the limits imposed by the section. We granted the writ of certiorari2 because the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals was upon an important question of federal law and probably in conflict with our decisions. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The phraseology of the section was adopted to avoid the strictness of construction incident to a law imposing penalties, and to give the owner of a copyright some recompense for injury done him, in a case where the rules of law render difficult or impossible proof of damages or discovery of profits. In this respect the old law was unsatisfactory. In many cases plaintiffs, though proving infringement, were able to recover only nominal damages, in spite of the fact that preparation and trial of the case imposed substantial expense and inconvenience. The ineffectiveness of the remedy encouraged willful and deliberate infringement. \n\n[294 U.S. 207, 210]\n\u00a0\n This court has twice construed section 25(b) in the light of its history and purpose. Westermann Co. v. Dispatch Printing Co., \n249 \nU.S. 100\n, 39 S.Ct. 194; Jewell-La Salle Realty Co. v. Buck, \n283 \nU.S. 202\n, 51 S.Ct. 407. As shown by those decision, the purpose of the act is not doubtful. The trial judge may allow such damages as he deems to be just and may, in the case of an infringement such as is here shown, in his discretion, use as the measure of damages one dollar for each copy-Congress declaring, however, that just damages, even for the circulation of a single copy, cannot be less than $250, and no matter how many copies are made, cannot be more than $5,000. In the Westermann and La Salle Cases it was held that not less than $250 could be awarded for a single publication or performance. It follows that such an award, in the contemplation of the statute, is just. The question now presented is whether it can be unjust, according to the legislative standard, to use the prescribed measure-$1 per copy-up to the maximum permitted by the section. As the Westermann Case shows, the law commits to the trier of facts, within the named limits, discretion to apply the measure furnished by the statute provided he awards no more than $5,000. He need not award $ 1 for each copy, but, if upon consideration of the circumstances he determines that he should do so, his action cannot be said to be unjust. In other words, them employment of the statutory yardstick, within set limits, is committed solely to the court which hears the case, and this fact takes the matter out of the ordinary rule with respect to abuse of discretion. This construction is required by the language and the purpose of the statute. The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded to the District Court for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n So ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of March 4, 1909, c. 320,  25(b), 35 Stat. 1081, as amended by Act of August 24, 1912, c. 356, 37 Stat. 489, U.S.C. tit. 17,  25 (17 USCA  25(b): 'If any person shall infringe the copyright in any work protected under the copyright laws of the United States such person shall be liable: ...\n'(b) To pay to the copyright proprietor such damages as the copyright proprietor may have suffered due to the infringement, as well as all the profits which the infringer shall have made from such infringement, ... or in lieu of actual damages and profits such damages as to the court shall appear to be just, and in assessing such damages the court may, in its discretion, allow the amounts as hereinafter stated (here follow limitations with respect to the amount of damages to be awarded for certain infringements not material in the present case), and such damages shall in no other case exceed the sum of $5,000 nor be less than the sum of $250, and shall not be regarded as a penalty. ...'\n\n There follows a schedule of which item 'Second' is: 'In the case of any work enumerated in section 5 of this title (section 5 includes periodicals and newspapers), except a painting, statue, or sculpture, $1 for every infringing copy made or sold by or found in the possession of the infringer or his agents or employees.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] \n293 \nU.S. 551\n, 55 S.Ct. 217, 79 L.Ed. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] See rule 38, par. 5(b)(c). \n\n\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDOUGLAS v. WILLCUTS(1935)\n\nArgued: October 14, 1935Decided: November 11, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Leland W. Scott and Clark R. Fletcher, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent. \n\n[296 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES, delivered the opinion of the Court.\n On September 12, 1923, petitioner, Edward B. Douglas, entered into an agreement with his wife and the Minneapolis Trust Company, by which he transferred securities in trust for his wife's benefit. Out of the income of the trust estate the trustee was to pay Mrs. Douglas annually the sum of $15,000, up to November 6, 1927, and thereafter $21,000. Deficiencies were to be made up in a prescribed manner. Excess income (in case the principal was not impaired) was to be paid to petitioner. On the death of his wife, he was to receive the property free of the trust. Petitioner reserved the right to designate securities for investment, subject, however, to the approval of the trustee acting in that respect on behalf of Mrs. Douglas.\n The parties stipulated that the provisions for Mrs. Douglas were 'in lieu of, and in full settlement of alimony, and of any and all dower rights or statutory interests in the estate' of her husband, and 'in lieu of any and all claims for separate maintenance and allowance for her support.'\n Three days later, Mrs. Douglas obtained a decree of absolute divorce in a district court of the state of Minnesota. The decree provided: 'It is further adjudged and decreed that the defendant provide and create the trust fund as set out in that certain agreement between said parties and the Minneapolis Trust Company as trustee now on file with said trustee, and that the plaintiff have the provision therein made in lieu of all other alimony or interest in the property or estate of the defendant and that neither party have any costs or disbursements herein.'\n The question in this case relates to the net income of the trust which was distributed to Mrs. Douglas in the \n\n[296 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n years 1927 and 1928. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue determined that these amounts were income to the petitioner. Taxes assessed accordingly were paid by petitioner under protest, claim for refund was disallowed, and this suit was brought to recover the amount paid. Judgment for petitioner was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 73 F. (2d) 130. We granted certiorari (\n295 \nU.S. 722\n, 55 S.Ct. 642, April 8, 1935) in view of an asserted conflict with the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit in the case of Schweitzer v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 75 F.(2d) 702, 705, 706.\n Petitioner contends that the agreement created an irrevocable trust; that under the Revenue Acts petitioner and Mrs. Douglas were separate taxpayers; and that, having accepted the benefits of the trust, she was taxable upon the income she received as beneficiary. Revenue Act 1926,  219, 26 USCA  161-167 notes; Revenue Act 1928,  161, 162, 167, 26 USCA  161, 162, 167 note; Helvering v. Butterworth, \n290 \nU.S. 365, 369\n, 370 S., 54 S.Ct. 221. The Circuit Court of Appeals decided that the income was taxable to the petitioner, since it went to the discharge of his legal obligation; that is, the income was devoted to payments which petitioner was bound to make under the decree of the Minnesota court. 73 F.( 2d) 130, page 133.\n The authority of the district court is defined by statute. Mason's Minnesota Statutes 1927,  8601-8604. The court is empowered upon divorce for any cause, except that of the wife's adultery, to decree to the wife 'such part of the personal and real estate of the husband, not exceeding in value one-third thereof, as it deems just and reasonable, having regard to the ability of the husband, the character and situation of the parties, and all other circumstances of the case.' The court may also decree 'such alimony out of the estate, earnings, and income of the husband as it may deem just and reasonable,' but 'the aggregate award and allowance made to the wife from the estate of the husband' is not to 'exceed in \n\n[296 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n present value one-third of the personal estate, earnings, and income of the husband, and one-third in value of his real estate.' Id.,  8602. The court 'may appoint trustees, whenever it is deemed expedient, to receive any money ordered to be paid to the wife, upon trust to invest the same, and pay over the income for the support of the wife, or of the wife and minor children of the parties, or any of them, in such manner as the court shall direct, or to pay over to the wife the principal sum in such proportions and at such times as the court shall order.' Id.,  8601. After a decree 'for alimony, or other allowance for the wife and children,' or 'for the appointment of trustees to receive and hold any property for the use of the wife or children,' the court may from time to time 'revise and alter' the decree, with respect to the amount 'of such alimony or allowance' and also with respect to 'the appropriation and payment of the principal and income of the property so held in trust, and may make any order respecting any of the said matters which it might have made in the original action.' Id.,  8603. 1 \n\n[296 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of the State has decided that the district court in exercising this authority is not precluded by stipulations and agreements of the parties, entered into pending the action (but not void by reason of having been made to facilitate the decree of divorce), from making such provision for the wife as the court may deem appropriate. Such stipulations or agreements do not control the court. The court may adopt or reject them as it deems best in the light of the situation of the parties. When such agreements are approved, and in effect are embodied in the decree, they do not detract from the authority of the court to alter or revise its decree and the provisions made for the wife's benefit. In Warren v. \n\n[296 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n Warren, 116 Minn. 458, pages 459, 460, 133 N.W. 1009, the court said:\n'It appears that the original judgment for alimony was based upon a stipulation of the parties, entered into pending the action, but not to facilitate the granting of the divorce, and plaintiff contends that the judgment so founded and entered became a contract between the parties, and is not subject to change by the court, except upon restoration of plaintiff to her position and rights before its entry. In this we are unable to concur.\n\n'Stipulations and agreements of the kind, where not void by reason of having been entered into to facilitate a decree of divorce, become merged in the judgment when entered, and are not, in the absence of statute upon the subject, so far of a contractual nature as to preclude the court subsequently from changing and modifying the judgment, upon application of one of the parties. The court is not controlled by the stipulation, and may adopt or reject it as seems consistent and proper from the situation of the parties, as disclosed by the evidence on the trial. The fact that such stipulations are usually adopted by the court does not change the situation.'\n\n See, also, Haskell v. Haskell, 116 Minn. 10, 132 N.W. 1129; Martinson v. Martinson, 116 Minn. 128, 133 N.W. 460; Sessions v. Sessions, 178 Minn. 75, 226 N.W. 211, 701; Randall v. Randall, 181 Minn. 18, 231 N.W. 413; Erickson v. Erickson, 181 Minn. 421, 232 N.W. 793.\n As we have noted, this control over provisions for the benefit of the wife in connection with divorce applies by the express terms of the statute not only to 'alimony' but also to 'other allowance for the wife and children, or either of them', and to 'the appointment of trustees to receive and hold any property for the use of the wife or children.' See section 8603\n\n\n In the instant case, the trust agreement was made on the day that the suit for divorce was brought. The agree- \n\n[296 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n ment was manifestly made in contemplation of that suit. When the district court was shortly called upon to determine what provision should be made for the wife, the court was not bound by the trust agreement. Within the limits prescribed by the statute (and there is no suggestion that the provision here went beyond those limits) the court had full authority to make an allowance to the wife out of her husband's property and to set up a trust to give effect to that allowance. Being satisfied with the provision made by the trust agreement, the court incorporated that provision in its decree. The court did not approve the trust agreement as one deriving efficacy from the action of the parties. The court made its own requirement. The decree required the petitioner to 'provide and create the trust fund.' While the terms of the trust as set up in the trust agreement were approved, the court made those terms its own. It was from this action of the court that the trust derived its force.\n Amounts paid to a divorced wife under a decree for alimony are not regarded as income of the wife but as paid in discharge of the general obligation to support, which is made specific by the decree. Gould v. Gould, \n245 \nU.S. 151, 153\n, 38 S.Ct. 53; Audubon v. Shufeldt, \n181 \nU.S. 575, 577\n, 21 S.Ct. 735. Petitioner's contention that the district court did not award alimony is not supported by the terms of the decree. It described the provision as made 'in lieu of all other alimony or interest in the property or estate of the defendant.' However designated, it was a provision for annual payments to serve the purpose of alimony, that is, to assure to the wife suitable support. The fact that the provision was to be in lieu of any other interest in the husband's property did not affect the essential quality of these payments. Upon the pre-existing duty of the husband the decree placed a particular and adequate sanction, and imposed upon petitioner the obligation to devote the \n\n[296 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n income in question, through the medium of the trust, to the use of his divorced wife.\n No question is raised as to the constitutional power of the Congress to attribute to petitioner the income thus segregated and paid in discharge of his obligation, and that authority could not be challenged successfully, Burnet v. Wells, \n289 \nU.S. 670, 677\n, 682 S., 684, 53 S.Ct. 761. The question is one of statutory construction. We think that the definitions of gross income (Revenue Act 1926,  213, 26 USCA  22 note; Revenue Act 1928,  22, 26 USCA  22 and note) are broad enough to cover income of that description. They are to be considered in the light of the evident intent of the Congress 'to use its power to the full extent.' Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161\n, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476; Helvering v. Stockholms Enskilda Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84, 89\n, 55 S.Ct. 50. We have held that income was received by a taxpayer, when, pursuant to a contract, a debt or other obligation was discharged by another for his benefit. The transaction was regarded as being the same in substance as if the money had been paid to the taxpayer and he had transmitted it to his creditor. Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, 49 S.Ct. 499; United States v. Boston & Maine Railroad, \n279 \nU.S. 732\n, 49 S.Ct. 505. See, also, United States v. Mahoning Coal R. Co. (C.C.A.) 51 F.(2d) 208. The creation of a trust by the taxpayer as the channel for the application of the income to the discharge of his obligation leaves the nature of the transaction unaltered. Burnet v. Wells, supra. In the present case, the net income of the trust fund, which was paid to the wife under the decree, stands substantially on the same footing as though he had received the income personally and had been required by the decree to make the payment directly.\n We do not regard the provisions of the statutes as to the taxation of trusts, fiduciaries and beneficiaries (Revenue Act 1926,  2, 219, 26 USCA  1696 and note, 161-167 note; Revenue Act 1928,  161, 162, 26 USCA  161, 162) as intended to apply to cases where the income of the trust would otherwise remain, by virtue of the nature and purpose of the \n\n[296 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n trust, attributable to the creator of the trust and accordingly taxable to him. These provisions have appropriate reference to cases where the income of the trust is no longer to be regarded as that of the settlor, and we find no warrant for a constructioin which would preclude the laying of the tax against the one who through the discharge of his obligation enjoys the benefit of the income as though he had personally received it.\n The decision in Helvering v. Butterworth, \n290 \nU.S. 365\n, 54 S.Ct. 221, 222, is not opposed. There the trust was testamentary and the only question was with respect to the liability for the tax as between the trustee and the beneficiary. The Court observed that 'the evident general purpose of the statute was to tax in some way the whole income of all trust estates.' The decision has no application to a case where the income is still taxable to the grantor. Nor are the provisions of the statutes (Revenue Act 1926,  219(h), 26 USCA  167 note; Revenue Act 1928 ,  167, 26 USCA  167 note) defining instances in which the grantor remains taxable, as in case of certain reservations for his benefit or provisions for the payment of premiums upon policies of insurance on his life, to be regarded as excluding instances not specified, where in contemplation of law the income remains in substance that of the grantor. No such exclusion is expressed and we see no ground for implying it.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The text of these provisions is as follows:\n'8601. Trustee of alimony-The court may appoint trustees, whenever it is deemed expedient, to receive any money ordered to be paid to the wife, upon trust to invest the same, and pay over the income for the support of the wife, or of the wife and minor children of the parties, or any of them, in such manner as the court shall direct, or to pay over to the wife the principal sum in such proportions and at such times as the court shall order, regard being had in all such cases to the situation and circumstances of such wife, and the children if there are any, provided for in the order; and such trustees shall give such bond, as the court shall require, for the faithful performance of their trust.'\n\n'8602. Property of husband-Permanent alimony-Upon a divorce for any cause except that of adultery committed by the wife, if the estate and property restored or awarded to her is insufficient for the suitable support of herself and such children of the marriage as shall be committed to her care and custody, or if there is no such estate and property, the court may further order and decree to her such part of the personal and real estate of the husband, not exceeding in value one-third thereof, as it deems just and reasonable, having regard to the ability of the husband, the character and situation of the parties, and all other circumstances of the case. \n\n The court may also, in the cases provided for in this section, decree to the wife such alimony out of the estate, earnings, and income of the husband as it may deem just and reasonable, having regard to the ability of the husband, the character and situation of the parties, and other circumstances of the case, and may by its decree make the same a specific lien upon any specified parcels of his real estate, or authorize its enforcement by execution against his property, real and personal; but the aggregate award and allowance made to the wife from the estate of the husband under this section shall not in any case exceed in present value one-third of the personal estate, earnings, and income of the husband, and one-third in value of his real estate.'\n'8603. Order for alimony, etc., revised-After an order or decree for alimony, or other allowance for the wife and children, or either of them, or for the appointment of trustees to receive and hold any property for the use of the wife or children, the court, from time to time, on petition of either of the parties, may revise and alter such order or decree respecting the amount of such alimony or allowance, and the payment thereof, and also respecting the appropriation and payment of the principal and income of the property so held in trust, and may make any order respecting any of the said matters which it might have made in the original action.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","51":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDRAKE v.

The action was brought in a state court in Pennsylvania, in July, 1933, and was removed to the federal court. The policy provided that it should be incontestable after two years from date of issue. In its affidavit of defense, respondent set up the affirmative defense that the policy had been obtained by means of false and fraudulent statements in the decedent's application which \n\n[293 U.S. 379, 381]\n\u00a0\n was made a part of the policy. These statements consisted of the applicant's answers to questions with respect to hospital observation or treatment and to his consultations with physicians. Respondent alleged that, while the applicant had answered these questions with an unqualified negative, he had in fact repeatedly consulted physicians for neurosis and cardiac disease and had twice been the subject of hospital observation. Respondent further alleged that these answers were made by the applicant 'with knowledge of their falsity and fraudulently for the purpose of procuring said insurance.' Respondent tendered judgment for the premiums received by it, with interest, and prayed for cancellation of the policy. Petitioner in her reply denied that the answers in the application were either false or fraudulent.\n Respondent then presented a petition asking that the 'equitable issue' raised by the affidavit of defense and the plaintiff's reply should be heard pursuant to section 274b of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  398 ( 28 USCA  398)) 'by a chancellor according to equity procedure in advance of the trial by jury at law of any purely legal issues.' The District Court entered a rule to show cause why the petition should not be granted and, on hearing, made the rule absolute. Its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 70 F.(2d 728. This Court issued writ of certiorari, October 8, 1934. \n293 \nU.S. 535\n, 55 S.Ct. 70, 79 L.Ed. --.\n First. A preliminary question arises as to the jurisdiction of the Circuit Court of Appeals. The decree of the District Court was interlocutory, and the question is whether it can be considered to be one granting an injunction and thus within the purview of section 129 of the Judicial Code, as amended (28 U.S.C.  227 (28 USCA  227)), permitting appeal.\n This section contemplates interlocutory orders or decrees which constitute an exercise of equitable jurisdiction in granting or refusing an injunction, as distinguished from a mere stay of proceedings which a court of law, as \n\n[293 U.S. 379, 382]\n\u00a0\n well as a court of equity, may grant in a cause pending before it by virtue of its inherent power to control the progress of the cause so as to maintain the orderly processes of justice. The power to stay proceedings in another court appertains distinctively to equity in the enforcement of equitable principles, and the grant or refusal of such a stay by a court of equity of proceedings at law is a grant or refusal of an injunction within the meaning of section 129 as amended. And, in this aspect, it makes no difference that the two cases, the suit in equity for an injunction and the action at law in which proceedings are stayed, are both pending in the same court, in view of the established distinction between 'proceedings at law and proceedings in equity in the national courts and between the powers of those courts when sitting as courts of law and when sitting as courts of equity.' Per Van Devanter, J., in Griesa v. Mutual Life Insurance Company (C.C.A.) 165 F. 48, 50, 51.\n When the Congress enacted section 274b of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  398), providing for equitable defenses in actions at law and the granting of affirmative equitable relief, the procedure was simplified, but the substance of the authorized intervention of equity was not altered. The court was empowered to exercise a summary equitable jurisdiction. Equitable defenses were permitted to be interposed in actions at law 'by answer, plea or replication without the necessity of filing a bill on the equity side of the court.' \n1\n The defendant is to have 'the same rights' as if he had filed a bill seeking the same relief. The equitable issue 'is to be tried to the judge as a chancellor.' The same order of trial is preserved as under the system \n\n[293 U.S. 379, 383]\n\u00a0\n of separate courts. Liberty Oil Company v. Condon Nat. Bank, \n260 \nU.S. 235, 242\n, 243 S., 43 S.Ct. 118. The trial of the issue at law may be postponed until the equitable issue is first disposed of, and then, if an issue at law remains, it is triable by a jury as the Seventh Amendment requires. Id.\n It is thus apparent that when an order or decree is made under section 274b (28 USCA  398), requiring, or refusing to require, that an equitable defense shall first be tried, the court, exercising what is essentially an equitable jurisdiction, in effect grants or refuses an injunction restraining proceedings at law precisely as if the court had acted upon a bill of complaint in a separate suit for the same purpose. Such a decree was made in the instant case, and therefore, although interlocutory, it was appealable to the Circuit Court of Appeals under section 129, as amended (28 USCA  227). See Ford v. Huff (C.C.A.) 296 F. 652, 658; American Cyanamid Co. v. Wilson & Toomer Fertilizer Co. (C.C.A.) 62 F.(2d) 1018, 1019, 1020. Compare Emlenton Refining Co. v. Chambers (C.C. A.) 14 F.(2d) 104.\n Second. We come to the merits. Was the defense set up by the defendant of such a nature that defendant was entitled to have it heard and determined in equity and to enjoin the proceedings at law pending that determination? The test under section 274b is whether the defendant could have maintained a bill in equity on the same averments. The unequivocal language of the provision leaves no room for the argument that the substantive jurisdiction of equity was sought to be changed or enlarged. The defendant's rights to a hearing in equity are 'the same,' not greater, when he resorts to the summary procedure. \n\n[293 U.S. 379, 384]\n\u00a0\n See Liberty Oil Company v. Condon Nat. Bank, supra; Union Pacific Railroad Co. v. Syas (C.C.A.) 246 F. 561, 565; American Cyanamid Co. v. Wilson & Toomer Fertilizer Co., supra; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Miller (C.C.A. 8th Circuit, October 25, 1934) 73 F.(2d) 350. Compare Phillips-Morefield v. Southern States Life Insurance Co. (C.C.A.) 66 F.(2d) 29, 30; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Marotta (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 1038. And it necessarily follows that this summary procedure cannot aid the defendant when a bill for the same relief would not lie because the defense is one which is completely available in the action at law. Emphasizing the fundamental principle of the equitable jurisdiction, the Congress, from the first Judiciary Act, has declared that suits in equity shall not be sustained in any court of the United States in any case where a 'plain, adequate and complete remedy' may be had at law. Act of September 24, 1789,  16, 1 Stat. 82, now Jud. Code,  267, 28 U.S.C.  384 (28 USCA  384).\n The instant case is not one in which there is resort to equity for cancellation of the policy during the life of the insured and no opportunity exists to contest liability at law. Nor is it a case where, although death may have occurred, action has not been brought to recover upon the policy, and equitable relief is sought to protect the insurer against loss of its defense by the expiration of the period after which the policy by its terms is to become incontestable. \n2\n Here, on the death of the insured, an action at law was brought on the policy, and the defendant had opportunity in that action at law, and before the policy by its terms became incontestable, to contest its liability and accordingly filed its affidavit of defense. That defense \n\n[293 U.S. 379, 385]\n\u00a0\n was solely that the defendant had been induced to issue the policy by false answers in the application which were alleged to have been made by the applicant 'with knowledge of their falsity and fraudulently' in order to obtain the insurance. The affidavit of defense showed nothing whatever as a further ground for equitable relief, and the respondent is necessarily confined to the case it made. In such a case, the defense of fraud is completely available in the action at law, and a bill in equity would not lie to stay proceedings in that action in order to have the defense heard and determined in equity. Phoenix Mut. Life Insurance Co. v. Bailey, 13 Wall. 616, 623; New York Life Insurance Company v. Bangs, \n103 U.S. 780\n, 782; Cable v. United States Life Insurance Co., \n191 \nU.S. 288, 305\n, 24 S.Ct. 74; American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., \n260 \nU.S. 360, 363\n, 43 S.Ct. 149; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Marshall (C.C.A.) 23 F.(2d) 225; New York Life Insurance Co. v. Miller, supra. Respondent was in no better position under section 274b (28 USCA  398).\n Nor is there merit in the contention that the remedy at law is not adequate because petitioner is not the only person interested in the policy and that the premiums paid would be refundable to the decedent's executors. The executors have no interest entitling them to enforce the policy. Petitioner is the sole beneficiary of the policy, and is entitled to recover upon it, if it is valid, and cannot prevail if the defense of fraud is established. Insurance Co. v. Bailey, supra; Cable v. United States Life Insurance Co., supra. The affidavit of defense raised no question as to petitioner's standing as beneficiary of the policy, and, indeed, it expressly offered judgment in favor of the petitioner for the amount of the premiums in accordance with a tender previously made.\n Respondent's petition for a hearing and determination in equity in advance of the trial of the action at law should have been denied. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the action is remanded to the \n\n[293 U.S. 379, 386]\n\u00a0\n District Court, with direction to vacate its order for a hearing in equity and to proceed with the trial of the action at law.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The text of section 274b (28 U.S.C. 398 (28 USCA  398)) is as follows:\n'Equitable defenses and equitable relief in actions at law. In all actions at law equitable defenses may be interposed by answer, plea, or replication without the necessity of filing a bill on the equity side of the court. The defendant shall have the same rights in such case as if he had filed a bill embodying the defense of seeking the relief prayed for in such answer or plea. Equitable relief respecting the subject matter of the suit may thus be obtained by answer or plea. In case affirmative relief is prayed in such answer or plea, the plaintiff shall file a replication. Review of the judgment or decree entered in such case shall be regulated by rule of court. Whether such review be sought by writ of error or by appeal the appellate court shall have full power to render such judgment upon the records as law and justice shall require.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] See Mutual Life Insurance Co. v.

Richardson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Sanford Bates, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[295 U.S. 490, 491]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was convicted of a crime in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas after indictment and a plea of guilty. He was sentenced, October 10, 1932, to imprisonment for four and a half years in the Penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas. On the same day the sentence was suspended for five years upon conditions of probation, and the defendant (the petitioner in this court) was placed in charge of the District Probation Officer for that length of time. One of the conditions was that the probationer would refrain from the violation of any state or federal penal laws. Another was that he would live 'a clean, honest and temperate life.'\n In July, 1933, information was conveyed to the District Probation Officer that petitioner had broken these conditions. In a letter written by his father he was charged with drunkenness and the forgery of two checks. The officer made report of this information to the District Judge and requested a revocation of the order for suspension of sentence. On July 29, 1933, the District Judge issued a mandate for a warrant of arrest. On August 5, he signed an order that the suspension be revoked and that the defendant be committed to prison to serve the stated term. Upon arrest under the warrant the defendant was not brought by his custodian before any court or judge. He was transported at once to the penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas, and there imprisoned. Later, in December, 1933, he filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas, contending that his imprisonment was unlawful for the reason that probation had been ended without the opportunity for a hearing made necessary by statute. The District Judge dismissed the application for the writ, and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit \n\n[295 U.S. 490, 492]\n\u00a0\n affirmed his order. 74 F.(2d) 924. A writ of certiorari issued from this court. \n294 \nU.S. 704\n, 55 S.Ct. 640, 79 L.Ed. --.\n Upon the suspension of sentence in October, 1932, the applicable statute made provision as follows: 'At any time within the probation period the probation officer may arrest the probationer without a warrant, or the court may issue a warrant for his arrest. Thereupon such probationer shall forthwith be taken before the court. At any time after the probation period, but within the maximum period for which the defendant might originally have been sentenced, the court may issue a warrant and cause the defendant to be arrested and brought before the court. Thereupon the court may revoke the probation or the suspension of sentence, and may impose any sentence which might originally have been imposed.' Act of March 4, 1925, c. 521,  2, 43 Stat. 1260, 18 U.S.C.  725 (18 USCA  725.) An amendment of the statute in June, 1933 (Act of June 16, 1933, c. 97, 48 Stat. 256, 18 U.S.C. Supp.  725 (18 USCA  725)), permits the execution of the warrant by a United States marshal as well as by a probation officer, but does not change the procedure otherwise. Under the statute as amended as well as in its original form, the probationer 'shall forthwith be takn before the court.' This mandate was disobeyed. The probationer, instead of being brought before the court which had imposed the sentence, was taken to a prison beyond the territorial limits of that court and kept there in confinement without the opportunity for a hearing. For this denial of a legal privilege the commitment may not stand.\n In thus holding we do not accept the petitioner's contention that the privilege has a basis in the Constitution, apart from any statute. Probation or suspension of sentence comes as an act of grace to one convicted of a crime, and may be coupled with such conditions in respect of \n\n[295 U.S. 490, 493]\n\u00a0\n its duration as Congress may impose. Burns v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 216\n, 53 S.Ct. 154. But the power of the lawmakers to dispense with notice or a hearing as part of the procedure of probation does not mean that a like dispensing power, in opposition to the will of Congress, has been confided to the courts. The privilege is no less real because its source is in the statute rather than in the Fifth Amendment. If the statement of the Congress that the probationer shall be brought before the court is command and not advice, it defines and conditions power. French v. Edwards, 13 Wall. 506, 511. The revocation is invalid unless the command has been obeyed.\n We find in this statute more than directory words of caution, leaving power unaffected. This is so if we consider the words alone, putting aside for the moment the ends and aims to be achieved. The defendant 'shall' be dealt with in a stated way; it is the language of command, a test significant, though not controlling. Richbourg Motor Co. v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 528, 534\n, 50 S.Ct. 385, 73 A.L.R. 1081. Doubt, however, is dispelled when we pass from the words alone to a view of ends and aims. Clearly the end and aim of an appearance before the court must be to enable an accused probationer to explain away the accusation. The charge against him may have been inspired by rumor or mistake or even downright malice. He shall have a chance to say his say before the word of his pursuers is received to his undoing. This does not mean that he may insist upon a trial in any strict or formal sense. Burns v. United States, supra, \n287 U.S. 216\n, at pages 222, 223, 53 S.Ct. 154. It does mean that there shall be an inquiry so fitted in its range to the needs of the occasion as to justify the conclusion that discretion has not been abused by the failure of the inquisitor to carry the probe deeper. Burns v. United States, supra. That much is necessary, or so the Congress must have thought, to protect the individual against malice or op- \n\n[295 U.S. 490, 494]\n\u00a0\n pression. Almost equally it is necessary, if we read aright the thought of Congress, for the good of the probation system with all its hopes of social betterment.\n If these are the ends to be promoted by bringing the probationer into the presence of his judge, the act is seen at once to be mandatory in meaning as well as mandatory in form. Statutes are not directory when to put them in that category would result in serious impairment of the public or the private interests that they were intended to protect. French v. Edwards, supra; Lyon v. Alley, \n130 \nU.S. 177, 185\n, 9 S.Ct. 480; Erhardt v. Schroeder, \n155 \nU.S. 124, 128\n, 130 S., 15 S.Ct. 45. Such is the situation here. When a hearing is allowed but there is error in conducting it or in limiting its scope, the remedy is by appeal. When an opportunity to be heard is denied altogether, the ensuing mandate of the court is void, and the prisoner confined thereunder may have recourse to habeas corpus to put an end to the restraint. It is beside the point to argue, as the government does, that in this case a hearing, if given, is likely to be futile because the judge has made it plain how his discretion will be exercised in that already he has canceled the suspension on the strength of an ex parte showing. The non sequitur is obvious. The judge is without the light whereby his discretion must be guided until a hearing, however summary, has been given the supposed offender. Cf. Snyder v. Com. of Massachusetts, \n291 \nU.S. 97, 116\n, 54 S.Ct. 330, 90 A.L.R. 575. Judsgment ceases to be judicial if there is condemnation in advance of trial.\n We hold that the attempted revocation is invalid for defect of power, and that, the suspension still continuing, the petitioner is entitled to be discharged from his confinement.\n The discharge is without prejudice to his arrest and commitment as a result of subsequent proceedings conforming to the statute. \n\n[295 U.S. 490, 495]\n\u00a0\n The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded with instructions that the writ must be sustained and the prisoner discharged.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","56":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEVANS v.

Pursuant to local law (Crawford & Moses' Digest,  1159-1163), he began the suit by attachment of real estate of the petitioner in the county, as that of a foreign corporation.\n Petitioner appeared specially in the circuit court and moved to vacate the attachment, on the grounds that it is \n\n[295 U.S. 229, 231]\n\u00a0\n not a foreign corporation subject to attachment under the pertinent statutes of Arkansas, and that it is a federal instrumentality, immune from mesne process of attachment, by virtue of its organization and functions under the statutes of the United States. On denial of the motion, petitioner sought of the Supreme Court of the state a writ of prohibition directed to respondent, the circuit judge, which was denied. 74 S.W.(2d) 222. We brought the case here on certiorari. \n294 \nU.S. 700\n, 55 S.Ct. 506, 79 L.Ed. --.\n The ruling of the state Supreme Court, that petitioner is a foreign corporation within the meaning of the Arkansas attachment statute, and that the attachment was authorized by local law, presents only a state question, which is not open for review here. The sole question for our consideration is whether the petitioner is exempt from attachment because it is a federal agency or instrumentality which Congress has not expressly subjected to judicial process.\n Without now entering into a detailed examination of the subject, it is sufficient that this court has already had occasion to consider the organization and functions of federal land banks, and to declare that they are instrumentalities of the federal government, engaged in the performance of an important governmental function. Smith v. Kansas City Title & Trust Co., \n255 \nU.S. 180\n, 41 S.Ct. 243; Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, \n290 \nU.S. 247\n, 54 S.Ct. 168. As such, so far as they partake of the sovereign character of the United States, Congress has full power to determine the extent to which they may be subjected to suit and judicial process. See Eastern Transportation Co. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 675, 677\n, 47 S.Ct. 289. Whether federal agencies are subjected to suit, and, if so, the extent to which they are amenable to judicial process, is thus a question of the congressional intent. See The Lake Monroe, \n250 \nU.S. 246, 249\n, 39 S.Ct. 460; Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. United States Fleet Corp., \n258 \nU.S. 549\n, 42 S.Ct. 386; Mossouri Pacific R. Co. v. Ault, \n256 \nU.S. 554, 559\n, 41 S.Ct. 593. If the \n\n[295 U.S. 229, 232]\n\u00a0\n answer is not made plain by the words of the statute, it is necessary to ascertain, by examination of the purposes and organization of the federal farm loan system, whether immunity from attachment is granted by implication. See Shaw v. Oil Corp., \n276 \nU.S. 575\n, 48 S.Ct. 333.\n Section 4 of the Federal Farm Loan Act (12 USCA  676) provides that federal land banks 'shall have power ... to sue and be sued, complain, interplead, and defend, in any court of law or equity, as fully as natural persons.' This express waiver of immunity from suit narrows the inquiry to the question whether liability to suit includes by implication judicial process of attachment and execution, which are usual incidents of suits against natural persons. For it is conceded that if the liability to suit includes liability to execution, it would equally include liability to process of attachment, by which the property seized is held subject to execution.\n In interpreting section 4, it is to be borne in mind that federal land banks, although concededly federal instrumentalities, possess also some of the characteristics of private business corporations. \n1\n See Federal Land Bank v. Gaines, supra, \n290 \nU.S. 247, 254\n, 54 S.Ct. 168. The statute does not contemplate that their stock is to be wholly, or even chiefly, government owned. \n2\n Its \n\n[295 U.S. 229, 233]\n\u00a0\n acquisition by private investors is permitted, section 5 (12 USCA  692), and its subscription by the borrowing national farm loan associations is compulsory, section 7 (12 USCA  721). The operations of the federal land banks are, in part at least, for profit. Section 5 (12 USCA  691 et seq.). In the conduct of their business they may enter into contracts, section 4 ( 12 USCA  676), borrow money, receive interest and fees, section 13 (12 USCA  781), pay the expenses and commissions of agents, section 15 (12 USCA  804), and pay dividends on their stock, section 5 (12 USCA  694). While they are required to deposit in trust farm mortgages as security for farm loan bonds, section 13 (12 USCA  781), they may acquire and dispose of property in their own right, including land. Section 13 (12 USCA  781). They thus have many of the characteristics of private business corporations, distinguishing them from the government itself and its municipal subdivisions, and from corporations wholly government owned and created to effect an exclusively governmental purpose. This is a circumstance which gives some support to the inference that the intended scope of the liability to suit includes judicial process incident to suit. See District of Columbia v. Woodbury, \n136 \nU.S. 450, 456\n, 10 S.Ct. 990; Clallam County, Wash. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 341, 345\n, 44 S. Ct. 121.\n The implication finds support also in the fact that the remedies afforded by the Federal Farm Loan Act to creditors of federal land banks are identical with those given to creditors of joint-stock land banks. Joint-stock land \n\n[295 U.S. 229, 234]\n\u00a0\n banks are privately owned corporations, organized for profit to their stockholders through the business of making loans on farm mortgages. Section 16 (12 USCA  811 et seq.). There is nothing in their organization and powers to suggest that they are government instrumentalities. Section 16 (12 USCA  813) declares that 'except as otherwise provided, joint- stock land banks shall have the powers of, and be subject to all the restrictions and conditions imposed on, Federal land banks by this Act ( chapter), so far as such restrictions and conditions are applicable. ...' There is no other provision relating to their general corporate powers and liabilities. Section 29 (12 USCA  963) provides that 'upon default of any obligation, Federal land banks and joint stock land banks may be declared insolvent and placed in the hands of a receiver by the Farm Credit Administration (Federal Farm Loan Board). ...' Except for section 4, subjecting federal land banks to suit, made applicable to joint stock land banks by section 16, there is no other remedy provided for creditors of either class of banks whose judgments are unpaid, and the receivership is available only through the favorable action of the Farm Credit Administration. In view of the character of the business of joint-stock land banks, there is no ground for supposing that Congress intended to render their property immune from seizure by judicial process and thus to make a receivership, if permitted by the Farm Credit Administration, the sole means of compelling payment of judgments against them, or that it would have extended to them the provisions and restrictions of section 16 if it had been thought to exempt them from attachment and execution. The inference is strong that by treating the two types of corporations alike with respect to liability to suit and attachment, the one, as much as the other, was intended to be subject to judicial seizure of its property, such as is ordinarily incident to suits, to which both are expressly made subject.\n It is of some significance, also, that Congress thought it necessary, by the terms of section 26 (12 USCA  931), to exempt federal land \n\n[295 U.S. 229, 235]\n\u00a0\n banks from taxation, a provision which is not made applicable to joint- stock land banks. There is thus a specific grant of immunity from taxation, to a corporation having its own purposes as well as those of the United States, and interested in profits on its own account, see Clallam County, Wash. v. United States, supra, \n263 \nU.S. 341, 344\n, 345 S., 44 S.Ct. 121; compare The Lake Monroe, supra, \n250 \nU.S. 246, 256\n, 39 S.Ct. 460, in contrast to the legislative silence as to attachment and execution in suits to which the bank is liable. This affords additional evidence of the congressional judgment that the attachment and execution, as distinguished from liability to taxation, are not obstacles to the performance of the governmental functions committed to federal land banks. Had it been intended otherwise, it would seem to have been at least equally necessary to provide specifically for immunity from attachment and levy, as was done in section 10 of the Federal Railroad Control Act of 1918, c. 25, 40 Stat. 451, 456, which subjected rail carriers under federal control to liability to suit. Immunity of corporate government agencies from suit and judicial process, and their incidents, is less readily implied than immunity from taxation. See The Lake Monroe, supra; Sloan Shipyards Corp. v. United States Fleet Corporation, \n258 U.S. 549\n, 566-568, 42 S.Ct. 386; Olson v. United States Spruce Corporation, \n267 \nU.S. 462\n, 45 S.Ct. 357; U.S. Shipping Fleet Corporation v. Harwood, \n281 U.S. 519\n, 524-526, 50 S.Ct. 372; compare The Davis, 10 Wall. 15; National Volunteer Home v. Parrish, \n229 \nU.S. 494\n, 33 S.Ct. 944; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 76, 79\n, 45 S.Ct. 211.\n In prescribing liability to suit, the qualifying phrase 'as fully as natural persons' is not customary in acts defining the powers and duties of private corporations, or usual in those creating corporations to perform federal functions. \n3\n It appears in section 8 of the National Banking \n\n[295 U.S. 229, 236]\n\u00a0\n Act, enacted in 1864, c. 106, 13 Stat. 99, 101 (12 USCA  24) which authorized national banks 'to sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law and equity, as fully as natural persons.' In 1873 the National Banking Act was amended, chapter 269,  2, 17 Stat. 603, to provide that 'no attachment, injunction or execution, shall be issued against such association or its property before final judgment in any suit, action, or proceeding, in any State, county, or municipal court.' R.S.  5242, 12 U.S.C. 91 (12 USCA  91). This amendment, which impliedly saved the right of execution upon judgments against national banks, while forbidding attachment, would seem to be a recognition by Congress that the liability of national banks to suit 'as fully as natural persons' extends by implication to attachment and execution. See Pacific National Bank v. Mixter, \n124 \nU.S. 721\n, 8 S.Ct. 718; Van Reed v. People's National Bank, \n198 \nU.S. 554\n, 25 S.Ct. 775, 3 Ann.Cas. 1154; compare Earle v. Pennsylvania, \n178 \nU.S. 449, 454\n, 20 S.Ct. 915. The legislative history of this section of the National Banking Act suggests that the like provision, without the amendment, was incorporated in the Federal Farm Loan Act as sufficient to subject federal land banks to the same liability to attachment to which national banks were deemed to be subject before the amendment of the National Banking Act.\n While none of these considerations, taken alone, may be enough to give clear indication of the congressional purpose, their cumulative effect is persuasive that federal land banks, like joint-stock land banks, were intended to be subject to the incidents of suit, including attachment \n\n[295 U.S. 229, 237]\n\u00a0\n and execution. In creating federal land banks as government instrumentalities, but with many of the purposes and activities of private corporations, in exempting them alone from taxation, and at the same time subjecting them, like jointstock land banks, to suit 'as fully as natural persons,' Congress cannot be thought to have intended that either class of banks should be immune from attachment, and their judgment creditors relegated to a receivership, allowed as a matter of grace, as the sole means of collecting their judgments.\n In the present case it does not appear that the attachment would directly interfere with any function performed by petitioner as a federal instrumentality. We reserve the question whether a different result would be required if such an interference were shown.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n295 \nU.S. 769\n, 55 S.Ct. 832, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The legislative history of the Federal Farm Loan Act shows that Congress understood that many of the activities of the federal land banks were to be of a private character.

No. 494, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 6; Report of Senate Comm. on Banking and Currency, No. 144, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 2; Remarks of Senator Hollis, sponsor of the bill, 53 Cong.Rec. 6854. For this reason the Senate gave extended consideration to the constitutionality of exempting federal land banks from state taxation. 53 Cong.Rec. 6961-6970, 7305-7318, 7372- 7378. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The original capitalization of the twelve federal land banks was $9, 000,000, of which the Treasury subscribed $8,892,130. (Federal Farm Loan Board, Annual Report, 1917, p. 13.) As the national farm loan associations, made up of individual borrowers, were organized and borrowed from the banks, they were required to purchase stock in the banks. Section 7 (12 USCA  733). By this method the original Treasury subscription was almost wholly retired, and only $204,698 of the issued capital stock, $65,676,130, was Government owned in 1931. (Federal Farm Loan Board, Annual Report, 1931, p. 21.) Recent legislation has resulted in a large increase in the capital stock and surplus of the federal land banks, contributed by the Government. See Act of January 23, 1932, c. 9,  2, 47 Stat. 12, 12 USCA  698; Act of June 16, 1933, c. 100, 48 Stat. 274, 279; cf. Act of January 31, 1934, c. 7, 48 Stat. 344, 12 USCA  1020 et seq.

JACK(1935)\nNo. 214\nArgued: December 11, 1934Decided: February 4, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 158, 159]\n\u00a0\n Mr. James F. Pierce, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The respondent, receiver of an insolvent national bank, brought this action in the federal court for the district of Utah against the petitioner to recover an assessment made by the Comptroller of the Currency. That court held him not entitled to recover. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed. 71 F.(2d) 264.\n August 17, 1917, Henry Forrest died testate owning six shares of the Nephi (Utah) national bank stock registered in his name. By his will he gave $1,000 to his niece and the rest of his property to his widow for life and whatever thereof she might have at death in equal \n\n[294 U.S. 158, 160]\n\u00a0\n shares to their son, who is the petitioner here, and their daughter. The will was probated in the district court of Juab county, Utah, and petitioner was appointed administrator with the will annexed. Before decree of distribution he and the daughter transferred all their rights to their mother.\n March 11, 1920, the court made an order reciting that the estate had been closed, and approved and settled the administrator's final account, and on the next day entered its decree directing that the property belonging to the estate be distributed to the widow. The administrator made distribution as ordered. The property so transferred included the bank stock, other personal property, and real property. Shortly after the distribution, the widow deeded to her daughter some of the real estate and to the petitioner the balance which is still held by him and worth more than $2,000. Respondent says, and we assume, that these conveyances were made without consideration. As petitioner knew, the stock was not transferred on the books of the bank but continued to stand in the name of his father.\n After distribution the bank paid a dividend to its stockholders and sent petitioner a check payable to the estate covering the amount applicable to the six shares. He deposited the check in his mother's account in the bank, informed its officers that the stock belonged to her, and suggested that thereafter checks for dividends be made to her. July 4, 1931, she died having no property other than the bank stock. November 17, 1931, petitioner applied to the court to be discharged as his father's administrator. November 18, having found the certificates covering the six shares among his mother's effects, he delivered them to the bank to be held for her estate. December 1, the court granted his application for discharge. The bank closed the same day. The Comptroller appointed respondent receiver and March 8, 1932, made an \n\n[294 U.S. 158, 161]\n\u00a0\n assessment of $100 on each share of the stock. Petitioner refused to pay the assessment on the shares formerly owned by his father.\n The complaint asserts devastavit in that the petitioner as administrator failed to pay into court or to retain property sufficient to cover the assessment or to transfer the stock to a solvent person and disposed of the entire estate except the stock. It also alleges that the real property deeded petitioner by his mother, having been conveyed to him without consideration, is subject to a lien for the amount of the assessment. The case was tried without a jury. At the close of the evidence, respondent moved for judgment against petitioner personally and, if that be denied, for transfer of the case to the equity side and a decree against the real property. Petitioner moved for judgment. The court denied respondent's motion and granted that of petitioner. The Circuit Court of Appeals held petitioner had not committed devastavit, but that, as the stock stood on the books of the bank in the name of the deceased, his estate remained liable and that petitioner held the real property subject to the assessment. It remanded the case to the district court, directed its transfer to equity and that decree be entered in conformity with its opinion.\n Title 12, U.S. Code,  64 (12 USCA  64), provides that: 'The stockholders of every national banking association shall be held individually responsible for all contracts, debts, and engagements of such association, each to the amount of his stock therein, at the par value thereof in addition to the amount invested in such stock. ...' And see section 63. Section 66 provides that: 'Persons holding stock as executors, administrators, guardians, or trustees, shall not be personally subject to any liabilities as stockholders; but the estates and funds in their hands shall be liable in like manner and to the same extent as the testator, intestate, ward, or person interested in such trust funds \n\n[294 U.S. 158, 162]\n\u00a0\n would be, if living and competent to act and hold the stock in his own name.'\n The liability of stockholders is based upon the statute, 12 USCA  64. 1 As a general rule, the person in whose name the stock stands on the books of the bank is liable,2 but the actual owner may be held although the stock has not been registered in his name. \n3\n The liability does not altogether cease on the death of the owner but, as limited and defined by section 66, attaches to his estate. \n4\n The fiduciaries are exempt but the property belonging to the estate is liable as would be the deceased if living. No cause of action arises until the assessment is made by the Comptroller and, so far as concerns the need and amount, his findings are conclusive. \n5\n He acts under federal authority and in respect of determinations, orders, and assessments may not be trammeled, controlled, or prevented by state laws. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 158, 163]\n\u00a0\n In the absence of federal enactments relating to procedure for enforcement of the liability imposed by section 66, collection is to be made in accordance with state laws governing claims against estates of deceased persons at least to the extent that such laws are not inconsistent with enforcement of the liability imposed by national authority. \n7\n There is no suggestion that the laws of the State of Utah discriminate against or are inadequate for the just and convenient enforcement of liability imposed, section 66, against estates of deceased stockholders. There can be no liability on account of assessments made after complete administration, final distribution of all the property and the extinguishment of the estate.\n In this case, the Comptroller's assessment was made more than eleven years after complete distribution and long after decedent's widow as distributee became the actual, though not the registered, owner of the stock and liable under section 64. The decree of March 11, 1920, closed the estate. The fact that the administrator was not formally discharged until December 1, 1931, about the time the bank failed, is without significance here as the Comptroller's assessment was not made until March 8, 1932. As the estate had ceased to exist before the bank became insolvent, the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly held that petitioner as administrator was not required by Utah law (R.S. 1933, 102-9-26) to retain or pay into court any property or money to cover possible future liability in respect of the stock that had been decreed and distributed to the widow. There is nothing to support the allegation of devastavit.\n Section 102-9-28 provides: 'When the accounts of the administrator or executor have been settled and an order \n\n[294 U.S. 158, 164]\n\u00a0\n made for the payment of debts and distribution of the estate, no creditor whose claim was not included in the order for payment has any right to call upon the creditors who have been paid, or upon the heirs, devisees or legatees, to contribute to the payment of his claim. ...' Viewed in the light of that provision, it is plain that the distribution fully extinguished the estate. It follows that petitioner's real estate that had belonged to decedent never became liable for the assessment.\n In Matteson v. Dent, \n176 \nU.S. 521\n, 20 S.Ct. 419, relied on by the court below and by respondent, this court affirming the supreme Court of Minnesota (70 Minn. 519, 73 N.W. 416; 73 Minn. 170, 75 N.W. 1041) held the estate not to have been extinguished when the bank became insolvent or when the assessment was made. The facts of that case were similar to those now before us. The estate ofa deceased stockholder of a national bank was, after administration, fully distributed without a transfer of the stock on the books of the bank. Later, because of its insolvency, the Comptroller closed the bank and made an assessment against its stockholders. He brought suit and obtained judgment against distributees under and in accordance with the General Statutes of Minnesota, 1894,  5918, which declares: 'The next of kin of a deceased person are liable to an action by a creditor of the estate, to recover the distributive shares received out of such estate, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy his debt. ...' That this statute utterly differs from that of Utah (102-9-28) clearly appears from the opinions of the Minnesota Supreme Court. In the first one it said (page 522 of 70 Minn., 73 N.W. 416): 'The claim here in question was a contingent claim, which did not become absolute until after the time to file claims had expired, and the estate was distributed to the widow, heirs, and next of kin. Under these circumstances the plaintiff may maintain an action, under chapter 77, Gen. St. 1894 (which includes \n\n[294 U.S. 158, 165]\n\u00a0\n section 5918), against the distributees, to recover of them the amount of the liability, not exceeding the amount of the distributive share received by each.' On the second appeal, the court overruled the contention that the liability of each distributee was limited to the amount of the bank stock he received from the estate. And this court, following and interpreting these decisions and affirming the judgment, held that, although the property had been allotted and delivered to the persons thereunto entitled under the decree of the probate court, the estate had not been extinguished but continued to exist subject to the liability defined in 12 USCA  66. As by Minnesota law-contrary to that of Utah- decedent's estate after distribution continued to be subject to the enforcement of claims, that case does not support respondent's contention here.\n The judgment of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and that of the District Court is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n294 \nU.S. 733\n, 55 S.Ct. 543, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] McClaine v.

MULLER(1935)\nNo. 47\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 207, 208]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Charles E. Hughes, Jr., of Washington, D.C., Percy Heiliger, of New York City, and James D. Shearer, of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Abram F. Myers, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an action brought in a Minnesota state court of first instance by the Film Corporation against Muller, to recover damages for an alleged breach of two contracts by which Muller was licensed to exhibit certain moving picture films belonging to the corporation. Muller answered, setting up the invalidity of the contracts under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act (15 USCA  1-7, 15 note). It was and is agreed that these contracts are substantially the same as the one involved in United States v. Paramount Famous Lasky Corporation, et al. (D.C.) 34 F.(2d) 984, affirmed \n282 \nU.S. 30\n, 51 S.Ct. 42; that petitioner was one of the defendants in that action; and that the 'arbitration clause,' paragraph 18 of each of the contracts sued upon, is the same as that held in that case to be invalid. In view of the disposition which we are to make of this writ, it is not necessary to set forth the terms of the arbitration clause or the other provisions of the contract.\n The court of first instance held that each contract sued upon violated the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, and dismissed the action. In a supplemental opinion, that court put its decision upon the grounds, first, that the arbitration plan is so connected with the remainder of the contract that the entire contract is tainted; and, second, that the con- \n\n[296 U.S. 207, 209]\n\u00a0\n tract violates the Sherman Anti-Trust law. The state Supreme Court affirmed. 192 Minn. 212, 255 N.W. 845. We granted certiorari, \n293 \nU.S. 550\n, 55 S.Ct. 213; but, when the case was called for argument, it appeared that no final judgment had been entered, and the writ was dismissed as improvidently granted. \n294 \nU.S. 696\n, 55 S.Ct. 444. The case was then remanded to the state Supreme Court; and, the judgment having been made final, and again affirmed by the state Supreme Court on the authority of its previous opinion, (Minn.) 260 N.W. 320, we allowed the present writ. \n295 \nU.S. 730\n, 55 S.Ct. 924\n\n\n In its opinion, the state Supreme Court, after a statement of the case, said (192 Minn. 212, at page 214, 255 N.W. 845, 846): 'The question presented on this appeal is whether the arbitration clause is severable from the contract, leaving the remainder of the contract enforceable or not severable, permeating and tainting the whole contract with illegality and making it void.' That court then proceeded to refer to and discuss a number of decisions of state and federal courts, some of which took the view that the arbitration clause was severable, and others that it was not severable, from the remainder of the contract. After reviewing the opinion and decree of the federal District Court in the Paramount Case, the lower court reached the conclusion that the holding of the federal court was that the entire contract was illegal; and upon that view and upon what it conceived to be the weight of authority, held the arbitration plan was inseparable from the other provisions of the contract. Whether this conclusion was right or wrong we need not determine. It is enough that it is, at least, not without fair support.\n Respondent contends that the question of severability was alone decided and that no federal question was determined by the lower court. This contention petitioner challenges, and asserts that a federal question was involved and decided. We do not attempt to settle the dis- \n\n[296 U.S. 207, 210]\n\u00a0\n pute; but, assuming for present purposes only that petitioner's view is the correct one, the case is controlled by the settled rule that where the judgment of a state court rests upon two grounds, one of which is federal and the other nonfederal in character, our jurisdiction fails if the nonfederal ground is independent of the federal ground and adequate to support the judgment. This rule had become firmly fixed at least as early as Klinger v. State of Missouri, 13 Wall. 257, 263, and has been reiterated in a long line of cases since that time. It is enough to cite, in addition to the Klinger Case, the following: Enterprise Irr. Dist. v. Farmers' Mut. Canal Co., \n243 U.S. 157\n, 163-165, 37 S.Ct. 318; Petrie v. Nampa etc., Irr. Dist., \n248 \nU.S. 154, 157\n, 39 S.Ct. 25; McCoy v. Shaw, \n277 \nU.S. 302\n, 48 S.Ct. 519; Eustis v. Bolles, \n150 \nU.S. 361\n, 14 S.Ct. 131.\n Whether the provisions of a contract are nonseverable, so that if one be held invalid the others must fall with it, is clearly a question of general and not of federal law. The invalidity of the arbitration clause which the present contracts embody is conceded. It was held invalid by the federal District Court in the Paramount Case, and its judgment was affirmed here. The question, therefore, was foreclosed; and was not the subject of controversy in the state courts. In that situation, the primary question to be determined by the court below was whether the concededly invalid clause was separable from the other provisions of the contract. The ruling of the state Supreme Court that it was not, is sufficient to conclude the case without regard to the determination, if, in fact, any was made, in respect of the federal question. It follows that the nonfederal ground is adequate to sustain the judgment.\n The rule announced in Enterprise Irr. Dist. v. Farmers' Mut. Canal Co ., supra, and other cases, to the effect that our jurisdiction attaches where the nonfederal ground is so interwoven with the other as not to be an independent \n\n[296 U.S. 207, 211]\n\u00a0\n matter, does not apply. The construction put upon the contracts did not constitute a preliminary step which simply had the effect of bringing forward for determination the federal question, but was a decision which automatically took the federal question out of the case if otherwise it would be there. The nonfederal question in respect of the construction of the contracts and the federal question in respect of their validity under the Anti-Trust Act were clearly independent of one another. See Allen v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co., \n173 U.S. 479\n, 489-492, 19 S.Ct. 518. The case, in effect, was disposed of before the federal question said to be involved was reached. Chouteau v. Gibson, \n111 \nU.S. 200\n, 4 S.Ct. 340; Chapman v. Goodnow, \n123 \nU.S. 540, 548\n, 8 S.Ct. 211. A decision of that question then became unnecessary; and whether it was decided or not, our want of jurisdiction is clear.\n Writ dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\n\n\n","60":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFOX v.

Holt, of Charleston, W. Va., for appellant.\n Mr. H. D. Rummel, of Charleston, W. Va., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 87, 91]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy hinges upon the meaning and validity of the chain store license tax of West Virginia in its application to distributing plants and service stations for the sale of gasoline and kindred products.\n On March 8, 1933, the Legislature of West Virginia passed a law (Acts W. Va. 1933, c. 36) whereby all persons and corporations operating or maintaining a store as therein defined were required to obtain an annual license from the state tax commissioner. The license fee was graduated according to the number of stores. Upon one store the fee was to be $2; upon two stores or more, but not to exceed five, the fee was to be $5 for each additional store; upon six or more, but not to exceed ten, $10 for each additional store; upon each store in excess of ten, but not to exceed fifteen, $20; upon each in excess of fifteen, but not to exceed twenty, $ 30; upon each in excess of twenty, but not to exceed thirty, $35; upon each in excess of thirty, but not to exceed fifty, $100; upon each in excess of fifty, but not to exceed seventy-five, $200; and upon each in excess of seventy-five, $250.\n Appellee, complainant in the court below, is a Delaware corporation, engaged in the business of refining, transporting, and distributing petroleum products. It owns or controls in West Virginia 949 service or filling \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 92]\n\u00a0\n stations, and 54 bulk plants, a total of 1,003. Of the 949 stations, there are 101, which are described as 'company owned'; these are both owned and operated by the complainant itself. 'Leased outlets,' 388 in number, and 'vending privilege outlets,' 460 in number, are leased by the complaint and operated by agents under commission contracts. By concession its control over these outlets is so complete as to amount to operation within the meaning of the statute. Finally there are 54 'bulk or distributing plants,' maintained chiefly for the storage of petroleum products to be distributed to the stations, but in part as a source of supply from which deliveries are made to buyers.\n Chains for the sale of gasoline have units many times more numerous than chains for other purposes. The longest 'general commodity' chain is that of the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company with 198 stores within the boundaries of West Virginia. Not only are the gasoline units more numerous, but the sales from any one unit are, comparatively speaking, small, as must always be the case when subdivision is so minute. The result is to cast upon the complainant and upon competing chains in the same business a burden much heavier, both absolutely and relatively to earnings, than any that is borne by others. This is brought out clearly through statistical tables in the record. The store license fees from all sources during the year 1933 amounted to $569,693. Of this total, stores other than gasoline stations contributed $83,525 (single stores $21,723, and multiple stores $61,802). Single gasoline stations, maintained by independent dealers, 2,000 in number, contributed $5,000, and chain gasoline stations $481,168, or 84.46 per cent. of the whole. Five oil companies, including the complainant, paid $476,171 or 83.5 per cent., and the complainant alone paid $240,173 or 42.16 per cent. Other tables supply the data for a comparison between the business done by the gasoline chains and that \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 93]\n\u00a0\n of chains for other purposes. If we look to the year 1932, the latest year for which complete figures are forthcoming, 2,453 gasoline chain stations did an aggregate business of $15,198,638, or 4.6 per cent. of the total chain business of the state, yet they would have paid 84.46 per cent. of the tax if the law had been in force during that year; 1,889 general retail stores in chain organizations did a total business of $75,454,257, or 22.9 per cent. of the whole, and would have paid 10.7 per cent. of the tax, this because the number of the units was relatively small. In 1932, the average gross revenue of the complainant's gasoline stations was $26, 822 for each of the company owned stations, and $3,892 for each of the agency stations, the company owned stations making by far the better showing. During the same year the average net income for company stations was $1,782.78 (it had been more than double in 1931), and for agency stations only $89.75. Upon that basis a tax of $250 would have left a profit for the one group, but a loss for the other. In the computation of this loss, a word may be of use as to the bookkeeping methods in vogue in the complainant's business. The complainant's practice has been to bill the gasoline to its stations at the current market prices, as if there were a sale to strangers. Such a mode of segregation, unless corrected by other data, will give at times a partial picture of the economic situation. If the price at which the oil is billed includes a reasonable profit for refining and transporting, the business may show a gain when viewed in all its parts, though the later work of marketing is carried on at cost or less. Stations scattered far and wide address a mass appeal to customers, and thus stimulate them to buy at the sign that has made itself familiar. True, the complainant lost money in the process of refining from 1930 to 1933, but, for anything that is shown, the loss had its origin in the general economic depression prevailing in those years. Even so, there can be no denial that service filling stations, when organ- \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 94]\n\u00a0\n ized in chains, bear a heavier and harsher burden than chains whose units are fewer and yet individually larger.\n Impatient of that burden, the complainant brought this suit in June, 1933, to restrain the state tax commissioner from paying into the treasury of the state to sum of $240,173.50 paid under protest as the license taxes of the year. The reason for resort to equity was the uncertainty as to the existence of any remedy at law for the recovery of the taxes when once the moneys were deposited in this treasury, and subjected thereby to the state's ownership and power. In its bill of complaint the complainant took the ground that the exactions were illegal, first, because the gasoline stations were not stores within the meaning of the statute, and, second, because, even though they were, the imposition of taxes was a denial to the complainant of immunities secured by the equal protection clause and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and also by provisions of the Constitution of the state. A District Court of three judges, organized in accordance with section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.  380 (28 USCA  380)), heard the complainant's application for interlocutory and permanent relief. The court decided, after a careful review of the West Virginia statutes, that there was an imperfect remedy at law which made permissible resort to equity. In that conclusion we concur. The court decided also that the operation of the tax in its application to chains of gasoline stations was so much harsher and heavier than the operation of the tax when applied to other chains as to constitute a denial to the complainant of the equal protection of the laws. Finally the court decided that gasoline stations were not stores within the meaning of the statute. 6 F.Supp. 494. The decree enjoined the payment of the contested fees into the treasury of the state, and ordered restitution. An appeal to this court followed. \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 95]\n\u00a0\n First. The filling stations and distribution plants are stores or mercantile establishments within the meaning of the statute.\n By section 8, 'the term 'store' as used in this act shall be construed to mean and include any store or stores or any mercantile establishment or establishments which are owned, operated, maintained and\/or controlled by the same person, firm, corporation, copartnership or association, either domestic or foreign, in which goods, wares or merchandise of any kind, are sold, either at retail or wholesale.'\n There is no doubt that goods, wares, and merchandise of a kind, i.e., gasoline and other petroleum products, and even tires and other automobile accessories, are sold by the complainant and its agencies at its plants and service stations. This satisfies the test of the statute, and subjects the seller to the tax. We are told that the average man, if requested to point out to a stranger the store nearest by or even the nearest mercantile establishment, would not be likely to think of a filling station as within the range of the inquiry. \n1\n Wadhams Oil Co. v. State, 210 Wis. 448, 245 N.W. 646, 649, 246 N.W. 687. There might be force in this suggestion if the statute had left the meaning of its terms to the test of popular understanding. Instead, it has attempted to secure precision and certainty by rejecting a test so fluid and indeterminate and supplying its own glossary. The goods offered for sale are to be understood as having reference to goods 'of any kind,' and the place at which the sale is made shall include, not only places that in the common speech of men would be designated as stores, but, broadly speaking, any mercantile establishment, \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 96]\n\u00a0\n whether a store or something else. In such circumstances definition by the average man or even by the ordinary dictionary with its studied enumeration of subtle shades of meaning is not a substitute for the definition set before us by the lawmakers with instructions to apply it to the exclusion of all others. Cf. Midwestern Petroleum Corp. v. State Board of Tax Commissioners (Ind. Sup.) 187 N.E. 882. There would be little use in such a glossary if we were free in despite of it to choose a meaning for ourselves.\n Extrinsic tokens of intention, however, are not lacking altogether, and, though their force may not be great, they point us the same way. In the passage of the bill through the Senate, an amendment was proposed whereby the definition of a store in section 8 was to be supplemented by the following proviso: 'Provided, however, that the term 'store' shall not include filling stations engaged exclusively in the sale of gasoline and other petroleum products.' The amendment was put to a vote and rejected. What was done in that connection is doubtless not conclusive as to the meaning of the bill in the unamended form. Murdock v. City of Memphis, 20 Wall. 590, 618. It is, however, a circumstance to be weighed along with others when choice is nicely balanced. Finlayson v. City of Shinnston, 113 W.Va. 434, 437, 168 S.E. 479; cf. United States v. United Shoe Machinery Co. (D.C.) 264 F. 138, 174; Lapina v. Williams, \n232 \nU.S. 78, 89\n, 34 S.Ct. 196. Reinforcing this token is the contemporaneous interpretation of the statute by the tax commissioner of the state, the administrative agent charged with its enforcement. Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 375, 378\n, 51 S.Ct. 144. We give to such construction 'respectful consideration,' though we have power to disregard it. United States v. Moore, \n95 U.S. 760\n, 763; Fawcus Machine Co. v. United States, supra. The complainant was at liberty to maintain a suit in the state courts, where the meaning of the statute could have \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 97]\n\u00a0\n been determined with finality. It chose to have recourse to the courts of the nation. In such circumstances we are charged with a duty of independent judgment (Siler v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n213 \nU.S. 175, 194\n, 29 S.Ct. 451; Hurn v. Oursler, \n289 \nU.S. 238, 243\n, 53 S. Ct. 586), but, in default of other tests, we lean to an agreement with the agents of the state.\n Second. The statute in its application to the complainant and others similarly situated does not deny to the taxpayer the equal protection of the laws.\n The inquiry divides itself into two branches which call for separate consideration. Is a series of filling stations a chain of such a kind as to be subject to a different measure of taxation from stations in separate ownership? This question was answered by the court below in favor of the state, but it is still pressed in this court by counsel for the complainant. If the stations in a chain may be taxed differently from independent units and the amount of the tax fixed upon a graduated basis, is the graduation in its consequences so extreme, so disproportionate to benefits, as to be an arbitrary discrimination between longer chains and shorter ones, or between chains for the sale of gasoline and for the sale of other products? This question was answered by the court below in favor of the taxpayer.\n\n\n (1)\n We think a series of gasoline stations maintained in a single ownership has the benefit of chain organization in such a sense and measure as to fall within the scope of the decisions of this court in State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464, and Liggett Co. v. Lee, \n288 \nU.S. 517\n, 53 S. Ct. 481, 85 A.L.R. 699. The opinion in Jackson's Case enumerates some of the advantages of chain store operation, and finds a sufficient basis for taxing chains differently from stores separately owned. The opinion in Liggett's Case makes it clear that the list of benefits was for illustration only, but that in every 'integrated chain,' whatever its particular quality, there is something constant and distinctive which marks it off from stores main- \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 98]\n\u00a0\n tained in separate ownership, and even from those combining in co- operative leagues. 288 U.S. at page 532, 53 S.Ct. 481, 85 A. L.R. 699. The complainant in this suit returns to the same method of attack, picking out one feature of management after another from the list in Jackson's Case, as if what was enumerated there were a code to which every chain is to conform if it is to be subject to taxation in accordance with a special system. The method is deceptive, yet many of the chief benefits found in the structure of other integrated chains will be discovered to be present here.\n We have here abundant capital; standardization in equipment and display; superior management; more rapid turnover; uniformity in store management; special accounting methods; and a unified sales policy co- ordinating the diverse units. The complainant receives the crude oil from a subsidiary company, which produces one-third of what it sells and buys two-thirds from others, these others, for all that appears, being affiliated corporations. The oil when delivered is refined by the complainant, and then billed to itself, that is, to its stations and agencies, at current market rates. Through all these far-flung instruments it distributes its own products and spreads through every hamlet its repute as a distributor. Ownership or control of a host of well-appointed depots, uniform in design and color, has put the chains in a position to bring home to the consuming public the knowledge of their wares and of the quality of their service in a way far beyond the capacity of the independent dealer with one station or a few. The mere statement of the number of depots maintained by the complainant-1,000 separate centers of attraction and distribution-must bear persuasive witness to the tremendous potencies of advertisement, of reiterated suggestion, inherent in a business conducted on such a scale. The results confirm the prophecy. There are 4,453 filling stations in West Virginia. Of these only 55 per cent. are members of a chain, yet this 55 per cent. \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 99]\n\u00a0\n has been able to make 75 per cent. of the sales of motor fuel. True the complainant has been willing to loan its distinctive labels and equipment to independent operators dealing in its products, and even to paint their stations so that they will seem to be its own. This practice has been discontinued since the passage of the National Industrial Recovery Act (48 Stat. 195) and the adoption of a code thereunder. Even before that time, however, the gasoline was billed to independents at a price one-half cent per gallon higher than the price payable by agencies acting on a commission basis. The discrimination may mean the difference between a profit and a loss. More important is this, that the effect of multitudinous agencies, reaching into every corner, and yet subject to regulation at a center, is to fix a uniform retail price to which independents must conform as the price of their existence. They are independent in name only, for the chain sets the pace, and even in competing they are subject to its mastery. They are remainded every hour that a chain efficiently conducted, with ample capital behind it, is able to attract the public in a degree impossible for others. Indeed, some of them are driven to pose as members of the chain by borrowing its insignia in order to share its popularity. The popularity would be unattainable without a multiplicity of units repeating the same message.\n\n\n (2)\n Chains of gasoline stations being subject like other chains to a graduated tax, the question remains whether the rates are so oppressive as to amount to arbitrary discrimination or to unlawful confiscation.\n When the power to tax exists, the extent of the burden is a matter for the discretion of the lawmakers. The subject was fully considered in Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40\n, 54 S.Ct. 599, decided at the last term. 'Even if the tax should destroy a business it would not be made invalid or require compensation upon that ground alone. Those who enter upon a business take that risk.' Alaska Fish Salting & By-Products \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 100]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. Smith, \n255 \nU.S. 44, 48\n, 41 S.Ct. 219, 220, quoted in Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra, page 46 of 292 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 599. True the reservation was made (292 U.S. at page 44, 54 S.Ct. 599) that an act might be so arbitrary as not to be an exercise of the taxing power at all, the form of a tax being a cloak for something else. Cf. Child Labor Case, \n259 \nU.S. 20\n, 42 S.Ct. 449, 21 A.L.R. 1432. In respect of the challenged act, there is neither evidence nor even claim of any such abuse. On the contrary, the complainant has stated in its bill that the 'act is, in effect, a tax measure,' its validity or invalidity to be adjudged upon that basis. A chain, as we have seen, is a distinctive business species, with its own capacities and functions. Broadly speaking, its opportunities and powers become greater with the number of the component links; and, the greater they become, the more far-reaching are the consequences, both social and economic. For that reason the state may tax the large chains more heavily than the small ones, and upon a graduated basis, as indeed we have already held. State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, supra; Liggett Co. v. Lee, supra. Not only may it do this, but it may make the tax so heavy as to discourage multiplication of the units to an extent believed to be inordinate, any by the incidence of the burden develop other forms of industry. Quong Wing v. Kirkendall, \n223 \nU.S. 59\n, 32 S.Ct. 192; American Sugar Refining Co. v. Louisiana, \n179 \nU.S. 89, 95\n, 21 S.Ct. 43; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 126\n, 30 S.Ct. 496; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 394\n, 52 S.Ct. 581; Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 87 A.L.R. 721. In principle there is no distinction between such an exercise of power and the statute upheld in Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra, whereby sales of butter were fostered and sales of oleomargarine repressed. A motive to build up through legislation the quality of men may be as creditable in the thought of some as a motive to magnify the quantity of trade. Courts do not choose between such values in adjudging legislative powers. They put the choice aside as beyond their lawful competence. 'Collateral \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 101]\n\u00a0\n purposes or motives of a Legislature in levying a tax of a kind within the reach of its lawful power are matters beyond the scope of judicial inquiry.' Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, supra, at page 44 of \n292 U.S. 54\n S.Ct. 599, 601; McCray v. United States, \n195 \nU.S. 27, 56\n, 24 S.Ct. 769, 1 Ann. Cas. 561. The tax now assailed may have its roots in an erroneous conception of the ills of the body politic or of the efficacy of such a measure to bring about a cure. We have no thought in anything we have written to declare it expedient or even just, or for that matter to declare the contrary. We deal with power only.\n The argument against the statute rings the changes upon a comparison between the position of the gasoline chains and that of chains for other products. The gasoline chains,2 as already noted in this opinion, have units more numerous by far than those that deal in other things, and because of their size must pay a large percentage of the tax, though it is not to be forgotten that there are general commodity chains also within the upper brackets. The outcome is no evidence of an arbitrary discrimination, defiant of the restraints of law. All members of a class within the same graduated levels are treated impartially and subjected to an equal rule. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, \n170 \nU.S. 283, 293\n, 296 S., 18 S.Ct. 594. If only one form of chain chooses so to multiply its units, after arriving at the topmost levels, as to make the burden heavy, it owes its position on the scale and the aggravation of the tax to the exigencies of business and not to those of law. The classification is not arbitrary, but in its normal operation has a rational relation to the subject-matter to be taxed, the capacity to pay, and the justice of the payment. Cf. Magoun v. Illinois Trust & Savings Bank, supra; Knowlton v. Moore, \n178 \nU.S. 41, 54\n, 20 S.Ct. 747; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61\n, 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Lake Shore & Michigan \n\n[294 U.S. 87, 102]\n\u00a0\n Southern R. Co. v. Clough, \n242 \nU.S. 375, 385\n, 37 S.Ct. 144; Maxwell v. Bugbee, \n250 \nU.S. 525, 540\n, 541 S., 40 S.Ct. 2; Watson v. State Comptroller, \n254 \nU.S. 122, 124\n, 41 S.Ct. 43; State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, supra, at page 537 of 283 U.S ., 51 S.Ct. 540. We have never yet held that government in levying a graduated tax upon all the members of a class must satisfy itself by inquiry that every group within the class will be able to pay the tax without the sacrifice of profits. The operation of a general rule will seldom be the same for every one. If the accidents of trade lead to inequality or hardship, the consequences must be accepted as inherent in government by law instead of government by edict.\n Third. The statute does not violate the Constitution of West Virginia which requires that taxation shall be equall and uniform throughout the state. Article 10,  1.\n The Constitution of Indiana has a like provision which was considered by this court when sustaining the chain store tax in State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, supra, at page 542 of 283 U.S., 51 S.Ct. 540. The view was expressed that the standard of uniformity under the Constitution of the state was substantially the same as the standard of equality under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the nation.\n Not finding that the courts of West Virginia have spoken on the subject differently, we reach the same conclusion now. Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v. Garrett, \n231 \nU.S. 298, 305\n, 34 S.Ct. 48. Cf. Laing v. Fow (W. Va., 1934) 175 S.E. 354, 359; Hope Natural Gas Co. v.

It maintains that the transaction out of which the alleged gains arose amounted to a reorganization within the intendment of section 112(i)(1) (A), Revenu Act 1928, 45 Stat. 816 (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note).1\n The court below was of opinion that the transaction involved amounted to a sale of the assets and business of the taxpayer. In November, 1929, petitioner transferred what the Board of Tax Appeals seems to have assumed was substantially all of its assets to the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation, and received therefor $200,000 in cash and 17,250 shares common stock of the purchaser, then worth possibly $30 per share. After the trans- \n\n[296 U.S. 389, 391]\n\u00a0\n fer, the taxpayer remained in existence and continued to do business. It also retained assets of undisclosed value, namely, shares of certain subsidiary corporations and some other property. If the claim of the taxpayer that the transfer included substantially all its property is correct, then we think what was done amounted to a reorganization within the statute. The facts in respect of this were not found by the Board of Tax Appeals, and the cause must be returned there in order that the omission may be supplied. The mere fact that the taxpayer and its subsidiaries continued actively in business would not defeat the claim of reorganization. The ownership of the stock in the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation gave the taxpayer a substantial and continuing interest in the affairs of that corporation.\n The judgment of the court below is reversed. The cause will be remanded to the Circuit Court of Appeals, with direction to that Court to remand the case to the Board of Tax Appeals for determination of the value of the retained assets, and such further proceedings as may be necessary. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Margin of opinion in Helvering v.

HELVERING(1935)\nNo. 41\nArgued: November 15, 1935Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 200, 201]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Hugh C. Bickford and R. Kemp Slaughter, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. James L. Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n January 1, 1927, petitioner, general Utilities, a Delaware corporation, acquired 20,000 shares (one-half of total outstanding) common stock Islands Edison Company, for which it paid $2,000. Gillet & Company owned the remainder.\n During January, 1928, Whetstone, president of Southern Cities Utilities Company, contemplated acquisition by his company of all Islands Edison common stock. He discussed the matter with Lucas, petitioner's president, also with Gillet & Co. The latter concern agreed \n\n[296 U.S. 200, 202]\n\u00a0\n to sell its holdings upon terms acceptable to all. But Lucas pointed out that the shares which his company held could only be purchased after distribution of them among stockholders, since a sale by it would subject the realized profit to taxation, and when the proceeds passed to the stockholders there would be further exaction. Lucas had no power to sell, but he, Gillet, and Whetstone were in accord concerning the terms and conditions under which purchase of all the stock might become possible-'it being understood and agreed between them that petitioner would make distribution of the stock of the Islands Edison Company to its stockholders and that counsel would prepare a written agreement embodying the terms and conditions of the said sale, agreement to be submitted for approval to the stockholders of the Islands Edison Company after the distribution of said stock by the petitioner.'\n Petitioner's directors, March 22, 1928, considered the disposition of the Island Edison shares. Officers reported they were worth $1,122,500, and recommended an appreciation on the books to that figure. Thereupon a resolution directed this change; also 'that a dividend in the amount of $1, 071,426.25 be and it is hereby declared on the Common Stock of this Company payable in Common Stock of The Islands Edison Company at a valuation of $56.12 1\/2 a share, out of the surplus of the Company arising from the appreciation in the value of the Common Stock of The Islands Edison Company held by this Company, viz., $1,120,500.00, the payment of the dividend to be made by the delivery to the stockholders of this Company, pro rata, of certificates for the Common Stock of The Islands Edison Company held by this Company at the rate of two shares of such stock for each share of Company Stock of this Corporation.'\n Accordingly, 19,090 shares were distributed amongst petitioner's thirty-three stockholders and proper transfers \n\n[296 U.S. 200, 203]\n\u00a0\n to them were made upon the issuing corporation's books. It retained 910 shares.\n After this transfer, all holders of Islands Edison stock sold to Southern Cities Utilities Company at $56.12 1\/2 per share. Petitioner realized $46,346.30 net profit on 910 shares and this was duly returned for taxation. There was no report of gain upon the 19,090 shares distributed to stockholders.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue declared a taxable gain upon distribution of the stock in payment of the dividend declared March 22d, and made the questioned deficiency assessment. Seeking redetermination by the Board of Tax Appeals, petitioner alleged: 'The Commissioner of Internal Revenue has erroneously held that the petitioner corporation made a profit of $1,069,517.25 by distributing to its own stockholders certain capital stock of another corporation which it had theretofore owned.' And it asked a ruling that no taxable gain resulted from the appreciation upon its books and subsequent distribution of the shares. Answering, the Commissioner denied that his action was erroneous, but advanced no new basis of support. A stipulation concerning the facts followed; and upon this and the pleadings, the Board heard the cause.\n It found: 'The respondent has determined a deficiency in income tax in the amount of $128,342.07 for the calendar year 1928. The only question presented in this proceeding for redetermination is whether petitioner realized taxable gain in declaring a dividend and paying it in the stock of another company at an agreed value per share, which value was in excess of the cost of the stock to petitioner.' Also: 'On March 26, 1928, the stockholders of the Islands Edison Company (one of which was petitioner, owning 910 shares) and the Southern Cities Utilities Company, entered into a written contract of sale of the Islands Edison Company stock. At no \n\n[296 U.S. 200, 204]\n\u00a0\n time did petitioner agree with Whetstone or the Southern Cities Utilities Company, verbally or in writing, to make sale to him or to the Southern Cities Utilities Company of any of said stock except the aforesaid 910 shares of the Islands Edison Company.'\n The opinion recites: The Commissioner's 'theory is that upon the declaration of the dividend on March 22, 1928, petitioner became indebted to its stockholders in the amount of $1,071,426.25, and that the discharge of that liability by the delivery of property costing less than the amount of the debt constituted income, citing United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., \n284 \nU.S. 1\n, 52 S.Ct. 4.' 'The intent of the directors of petitioner was to declare a dividend payable in Islands Edison stock; their intent was expressed in that way in the resolution formally adopted; and the dividend was paid in the way intended and declared. We so construe the transaction, and on authority of First Savings Bank v. Burnet, supra ( 60 App.D.C. 307, 53 F.(2d) 919, 82 A.L.R. 549), we hold that the declaration and payment of the dividend resulted in no taxable income.'\n The Commissioner asked the Circuit Court of Appeals, Fourth Circuit, to review the Board's determination. He alleged: 'The only question to be decided is whether the petitioner (taxpayer) realized taxable income in declaring a dividend and paying it in stock of another company at an agreed value per share, which value was in excess of the cost of the stock.'\n The court stated: 'There are two grounds upon which the petitioner urges that the action of the Board of Tax Appeals was wrong: First, that the dividend declared was in effect a cash dividend and that the respondent realized a taxable income by the distribution of the Islands Edison Company stock to its stockholders equal to the difference between the amount of the dividend declared and the cost of the stock. Second, that the sale made of the \n\n[296 U.S. 200, 205]\n\u00a0\n Islands Edison Company stock was in reality a sale by the respondent (with all the terms agreed upon before the declaration of the dividend), through its stockholders who were virtually acting as agents of the respondent, the real vendor.'\n Upon the first ground, it sustained the Board. Concerning the second, it held that, although not raised before the Board, the point should be ruled upon.\n'When we come to consider the sale of the stock of the Islands Edison Company we cannot escape the conclusion that the transaction was deliberately planned and carried out for the sole purpose of escaping taxation. The purchaser was found by the officers of the respondent; the exact terms of the sale as finally consummated were agreed to by the same officers; the purchaser of the stock stated that the delivery of all the stock was essential and that the delivery of a part thereof would not suffice; the details were worked out for the express and admitted purpose of avoiding the payment of the tax and for the reason that the attorneys for the respondent had advised that unless some such plan was adopted the tax would have to be paid; and a written agreement was to be prepared by counsel for the respondent which was to be submitted to the stockholders; all this without the stockholders, or any of them, who were ostensibly making the sale, being informed, advised or consulted. Such admitted facts plainly constituted a plan, not to use the harsher terms of scheme, artifice or conspiracy, to evade the payment of the tax. For the purposes of this decision it is not necessary to consider whether such a course as is here shown constituted a fraud, it is sufficient if we conclude that the object was to evade the payment of a tax justly due the government.\n\n'The sale of the stock in question was, in substance, made by the respondent company, through the stockholders as agents or conduits through whom the transfer of \n\n[296 U.S. 200, 206]\n\u00a0\n the title was effected. The stockholders, even in their character as agents, had little or no option in the matter and in no sense exercised any independent judgment. They automatically ratified the agreement prepared and submitted to them.'\n\n A judgment of reversal followed.\n Both tribunals below rightly decided that petitioner derived no taxable gain from the distribution among its stockholders of the Islands Edison shares as a dividend. This was no sale; assets were not used to discharge indebtedness.\n The second ground of objection, although sustained by the court, was not presented to or ruled upon by the Board. The petition for review relied wholly upon the first point; and, in the circumstances, we think the court should have considered no other. Always a taxpayer is entitled to know with fair certainty the basis of the claim against him. Stipulations concerning facts and any other evidence properly are accommodated to issues adequately raised.\n Recently (April, 1935) this court pointed out: 'The Court of Appeals is without power, on review of proceedings of the Board of Tax Appeals, to make any findings of fact. ... The function of the court is to decide whether the correct rule of law was applied to the facts found; and whether there was substantial evidence before the Board to support the findings made. ... If the Board has failed to make an essential finding and the record on review is insufficient to provide the basis for a final determination, the proper procedure is to remand the case for further proceedings before the Board. ... And the same procedure is appropriate even when the findings omitted by the Board might be supplied from examination of the record.' Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123, 131\n, 132 S., 55 S.Ct. 732, 736\n\n\n Here the court undertook to decide a question not properly raised. Also it made an inference of fact directly \n\n[296 U.S. 200, 207]\n\u00a0\n in conflict with the stipulation of the parties and the findings, for which we think the record affords no support whatever. To remand the cause for further findings would be futile. The Board could not properly find anything which would assist the Commissioner's cause.\n The judgment of the court below must be reversed. The action of the Board of Tax Appeals is approved.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGEORGE ALLISON & CO., INC. v. U.

CITY OF DECATUR(1935)\nNo. 570\nArgued: April 3, 1935Decided: April 29, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Walter T. Colquitt, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellants.\n Mr. James A. Branch, of Atlanta, Ga., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Georgia Railway & Electric Company, which owned and operated street car lines in the city of Decatur and between that city and other points in the state, leased its property in 1912 to the Georgia Railway & Power Company for the term of 999 years. By the terms of the lease, the latter company bound itself to pay all taxes, rates, charges, licenses, and assessments which \n\n[295 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n might be lawfully imposed and assessed against the property during the continuance of the lease.\n By the terms of its charter and a consolidation agreement, the Georgia Power Company in 1927 became possessed of all the rights, franchises, etc., and subject to all the duties, liabilities, debts, and obligations of these two corporations; and thereupon their existence, with certain exceptions, ceased and became merged in the Georgia Power Company as a consolidated corporation.\n On May 15, 1925, the city of Decatur, acting under a state statute,1 ordained that a designated street over which the railway lines extended should be paved as a necessary improvement for travel and drainage; and that the cost of such pavement should be assessed in full against the Railway & Power Company for paving between the tracks and for two feet on each side thereof, the remaining cost to be assessed one-half against the real estate abutting on one side of the street where paved, and the other half against the real estate abutting on the other side. Upon the refusal of each of the three companies to pay the cost assessed for the track paving, the city filed a bill in equity against them seeking to recover the amount of the assessment, alleging the absence of all legal remedy.\n In the trial court a demurrer to the bill was overruled and a motion to dismiss was denied. The motion to dismiss was based upon the ground, among others, that neither of the defendant companies had received any benefit from the paving, and that the assessment and ordinance were invalid as contravening the due process and equal protection of law clauses of the Fourteenth \n\n[295 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Thereafter, answers were filed, alleging that the assessment vastly exceeded the entire value of the street railway property and lines located and operated within the city, and offering to surrender them to the city, together with the franchise under which they were constructed and operated, without the necessity of levy or sale; that the only reason why such offer was not accepted was because their entire value was less than the amount of the assessment; that the paving for which the assessment was made did not benefit the lines, property, or franchise, but, on the other hand, was a detriment.\n Appellants called a witness in support of the contention that their property was not benefited; but upon objection his testimony was excluded. They offered to prove by him that the pavement in question added nothing in value to the street railway property, but, on the contrary, was a detriment to its operation; that it made it more difficult and expensive to maintain the track with the pavement than without it; that the railway does not use the pavement in any way; and that it adds nothing in the way of additional travel upon the street cars. The trial court sustained an objection to the offer on the ground 'that the question of benefits by virtue of overruling the demurrer to the petition' became irrelevant and immaterial.\n At the conclusion of the trial, a decree was rendered against the Georgia Railway & Power Company and the Georgia Power Company for the amount of the paving assessment, with interest, which was affirmed by the state Supreme Court on appeal. 179 Ga. 471, 176 S.E. 494. The ruling of the trial court excluding the evidence offered upon the subject of benefits was sustained on the ground that such evidence was immaterial to the consideration of the question; and the contention of the railway corporations in respect of the violation of the Federal Constitution was rejected as being without foundation. \n\n[295 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n As we read its decision, the court below held that the state statute which authorized, and the ordinance which directed, an assessment for the cost of improvements require, as the basis for their operation, the existence of benefits; and the case was dealt with in that view. The contention of the appellants, as stated by that court, was that the street railway received no benefit from the paving and assessment, and, therefore, there was an arbitrary abuse of legislative authority. But the court held that from the act of the city in adopting the ordinance a presumption arose that the paving was beneficial to the street railway company and the assessment legal. 'The burden,' it said, 'of overcoming this presumption that the action of the city was not an arbitrary abuse of the legislative authority rests upon the plaintiffs in error.' The fourth headnote, which as we understand is prepared by the court, reads in part:2\n'When paving is done and assessment therefor regularly made in the manner provided in the city charter, a presumption arises that the paving and assessment were legal, and casts the burden of proof on one who attacks the assessment on the ground that the same was an arbitrary abuse of the legislative authority, because of no benefit, or that it is confiscatory.'\n\n In the body of the opinion, there is an excerpt from an earlier decision to the effect that the power to determine benefits to be received by the property of a street railway company from local improvements is a legislative one; that this power was vested in the commissioners of the city; and that the question of benefits having been determined by the commissioners, could not be inquired into by the courts unless it is made to appear that there has been an arbitrary abuse of the power.\n In this court, the city insists that, under Georgia law, 'the general rule that assessments against abutting own- \n\n[295 U.S. 165, 170]\n\u00a0\n ers for street improvements are sustainable only to the extent of special benefits to abutting property is not applicable to railway companies having tracks in the street improved.' And it seeks to sustain the assessment as an exercise of the police power and the alleged power of the state to alter or amend corporate charters. If the Georgia statutes had been thus construed by the state Supreme Court, a different question would be presented. The difficulty, however, is that the court, as we have said, construed the statute as contemplating the existence of benefits to the railway as a basis for the assessment, but required the railway companies to overcome a legislative presumption that such benefits existed by proof of an arbitrary abuse of the legislative authority 'because of no benefit.' By that construction we are bound, and in accordance with it must consider and determine the case. The construction becomes part of the statute as much as though it were found in appropriate words in its text. Morley v. Lake Shore Railway Co., \n146 \nU.S. 162, 166\n, 13 S.Ct. 54; Lindsley v. Natural Carbonic Gas Co., \n220 \nU.S. 61, 73\n, 31 S.Ct. 337, Ann. Cas. 1912C, 160; Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias v. Meyer, \n265 U.S. 30\n, 32, et seq., 44 S.Ct. 432.\n Under the statute and ordinance thus construed, if the burden imposed is without any compensating advantage (as appellants offered to show), the arbitrary abuse of the power exercised is plain, Myles Salt Co. v. Iberia Drainage Dist., \n239 \nU.S. 478, 485\n, 36 S.Ct. 204; the assessment amounts to confiscation, Bush v. Branson (C.C.A.) 248 F. 377, 380, 381. And this doctrine has been fully recognized in Georgia. Mayor, etc., of Savannah v. Knight, 172 Ga. 371, 375, 157 S.Ct. 309. Moreover, the offer of appellants to surrender all their railway property within the city, including the franchise, strongly tended to show that the assessment exceeded the entire value of the property with which the improvement was connected; in which case, as the court below itself has held, there can be no presumption of benefit. Holst v. City of LaGrange, 175 Ga. 402, 404, 165 S.E. 217. \n\n[295 U.S. 165, 171]\n\u00a0\n No question is raised as to the competency of the proof which was offered, and evidently there is none. The ruling was simply that it was immaterial. But the existence of benefits resulting from the improvement was material and was deemed so-else why require it, or why create an affirmative presumption in respect of it? Certainly, competent proof tending to overcome a rebuttable presumption of material fact cannot be immaterial; and the refusal of a court to receive or consider any proof whatever on the subject amounts to a denial of a hearing on that issue in contravention of the due process of law clause of the Constitution.

Ct. 441.\n The decree of the court below must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the foregoing opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE dissents.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n The question is one of state power. Since the Constitution does not deny to the local authorities power to require the paving of appellants' right of way, as a police measure regulating the use of the public streets, see Durham Public Service Co. v. Durham, \n261 \nU.S. 149\n, 43 S.Ct. 290; Fort Smith Light Co. v. Paving District, \n274 \nU.S. 387\n, 47 S.Ct. 595, it would seem that the mere fact that the state court justified the exercise of the power on different or even untenable grounds would not present to us any substantial federal question. \n\n[295 U.S. 165, 172]\n\u00a0\n In any case, the examination of the record makes it plain that the question considered in the opinion of this Court is unsubstantial. Appellant Georgia Power Company, which has taken over the rights and obligations of the other appellants, has a single franchise to supply electric power and to operate a street car line in Decatur and elsewhere, and is subject to a contract requiring it to maintain a 5-cent fare on its railway. See Georgia Ry. Co. v. Decatur, \n262 \nU.S. 432\n, 43 S.Ct. 613; Georgia Power Co. v. Decatur, \n281 \nU.S. 505\n, 50 S.Ct. 369. In an attempt to establish the arbitrary character of the assessment, appellant offered to prove that the railway could not operate its line in Decatur profitably under its contract for a 5-cent fare, and that it stood ready to surrender the franchise and discontinue operation. It further offered to show that no benefits were received by the power company or by any of its property as a result of the improvement. This general offer was explained and made specific by the proffered testimony of a witness, rejected as immaterial, that the pavement 'added not one cent to the value of the street railway property at all.' 'On the contrary,' in his opinion, 'it was a detriment to the street railway operations.' Traffic was not increased thereby. Indeed, the pavement would increase the labor and expense of keeping the track in good condition. While the 5-cent fare continued, the company would be unable to earn the cost of operation. Neither on the argument in this court nor, so far as appears, in any of the courts of Georgia, did the company suggest that it had additional or more persuasive evidence to offer.\n Our decisions make it abundantly plain that this evidence, if received, could have no tendency to overcome the presumptive correctness of the legislative finding of benefit. A property owner does not establish want of assessable benefits by showing that a particular public improvement does not aid or facilitate the particular use \n\n[295 U.S. 165, 173]\n\u00a0\n which he makes of the land. Miller & Lux v. Sacramento Drainage District, \n256 \nU.S. 129\n, 41 S.Ct. 404; Houck v. Little River Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 254, 264\n, 36 S.Ct. 58; Valley Farms Co. v. Westchester County, \n261 \nU.S. 155\n, 43 S.Ct. 261, or demonstrate that the assessment is confiscatory by showing that the use which he makes of the land is unprofitable, Durham Public Service Co. v. Durham, supra, \n261 U.S. 149\n, 153-155, 43 S.Ct. 290; Fort Smith Light Co. v. Paving District, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 387, 390\n, 47 S.Ct. 595. The earning capacity of the property would seem especially irrelevant where the profit has been limited by the taxpayer's contract, whether entered into improvidently or to gain some collateral advantage.\n The offer to surrender the unprofitable street railway, while retaining the profitable electric business, which in this case the Supreme Court of the state ruled were parts of an indivisible franchise, was rightly disregarded as without probative force. The power company could not, without the consent of the city, surrender the unprofitable part of its franchise and retain the profitable part. Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537, 543\n, 544 S., 50 S.Ct. 401. The city could not accept the offer without abrogating its contract. Neither the offer nor the refusal to accept it is evidence that the improvement was not of public benefit, which inured to the appellant as a property owner.\n The Supreme Court of Georgia did not question the appellant's right to rebut the presumption of validity by evidence reasonably indicative of arbitrary action. On the contrary, it expressly recognized that right in its opinion in this case (179 Ga. 471, 176 S.E. 494), as well as in an earlier opinion from which it quoted (Georgia Power Co. v. Decatur, 170 Ga. 699, 154 S.E. 268). The Court did no more than to hold that, treating the proffered testimony as accepted rather than rejected, it was insufficient to establish any inference of arbitrary oppression. Compare Branson v. Bush, \n251 \nU.S. 182, 190\n, 191 S., 40 S.Ct. 113; Mt. St. \n\n[295 U.S. 165, 174]\n\u00a0\n Mary's Cemetery Ass'n v. Mullins, \n248 \nU.S. 501\n, 39 S.Ct. 173; Embree v. Kansas City Road District, \n240 \nU.S. 242\n, 36 S.Ct. 317. For that reason, the testimony was correctly held to be 'immaterial,' and the error, if any, 'harmless.'\n A street must be properly paved, for the safety and convenience of travelers, as well as for the good of abutting owners.

(2d) 577, which affirmed a decree of the District Court overruling motions to dismiss the bills of complaint and to vacate the appointments of receivers. The questions involved are of public importance. See \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 32]\n\u00a0\n Pennsylvania v. Williams, \n294 \nU.S. 176\n, 55 S.Ct. 380; Gordon v. Ominsky, \n294 \nU.S. 186\n, 55 S.Ct. 391; No. 431, Penn General Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n294 \nU.S. 189\n, 55 S.Ct. 386, decided February 4, 1935\n\n\n On February 14, 1933, petitioner, the secretary of banking of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, took possession of the business and property of the Chester County Trust Company, a Pennsylvania banking corporation. By section 21 of the Banking Act of 1923, P.L. 809, as amended by Act May 5, 1927, P.L. 762,  7 (7 PS Pa.  21), he is authorized to take possession of and to liquidate the business and property of banking corporations of the commonwealth which are in 'an unsafe or unsound condition.' Pursuant to section 22 (7 PS PA.  22), he filed a 'certificate of possession' in his office, and on the following day filed a certified copy of the certificate with the prothonotary of the court of common pleas of Chester county. When this is done, he has, by section 29, as amended by Act May 5, 1927, P.L. 762,  11 (7 PS Pa.  29), the status of a receiver appointed by any court of equity of the commonwealth.\n Included in the business and property taken over by the secretary were two trust funds, or 'mortgage pools,' consisting of mortgages held by the trust company as fiduciary, against which it had issued participation certificates entitling the holder to an undivided share in the principal and interest of mortgages aggregating in excess of $2,900,000 in one pool and of $1,700,000 in the other. The Department of Banking Code of May 15, 1933, P.L. 565 (71 PS Pa.  733-1 to 733-1203), which became effective July 3, 1933, provides in section 701 (71 PS Pa.  733-701) that the secretary, when in possession of the business and property of a banking corporation, shall have the status of a general receiver and be responsible to the court in which his certificate of possession is filed, in this case the court of common pleas of Chester county, and that he shall exercise all the rights, powers, and duties of the corporation and succeed to its title and right to possession of all property and securities. Article 9 of the Code,  901-906 (71 PS Pa.  733-901 to 733- 906), provides for the disposition of the trust funds and mortgage pools of a trust company taken over by the secretary. After he has filed a notice of his intention to \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 33]\n\u00a0\n proceed with its liquidation, any certificate holder of a mortgage pool is authorized to apply to the court for the appointment of a substituted fiduciary of the pool. The secretary is required, 'as soon as it may be convenient,' to file in court an account of the securities in any mortgage pool conducted by the trust company, and he is directed to apply for the appointment of a substituted fiduciary of the mortgage pool if, within thirty days after the filing of the account, no certificate holder has made such an application. The Code thus provides for the secretary's possession and administration of the mortgage pools of a closed bank until such time as a substituted fiduciary is appointed.\n The bills of complaint in the present suits, naming the secretary as defendant, were respectively filed in the District Court on August 25 and August 28, 1933, approximately a month and three weeks after the mortgage pool provisions of the Banking Code had become effective. There is no material difference between the two bills of complaint. The plaintiff in No. 549, respondent here, a citizen of Connecticut, is alleged to be the owner of a participation certificate in the larger of the two pools, and the plaintiff in No. 550, respondent here, a citizen of New Jersey, is alleged to be the owner of a participation certificate in the smaller. Each bill, after stating the facts already detailed with respect to the secretary's possession of the property of the trust company, including the mortgage pools, alleged that the plaintiff had received no interest or income on his participation certificate after the secretary had taken possession; that the secretary had filed no account of the mortgage pools; and avers, on information and belief, 'that interest on many of the mortgages comprising said pool has not been paid ... and that little effort is made to secure the collection of the interest. ...' It is also alleged that: 'There is danger of sales by the respective authorities by reason of the non-payment of taxes on said properties and that little effort \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 34]\n\u00a0\n is being made to compel the payment of taxes. ...' The bills contain no charge of improper conduct, neglect, or mismanagement, or any allegation that the failure of the mortgagors to pay interest and taxes was due to want of diligence on the part of the secretary. They pray the appointment of a receiver to take charge of, conserve, and administer all the assets comprising the mortgage pools, but they do not ask the appointment of a new trustee or the removal of the secretary, or pray any directions or instructions to him, or any other relief except the usual injunction in aid of the receivership.\n On the day the bill of complaint in the second suit was filed, attorneys for the plaintiffs filed motions for the appointment of receivers. Two days later, on August 30, 1933, upon telephone notice to the petitioners of an hour and a half, the District Judge heard the motions and appointed receivers. The secretary failed to surrender the mortgage pools to the receivers, and the District Court issued, on September 2, 1933, a rule to show cause why the secretary should not be adjudged in contempt. On September 4th, the court of common pleas of Chester county, upon application by a mortgage pool certificate holder, issued an injunction restraining the secretary from relinquishing possession of the mortgage pool assets until further order of the court. On September 5th, the petitioner filed answers to the petitions to punish for contempt, and made motions, on affidavits and petitions, to dismiss the bills and to vacate the appointment of the receivers. Both motions assailed the bills as not stating facts to show that damage would be suffered by any party in interest if receivers were not appointed. The motions to dismiss also challenged the 'authority' of the District Court to appoint receivers. In the petitions to vacate the orders appointing receivers, it was alleged that since the closing of the trust company the secretary had continued to operate the mortgage pools and was ready to file with the court of common pleas his account of assets compris- \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 35]\n\u00a0\n ing the pools, that his management of them was in accordance with the Pennsylvania statutes, and that he had conducted the mortgage pools 'with the utmost regard for the interests of the participants.' No action appears to have been taken upon the motion to adjudge the petitioners in contempt, but in denying, upon the pleadings and motion papers, the motions to dismiss and to vacate the orders appointing receivers, the District Court ruled that it had jurisdiction of the cause as a federal court, and found that nothing had been done by the Banking Department 'to provide the means for an active, intelligent, responsible administration of its pools.'\n The Court of Appeals ruled that the District Court had jurisdiction, since the secretary, in taking possession of the mortgage pools, had acted by authority of the statute and not under any order or decree of the state court. The assets, it was said, were not in the actual or constructive possession of the state court, and consequently there was no occasion to apply the rule of comity under which a federal court will relinquish its jurisdiction in favor of a state court which has first acquired possession of the property which is the subject of suit. See Penn Casualty Co. v. Pennsylvania, supra. Upon the basis of the finding of the District Court that the Banking Department had failed to provide suitable means for the administration of the pools, it concluded that no abuse of discretion in the appointment of receivers had been shown.\n From what this Court has recently said in Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra, it is evident that the District Court correctly determined that it had jurisdiction of the cause. The requisite diversity of citizenship and the jurisdictional amount in controversy are shown by the record and are unchallenged. The relief prayed was that which a court of equity is competent to give. The bills of complaint were therefore sufficient to invoke the power and authority conferred on the District Court, by the Consti- \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 36]\n\u00a0\n tution and statutes of the United States, to entertain the suit and render an appropriate decree.\n Since the court had power to act, it is necessary to consider the various objections urged to the decree only in so far as they are addressed to the propriety of its action as a court of equity. These objections were not foreclosed by the determination that the court had jurisdiction. By the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20,  11, 1 Stat. 73, 78; U. S.C., tit. 28,  41(1), 28 USCA  41(1), the lower federal courts were given original jurisdiction 'of all suits ... in equity,' where the other jurisdictional requisites are satisfied. From the beginning, the phrase 'suits in equity' has been understood to refer to suits in which relief is sought according to the principles applied by the English Court of Chancery before 1789, as they have been developed in the federal courts. 1 Robinson v. Campbell, 3 Wheat. 212, 221-223; United States v. Howland, 4 Wheat. 108, 115; Waterman v. Canal-Louisiana Bank & Trust Co., \n215 \nU.S. 33, 43\n, 30 S.Ct. 10. When the petitioners challenged the sufficiency of the bills of complaint and the appropriateness of the appointment of receivers, it was not enough for the District Court to decide that as a federal court it had power to act. It should also have determined whether, in accordance with the accepted principles of equity, any state of facts was presented to it which called for the exercise of its extraordinary powers as a court of equity. See Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra.\n The sole relief prayed by the bills was the appointment of receivers and the command of the court that property, shown to be in the lawful possession of the pe- \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 37]\n\u00a0\n titioner acting as a temporary trustee or fiduciary, be surrendered to them. A receivership is only a means to reach some legitimate end sought through the exercise of the power of a court of equity. It is not an end in itself. Where a final decree involving the disposition of property is appropriately asked, the court in its discretion may appoint a receiver to preserve and protect the property pending its final disposition. For that purpose, the court may appoint a receiver of mortgaged property to protect and conserve it pending foreclosure. Wallace v. Loomis, \n97 U.S. 146\n, 162; Union Trust Co. v. Illinois Midland Ry. Co., \n117 \nU.S. 434, 455\n, 6 S.Ct. 809; Hitz v. Jenks, \n123 \nU.S. 297, 306\n, 8 S.Ct. 143; Freedman's Saving & Trust Co. v.

Co. v. Owsley, 176 F. 26 (C.C.A.2d); Ball v. Tompkins, 41 F. 486, 489 (C.C.); cf. Haines v. Carpenter, Fed. Cas.

Shepherd, 21 How. 112, 125; Ogilvie v. Knox Insurance Co., 22 How. 380, 392; Ingle v. Jones, 9 Wall. 486, 498.\n But there is no occasion for a court of equity to appoint a receiver of property of which it is asked to make no further disposition. The English Chancery Court from the beginning declined to exercise its jurisdiction for that purpose. Anonymous, 1 Atkyns 489, 578; Ex parte Whitfield, 2 Atkyns 315; Goodman v. Whitcomb, 1 Jacob & Walker 589, 592; Robinson v. Hadley, 11 Beavan 614; Roberts v. Eberhardt, Kay 148, 160, 161. 2 It is true that \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 38]\n\u00a0\n the receivership of an insolvent corporation, upon the application of a simple contract creditor with the consent of the corporation, has been recognized by the federal courts as an appropriate form of relief when the end sought is the liquidation of the assets and their equitable distribution among the creditors.

Fiershem, \n290 \nU.S. 504, 525\n, 54 S.Ct. 298, 90 A.L.R. 391. Whether this exercise of jurisdiction, to liquidate or conserve the assets of a corporation through the agency of a receivership, is to be supported as an extension of that exercised over decedents' estates, see Glenn on Liquidation,  154-161, or of remedies afforded to judgment creditors where legal remedies are inadequate, see Manhattan Rubber Mfg. Co. v. Lucey Mfg. Co., 5 F.(2d) 39, 42 (C.C.A.2d),3 it has never been extended to other classes of cases. Whenever the attempt thus to extend it, by using the receivership as an end instead of a means, has been brought to the attention of this Court, it has pointed out that a federal court of equity will not appoint a receiver where the appointment is not ancillary to some form of final relief which is appropriate for equity to give. Pusey & Jones Co. v. Hanssen, supra, page 497 of 261 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 454; Booth v. Clark, \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 39]\n\u00a0\n 17 How. 322, 331; see Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77\n, 43 S.Ct. 480; Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371\n, 14 S.Ct. 127.\n Respondents' bills of complaint not only failed to seek any remedy other than the appointment of receivers, but they failed to disclose any basis for equitable relief by the appointment of receivers or otherwise. Respondents are not shown to be creditors, much less judgment creditors. As beneficiaries of the fiduciary relationship of the trust company, and later of the secretary, to the mortgage pools, they failed to allege misconduct or neglect on which any equitable relief could be predicated. They did not show that there was any danger to the assets of the mortgage pools, or to their management, which would be avoided or removed by the appointment of receivers. Petitioner did not waive these defects of the bills, or consent to the appointment of receivers.\n We have recently had occasion to point out that a federal court, even in the exercise of an equity jurisdiction not otherwise inappropriate, should not appoint a receiver to displace the possession of a state officer lawfully administering property for the benefit of interested parties, except where it appears that the procedure afforded by state law is inadequate or that it will not be diligently and honestly followed. Gordon v. Ominsky, supra; Pennsylvania v. Williams, supra. Even when the bill of complaint states a cause of action in equity, the summary remedy by receivership, with the attendant burdensome expense, should be resorted to only on a plain showing of some threatened loss or injury to the property, which the receivership would avoid. Here no such showing was made. It is true the District Court found that nothing had been done by the Banking Department to provide the means for an active, intelligent, and responsible administration of the mortgage pools. The Court of Appeals, on the basis of this finding, thought there had been no \n\n[295 U.S. 30, 40]\n\u00a0\n abuse of discretion. But that finding is without support in the record.\n The court below erred in not directing dismissal of the bills of complaint as failing to state a cause of action in equity. The appointment of receivers, in the circumstances, was an abuse of discretion which should have been promptly set aside on the applications of the petitioner. The decrees below will be reversed, and the cause remanded, with directions to the District Court to dismiss the bills and discharge the receivers.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The Act of May 8, 1972, c. 36,  2, 1 Stat. 275, 276; U.S.C., tit. 28,  723, 28 USCA  723, further provided: 'That ... the forms and modes of proceeding in suits ... shall be ... in those of equity ... according to the principles, rules and usages which belong to courts of equity ... as contradistinguished from courts of common law. ...'

Edgar Sampson, of Springfield, Ill., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Wm. L. Patton, of Springfield, Ill., and Harold A. Smith, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n By an appropriate proceeding, the Treasurer of Illinois sought an adjudication determining the ownership of eight $1,000 negotiable coupon bonds issued by the state. They were stolen from their lawful owner, petitioner Graham, August 30, 1930, and on September 22, 1930, were purchased for a fair price in the ordinary course of its business by respondent's Chicago office from Connolly, listed dealer at St. Paul, Minn. No circumstance suggests conscious wrongdoing by the purchaser.\n Three days after the theft, petitioner caused the Foreman corporation to send printed notices of it, with adequate descriptions of the bonds, to dealers throughout the country.\n Accepting the record upon the view most favorable to the petitioner, we may assume, as the Circuit Court of Appeals did, that the notice was received by respondent's main office in Davenport, also at the Chicago branch, prior to the purchase; there was absence of ordinary care upon \n\n[296 U.S. 27, 29]\n\u00a0\n the part of the Chicago branch in not making more elaborate provision for dissemination of the knowledge given by the notice; that respondent paid full value; at the time of the purchase it had no actual knowledge of the theft; it made no investigation to ascertain whether the bonds were stolen, other than to inquire concerning the status of the party offering them; the information given by the notice had been forgotten.\n The District Court declared, as conclusion of law: 'The respondent, The White-Phillips Company, Inc., by reason of having actually received, prior to its purchase of the securities here involved, a notice that the same had been stolen as hereinabove set forth, did not, by the purchase of said bonds, become a holder thereof in due course, but that at such time the said respondent had knowledge of such facts that its action in taking such securities amounted to bad faith.'\n Decree went for petitioner here, which upon appeal, after a painstaking review of the authorities, was reversed. The cause was remanded for further proceedings.\n The Illinois Negotiable Instrument Act,  52, 56 (Smith-Hurd Ann. St. Ill. c. 98,  72, 76), provides:\n'Holder in Due Course Defined.  52. A holder in due course is a holder who has taken the instrument under the following conditions: ...\n\n'4. That at the time it was negotiated to him he had no notice of any infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating it.'\n\n'Notice of Infirmity-What Constitutes.  56. To constitute notice of an infirmity in the instrument or defect in the title of the person negotiating the same, the person to whom it is negotiated must have had actual knowledge of the infirmity or defect, or knowledge of such facts that his action in taking the instrument amounted to bad faith.'\n\n The court below rightly concluded that the narrow question is this: 'Did appellant have actual knowledge \n\n[296 U.S. 27, 30]\n\u00a0\n of the infirmity or defect, or knowledge of such facts that its action in taking the instrument amounted to bad faith?' It ruled that, as a purchaser of negotiable instruments in good faith, before maturity and for a valuable consideration, respondent should be protected against a charge of bad faith which has no fact support other than the receipt of a notice circulated generally among dealers which stated that certain bonds of a large issue had been stolen.\n Petitioner insists that under the authoritative construction placed upon the Illinois Negotiable Instrument Law by her Supreme Court, since respondent had received information of the defective title, there was bad faith as matter of law, and no title passed. He strongly relies upon Northwestern National Bank v. Madison & Kedzie State Bank, 242 Ill.App. 22, and the denial of certiorari therein.\n Under Burns Mortgage Co. v. Fried, \n292 \nU.S. 487\n, 54 S.Ct. 813, 92 A.L.R. 1193, a definite construction of the Negotiable Instrument Law by the State Supreme Court, binding upon the local tribunals, must be accepted by the federal courts. But we cannot think that the ruling and action in the Northwestern Bank Case amount to such a construction. That cause, decided by the Appellate Court, First District, October, 1926, involved title to stolen bonds held by one claiming as a bona fide purchaser, after receipt of notice of the theft. The court there said: 'The notice having been received by the proper agent of the bank to receive, open and acknowledge its mail in the line of his duties, we think the bank is estopped from claiming that it did not have actual knowledge of the defect in the title to the bonds it subsequently received.' The State Supreme Court denied an application for certiorari without more. The argument is that this amounted to approval of the construction placed upon the statute by the Appellate Court. The point is not well taken. \n\n[296 U.S. 27, 31]\n\u00a0\n National Bank v. Uptown State Bank (1934) 273 Ill.App. 401, construed the statute differently, and made no reference to the earlier case. We cannot know upon what ground certiorari was denied. The Illinois Supreme Court has declared that, 'Whether one has notice of certain fact is question of fact and not of law,' Paine v. Sheridan Trust & Savings Bank, 342 Ill. 342, 348, 174 N.E. 368; also that denial of certiorari does not import approval of the reasons assigned by the lower court. People ex rel. v. Grant, 283 Ill. 391, 397, 119 N.E. 344.\n The Appellate Courts in Illinois are inferior tribunals and a statute provided that their opinions 'shall not be of binding authority in any cause or proceeding, other than in that in which they may be filed.' Illinois Constitution 1870, art. 6,  11; Smith-Hurd Ann. St. Ill. c. 37,  41, Cahill's Illinois Rev. Stats. 1933, c. 37, par. 49.\n No authoritative construction of the Negotiable Instrument Law of Illinois supports petitioner's position. And the court below rightly undertook to determine for itself the meaning and effect of the pertinent sections.\n As with other enactments, the Negotiable Instrument Law must be interpreted in view of the intended end-here, the free circulation of negotiable paper-and the meaning attributed by the courts to the language employed.\n In a contest over title to stolen negotiable bonds, the Supreme Court of Michigan recently considered the Uniform Negotiable Instrument Law of that state. Merchants' National Bank v. Detroit Trust Co. (1932) 258 Mich. 526-536, 537, 242 N.W. 739, 743, 85 A.L.R. 350. It held that one may purchase stolen negotiable bonds and acquire valid title as a holder in due course, although before the purchase, notice of the theft had come to him; but he may not willfully close his eyes to the notice, or resort to trick or artifice to avoid knowledge of its contents, or purposely forget \n\n[296 U.S. 27, 32]\n\u00a0\n it. He must act in good faith. Concerning Northwestern National Bank v. Madison & Kedzie State Bank, supra, it said: 'As far as we have been able to determine, this case stands alone. It estops the purchaser from showing good faith at the time the bonds are acquired. It makes notice of theft conclusive evidence of mala fides. It overlooks the well-established rule that, though one has received actual notice, if by forgetfulness or negligence he does not have it in mind when he acquires the bonds, he may still be a good-faith purchaser. It has been said that the test is one of simple honesty and good faith.' It approved Lord v. Wilkinson, 56 Barb. (N. Y.) 593, which rejected an instruction that, 'The defendants once having had notice, are bound by it, although the notice may have been forgotten,' and declared: 'If the rule is well founded, that notice once given is good forever-that knowledge acquired when notice is given, is conclusive evidence of knowledge possessed when the notes were bought-then this charge is correct. But if the bona fides of the defendants must be judged of from their acts, purposes and knowledge as they existed upon the day of the purchase, then the notice served is only prima facie or presumptive evidence of mala fides, and may be rebutted by proof that the notice was lost, or its existence and contents forgotten.'\n The doctrine approved in Michigan should be accepted by the federal courts, in the absence of an authoritative ruling in the state whose laws apply. It accords with what this court said in Goodman v. Simonds, 20 How. 343-365, 366, 367; Murray v. Lardner, 2 Wall. 110; Vermilye & Co. v. Adams Express Co., 21 Wall. 138-146; Shaw v. North Pennsylvania R. Co., \n101 U.S. 557\n-564; and King v. Doane, \n139 U.S. 166\n-173, 11 S.Ct. 465. Also with the view long enforced in England. Raphael v.

SULLIVAN(1935)\nNo. 499\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 458, 459]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. P. Plunkett and R. J. Hagman, both of St. Paul, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Stanley B. Houck, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent sued the railway company in the District Court for Minnesota to recover $3,990.20 awarded by the Interstate Commerce Commission as reparation. Alberta Coal Sales Co. v. Canadian Nat. Rys., 142 I.C.C. 543. That court gave him judgment; the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Sullivan, 72 F.(2d) 587. We are called on to decide whether the uncontroverted facts and those found by the commission are sufficient to warrant the conclusion that he sustained damage in consequence of violation of the Act (Interstate Commerce Act  1 et seq., 49 USCA  1 et seq.) by defendant.\n Plaintiff, a wholesale dealer, bought carloads of lignite at mines on the Canadian Pacific in Alberta, and sold the same to retail dealers and others in North Dakota at Great Northern stations in competition with other fuels. The shipments moved on combination rates, being the sum of proportionals made respectively by the Canadian Pacific and the Great Northern,1 applicable from mines to destinations, and on through bills of lading issued by the former, routing over its railroad to junction with the latter \n\n[294 U.S. 458, 460]\n\u00a0\n at the international boundary and thence over the railroad last mentioned to places of delivery. The combination rates necessarily reflect agreement, express or implied, between the connecting carriers to establish a through route for continuous carriage from origin on one to destination on the other. Each proportional necessarily was a part of the through rate and was capable of use only as such. St. Louis S.W. Ry. Co. v. United States, \n245 U.S. 136\n, 139 note 2, 38 S.Ct. 49, 50 note 4, 205 note 4. They show the basis of division of charges between connecting carriers and serve precisely as do agreed divisions of charges based on joint rates. A proportional differs from a local rate in that it covers only terminal service at place of receipt or at place of delivery but cannot, as does the local rate, cover both. Lewis, etc., Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., \n283 \nU.S. 654, 663\n, 51 S.Ct. 592.2There \n\n[294 U.S. 458, 461]\n\u00a0\n was no applicable joint rate. The Great Northern collected the charges and paid the Canadian Pacific amounts equal to the proportionals established by the latter.\n Plaintiff and another complained to the commission alleging the proportionals filed by the Great Northern and other American carriers to be unjust and unreasonable in violation of section 1 (49 USCA  1). They did not attack the combination or allege aught against the Canadian Pacific proportional. They prayed merely reasonable maximum American proportionals and reparation to the extent of the excess over such maxima. The commission found the American proportionals to be unjust and unreasonable so far as they exceed specified maxima which it made applicable in lieu of those assailed. It made no finding concerning the reasonableness of the Canadian proportionals or of the combination through rates. There being no claim or finding to the contrary, the charges collected on these shipments must be deemed to have been just and reasonable. Indeed, dissenting commissioners, without opposition on the part of the others, state that they are affirmatively shown to be reasonable.\n The Great Northern was by the Act required to file tariffs establishing reasonable proportionals to constitute \n\n[294 U.S. 458, 462]\n\u00a0\n and to be kept in force as factors in the combination through rates applicable to plaintiff's shipments. Its failure to specify just and reasonable charges was a violation of the Act. And, if injured thereby, plaintiff is entitled to recover the damages sustained in consequence of such failure. 49 U.S.C.  8 (49 USCA  8). Plaintiff invokes News Syndicate Co. v. N.Y.C.R.R., \n275 \nU.S. 179\n, 48 S.Ct. 39, and Lewis, etc., Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., supra. But neither is like this case. In each, shipments moved from an adjacent country into the United States on through rates made by joint action of the participating foreign and American carriers. The American carrier, having violated the Act by failure to file any tariff to cover its part of the transportation, collected freight charges found to be excessive and, as one of two or more joint tort-feasors, was held liable to the extent that the charges it exacted were in excess of what the commission ascertained to be just and reasonable. But here the charges collected were not excessive, and confessedly the same amounts lawfully might have been collected without injury or damage to plaintiff if only the connecting carriers had imposed the charges by means of 'joint' instead of the 'combination' through rates that they did establish.\n If defendant's proportional added to that established by the Canadian Pacific had produced an unjust rate, then to the extent that the total charge was excessive, plaintiff would have been subjected to a disadvantage in competing with others selling fuel in the same territory. The commission has power to determine rates to be unreasonable in violation of section 1 (49 USCA  1) without determining whether their application has resulted or will result in pecuniary loss or damage to the shipper. It may determine whether a proportional constituting a part of a combination rate violates section 1 without passing upon the validity of the rate as a whole. Atchison, T. & S.F. Ry. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 768, 776\n, 49 S.Ct. 494. But the commission may not order \n\n[294 U.S. 458, 463]\n\u00a0\n or permit payment of damages by way of reparation without finding that the amount of the charge was unjust and unreasonable. News Syndicate Co. v. N. Y.C.R.R., supra, page 187 of 275 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 39. And defendant, enforcing an unlawful charge to be divided between it and the Canadian Pacific, would be liable as a joint tort-feasor for the full amount of the excess. Louisville & N.R.R. Co. v. Sloss-Sheffield Co., \n269 \nU.S. 217, 231\n, 46 S.Ct. 73, et seq. News Syndicate Co. v. N.Y.C.R.R., supra. Lewis, etc., Co. v. Southern Pac. Co., supra.\n But the claim before us has no such foundation. Plaintiff seeks to recover the difference between the proportional established by defendant and that found by the commission to be just and reasonable notwithstanding its fuel was hauled from mines to the competitive field for a just and reasonable charge. That position cannot be maintained for as to the shipments here involved the Great Northern proportional cannot be applied save as it is a part of the through rate. There was a single charge which, though based on the combination rate, was precisely the same in amount as if the rate had been jointly made. As shown by our decision in Louisville & N.R.R. Co. v. Sloss-Sheffield Co., supra, page 234, of 269 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 73, the division among connecting carriers of charges based on joint rates- those involved in that case were constructed out of existing proportionals- is no concern of the shipper. The proportionals here involved are but parts of a through rate and cannot be distinguished from divisions of a joint rate. Morrell & Co. v. N.Y.C.R.R. Co., 104 I.C.C. 104, 128. The shipper's only interest is that the charge shall be reasonable as a whole. It follows that retention by the defendant of an undue proportion of just and reasonable charges did not damage plaintiff. Louisville & N.R.R. Co. v. Sloss-Sheffield Co., supra, page 234 of 269 U.S., 46 S.Ct. 73. Parsons v.

But the through bill of lading that is given by the rail carriers upon movements of traffic through Mobile ... to Europe is not at all of this character. It is a receipt on the part of the railroad for the carriage to the port and a receipt by the ship line for the carriage from the port to Europe. This receipt for carriage beyond the port is not given in the name of the rail carrier, but in the name of the steamship company ... is in reality a separate bill of lading, which is attached to the railroad bill of lading. ... This practice of making a divisible bill of lading showing the ultimate destination of the shipment by water, both of the rates being sometimes stated separately-the rate to the port and the rate from the port, or only one rate being stated, that to the port-is a railroad practice instituted for the convenience of all concerned. The ship line is operated in physical connection with the rail line, but the rail line receives none of the ship line's earnings, makes no division of a through rate with the ship, suffers none of its loss, and takes none of its hazards. The furnishing of a through bill of lading in connection with ship-side delivery at the port of Mobile is not a contract by the rail carrier for shipment beyond at a specified rate, or at any rate, nor does it carry with it any of the elements attaching to the through bill issued by a rail carrier with a rail connection. To call it a through bill of lading is therefore in fact a misnomer.'\n Through bills of lading issued under the Interstate Commerce Act,  25(4, 5), 49 USCA  25(4, 5), do not constitute 'an arrangement for continuous carriage or shipment' within the meaning of the Act.

HELVERING(1935)\nNo. 127\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 465, 466]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Hugh Satterlee, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[293 U.S. 465, 467]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner in 1928 was the owner of all the stock of United Mortgage Corporation. That corporation held among its assets 1,000 shares of the Monitor Securities Corporation. For the sole purpose of procuring a transfer of these shares to herself in order to sell them for her individual profit, and, at the same time, diminish the amount of income tax which would result from a direct transfer by way of dividend, she sought to bring about a 'reorganization' under section 112(g) of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 816, 818, 26 USCA  2112(g), set forth later in this opinion. To that end, she caused the Averill Corporation to be organized under the laws of Delaware on September 18, 1928. Three days later, the United Mortgage Corporation transferred to the Averill Corporation the 1,000 shares of Monitor stock, for which all the shares of the Averill Corporation were issued to the petitioner. On September 24, the Averill Corporation was dissolved, and liquidated by distributing all its assets, namely, the Monitor shares, to the petitioner. No other business was ever transacted, or intended to be transacted, by that company. Petitioner immediately sold the Monitor shares for $133,333. 33. She returned for taxation, as capital net gain, the sum of $76,007.88, based upon an apportioned cost of $57,325.45. Further details are unnecessary. It is not disputed that if the interposition of the so-called reorganization was ineffective, petitioner became liable for a much larger tax as a result of the transaction.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue, being of opinion that the reorganization attempted was without substance and must be disregarded, held that petitioner was liable for a tax as though the United corporation had paid her a dividend consisting of the amount realized from the sale of the Monitor shares. In a proceeding before the \n\n[293 U.S. 465, 468]\n\u00a0\n Board of Tax Appeals, that body rejected the commissioner's view and upheld that of petitioner. 27 B.T.A. 223. Upon a review of the latter decision, the Circuit Court of Appeals sustained the commissioner and reversed the board, holding that there had been no 'reorganization' within the meaning of the statute. 69 F.(2d) 809. Petitioner applied to this court for a writ of certiorari, which the government, considering the question one of importance, did not oppose. We granted the writ. \n293 \nU.S. 538\n, 55 S.Ct. 82, 79 L.Ed. --.\n Section 112 of the Revenue Act of 1928 (26 USCA  2112) deals with the subject of gain or loss resulting from the sale or exchange of property. Such gain or loss is to be recognized in computing the tax, except as provided in that section. The provisions of the section, so far as they are pertinent to the question here presented, follow:\n'Sec. 112. ... (g) Distribution of Stock on Reorganization. If there is distributed, in pursuance of a plan of reorganization, to a shareholder in a corporation a party to the reorganization, stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization, without the surrender by such shareholder of stock or securities in such a corporation, no gain to the distributee from the receipt of such stock of securities shall be recognized. ...\n\n'(i) Definition of Reorganization. As used in this section ...\n\n'(1) The term 'reorganization' means ... (B) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or both are in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred. ... ' 26 USCA  2112(g), (i) (1).\n\n It is earnestly contended on behalf of the taxpayer that since every element required by the foregoing subdivision (B) is to be found in what was done, a statutory reorganization was effected; and that the motive of the taxpayer thereby to escape payment of a tax will not alter the result \n\n[293 U.S. 465, 469]\n\u00a0\n or make unlawful what the statute allows. It is quite true that if a reorganization in reality was effected within the meaning of subdivision ( B), the ulterior purpose mentioned will be disregarded. The legal right of a taxpayer to decrease the amount of what otherwise would be his taxes, or altogether avoid them, by means which the law permits, cannot be doubted. United States v. Isham, 17 Wall. 496, 506; Superior Oil Co. v. Mississippi, \n280 \nU.S. 390, 395\n, 396 S., 50 S.Ct. 169; Jones v. Helvering, 63 App.D.C. 204, 71 F.(2d) 214, 217. But the question for determination is whether what was done, apart from the tax motive, was the thing which the statute intended. The reasoning of the court below in justification of a negative answer leaves little to be said.\n When subdivision (B) speaks of a transfer of assets by one corporation to another, it means a transfer made 'in pursuance of a plan of reorganization' (section 112(g) of corporate business; and not a transfer of assets by one corporation to another in pursuance of a plan having no relation to the business of either, as plainly is the case here. Putting aside, then, the question of motive in respect of taxation altogether, and fixing the character of the proceeding by what actually occurred, what do we find? Simply an operation having no business or corporate purpose-a mere device which put on the form of a corporate reorganization as a disguise for concealing its real character, and the sole object and accomplishment of which was the consummation of a preconceived plan, not to reorganize a business or any part of a business, but to transfer a parcel of corporate shares to the petitioner. No doubt, a new and valid corporation was created. But that corporation was nothing more than a contrivance to the end last described. It was brought into existence for no other purpose; it performed, as it was intended from the beginning it should perform, no other function. \n\n[293 U.S. 465, 470]\n\u00a0\n When that limited function had been exercised, it immediately was put to death.\n In these circumstances, the facts speak for themselves and are susceptible of but one interpretation. The whole undertaking, though conducted according to the terms of subdivision (B), was in fact an elaborate and devious form of conveyance masquerading as a corporate reorganization, and nothing else. The rule which excludes from consideration the motive of tax avoidance is not pertinent to the situation, because the transaction upon its face lies outside the plain intent of the statute. To hold otherwise would be to exalt artifice above reality and to deprive the statutory provision in question of all serious purpose.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGROVEY v. TOWNSEND(1935)\nNo. 563\nArgued: March 11, 1935Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 45, 46]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. Alston Atkins, of Houston, Tex., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner, by complaint filed in the justice court of Harris county, Tex., alleged that although he is a citizen of the United States and of the state and county, and a member of and believer in the tenets of the Democratic Party, the respondent, the county clerk, a state officer, having as such only public functions to perform, refused him a ballot for a Democratic Party primary election, because he is of the negro race. He demanded ten dollars damages. The pleading quotes articles of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas which require the nomination of candidates at primary elections by any organized political party whose nominees received 100,000 votes or more at the preceding general election, and recites that agreeably to these enactments a Democratic primary election was held on July 28, 1934, at which petitioner had the right to vote. Referring to statutes \n\n[295 U.S. 45, 47]\n\u00a0\n which regulate absentee voting at primary elections, the complaint states the petitioner expected to be absent from the county on the date of the primary election, and demanded of the respondent an absentee ballot, which was refused him in virtue of a resolution of the state Democratic Convention of Texas, adopted May 24, 1932, which is:\n'Be it resolved, that all white citizens of the State of Texas who are qualified to vote under the Constitution and laws of the state shall be eligible to membership in the Democratic party and as such entitled to participate in its deliberations.'\n\n The complaint charges that the respondent acted without legal excuse and his wrongful and unlawful acts constituted a violation of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments of the Federal Constitution.\n A demurrer, assigning as reasons that the complaint was insufficient in law and stated no cause of action, was sustained; and a motion for a new trial, reasserting violation of the federal rights mentioned in the complaint, was overruled. We granted certiorari,1 because of the importance of the federal question presented, which has not been determined by this court. \n2\n Our jurisdiction is clear, as the justice court is the highest state court in which a decision may be had,3 and the validity of the Constitution and statutes of the state was drawn in question on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution of the United States. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 45, 48]\n\u00a0\n The charge is that respondent, a state officer, in refusing to furnish petitioner a ballot, obeyed the law of Texas, and the consequent denial of petitioner's right to vote in the primary election because of his race and color was state action forbidden by the Federal Constitution; and it is claimed that former decisions require us so to hold. The cited cases are, however, not in point. In Nixon v. Herndon, \n273 \nU.S. 536\n, 47 S. Ct. 446, a statute which enacted that 'in no event shall a negro be eligible to participate in a Democratic party primary election held in the State of Texas,' was pronounced offensive to the Fourteenth Amendment. In Nixon v. Condon, \n286 \nU.S. 73\n, 52 S.Ct. 484, 485, 88 A.L.R. 458, a statute was drawn in question which provided that 'every political party in this State through its State Executive Committee shall have the power to prescribe the qualifications of its own members and shall in its own way determine who shall be qualified to vote or otherwise participate in such political party.' We held this was a delegation of state power to the state executive committee and made its determination conclusive irrespective of any expression of the party's will by its convention, and therefore the committee's action barring negroes from the party primaries was state action prohibited by the Fourteenth Amendment. Here the qualifications of citizens to participate in party counsels and to vote at party primaries have been declared by the representatives of the party in convention assembled, and this action upon its face is not state action. The question whether under the Constitution and laws of Texas such a declaration as to party membership amounts to state action was expressly reserved in Nixon v. Condon, supra, pages 84, 85, of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 484. Petitioner insists that for various reasons the resolution of the state convention limiting membership in the Democratic Party in Texas to white voters does not relieve the exclusion of negroes from participation in Democratic primary elections of its true nature as the act of the state. \n\n[295 U.S. 45, 49]\n\u00a0\n First. An argument pressed upon us in Nixon v. Condon, supra, which we found it unnecessary to consider, is again presented. It is that the primary election was held under statutory compulsion; is wholly statutory in origin and incidents; those charged with its management have been deprived by statute and judicial decision of all power to establish qualifications for participation therein inconsistent with those laid down by the laws of the state, save only that the managers of such elections have been given the power to deny negroes the vote. It is further urged that while the election is designated that of the Democratic Party, the statutes not only require this method of selecting party nominees, but define the powers and duties of the party's representatives and of those who are to conduct the election so completely, and make them so thoroughly officers of the state, that any action taken by them in connection with the qualifications of members of the party is in fact state action and not party action.\n In support of this view petitioner refers to title 50 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas of 1925,5 which by article 3101 requires that any party whose members cast more than 100,000 ballots at the previous election shall nominate candidates through primaries, and fixes the date at which they are to be held; by article 2939 requires primary election officials to be qualified voters; by article 2955 declares the same qualifications for voting in such an election as in the general elections; by article 2956, as amended (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 2956), permits absentee voting as in a general election; by article 2978 requires that only an official ballot shall be used, as in a general election; by articles 2980, 2981 specifies the form of ballot and how it shall be marked, as other sections do for general elections; by article 2984 fixes the number of ballots to be provided, as another article does \n\n[295 U.S. 45, 50]\n\u00a0\n for general elections; by articles 2986, 2987, and 2990 permits the use of voting booths, guard rails, and ballot boxes which by other statutes are provided for general elections; by articles 2998 and 3104 requires the officials of primary elections to take the same oath as officials at the general elections; by article 3002 defines the powers of judges at primary elections; by articles 3003-3025 provides elaborately for the purity of the ballot box; by article 3028 commands that the sealed ballot boxes be delivered to the county clerk after the election, as is provided by another article for the general election; and by article 3041 confers jurisdiction of election contests upon district courts, as is done by another article with respect to general elections. A perusal of these provisions so it is said will convince that the state has prescribed and regulated party primaries as fully as general elections, and has made those who manage the primaries state officers subject to state direction and control.\n While it is true that Texas has by its laws elaborately provided for the expression of party preference as to nominees, has required that preference to be expressed in a certain form of voting, and has attempted in minute detail to protect the suffrage of the members of the organization against fraud, it is equally true that the primary is a party primary; the expenses of it are not borne by the state, but by members of the party seeking nomination (article 3108, as amended by Acts 1931, c. 105,  2 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 3108)) and article 3116, as amended by Acts 1927, c. 54,  1 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 3116); the ballots are furnished not by the state, but by the agencies of the party (Rev. St. arts. 3109, 3119); the votes are counted and the returns made by instrumentalities created by the party (articles 3123-3125, 3127, as amended (Vernon's Ann Civ. St. arts. 3123-3125, 3127)); and the state recognizes the state convention as the organ of the party for the declaration of principles and the formulation of policies (articles 3136, 3139, as amended (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. arts. 3136, 3139)).\n We are told that in Love v. Wilcox, 119 Tex. 256, 28 S.W.(2d) 515, 522, the Supreme Court of Texas held the state was within its province in prohibiting a party from \n\n[295 U.S. 45, 51]\n\u00a0\n establishing past party affiliations or membership in nonpolitical organizations as qualifications or tests for participation in primary elections, and in consequence issued its writ of mandamus against the members of the state executive committee of the Democratic Party on the ground that they were public functionaries fulfilling duties imposed on them by law. But in that case it was said, page 272 of 119 Tex., 28 S.W.( 2d) 515, 522:\n'We are not called upon to determine whether a political party has power, beyond statutory control, to prescribe what persons shall participate as voters or candidates in its conventions or primaries. We have no such state of facts before us.'\n\n After referring to article 3107, as amended by Acts 1927, 1st Called Sess. c. 67,  1 (Vernon's Ann. Civ. St. art. 3107), which limits the power of the state executive committee of a party to determine who shall be qualified to vote at primary elections, the court said:\n'The committee's discretionary power is further restricted by the statute directing that a single, uniform pledge be required of the primary participants. The effect of the statutes is to decline to give recognition to the lodgment of power in a State Executive Committee, to be exercised at its discretion.'\n\n Although it did not pass upon the constitutionality of section 3107, as we did in Nixon v. Condon, supra, the Court thus recognized the fact upon which our decision turned, that the effort was to vest in the state executive committee the power to bind the party by its decision as to who might be admitted to membership.\n In Bell v. Hill, 74 S.W.(2d) 113, the same court, in a mandamus proceeding instituted after the adoption by the state convention of the resolution of May 24, 1932, restricting eligibility for membership in the Democratic Party to white persons, held the resolution valid and effective. After a full consideration of the nature of political parties in the United States, the court concluded that \n\n[295 U.S. 45, 52]\n\u00a0\n such parties in the state of Texas arise from the exercise of the free will and liberty of the citizens composing them; that they are voluntary associations for political action, and are not the creatures of the state; and further decided that sections 2 and 27 of article 1 of the state Constitution guaranteed to citizens the liberty of forming political associations, and the only limitation upon this right to be found in that instrument is the clause which requires the maintenance of a republican form of government. The statutes regulating the nomination of candidates by primaries were related by the court to the police power, but were held not to extend to the denial of the right of citizens to form a political party and to determine who might associate with them as members thereof. The court declared that a proper view of the election laws of Texas, and their history, required the conclusion that the Democratic Party in that state is a voluntary political association and, by its representatives assembled in convention, has the power to determine who shall be eligible for membership and, as such, eligible to participate in the party's primaries.\n We cannot, as petitioner urges, give weight to earlier expressions of the state courts said to be inconsistent with this declaration of the law. The Supreme Court of the state has decided, in a case definitely involving the point, that the Legislature of Texas has not essayed to interfere, and indeed may not interfere, with the constitutional liberty of citizens to organize a party and to determine the qualifications of its members. If in the past the Legislature has attempted to infringe that right and such infringement has not been gainsaid by the courts, the fact constitutes no reason for our disregarding the considered decision of the state's highest court. The legislative assembly of the state, so far as we are advised, has never attempted to prescribe or to limit the membership of a \n\n[295 U.S. 45, 53]\n\u00a0\n political party, and it is now settled that it has no power so to do. The state, as its highest tribunal holds, though it has guaranteed the liberty to organize political parties, may legislate for their governance when formed, and for the method whereby they may nominate candidates, but must do so with full recognition of the right of the party to exist, to define its membership, and to adopt such policies as to it shall seem wise. In the light of the principles so announced, we are unable to characterize the managers of the primary election as state officers in such sense that any action taken by them in obedience to the mandate of the state convention respecting eligibility to participate in the organization's deliberations. is state action.\n Second. We are told that sections 2 and 27 of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of Texas as construed in Bell v. Hill, supra, violate the Federal Constitution, for the reason that so construed they fail to forbid a classification based upon race and color, whereas in Love v. Wilcox, supra, they were not held to forbid classifications based upon party affiliations and membership or nonmembership in organizations other than political parties, which classifications were by article 3107 of Revised Civil Statutes, 1925, as amended, prohibited. But, as above said, in Love v. Wilcox the court did not construe or apply any constitutional provision and expressly reserved the question as to the power of a party in convention assembled to specify the qualications for membership therein.\n Third. An alternative contention of petitioner is that the state Democratic Convention which adopted the resolution here involved was a mere creature of the state and could not lawfully do what the Federal Constitution prohibits to its creator. The argument is based upon the fact that article 3167 of the Revised Civil Statutes of Texas, 1925, requires a political party desiring to elect \n\n[295 U.S. 45, 54]\n\u00a0\n delegates to a national convention to hold a state convention on the fourth Tuesday of May, 1928, and every four years thereafter; and provides for the election of delegates to that convention at primary conventions, the procedure of which is regulated by law. In Bell v. Hill, supra, the Supreme Court of Texas held that article 3167 does not prohibit declarations of policy by a state Democratic Convention called for the purpose of electing delegates to a national convention. While it may be, as petitioner contends, that we are not bound by the state court's decision on the point, it is entitled to the highest respect, and petitioner points to nothing which in any wise impugns its accuracy. If, as seems to be conceded, the Democratic Party in Texas held conventions many years before the adoption of article 3167, nothing is shown to indicate that the regulation of the method of choosing delegates or fixing the times of their meetings was intended to take away the plenary power of conventions in respect of matters as to which they would normally announce the party's will. Compare Nixon v. Condon, supra, page 84 of 286 U.S., 52 S.Ct. 484. We are not prepared to hold that in Texas the state convention of a party has become a mere instrumentality or agency for expressing the voice or will of the state.\n Fourth. The complaint states that candidates for the offices of Senator and Representative in Congress were to be nominated at the primary election of July 9, 1934, and that in Texas nomination by the Democratic Party is equivalent to election. These facts (the truth of which the demurrer assumes) the petitioner insists, without more, make out a forbidden discrimination. A similar situation may exist in other states where one or another party includes a great majority of the qualified electors. The argument is that as a negro may not be denied a \n\n[295 U.S. 45, 55]\n\u00a0\n ballot at a general election on account of his race or color, if exclusion from the primary renders his vote at the general election insignificant and useless, the result is to deny him the suffrage altogether. So to say is to confuse the privilege of membership in a party with the right to vote for one who is to hold a public office. With the former the state need have no concern, with the latter it is bound to concern itself, for the general election is a function of the state government and discrimination by the state as respects participation by negroes on account of their race or color is prohibited by the Federal Constitution.\n Fifth. The complaint charges that the Democratic Party has never declared a purpose to exclude negroes. The premise upon which this conclusion rests is that the party is not a state body but a national organization, whose representative is the national Democratic Convention. No such convention, so it is said, has resolved to exclude negroes from membership. We have no occasion to determine the correctness of the position, since even if true it does not tend to prove that the petitioner was discriminated against or denied any right to vote by the state of Texas. Indeed the contention contradicts any such conclusion, for it assumes merely that a state convention, the representative and agent of a state association, has usurped the rightful authority of a national convention which represents a larger and superior country-wide association.\n We find no ground for holding that the respondent has in obedience to the mandate of the law of Texas discriminated against the petitioner or denied him any right guaranteed by the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] \n294 \nU.S. 699\n, 55 S.Ct. 351, 79 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rule 38, subd. 5(a), 28 USCA  354. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Downham v.

LEIMERT(1935)\nNo. 600\nArgued: April 5, 1935Decided: April 29, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 116, 117]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Russell F. Locke, of Chicago, Ill., George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., and Walter T. Fisher, of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner.\n Mr. Daniel M. Healy, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 116, 119]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Respondent, receiver of Central Bank, brought suit against petitioner, receiver of Ashland Bank, in the District Court, Northern District of Illinois, to recover upon five checks drawn upon the former and indorsed by the latter bank. Jury having been waived, the trial court made findings of fact with conclusions of law and entered judgment in favor of respondent here for the sum demanded. There is no bill of exceptions; the findings control.\n From these it appears:\n All the banks spoken of herein were located in Chicago. James G. Hodgkinson was vice president and director of Ashland Bank; also vice president of Hodgkinson & Durfee, Inc., which had a deposit account with Central Bank. Against this account he drew the corporation's five checks, and delivered them to Ashland Bank. It indorsed and deposited four of them with Federal Reserve Bank for collection, Saturday, April 23d. The fifth check duly indorsed went for collection to the First National Bank. \n\n[295 U.S. 116, 120]\n\u00a0\n The Federal Reserve and First National Banks were regular members of the Chicago Clearing House Association; Central Bank an affiliate; Ashland Bank was neither member nor affiliate. A rule of the Chicago Clearing House provided: 'In order that the member banks presenting such items may have an opportunity to give special instructions as to the protest of unpaid items, that notice of nonpayment of any such items drawn on banks ... which are ... affiliated with members of the association ... and which have their places of business located ... on 12th Street or south thereof, be given by telephone before two-thirty o'clock (2:30) p.m. of the same day to the member banks presenting such items through the Clearing House ....'\n Early Monday morning, April 25th, the Federal Reserve Bank turned in the four deposited checks to the Chicago Clearing House. According to the rules and practices, Central Bank settled the indicated adverse balance at the clearing house and before 11:30 a.m. received the checks. Several hours later it learned that Hodgkinson & Durfee lacked funds to meet them.\n On the same day First National Bank, which carried accounts with both Central and Ashland Banks, charged the check received from the latter against the former's account, and sent it by messenger to the drawee's place of business, where it was received and retained.\n When the Central Bank ascertained the status of Hodgkinson & Durfee's account, it notified Hodgkinson. At 9:30 a.m. the following morning, April 26th, the five checks were returned to Ashland Bank for reimbursement. This was refused. No notice was given by Central Bank to either Federal Reserve or First National Bank. They 'got the money from the Central Bank and in turn gave the money to the Ashland Bank.'\n The trial court concluded the checks were not unconditionally paid; also that the notice to Ashland Bank on \n\n[295 U.S. 116, 121]\n\u00a0\n April 25th under section 102, Negotiable Instruments Law, section 124, c. 98, Smith-Hurd Ann. St. Ill., paragraph 124, Cahill's Rev. St. Ill. 1933, sufficed to fix responsibility. Accordingly judgment went against petitioner.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals, 72 F.(2d) 480, 481, affirmed, and among other things, said: 'It is conceded by both parties that, if payment were actually made by the bank on which the checks were drawn (in this case the Central Bank) or if, instead of actual payment, an unconditional credit had been given, then, though it were later discovered that there were insufficient funds on deposit in the account of the maker to cover the checks, the payment would be absolute and irrevocable. ... The method of transacting business followed by the clearing house association contemplates that the members will immediately examine the various items which go to make up the balance and only the subsequent lapse of time without electing to dishonor the check causes the settlement to become final. In the case of members of the clearing house, the time within which notice must be given is fixed by agreement. In the case of banks not members of the clearing house, the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments law must govern as to what length of time may elapse before the tentative payment becomes final and irrevocable. ... The Ashland bank was not a member of, or affiliated with, the clearing house association, and is vested with no rights based upon its rules. ... The Central Bank having elected to recover from the Ashland Bank directly, all that was necessary to bring the giving of notice of dishonor within the provisions of the Negotiable Instruments Law was that notice be given 'before the close of business hours on the day following.\"\n And it cited Smith-Hurd Rev. St. Ill. 1933, c. 98,  124 (Smith-Hurd Ann. St. Ill., c. 98,  124), Cahill's Rev. St. Ill. 1933, c. 98, par. 124 ( section 102, Negotiable Instruments Law) which provides:\n'Where the person giving and the person to receive notice reside in same place, notice must be given within the following times: \n\n[295 U.S. 116, 122]\n\u00a0\n\n'1. If given at the place of business of the person to receive notice, it must be given before the close of business hours on the day following.'\n\n\n We think the conduct of Central Bank constituted final irrevocable payment of the five checks, as if cash had passed over the counter. And if this be correct, counsel do not maintain that the judgment below can be sustained.\n Settlement at the clearing house, in respect of the four checks turned in by the Federal Reserve Bank, was at first provisional, subject to be withdrawn or corrected upon notice given before 2:30 o'clock. After this provisional settlement the drawee accepted delivery of the checks and gave no notice of dishonor prior to 2:30 o'clock. The time having expired, payment became absolute. The fifth check, presented by the First National Bank, after being charged to the drawee's account, was not dishonored, but upon presentation was accepted without reservation. Payment then became complete and irrevocable. Central Bank did not repudiate or question the charge against its account at the First National Bank. On the contrary this was ratified. See First Nat. Bank v. Burkhardt, \n100 U.S. 686\n, 689; American Nat. Bank v. Miller, \n229 \nU.S. 517, 520\n, 33 S.Ct. 883. Both collecting banks transmitted the proceeds received to Ashland Bank.\n Apparently the argument in support of the judgment below is this:\n The checks in the hands of the collecting banks were payable to bearer, and held in due course. The drawee bank did not in fact pay the checks, but after becoming holder, dishonored them. Thereafter, within the time prescribed by section 102, Negotiable Instruments Law, it gave notice to the first indorser and thus fixed the obligation to pay. Admitted payment to the collecting bank is excused upon the theory that this resulted from rules of the clearing house, not applicable to Ashland Bank, a nonmember. \n\n[295 U.S. 116, 123]\n\u00a0\n Since payment was actually made to the collecting bank, and never repudiated, it seems impossible to conclude that the secondary liability assumed by indorsers remained in force. As the checks were not dishonored when presented, the indorser could only have been advised that when paid the drawee lacked funds to meet them.\n The Ashland Bank is not seeking to enforce rules of the clearing house. It asks that proper effect be given to actual payment made through compliance with those rules. The duty of the drawee bank was either to pay or refuse to pay when the holder presented and demanded final payment of the checks. It paid them. The tentative payments became final-as much so as if money had passed. No objection is made to the clearing house rules and we find none.\n Section 102 of the Negotiable Instruments Law refers to notice of dishonor, not to the time within which a dishonored check may be returned, nor to advice concerning an overdraft. It does not relate to tentative payments and is without application in circumstances like those here disclosed. At least that seems clear to us and there is no holding to the contrary by the courts of Illinois.\n The record reveals no attempt to recover because of fraud, mutual mistake, or other similar circumstance.\n The questioned judgment must be reversed. One will be entered here for the petitioner.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHARTLEY v.

United States, 31 F.(2d) 924, 930, with that of the Court of Claims in McKinney v. United States, 62 Ct.Cl. 180. See Elmhirst v. United States, 38 F.(2d) 915; Myers v. United States, 51 F.(2d) 145; compare McCann v. United States, 48 F.(2d) 446, each decided by the Court of Claims.\n Petitioner's tax returns1 were for the calendar years 1924 and 1925. Sections 202(a, b) and 214(a)(8), (10) \n\n[295 U.S. 216, 218]\n\u00a0\n of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 229, 239-241, and section 204(a), (b), (c) of the 1924 and 1926 Acts (26 USCA  935 and note) provide that the basis for computing gain or loss on the sale of property, and depreciation and depletion, shall be its cost, or its value on March 1, 1913, if acquired before that date. None of the acts specifically provide a basis for making the computations where return is made of income received by the estate of a decedent in the course of administration. But in the case of property acquired by 'bequest, devise, or inheritance' section 202(a)(3) of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 229, and section 204(a)(5) of the 1924 and 1926 Acts, 26 USCA  935 and note, provide that the basis shall be the fair market value 'at the time of acquisition.'\n The revenue acts consistently treat the estate of a decedent in the hands of an administrator or executor as a separate taxpayer. By section 2 of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 227, and 1924 and 1926 Acts, 26 USCA  1262, the estate of a decedent is embraced within the term 'taxpayer.' Each act specifically provides for taxation of the income of an estate during administration. Section 219 of the 1924 Act, 42 Stat. 246, and 1924 and 1926 Acts, 26 USCA  960 note. Each includes profits from the sale of property by the taxpayer in taxable income, section 213 of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 237, 238, and 1924 and 1926 Acts, 26 USCA  954 and note, and provides for the deduction of losses from gross income in arriving at taxable income, section 214 of the 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 239, and 1924 and 1926 Acts, 26 USCA  955 and note. See Merchants' Loan & Trust Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509, 516\n, 517 S., 41 S.Ct. 386, 15 A.L.R. 1305. Each makes provision for the imposition of a tax upon the estates of deceased persons, and the 'gross estate' which is the basis for computing the tax is the value of the decedent's property at the time of his death. Section 402, 1921 Act, 42 Stat. 278; section 302, 1924 and 1926 Acts, 26 USCA  1094 note.\n The Court of Claims held that the time of acquisition, indicated by section 202(a) of the 1921 Act and section 204(a) of the 1924 and 1926 Acts as the controlling date for calculating gain or loss to the estate in the course of administration, must be taken to be the date of acquisition \n\n[295 U.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n by the decedent rather than the time of acquisition by the executor or administrator on the decedent's death. This conclusion, it was thought, was compelled by the statutory command that the basis of computation shall be 'cost,' which could have no application to the acquisition by the executor or administrator, who is not a purchaser of the estate which be administers. McKinney v. United States, supra, 62 Ct.Cl. 180, 188. But this specification is not enough to restrict the effect of the general provisions of these acts which impose a tax on the income, including capital gains, of taxpayers. The use of the word cost does not preclude the computation and assessment of the taxable gains on the basis of the value of property, rather than its cost, where there is no purchase by the taxpayer, and thus no cost at the controlling date. See Heiner v. Tindle, \n276 \nU.S. 582, 585\n, 586 S., 48 S.Ct. 326; Lucas v. Alexander, \n279 \nU.S. 573, 578\n, 579 S., 49 S.Ct. 426, 61 A.L.R. 906.\n No plausible reason has ben advanced for supposing that Congress intended the capital gains or losses of the estate of a decedent to be treated any differently from those resulting from the sale of property taken by 'bequest, devise, or inheritance,' as provided in section 202(a)( 3) of the 1921 Act and section 204(a)(5) of the 1924 and 1926 Acts, or that it intended to bring gains or losses, accruing between the date of decedent's acquisition of the property and his death, into the computation of both the estate tax and the income tax assessed upon his administrator or executor. When it had a different purpose in the case of gifts inter vivos, not subject to a gift tax, it specifically directed that gains or losses to the donee should be computed on the basis of the cost of the property at the date of acquisition by the donor. Section 202(a)(2), 1921 Act; section 204(a)(2)(4), 1924 and 1926 Acts, 26 USCA  935(a) (2, 4); see Taft v. Bowers, \n278 \nU.S. 470\n, 49 S.Ct. 199, 64 A.L.R. 362; Helvering v. New York Trust Co., \n292 \nU.S. 455, 462\n, 54 S.Ct. 806. The conclusion seems inescapable that the intended date of acquisition by an executor or administra- \n\n[295 U.S. 216, 220]\n\u00a0\n tor, where the estate is the taxpayer, is the date of the decedent's death. Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 335\n, 50 S.Ct. 115.\n Possibility of doubt was removed by Treasury Regulation. Article 343 of Regulation 45, under the 1918 Act, prescribed that gains or losses of an estate should be computed on the basis of the value of the property at the date of the decedent's death. This was carried forward by article 343 of Regulation 62 under the Act of 1921, of Regulation 62 under the Act of 1924, and of Regulation 69 under the Act of 1926. Following the decision of the Court of Claims in McKinney v. United States, supra, and with the purpose of conforming to it, the ruling was amended by T.D. 4011, VI-1 Cum. Bul. 77, on April 6, 1927, so as to make the cost to the decedent the basis of the computation. Doubts having been raised as to the ruling in McKinney v. United States, supra, by later decisions,2 the amendment was revoked, and article 343 restored to its original form, T.D. 4177, VII-2 Cum.Bul. 134, on July 7, 1928. The substance of the regulation in its original and final form was carried into  113(a)(5) of the Revenue Act of 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 818, 819, 26 USCA  2113(a)(5), which directed that the basis for the computation of gains or losses upon property acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent should be its value at the time of the decedent's death.\n The re-enactment of the pertinent provisions of section 202 of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 229) in the Acts of 1924, 26 USCA  935 and note, and 1926, 26 USCA  935, without material change, was a congressional recognition and approval of the interpretation of the section by the Treasury Regulations, which gave them the force of law.

Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 344\n, 56 S.Ct. 289, decided this day.\n From the facts, as found by the Board of Tax Appeals, it appears that respondent was formed by an indenture of trust in November, 1926. The creators of the trust were Harry Coleman, pauline Coleman, Bernard Gilbert, Harris Levine, and Lena Levine. They were co-owners of real property consisting of about twenty apartment houses in the city of Boston and vicinity.\n The property had originally been owned by Harry Coleman, Bernard Gilbert, and Harris Levine in equal shares, but subsequently Coleman and Levine transferred to their wives one-half of their interests. These five persons had for some time been associated in the business of owning and operating apartment houses. By the trust instrument, which recited a contemporaneous conveyance of the property to themselves, they declared that the real estate so conveyed, and any real estate thereafter acquired under the trust, should be held by them in trust for the purposes described, with the designation 'Coleman-Gilbert Associates.' The trust was to continue for fifteen years unless sooner terminated by sale and distribution of the trust estate. The trustees were to hold the property in order to improve and dispose of it for the benefit of the persons named as 'cestuis que trustent and beneficiaries, and \n\n[296 U.S. 369, 371]\n\u00a0\n their respective representatives and assigns, devisees, or legatees' in the shares provided in the instrument. Except as stated, the beneficiaries were to have no interest in the trust property, and 'especially' they were to have 'no right to call for any partition thereof.' The interests of the beneficiaries were to be personal property, and the death of any one or of all the beneficiaries was not to determine the trust nor entitle the legal representatives of the decedent to an accounting by the trustees.\n The trustees were to have the 'full power and discretion' of absolute owners, with authority to invest and reinvest the trust property, including its income, in mortgages or in obligations secured upon real estate, and 'in the purchase and improvement of real estate situated in the cities or towns of the commonwealth of Massachusetts.' The trustees were authorized to sell at public or private sale any part or all of the trust property upon such terms as they might see fit,' to improve, to lease for a term beyond the possible termination' of the trust, of for any less term, 'to hire for improvement or otherwise, to let, to exchange, to release, to partition,' to borrow money, and to execute all necessary contracts. Funds in the possession of the trustees, being 'the proceeds of sales or otherwise,' or net income, which was 'not required in their judgment for development or improvement of the trust property,' were to be divided and paid over annually, or oftener, if convenient, equally among the said beneficiaries and their respective representatives and assigns in the proportions stated. The trustees were to have no power to bind the beneficiaries personally, and the trustees were to be responsible only for willful default and breach of trust. There was also provision for the resignation of trustees, and in case of death or resignation of a trustee, the surviving trustees were to appoint successors, and if they failed to do so, the beneficiaries were to have the right of appointment. \n\n[296 U.S. 369, 372]\n\u00a0\n The Board of Tax Appeals found that the trust owned and operated some twenty apartment houses, the gross annual rents of which amounted to about $ 420,000. There were approximately 1,500 tenants. The gross cost of the properties was about $3,000,000. Employees' pay rolls amounted to about $ 25,000, and the operating expenses to about $300,000, annually. The trustees drew no salary. Two of the male trustees devoted their entire time to the management and a third trustee was also actively engaged. An office force of three persons, besides the three operating trustees, was required to keep the necessary financial records o the trust. There were no 'building managers' or superintendents. The trustees supervised the maintenance of the trust properties looking after their operating condition, collecting rents, ordering repairs, purchasing supplies, arranging loans, and supervising office details, securing new tenants, and generally operating the trust properties. The female trustees were entirely inactive.\n The Board of Tax Appeals summed up its findings by saying: 'These trustees, although they did not exercise all of the powers given to them in the trust instrument, were engaged, nevertheless, in carrying on a business for profit in much the same manner as the directors of a corporation are associated together for the purpose of carrying on a business enterprise.'\n We think that the Board was right in its conclusion that the trust constituted an association within the meaning of the revenue acts. The governing principles have been discussed in Morrissey v. Commissioner, supra, and need not be restated. The small number of persons in the trust now before us does not present a difference in the legal aspect of their enterprise from the standpoint of the statutory classification. A few persons, as well as many, may form an association to conduct a business for their common profit. Nor is the absence of provision for \n\n[296 U.S. 369, 373]\n\u00a0\n control by the beneficiaries, as such, determinative. The fact that the enterprise was confined to dealings in real property, its management, and improvement does not prevent its being classified as an association. See Swanson v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 362\n, 56 S.Ct. 283, decided this day. The Circuit Court of Appeals, while not questioning the sufficiency of the evidence to warrant the Board of Tax Appeals in finding that the trustees were conducting a business enterprise for the purpose of ensuring an income for the beneficiaries, and that the trustees may have exercised powers in some respects as great as those of the directors of a corporation, found a distinction in the procedure that had been followed. There had been no meetings, no records, and the acts of the trustees were not determined by a majority vote. The trustees had conducted the business in the same manner as it had been conducted before the trust was formed. We think that the court unduly emphasized the mere differences of formal procedure. If such differences were to be made the test in determining whether or not an enterprise for the transaction of business constitutes an association, the subject would be enveloped in a cloud of uncertainty, and enterprises of the same essential character would be placed in different categories simply by reason of formal variations in mere procedural details. The significant resemblance to the action of directors does not lie in the formalities of meetings or records but in the fact that, by virtue of the agreement for the conduct of the business of a joint enterprise, the parties have secured the centralized management of their undertaking through designated representatives.\n We agree with the Circuit Court of Appeals that weight should be given to the purpose for which the trust was organized, but that purpose is found in the agreement of the parties. Not only were they actually engaged, as the Board of Tax Appeals determined, in carrying on an extensive business for profit, but the terms of the trust \n\n[296 U.S. 369, 374]\n\u00a0\n instrument authorized a wide range of activities in the purchase, improvement and sale of properties in the cities and towns of the state. The parties are not at liberty to say that their purpose was other or narrower than that which they formally set forth in the instrument under which their activities were conducted. Undoubtedly they wished to avoid partition of the property of which they had been co-owners, but their purpose as declared in their agreement was much broader than that. They formed a combination to conduct the business of holding, improving and selling real estate, with provision for management through representatives, wit continuity which was not to be disturbed by death or changes in ownership of beneficial interests, and with limited liability. They had been co-owners but they preferred to become 'associates,' and also not to become partners. Morrissey v. Commissioner, supra.\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed and the orders of the Board of Tax Appeals are affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","76":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. CITY BANK FARMERS TRUST CO.(1935)\nNo. 10\nArgued: October 15, 1935Decided: November 11, 1935\n\n\n\n The \n\n[296 U.S. 85, 86]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General and Mr. David E. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Russell L. Bradford, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Revenue Act of 1926,  302(d)1, provides:\n'The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated- ...\n\n'(d) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, by trust or otherwise, where the enjoyment thereof was subject at the date of his death to any change through the exercise of a power, either by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any person, to alter, amend, or revoke.'\n\n The questions for decision are whether the section requires inclusion in the gross estate of the value of the corpus of a trust established in 1930 where the creator reserved a power to revoke or modify, to be exercised jointly with a beneficiary and the trustee; and whether, if such value is to be included in the gross estate, the section offends the Fifth Amendment.\n By a writing dated February 21, 1930, Gertrude Feldman James, a nonresident citizen, transferred securities to the respondent as trustee; the trust to last during the lives of her two daughters or the survivor of them. The \n\n[296 U.S. 85, 87]\n\u00a0\n income was to be paid to her until her death, or until the termination of the trust, whichever should first occur. After her death, her husband surviving, the income was to be paid to him. If he did not outlive her, or upon his death, the income was to be distributed amongst their issue per stirpes. At the termination of the trust, the corpus was to be delivered to the husband, if he were alive; if not, to the settlor, if living, or, if she were dead, to the beneficiaries at that time entitled to receive the income; if there were none such, to the heirs at law of the husband. The trust was irrevocable save that the settlor reserved the right to modify, alter, or revoke it, in whole or in part, or to change any beneficial interest; any such revocation or alteration to be effected with the written consent of the trustee and her husband, or, if the husband were dead, of the trustee and her husband's brother. If they could not agree, the decision of the husband or of the brother, as the case might be, was to be final. Samuel James, the husband, survived the grantor, whose death occurred before the termination of the trust, and he is in receipt of the income.\n The petitioner included the value of the corpus of the trust in Mr. James' gross estate and determined a deficiency of tax. The Board of Tax Appeals reversed, holding that section 302(d) did not apply. \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the Board's decision. \n3\n We granted the writ of certiorari because the decision below conflicts with that in another circuit. \n4\n We hold that the section covers this case, and, as so applied, is valid.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals thought our decision in Reinecke v. Northern Trust Company, \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397, required the language of the act to be construed as tantamount to \n\n[296 U.S. 85, 88]\n\u00a0\n in conjunction 'with any person not a beneficiary.' So limited, it is inapplicable to the trust in question. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The Reinecke Case involved section 402(c) of the Revenue Act of 19216 ( substantially section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 USCA  1094(c), which directed the inclusion in the gross estate of all property 'to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death.' It was held that a gift beyond the power of the grantor to alter, amend, or revoke could not be said to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death. Conversely, one which he alone held the power to revoke or modify came within the section, since, at his death, substantial interests passed from his control and were for the first time confirmed in others. The case involved nothing more than a determination whether the transfers were complete when made. If they were, the statute did not reach them. Here we have a different problem, for section 302(d) of the 1926 act on its face embraces Mrs. James' transfer, although complete when made and thereafter beyond her own unfettered control.\n The respondent says that the section ought to be construed in the light of the analogous section 219(g).7 The latter, part of the income tax title, is: 'Where the grantor of a trust has, at any time during the taxable year, either alone or in conjunction with any person not a beneficiary of the trust, the power to revest in himself title to any \n\n[296 U.S. 85, 89]\n\u00a0\n part of the corpus of the trust, then the income of such part of the trust for such taxable year shall be included in computing the net income of the grantor.' The two sections have a cognate purpose, but they exhibit marked differences of substance. The one speaks of a power to be exercised with one not a beneficiary; the other of a power to be exercised with any person. The one refers to a power to revest the corpus in the donor; the other has no such limitation. \n8\n It is true, the Report of the Ways and Means Committee on section 302(d) said: 'this provision is in accord with the principle of section 219(g) of the bill which taxes to the grantor the income of a revocable trust.' \n9\n But to credit the assertion that the difference in phraseology is without significance, and in both sections Congress meant to express the same thought, would be to disregard the clear intent of the phrase 'any person' employed in section 302(d). We are not at liberty to construe language so plain as to need no construction,10 or to refer to committee reports where there can be no doubt of the meaning of the words used. \n11\n The section applies to this transfer.\n We are next told that if the act means what it says it taxes a transfer as one taking effect at death though made prior to death and complete when made; that to do this is arbitrary and deprives the taxpayer of property without due process.\n The section was first introduced into the Revenue Act of 1924, and re- enacted in that of 1926. Mrs. James created her trust in 1930. She was, therefore, upon notice of the law's command, and there can be no claim that the statute is retroactive in its application to her transfer. \n\n[296 U.S. 85, 90]\n\u00a0\n The inquiry is whether it is arbitrary and unreasonable to prescribe for the future that, as respects the estate tax, a transfer, complete when made, shall be deemed complete only at the transferor's death, if he reserves power to revoke or alter exercisable jointly with another.\n The respondent insists that a power to recall an absolute and complete gift only with the consent of the donee is in truth no power at all; that in such case the so-called exercise of the power is equivalent to a new gift from the donee to the donor. And so it is claimed that the statute arbitrarily declares that to exist which in fact and law is nonexistent. The position is untenable. The purpose of Congress in adding clause (d) to the section as it stood in an earlier act was to prevent avoidance of the tax by the device of joining with the grantor in the exercise of the power of revocation some one who he believed would comply with his wishes. Congress may well have thought that a beneficiary who was of the grantor's immediate family might be amenable to persuasion or be induced to consent to a revocation in consideration of other expected benefits from the grantor's estate. Congress may adopt a measure reasonably calculated to prevent avoidance of a tax. The test of validity in respect of due process of law is whether the means adopted is appropriate to the end. A legislative declaration that a status of the taxpayer's creation shall, in the application of the tax, be deemed the equivalent of another status falling normally within the scope of the taxing power, if reasonably requisite to prevent evasion, does not take property without due process. But if the means are unnecessary or inappropriate to the proposed end, are unreasonably harsh or oppressive, when viewed in the light of the expected benefit, or arbitrarily ignore recognized rights to enjoy or to convey individual property, the guarantee of due process is infringed. \n\n[296 U.S. 85, 91]\n\u00a0\n Illustrations are not lacking of cases falling on either side of the line.\n Congress may require that property transferred in contemplation of death, although the transfer is so remote in time as not to comply with the requirements of a gift causa mortis, shall nevertheless be treated as part of the estate for purposes of taxation; this for the prevention of evasion and the giving of practical effect to the exercise of admitted power. \n12\n This is true despite the fact that the statutory prescription embraces gifts inter vivos which are in fact fully executed, irrevocable, and cannot be defeated. \n 13\n\u00a0\n\n Although property received by gift from another is capital in the hands of the donee, the gain upon a sale may be measured by the cost to the donor rather than the value at the time of acquisition by the donee. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n It is competent for Congress, in order to avoid the evasion of tax, to declare that when one has placed his property in trust subject to a right of revocation in himself and another who is not the beneficiary he shall, nevertheless, be deemed to control the property in such sense that the income therefrom shall be treated as his income for the levying of a tax. \n15\n So, also, where an irrevocable trust is established to pay for insurance on the settlor's life, to collect the policy upon his death, and to hold or apply the proceeds for the benefit of his dependents, Congress may declare the income of the trust fund taxable to the settlor as part of his own income. \n16\n\u00a0\n\n In the instances cited, the power to levy an excise upon the testamentary transfers or to tax income was conceded. \n\n[296 U.S. 85, 92]\n\u00a0\n To effectuate the exercise of this admitted power and to prevent evasion Congress was held to have acted reasonably in including within the sweep of the statute a status or an act not normally within its reach.\n There are, however, limits to the power of Congress to create a fictitious status under the guise of supposed necessity. Thus it has been held that an act creating a conclusive presumption that a gift made within two years prior to death was made by the donor in contemplation of death, and requiring the value of the gift to be included in computing the estate of the decedent subject to transfer tax, is so grossly unreasonable as to violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. \n17\n In the same category falls a statute seeking to tax the separate income of a wife as income of her husband. \n 18\n\u00a0\n\n In view of the evident purpose of Congress we find nothing unreasonable or arbitrary in the provisions of section 302(d) of the Revenue Act of 1926 as applied in the circumstances of this case. It was appropriate for Congress to prescribe that if, subsequent to the passage of that act, the creator of a trust estate saw fit to reserve to himself jointly with any other person the power of revocation or alteration, the transaction should be deemed to be testamentary in character, that is, treated for the purposes of the law as intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at the death of the settlor.\n The judgment is reversed.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER are of opinion that the judgment should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n296 \nU.S. 664\n, 56 S.Ct. 303. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9, 70; U.S.C.App., tit. 26,  1094(d), 26 USCA  1094(d). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 29 B.T.A. 1141. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 74 F.(2d) 242. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Commissioner v.

Combs Well No. 2 contested the ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that the taxpayer was taxable as an association, and not as a trust, on its income for the years 1925 and 1926. The Board of Tax Appeals sustained their contention and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Board. Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Combs, 76 F.(2d) 682. A writ of certiorari was issued in view of the conflict of decisions to which we have referred in Morrissey v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 344\n, 56 S.Ct. 289, decided this day.\n The trust was created 'to finance and drill a well for production and sale of oil and other hydro-carbon substances under Oil and Gas Lease dated July 24, 1924.' By the agreement, the Hub Oil Company, a California corporation and owner of the oil and gas lease, assigned to E. E. Combs and Edward Everett, as trustees, all its rights under the lease, subject to a reservation of 6.5 per cent. of all oil, gas, and other hydro-carbon substances which might be produced and of a royalty interest in favor of one Smithson of 2 per cent. The agreement described as beneficiaries 'all persons who may own or acquire portions of the whole beneficial interest' as defined. The \n\n[296 U.S. 365, 367]\n\u00a0\n assignor agreed to supply to the trustees certain equipment, and one Bailes had already agreed to furnish other equipment and materials and to superintend the operation of drilling the well in consideration of 12 per cent. of the production. The trust was to pay all labor claims and for materials not otherwise provided.\n The 'whole beneficial interest' in the trust was defined as .71333 per cent. of gross production, and the beneficiaries were to be paid their pro rata shares, after deduction for the payment of lawful trust obligations, as follows: (a) 25 per cent. of gross production to the beneficiaries who provided money for the trust purposes; (b) .44333 per cent. to E. E. Combs; and (c) 2 per cent. to Edward Everett. Certificates of beneficial interest were to be issued in approved legal form and were to be held in escrow until a producing well was brought in. Thirteen persons were named as beneficiaries, with the amounts contributed and the percentages owned by each, these amounts aggregating $25,000 and the percentage of ownership amounting to 25 per cent. The 'certificate of beneficial interest' recited that the party named was the holder of a beneficial interest under the trust agreement in the amount stated and that the same was transferable only upon the books of the trustees, upon indorsement and surrender of the certificate. The trustees were authorized to hold all property and property rights, the legal title to which might vest in them under the trust, to use the moneys deposited by beneficiaries to pay for labor, casing, and other materials incident to drilling and production, to manage and protect the trust property, to pay 'trust debts,' to sell all products of the well, to borrow money upon the credit of the trust, and to sell any 'unsold beneficial interests' as they might deem best for trust purposes. The trustees were not to be individually liable except for willful misconduct. E. E. Combs was to act as production manager at a stated salary after the \n\n[296 U.S. 365, 368]\n\u00a0\n well was in production. All proceeds 'of sale of well products' were to be paid into a designated bank to be distributed as agreed.\n The provisions of the agreement were carried out. The thirteen described beneficiaries contributed the amount above stated. A well was drilled in 1925 and produced oil through the remainder of that year and for a portion of the year 1926. In the latter year the trustees sold the lease. In both years they currently distributed to the beneficiaries the net proceeds from the sale of oil and from the sale of the lease and, after the latter sale and distribution of the moneys received, the trust was terminated.\n The beneficiaries did not hold a meeting and the trust had no office or place of business, no seal, by-laws, or official name, and the operations of the trustees were confined to the one lease they acquired.\n In considering whether an association was created, the fact that the beneficiaries did not exercise control is not determinative. Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144\n, 44 S.Ct. 462; Morrissey v. Commissioner, supra. The parties joined in a common enterprise for the transaction of business, and the beneficiaries who contributed money for that purpose became associated in the enterprise according to the terms of the arrangement. The essential features of the enterprise were not affected by the fact that the parties confined their operations to one oil well. See Swanson v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 362\n, 56 S.Ct. 283, decided this day. Parties may form an association for a small business as well as for a large one. Here, through the medium of a trust the parties secured centralized management of their enterprise, and its continuity during the trust term without termination or interruption by death or changes in the ownership of interests, and with limited liability and transferable beneficial interests evidenced by certificates. Entering into a joint undertaking they avoided the characteristic re- \n\n[296 U.S. 365, 369]\n\u00a0\n sponsibilities of partners and secured advantages analogous to those which pertain to corporate organization. The fact that meetings were not held or that particular forms of corporate procedure were absent is not controlling. Morrissey v. Commissioner, supra.\n We think that the taxpayer was taxable as an association. The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","78":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v.

Stone died a resident of New York. He left a will by which he created for the benefit of his daughter, the decedent, Annie Stone, a trust fund, the income from which was to be paid to her during her life. The will provided that upon her death her share of the \n\n[294 U.S. 153, 154]\n\u00a0\n estate should go and be applied to such persons and such uses as she might appoint by last will and testament; but, in default of such appointment, her share of the estate should go and belong to her children or issue, respectively, by right of representation, or, in default of such issue, to her next of kin. Surviving John O. Stone were his widow and three daughters, namely, this decedent and Ellen J. Stone and Sarah J. Grinnell. These constituted his only heirs at law and next of kin.

I give, devise, and bequeath in equal shares to my dear sisters Ellen J. Stone and Sarah J. Grinnell. ...' After the death of Annie Stone, the two sisters in writing renounced their right to receive the property under this paragraph of her will and elected to take the property under the provisions of the will of their father, John O. Stone.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue declared a tax deficiency of several thousand dollars in the federal estate tax on the estate of Annie Stone, upon the theory that the property derived from the estate of her father was required to be included in her gross estate in virtue of the fact that she had exercised a power of appointment in respect thereof. The Board of Tax Appeals, on review, sustained the Commissioner. The order of the Board of Tax Appeals based on this holding was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals, 70 F.(2d) 705, upon the ground that the property did not pass under the exercise of the power; and consequently an essential condition of section 302 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA  1094) was not present. \n\n[294 U.S. 153, 155]\n\u00a0\n Section 302, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 70, 71, provides:\n'Sec. 302. The value of the gross estate of the decedent shall be determined by including the value at the time of his death of all property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, wherever situated-...\n\n'(f) To the extent of any property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent (1) by will, or (2) by deed executed in contemplation of, or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after, his death, except in case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and full consideration in money or money's worth.'\n\n The crucial words are 'property passing under a general power of appointment exercised by the decedent by will.' Analysis of this clause discloses three distinct requisites: (1) The existence of a general power of appointment; (2) an exercise of that power by the decedent by will; and ( 3) the passing of the property in virtue of such exercise. Clearly, the general power existed and was exercised; and this is not disputed. But it is equally clear that no property passed under the power or as a result of its exercise, since that result was definitely rejected by the beneficiaries. If they had wholly refused to take the property, it could not well be said that the property had passed under the power, for in that event it would not have passed at all. Can it properly be said that, because the beneficiaries elected to take the property under a distinct and separate title, the property nevertheless passed under the power? Plainly enough, we think, the answer must be in the negative.\n The contention of the government is that the tax is imposed 'upon the power to transmit or the transmission of property by death; the shifting of the economic benefits in property is the real subject of the tax. ... The \n\n[294 U.S. 153, 156]\n\u00a0\n property in question passed to the sisters under the general power of appointment exercised by the decedent by will within the meaning of the statute.' But this involves the obviously self-destructive conclusion that an unsuccessful attempt to effectuate a thing required by the statute is the same as its consummation. The tax here does not fall upon the mere shifting of the economic benefits in property, but upon the shifting of those benefits by a particular method, namely, by their 'passing under a general power of appointment,' and not otherwise. Acceptance of the government's contention would strip the italicized word of all meaning.\n The government relies upon Chase Nat. Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 63 A.L.R. 388, and Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758. In neither of these cases was the court concerned with the meaning of the act. In the first case (page 334 of 278 U.S., 49 S.Ct. 126) the court said the tax was plainly imposed by the explicit language of the statute, and that there was no question as to its construction. The sole question for determination was as to the constitutional validity of the act. The same is true in respect of the second case. Neither case sheds any light upon the question here involved, namely, the meaning and application of the statutory provision.\n The court below leaned confidently upon the decision of the New York Court of Appeals in the Matter of Lansing's Estate, 182 N.Y. 238, 74 N.E. 882, 884. That well-considered case and this in principle cannot be distinguished. We think the reasoning of the New York court as to the meaning and application of the state law equally applies to the federal statute here in question. There, as here, the contention of the taxing authorities (there under the state act, here under the federal act) was that the appointee named in the will of the donee of the power took her property thereunder and not under the will of the creator of the power, notwithstanding the property had been given to her by the will of the former subject to the power \n\n[294 U.S. 153, 157]\n\u00a0\n of appointment. But the state court answered that the power gave the appointee nothing and took nothing away from her; that she had the right of election and could refuse to take under the appointment and still hold the property, since her title without was as good as it was with the power; that she treated the exercise of the power as a mere attempt and not as an effective execution of it; and that it sufficiently appeared that she elected to reject title from that source.\n'Her rights were fixed by the will of her grandfather, and, unless changed pursuant to its provisions, her estate in expectancy would become an estate in possession upon the death of her mother. ... Although the power was exercised in form, her title was perfect without it, and she derived no benefit from it. The power was to 'dispose of the remainder,' and the remainder was not disposed of, but continued where it was. The attempt to execute the power was not effective, because it did nothing. The exercise of a power which leaves everything as it was before is a mere form, with no substance.'\n\n The opinion, page 244 of 182 N.Y., 74 N.E. 882, 884, points out that the power might have been exercised so as to have left the appointee with no title at all; but that in fact it was exercised so as to leave her the same title that she would have had if the power had not been exercised. The same is true here.\n'An appointee under a power,' the court continued, 'has the right of election, the same as a grantee under a deed. ... He can accept the title tendered or reject it, in his discretion. It cannot be forced upon him against his will. He cannot be compelled to receive additional evidence of title when he does not want it, and does not need it because his title is perfect without it. His consent is necessary before the attempt to exercise the power becomes binding upon him the same as consent is necessary in making a contract or agreement. Declining or refusing to take has the same effect as incapacity to take, \n\n[294 U.S. 153, 158]\n\u00a0\n as in the case of a devise to a corporation which has no power to hold any more property because the statutory limit has been exceeded. The title is not affected, but remains where it was before.'\n\n We granted the writ of certiorari in this case (\n293 \nU.S. 543\n, 55 S.Ct. 103, 79 L.Ed. --) because of an alleged conflict with Wear v. Commissioner ( C.C.A.) 65 F.(2d) 665, and Lee v. Commissioner, 61 App.D.C. 33, 57 F.(2d) 399. The reasoning and conclusions of those courts and of the court below cannot be reconciled. We are of opinion that, to the extent of the conflict, the view of the former is wrong and that of the court below is right, and we hold accordingly.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. HELMHOLZ(1935)\nNo. 14\nArgued: Decided: November 11, 1935\n\n\n\n The \n\n[296 U.S. 93, 94]\n\u00a0\n Attorney General and Mr. David E. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Messrs. James Quarles, of Washington, D.C., and Louis Quarles, of Milwaukee, Wis., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, like No. 10, Helvering v. City Bank Farmers' Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 85\n, 56 S.Ct. 70, arises under section 302(d) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA  1094(d). The respondent is administrator and sole beneficiary of the estate of his wife, Irene C. Helmholz. In 1918 she, her father and mother and her brothers and sisters joined in an indenture conveying to a trustee all of the shares of stock in the Patrick Cudahy Family Company. Her contribution was 999 shares, the dividends from which the trustee was to receive, and pay, less expenses, to Mrs. Helmholz for life, remainder to her appointee by will and remainder to her issue; and in event she or any other subscriber should die without issue the net dividends on the stock delivered to the trustee by such decedent were to be paid 'to the surviving subscribers or their issue living at the time of distribution proportionately by right of representation.'\n The paragraph of the indenture relative to the termination of the trust is:\n'Fifth: The term of the primary trust hereby created shall end (1) upon the death of the last surviving grandchild of Patrick and Anna M. Cudahy, they being then deceased, or (2) upon delivery to the said trustee of a written instrument signed by all of the then beneficiaries, other than testamentary appointees, declaring said trust term at an end, or (3) upon delivery to said trustee of a copy (certified by the president or secretary of the Patrick \n\n[296 U.S. 93, 95]\n\u00a0\n Cudahy Family Company and under its corporate seal) of a resolution adopted by unanimous vote of the board of directors of said corporation declaring said trust term at an end, whereupon and in either of said events the said trustee shall distribute the capital stock of said the Patrick Cudahy Family Company to the beneficiaries then entitled to receive the net dividends thereof other than testamentary appointees; excepting the shares to the dividends upon which such testamentary appointees are entitled, which shall be held by said trustee as hereinbefore provided.\n\n'The term of the primary trust hereby created shall also terminate upon the dissolution of said the Patrick Cudahy Family Company in the manner and for any of the causes provided by law, whereupon the trustee shall distribute all the proceeds and assets by it received upon the liquidation of said corporation to the beneficiaries other than testamentary appointees then entitled to receive net dividends or income in the proportion in which they are severally entitled, excepting the proceeds and (or) assets of shares to the net dividends or income upon which testamentary appointees are entitled, which shall continue to be held in trust as hereinbefore provided.\n\n'The term of the primary trust hereby created shall also terminate upon the extinction of issue of the said Patrick and Anna M. Cudahy, they being then deceased, whereupon the said trustee shall convey and transfer the stock of said the Patrick Cudahy Family Company to the Wisconsin Trust Company as trustee, to have and to hold the same upon the trusts and for the uses and purposes embraced in a certain resolution or declaration of trust adopted by the board of directors of the Wisconsin Trust Company May 24, 1915, establishing a certain community trust known as the Milwaukee Foundation for administration and distribution as in said trust declaration pre- \n\n[296 U.S. 93, 96]\n\u00a0\n scribed and defined, subject, however, to any existing valid testamentary appointments made by subscribers hereto as hereinbefore provided.'\n\n Irene C. Helmholz left a will bequeathing all her property to respondent. The Supreme Court of Wisconsin held this a valid exercise of her power of appointment under the trust deed. First Wisconsin Trust Co. v. Helmholz, 198 Wis. 573, 225 N.W. 181. The petitioner determined that the value of the 999 shares should be included in her gross estate. The Board of Tax Appeals reversed this determination. \n1\n The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, to which an appeal was taken pursuant to stipulation for hearing by that court, affirmed the Board. \n2\n We granted certiorari.\n What is said in No. 10 shows that the transfer was complete when the trust was created in 1918. The features which differentiate this case are the absence of a reserved power of revocation or alteration and the retroactive operation of the act. Either requires a decision that the corpus of the trust may not be included in the gross estate.\n The words of section 302(d), 26 USCA  1094(d) are: 'Where the enjoyment (of the transfer) was subject at the date of his death to any change through the exercise of a power, either by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any person, to alter, amend, or revoke.' The agreement under consideration contains no such power as that described. Like every welldrawn instrument it embodies provisions for the termination of the trust. An examination of paragraph fifth shows that these were, in the main, such as any farsighted settlor would employ. Since the beneficiaries were the issue of Patrick and Anna Cudahy, it was natural to provide that upon the extinction of issue the trust \n\n[296 U.S. 93, 97]\n\u00a0\n should terminate and the principal be turned over to a secondary charitable trust. Inasmuch as the corpus comprised only the shares of a corporation, there was nothing out of the ordinary in requiring that the trust terminate upon dissolution of the company and that the proceeds of liquidation be distributed amongst the then beneficiaries. It was not unnatural to direct that the trust should end if the managers of the company should unanimously so decide. And termination upon the death of the last surviving grandchild of Patrick and Anna Cudahy, they being then deceased, is certainly not unusual.\n The petitioner, however, pitches upon the only remaining event of termination, asserting it to be the equivalent of a power to revoke, or to amend, to be exercised by the settlor with others. This is found in the clause providing that the delivery to the trustee of a writing signed by all the then beneficiaries (other than testamentary appointees), declaring such purpose, shall be effective to end the trust. He points out that such a writing might have been executed by Mrs. Helmholz and her cobeneficiaries while she was alive, with the effect of revesting in her the shares which she had delivered into the trust. This argument overlooks the essential difference between a power to revoke, alter, or amend, and a condition which the law imposes. The general rule is that all parties in interest may terminate the trust. \n3\n The clause in question added nothing to the rights which the law conferred. Congress cannot tax as a transfer intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at the death of the settlor a trust created in a state whose law permits all the beneficiaries to terminate the trust.\n Another and more serious objection to the application of section 302( d) in the present instance is its retroactive oper- \n\n[296 U.S. 93, 98]\n\u00a0\n ation. The transfer was complete at the time of the creation of the trust. There remained no interest in the grantor. She reserved no power in herself alone to revoke, to alter, or to amend. Under the revenue act then in force, the transfer was not taxable as intended to take effect in possession or in enjoyment at her death. Reinecke v. Northern Trust Company, \n278 \nU.S. 339\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397. If section 302(d) of the Act of 1926 could fairly be considered as intended to apply in the instant case, its operation would violate the Fifth Amendment. Nichols v.

CO.(1935)\nNo. 537\nArgued: Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n The Attorney General and Mr. Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. Abram R. Serven, of Washington, D.C., for respondent. \n\n[294 U.S. 686, 687]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question for decision is whether assets held by the company in 1922 against matured and unpaid coupons attached to 20-payment life coupon nonparticipating policies constituted a reserve fund required by law within the meaning of section 245(a)(2) of the Revenue Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 261).1\n That section declares that net income means gross income less, among other permissible deductions, an amount equal to 4 per cent. of the mean of the 'reserve funds required by law' held at the beginning and end of the taxable year. Respondent, a stock company, incorporated under Utah law and commenced business in 1911. The laws of that state require, as a condition of doing life insurance business, that the assets of the company shall equal or exceed all liabilities for losses reported, expenses, taxes, and other outstanding liabilities including the legal reserves. And they prescribe the rate of interest to be assumed and the motality table to be used for the purpose of making valuations of life insurance policies and determining the reserves required to be maintained. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 686, 688]\n\u00a0\n The record contains a specimen policy for $10,000 applicable to age 35 issued in consideration of 20 annual premiums of $420.90. Attached are 19 coupons maturing serially on anniversary dates of the policy beginning with the first and ending with the nineteenth. Each coupon is a promise that at its maturity the company will pay the amount specified to the owner of the policy.\n The policy states: The company will credit insured the face amount of any matured coupon as it becomes due and pay compound interest thereon, thereby creating a fund to the credit of the insured which may be applied to the payment of premiums or at any time withdrawn in cash; and, if not so applied or withdrawn prior to his death, it will pay the coupon values with interest to date of death to the beneficiary in addition to the face amount of the policy. The insured during the first year or within a month after the due date of the second annual premium may elect to convert the coupons as they mature into paid-up life additions to the policy which are only reconvertible into cash surrender value.\n At the end of 20 years if all premiums have been paid in cash and if the amount of each matured coupon has been left with the company to accumulate at interest, then upon surrender of the policy and all coupons the insured shall select one of the following options: A guaranteed cash payment of $8,000; a paid-up policy for $14,130, subject to insurability; a guaranteed annual income of $490 for at least 20 years and as many more as the insured shall survive; a paid-up policy for $10,000 and an annual income of $174.40 during life. At the end of 15 years the company will issue a fully paid-up policy of $10,000 upon surrender of the original policy and the first 14 coupons representing values left on deposit at compound interest.\n The mean of the company's reserve funds in 1922 set up against liabilities other than matured coupons was $942,751.40. Later herein these are referred to collectively as 'insurance reserves.' The company claimed and the \n\n[294 U.S. 686, 689]\n\u00a0\n Commissioner allowed as a deduction 4 per cent. of that amount. It carried a separate reserve against matured, unsurrendered, and unpaid coupons, the mean of which in that year was $136,523.39. In its return the company deducted 4 per cent. of that amount, but the Commissioner disallowed the item. The Board of Tax Appeals, in harmony with its prior constructions of the clause in question, 3 held the coupon reserve deductible. It was sustained by the court, following cases in that and other Circuit Courts of Appeals. \n4\n 71 F.(2d) 962. That being in conflict with a recent decision of the Court of Claims, 5 this court granted a writ of certiorari. \n293 \nU.S. 553\n, 55 S.Ct. 346, 79 L.Ed. --.\n In the reserves required by the laws of Utah and of the other states in which the company issues policies of the described class, there is included an amount sufficient to cover not only all elements of insurance, but also the coupon liability. We are not here dealing with reserves in relation to solvency of the company. The thing to be ascertained is the meaning that Congress intended by the language '4 per centum of the mean of the reserve funds required by law.' The clause to be construed relates exclusively to life insurance companies. It is intended to define a deduction which they are permitted to make in the calculation of the net amount to be taxed. The rule that ambiguities in statutes imposing taxes are to be resolved in favor of taxpayers does not apply. Deductions are allowed only when plainly authorized. \n\n[294 U.S. 686, 690]\n\u00a0\n Ilfeld Co. v. Hernandez, \n292 \nU.S. 62, 66\n, 54 S.Ct. 596. New Colonial Co. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 54 S.Ct. 788\n\n\n The word 'reserve' has many meanings. Accounts creating reserves are set up in almost every line of business and funds evidenced by the book entries are held for many and widely different purposes. As the act does not permit corporations other than insurance companies to make deductions of the kind here under consideration, 'reserve funds' may not reasonably be deemed to include values that do not directly pertain to insurance. In life insurance the reserve means the amount, accumulated by the company out of premium payments, which is attributable to and represents the value of the life insurance elements of the policy contracts. The premiums include enough, over and above what is needed to maintain proper insurance reserves, to provide for the discharge of coupon liability according to the terms of the policy. The coupon values are the equivalent of cash and may be used to pay premiums on the face amount of the policy, to procure additional insurance, to lessen the number of annual premiums or otherwise to obtain insurance protection. The amounts so applied cease to exist as coupon liabilities and automatically become a part of the life insurance reserves. These differ essentially from coupon liability. Life insurance matures only upon the death of the insured and the life reserve is based upon that contingency, whereas liability on the matured coupons depends upon no contingency. It follows that the insurance reserves alone constitute the base on which the deduction is to be computed. Reserves against matured coupons are excluded. McCoach v. Insurance Co. of N.

The Commissioner seeks reversal. He claims the transaction out of which the assessment arose was not a reorganization within section 112, par. (i)(1)( A), Revenue Act, 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 791, 816, (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note). 'The term 'reorganization' means (A) a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes \n\n[296 U.S. 378, 380]\n\u00a0\n of stock of another corporation, or substantially all the properties of another corporation.' The Circuit Court of Appeals held otherwise, and remanded the cause for determination by the Board whether the whole of the cash received by the Minnesota Tea Company was in fact distributed as required by the act. We granted certiorari because of alleged conflicting opinions.\n The petition also stated that, as the taxpayer made an earlier conveyance of certain assets, the later one, here in question, of what remained to the Grand Union Company did not result in acquisition by one corporation of substantially all property of another. This point was not raised prior to the petition for certiorari, and, in the circumstances, we do not consider it.\n Statutory provisions presently helpful are in the margin. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[296 U.S. 378, 381]\n\u00a0\n July 14, 1928, respondent caused Peterson Investment Company to be organized, and transferred to the latter real estate, investments, and miscellaneous assets in exchange for the transferee's entire capital stock. The shares thus obtained were immediately distributed among the three stockholders. August 23, 1928, it transferred all remaining assets to Grand Union Company in exchange for voting trust certificates, representing 18,000 shares of the transferee's common stock, and $426,842. 52 cash. It retained the certificates; but immediately distributed the money among the stockholders, who agreed to pay $106,471.73 of its outstanding debts. Although of opinion that there had been been reorganization, the Commissioner treated as taxable gain the amount of the assumed debts upon the view that this amount of the cash received\n___ zation. The word 'reorganization,' as used in this paragraph, includes a merger or consolidation (including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation, or of substantially all the properties of another corporation ), recapitalization, or mere change in identity, form, or place of organization of a corporation.\n Revenue Act, 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 256.\n Sec. 203. (a) Upon the sale or exchange of property the entire amount of the gain or loss, determined under section 202, shall be recognized, except as hereinafter provided in this section.\n\n\n (b)\n (2) No gain or loss shall be recognized if stock or securities in a corporation a party to a reorganization are, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, exchanged solely for stock or securities in such corporation or in another corporation a party to the reorganization.\n\n\n (3)\n No gain or loss shall be recognized if a corporation a party to a reorganization exchanges property, in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, solely for stock or securities in another corporation a party to the reorganization.\n\n\n (4)\n No gain or loss shall be recognized if property is transferred to a corporation by one or more persons solely in exchange for stock or securities in such corporation, and immediately after the exchange \n\n[296 U.S. 378, 382]\n\u00a0\n by the company was really appropriated to the payment of its debts.\n The matter went before the Board of Tax Appeals upon the question whether the Commissioner ruled rightly in respect of this taxable gain. Both parties proceeded upon the view that there had been reorganization. Of its own motion, the Board questioned and denied the existence of one. It then ruled that the corporation had realized taxable gain amounting to the difference between cost of the property transferred and the cash received, plus the value of the 18,000 shares; $712,195.90.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals found there was reorganization within the statute, and reversed the Board. It\n___ such person or persons are in control of the corporation; but in the case of an exchange by two or more persons this paragraph shall apply only if the amount of the stock and securities received by each is substantially in proportion to his interest in the property prior to the exchange.\n\n\n (e)\n If an exchange would be within the provisions of paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists not only of stock or securities permitted by such paragraph to be received without the recognition of gain, but also of other property or money, then-\n\n\n (1)\n If the corporation receiving such other property or money distributes it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, no gain to the corporation shall be recognized from the exchange, but\n\n\n (2)\n If the corporation receiving such other property or money does not distribute it in pursuance of the plan of reorganization, the gain, if any, to the corporation shall be recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the sum of such money and the fair market value of such other property so received, which is not so distributed.\n\n\n (h)\n As used in this section and sections 201 and 204-\n\n\n (1)\n The term 'reorganization' means (A) a merger or consolidation ( including the acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation, \n\n[296 U.S. 378, 383]\n\u00a0\n concluded that the words, 'the acquisition by one corporation of ... substantially all the properties of another corporation,' plainly include the transaction under consideration. Also, that clause (B),  112(i)(1), first introduced by Revenue Act of 1924, and continued in later statutes, did not narrow the scope of clause (A). Further, that reorganization was not dependent upon dissolution by the conveying corporation. And, finally, that its conclusions find support in treasury regulations long in force.\n These conclusions we think are correct.\n The Commissioner maintains that the statute presents two definitions of reorganization by transfer of assets.\n___ or substantially all the properties of another corporation), or (B) a transfer by a corporation of all or a part of its assets to another corporation if immediately after the transfer the transferor or its stockholders or both are in control of the corporation to which the assets are transferred, or (C) a recapitalization, or (D) a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected.\n\n\n (2)\n The term 'a party to a reorganization' includes a corporation resulting from a reorganization and includes both corporations in the case of an acquisition by one corporation of at least a majority of the voting stock and at least a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of another corporation.\n Revenue Act, 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 12 (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note).\n Section 203(a), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), (e), (e)(1), (e)(2), (h), (h)( 1) and (h)(2) repeat the words of Section 203(a), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), ( e), (e)(1), (e)(2), (h), (h)(1) and (h)(2) of the Act of 1924\n\n\n Revenue Act, 1928, c. 852, 45 Stat. 816 (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note.)\n Section 112(a), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (d), (d)(1), (d)(2), (i), (i)( 1) and (i)(2) repeat the words of Section 203(a), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), ( e), (e)(1), (e)(2), (h), (h)(1) and (h)(2) of the Act of 1924.\n Revenue Act, 1932, c. 209, 47 Stat. 196 (26 U.S.C.A.  112 and note.)\n Section 112(a), (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(5), (d), (d)(1), (d)(2), (i), (i)( 1) and (i)(2) repeat the words of Section 203(a), (b)(2), (b)(3), (b)(4), ( e), (e)(1), (e)(2), (h), (h)(1) and (h)(2) of the Act of 1924. \n\n[296 U.S. 378, 384]\n\u00a0\n One, clause (B), requires that the transferor obtain control of the transferee. The other, clause (A), is part of the definition of merger or consolidation, and must be narrowly interpreted so as to necessitate something nearly akin to technical merger or consolidation. These clauses have separate legislative histories, and were intended to be mutually exclusive. Consequently, he says, clause (A) must be restricted to prevent overlapping and negation of the condition in clause (B). Also, the transaction here involved substantially changed the relation of the taxpayer to its assets; a large amount of cash passed between the parties; there are many attributes of a sale; what was done did not sufficiently resemble merger or consolidation, as commonly understood.\n With painstaking care, the opinion of the court below gives the history of clauses (A) and (B),  112(i)(1). We need not repeat the story. Clause (A) first appeared in the Act of 1921; (B) was added by the 1924 act. We find nothing in the history or words employed which indicates an intention to modify the evident meaning of (A) by what appears in (B). Both can have effect, and if one does somewhat overlap the other the taxpayer should not be denied, for that reason, what one paragraph clearly grants him. Treasury regulations long enforced support the taxpayer's position, as the opinion below plainly points out.\n Pinellas Ice & Cold Storage Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n287 \nU.S. 462, 470\n, 53 S.Ct. 257, 260, considered the language of section 203(h)(1)(A), Act of 1926, which became section 112(i)( 1)(A), Act of 1928, 26 U.S.C.A.  112 note, and held that a sale for money or short-term notes was not within its intendment. We approved the conclusion of the Commissioner, Board of Tax Appeals, and Court of Appeals, that the transaction there involved was in reality a sale for the equivalent of money; not an exchange for securities. But we disapproved the following assumption \n\n[296 U.S. 378, 385]\n\u00a0\n and observations of the court: 'That in adopting paragraph (h) Congress intended to use the words 'merger' and 'consolidation' in their ordinary and accepted meanings. Giving the matter in parenthesis the most liberal construction, it is only when there is an acquisition of substantially all the property of another corporation in connection with a merger or consolidation that a reorganization takes place. Clause (B) of the paragraph removes any doubt as to the intention of Congress on this point.' And we said: 'The words within the parenthesis may not be disregarded. They expand the meaning of 'merger' or 'consolidation' so as to include some things which partake of the nature of a merger or consolidation but are beyond the ordinary and commonly accepted meaning of those words-so as to embrace circumstances difficult to delimit but which in strictness cannot be designated as either merger or consolidation. But the mere purchase for money of the assets of one company by another is beyond the evident purpose of the provision, and has no real semblance to a merger or consolidation. Certainly, we think that to be within the exemption the seller must acquire an interest in the affairs of the purchasing company more definite than that incident to ownership of its short-term purchase- money notes.' And we now add that this interest must be definite and material; it must represent a substantial part of the value of the thing transferred. This much is necessary in order that the result accomplished may genuinely partake of the nature of merger or consolidation.\n Gregory v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 465\n, 55 S.Ct. 266, 97 A. L.R. 1355, revealed a sham; a mere device intended to obscure the character of the transaction. We, of course, disregarded the mask and dealt with realities. The present record discloses no such situation; nothing suggests other than a bona fide business move. \n\n[296 U.S. 378, 386]\n\u00a0\n The transaction here was no sale, but partook of the nature of a reorganization, in that the seller acquired a definite and substantial interest in the purchaser.\n True it is that the relationship of the taxpayer to the assets conveyed was substantially changed, but this is not inhibited by the statute. Also, a large part of the consideration was cash. This, we think, is permissible so long as the taxpayer received an interest in the affairs of the transferee which represented a material part of the value of the transferred assets.\n Finally, it is said the transferor was not dissolved, and therefore the transaction does not adequately resemble consolidation. But dissolution is not prescribed, and we are unable to see that such action is essential to the end in view.\n The challenged judgment is affirmed.\n Nos. 175 and 176.\n The respondents in these cases are two of the three stockholders of Minnesota Tea Company. The writs were granted upon the Commissioner's petition, which states the question involved is whether the transaction between Minnesota Tea Company and Grand Union Company, described above, No. 174, resulted in a reorganization within the Revenue Act of 1928. The petition also declared: 'The amount of the tax due from the respondents , ... depends solely upon whether the transfer of the properties of the Minnesota Tea Company to the Grand Union Company was a reorganization within the meaning of the Revenue Act.'\n We think the court below rightly decided there was a reorganization. It reversed the Board of Tax Appeals, and remanded the cause for further proceedings, and its judgment must be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Revenue Act, 1918, c. 18, 40 Stat. 1060.\n Sec. 202.

RANKIN(1935)\nNo. 582\nArgued: Decided: April 29, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 123, 125]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for petitioner.\n Mr. John W. Townsend, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Revenue Act of 1928 (chapter 852,  22, 111, 112, 113 (26 USCA  2022, 2111, 2112, 2113)) provides, as had earlier Revenue Acts, that in computing income from sales of property purchased after February 28, 1913, any excess of the amount realized over cost shall be gain and that any excess of the cost over the amount realized shall be loss. When gain or loss is to be determined on the sale of stock owned outright as an investment, the identification of the shares sold with those purchased ordinarily presents no difficulty. But when the taxpayer has engaged in marginal transactions on a stock exchange, the identification of sales and purchases is frequently impossible. It was, perhaps, primarily to deal with such cases that the Treasury adopted, in 1819, 1 \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 126]\n\u00a0\n the so-called 'First-in, first-out' rule. That rule appears in Article 58 of Regulations No. 74, under Revenue Act of 1928, as follows:\n'When shares of stock in a corporation are sold from lots purchased at different dates and at different prices and the identity of the lots can not be determined, the stock sold shall be charged against the earliest purchases of such stock. The excess of the amount realized on the sale over cost or other basis of the stock will constitute gain.'\n\n Applying this rule, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue assessed against Richard B. Turner for the year 1928 a deficiency tax of $11,173.05 on account of gains from his operations on the stock exchange in United Gas Improvement Company stock. Upon a redetermination by the Board of Tax Appeals, the Commissioner's action was sustained. 26 B.T.A. 1204. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the Board's decision and directed it to enter a new order in conformity with the court's opinion. 73 F.(2d) 9, 11. Turner having died during the litigation, his executor, Rankin, was substituted. Writs of certiorari were granted in this case, and in Snyder v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n295 \nU.S. 134\n, 55 S.Ct. 737, 79 L.Ed . --, decided this day, in order to determine questions concerning the effect, validity, and applicability of the regulation. \n294 \nU.S. 700\n, 55 S. Ct. 506, 79 L.Ed. --. The facts found by the Board were these:\n In 1926, Turner received in distribution of his father's estate $20, 000 in bonds. Wishing to change his inheritance into stock, he opened a marginal account with a stock broker; sold the bonds; and, with the proceeds as margin, purchased, from time to time during that year, an aggregate of 1,200 shares of United Gas Improvement Company stock at a cost of $117,202.50. On this stock the broker received for him, later in 1926, 300 shares as a dividend. There were no further operations in 1926 or in 1927. His marginal account became active in 1928. \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 127]\n\u00a0\n At the beginning of the year he was long 1,500 shares of this stock; in May he sold 300 shares for $44,619 net; in June he bought 1,000 shares for $ 143,225; in October he sold 500 shares for $73,865; and in November 500 shares for $74,115. Thus, at the close of the year, he was long 1,200 shares.\n In none of these transactions did the broker deliver to Turner, or Turner to the broker, any stock certificate. No specific certificate of stock was ever bought or sold by the broker for Turner; and none was earmarked or allocated for him in any manner. The purchases and sales affecting his account were made through the medium of street certificates handled by the broker; and the transactions were evidenced solely by debits and credits in his account on the broker's books. Turner first learned these facts after the deficiency assessment. He had always Intended to retain ownership on margin of 1,200 shares of the stock, since he had faith in the company and desired to hold them in lieu of the bonds which he had received from the estate of his father. To his business associates, who acted for him in giving orders to the broker, he had made it plain that the 1,200 shares were in the nature of a permanent commitment on his part. An employee of the broker understood that the decedent desired to retain 1,200 shares of the stock to take the place of the bonds which he had received from his father.\n On the above facts the Board concluded, as had the Commissioner, that it was impossible to determine the identity of the lots purchased and sold; and that, consequently, the 'First-in, first-out' regulation should be applied. In reversing that order the Court of Appeals said:\n'We think the petitioner's (Turner's) communication to his broker of his intention to hold the 1200 shares first purchased as an investment was in effect an order to his broker not to sell those shares, and when, two years later, \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 128]\n\u00a0\n he ordered the broker to make two sales in lots of 500 shares each, they were, conformably with the original instructions, the 1000 shares last purchased. The petitioner's instructions excluding from sale the shares first purchased were in effect an identification of the shares later sold as those last purchased.\n\n'While the petitioner, in identifying his shares, might have been more specific in his instructions to his broker, those he gave stand uncontradicted; indeed, they have not been questioned. We think they were enough to take the case out of the rule and that, in consequence, the deficiency tax in issue is invalid to the extent that it is based on gains made in sales of U.G.I. shares reckoned on the purchase price of the original 1200 shares.'\n\n First. The Commissioner contends that Turner's communication to his broker of his intention to keep 1,200 shares of United Gas Improvement Company stock was ineffective to identify the shares to be sold, because, from the very nature of these marginal operations, the shares were incapable of identification by the broker or anyone else. The basis for this contention are the facts that in such transactions no certificate is issued in the name of the customer, or earmarked for or otherwise allocated to him; that all certificates are in the name of the broker or street names; and that all certificates for stock of the same kind are commingled and held by the broker for the common benefit of all dealing in that particular stock. The fallacy of this argument lies in the assumption that shares of stock can be identified only through stock certificates. It is true that certificates provide the ordinary means of identification. But it is not true that they are the only possible means. Compare Richardson v. Shaw, \n209 \nU.S. 365\n, 28 S.Ct. 512, 14 Ann.Cas. 981; Gorman v. Littlefield, \n229 \nU.S. 19\n, 33 S.Ct. 690; Duel v. Hollins, \n241 \nU.S. 523\n, 36 S.Ct. 615. Particularly is this so when, as here, the thing to be established is the allocation of lots sold to lots purchased at different dates and different \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 129]\n\u00a0\n prices. \n2\n The required identification is satisfied, if the margin trader has, through his broker, designated the securities to be sold as those purchased on a particular date and at a particular price. It is only when such a designation was not made at the time of the sale, or is not shown, that the 'First-in, first-out' rule is to be applied. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The validity of the regulation, thus construed, cannot seriously be questioned. The contention advanced by the taxpayers, both here and in the companion case of snyder v. Helvering, Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n295 \nU.S. 135\n, 55 S.Ct. 737, 79 L.Ed. --, that the regulation, as applied to marginal transactions, is invalid under the Fifth Amendment, because it creates a conclusive presumption, must rest wholly on the assumption that the shares traded on margin are incapable of identification. Since that assumption is erroneous, it is clear that no conclusive presumption is established. It is, at most, the burden of proof that is affected. For the margin trader, while being required to establish the identity of the shares in order to avoid the 'First-in, first-out' rule, is left free to introduce any relevant evidence. Nor is he arbitrarily deprived of any of the important attributes of ownership, such as the 'right to decide which stock he is going to \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 130]\n\u00a0\n sell.' Indeed it is conceded, at least by the taxpayer in this case, that the regulation, as we now interpret it, 'provides a useful and reasonable rule for ascertaining what stock was sold in cases where there is no proof, or lack of satisfactory proof, of the fact.'\n Third. If the facts found by the Board of Tax Appeals had been what the Court of Appeals assumed them to be, there would have been such an identification of shares sold with shares purchased as to preclude the Commissioner from applying the 'First-in, first-out' rule. The Court of Appeals assumed that, 'What Turner did in this case, acting and speaking through his attorney, was to communicate to his broker his intention to hold for investment the shares of U.G.I. he originally purchased.' The facts found by the Board of Tax Appeals do not bear out this assumption of the court. The Board's findings were that, 'The decedent (Turner) always intended to retain the ownership on margin of 1,200 shares of the United Gas Improvement Company stock'; and that, 'an employee of the broker understood ... that the decedent desired to retain 1,200 shares to take the place of the bonds which he had received from his father.' The difference between the Board's findings and the court's statement of the facts is obviously vital. The court held that Turner's communication of his intention 'was in effect an order to his broker not to sell those shares'; that 'when, two years later, he ordered the broker to make two sales in lots of 500 shares each, they were, conformably with the original instructions, the 1,000 shares last purchased.' But if the employee was told, as the Board found, merely that Turner 'desired to retain 1,200 shares (of the U.G.I. stock) to take the place of the bonds which he had received from his father,' he would naturally believe that so long as any 1,200 shares of the stock were retained, it was immaterial to which of the lots the sales in 1928 were attributed; and hence there was no identi- \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 131]\n\u00a0\n fication. Thus it was only by departing from the facts as found by the Board of Tax Appeals that the court found justification for reversing the Board's decision.\n Fourth. The Court of Appeals is without power, on review of proceedings of the Board of Tax Appeals, to make any findings of fact. 'The Board of Tax Appeals is not a court. It is an executive or administrative board, upon the decision of which the parties are given an opportunity to base a petition for review to the courts after the administrative inquiry of the Board has been had and decided.' Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n279 \nU.S. 716, 725\n, 49 S.Ct. 499, 502. The function of the court is to decide whether the correct rule of law was applied to the facts found; and whether there was substantial evidence before the Board to support the findings made. See Phillips v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 599\n, 600 S., 51 S. Ct. 608; Burnet v. Leininger, \n285 \nU.S. 136, 138\n, 52 S.Ct. 345; Old Mission Portland Cement Co. v. Helvering, \n293 \nU.S. 289, 294\n, 55 S.Ct. 158.4 Unless the finding of the Board involves a mixed question of law and fact, the court may not properly substitute its own judgment for that of the Board. \n5\n If the Board has failed to make an essential finding and the record on review is insufficient to provide the basis for a final determination, the proper procedure is to remand the case for further proceedings before the Board. Compare Helvering v. Taylor, \n293 \nU.S. 507\n, 55 S.Ct. 287; Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 \nU.S. 299, 308\n, 53 S.Ct. 161.6 And \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 132]\n\u00a0\n the same procedure is appropriate even when the findings omitted by the Board might be supplied from examination of the record. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth. The Court of Appeals did not comment on the difference between the Board's findings and its own statement of the facts. Apparently it assumed that there was no difference; and reversed the Board's order, believing that it rested upon an erroneous ruling of law. For the court said that the Board made its determination 'on the theory that the U.G.I. stock, which from time to time he (Turner) purchased on margin and later sold, could be identified only by certificates; that as no certificates for shares were ever in his name, the shares sold could not be identified as shares purchased in any particular lot or at any particular time or price and, accordingly, charged the shares sold against those earliest purchased within the 'First in, first out' rule.'\n There is nothing in the opinion of the Board to indicate that its decision was based upon the 'theory' stated by the court. There is nothing in the record to indicate that any such contention had been made by the government before the Board; and Turner's petition for review by the Court of Appeals did not claim that the Board had acted upon that 'theory.' \n8\n But even if the Board's decision \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 133]\n\u00a0\n had been based on an erroneous rule of law, that would not have justified its reversal, if the findings of fact, governed by the correct rule of law, were sufficient to sustain the decision and had substantial support in the evidence. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Sixth. The Court of Appeals did not explicitly hold that the Board's finding as to Turner's communication to his broker was without substantial support in the evidence. The court, in its opinion, does state that, 'The evidence shows conclusively that Turner was sentimental about keeping the original 1,200 shares as an inheritance from his father; that his 'intention' was to retain as an investment the shares originally purchased and sell in speculation the shares more recently acquired.' It does not state that the evidence was equally conclusive as to the communication to the broker of this exact intention. There was, it is true, testimony to the effect that 'from the very beginning West & Company knew Mr. Turner's intentions and knew he was keeping the first purchase of 1,200 shares'; and the failure of the Board so to find was assigned as error by the taxpayer in his petition for review. But there was also testimony showing that Turner, during 1928, traded heavily in 20 other issues of stock. The Court of Appeals did not consider whether, in view of this and other evidence, the Board might reasonably have concluded that the testimony as to the broker's knowledge of Turner's intention was not entirely accurate, and that the broker's only clear understadning \n\n[295 U.S. 123, 134]\n\u00a0\n of Turner's intention was that, throughout his extensive trading, 1,200 shares of United Gas Improvement Company stock were to remain in his account. Since this question was not considered in the court below nor argued here, the case must be remanded to the Court of Appeals for further consideration.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE thinks that the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed and the order of the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed, on the grounds that the petitioner failed to show that the particular shares sold were capable of identification with respect to the date of their purchase, and that they could not be identified merely by designating them to the broker as the shares to be sold. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Art. 4, par. 60, Regulations No. 33 (Revised), Revenue Acts of 1916 and 1917; Art. 39, Regulations Nos. 45, 62, 65, and 69, Acts of 1918, 1921, 1924, and 1926, respectively; Art. 58, Regulations Nos. 74 and 77, Acts of 1928 and 1932, respectively; Act. 22(a)-8, Regulations No. 86, Act of 1934. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The original regulation, Art. 4, par. 60, Regulation No. 33 ( Revised), read, 'When stock is sold from lots purchased at different times and at different prices, and the identity of the lots can not be determined as to the dates of purchase, the stock sold shall be charged against the earliest purchases of such stock.'

LOUIS UNION TRUST CO.(1935)\nNo. 25\nArgued: Decided: November 11, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 39, 40]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. David E. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Daniel N. Kirby, of St. Louis, Mo., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The decedent, several years prior to his death, transferred to a trustee certain securities in trust, to be held, managed, and disposed of as an active trust, the net income thereof to be paid to the decedent's daughter during her life, with remainder over to the persons named. The trustee was given discretionary power to determine the trust whenever the trustee might deem it wise to do so, whereupon the estate was to revert to the grantor. The indenture contained a further provision that if the daughter predecease the grantor, the trust shall terminate and the trust estate be transferred, paid over, and delivered to the grantor, to be his absolutely. It is this latter provision which gives rise to the question we are called upon to consider. By the terms of the indenture, the grantor recited that it was his intention to make for the \n\n[296 U.S. 39, 41]\n\u00a0\n benefit of his daughter 'an absolute and irrevocable gift and settlement of the property ... so that the grantor shall during the life of his said daughter have no further individual or beneficial interest therein.' The grant was final and absolute in terms, and beyond the power of the grantor to revoke or alter. At the death of the grantor, neither of the contingencies upon which the trust estate would revert to the grantor had taken place.\n The Commissioner assessed a deficiency tax against the estate upon the view that the grantor, having reserved the right to a revestment in him of the trust property, title to which he had conveyed, upon the happening of either of the contingencies mentioned, the transfer to the trustee was one cintended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death' within the meaning of section 302(c), Revenue Act of 1924, c. 234, 43 Stat. 253, 304 (26 USCA  411 note).1\n The Board of Tax Appeals decided against the Commissioner's view (28 B.T.A. 107), and its holding was upheld by the court below. 75 F.(2d) 416.\n The substantive provision of the act which imposes the tax is section 301(a), 26 USCA  410 note; and by that provision the tax is laid 'upon the transfer of the net estate of every decedent dying after the enactment of this Act.' The event which gives rise to the tax is the death of the decedent, with the resulting transfer of his estate either by will or the law relating to intestacy. When, therefore, section 302(c) includes within the purview of section 301(a) a transfer inter vivos 'intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,' it does so upon the theory that such a transfer in effect is testamentary; that is to \n\n[296 U.S. 39, 42]\n\u00a0\n say, a substitute for either a disposition by will or a passing in virtue of intestacy.\n'But such a transfer, not so made, embodies a transaction begun and completed wholly by and between the living, taxable as a gift (Bromley v. McCaughn, \n280 \nU.S. 124\n, 50 S.Ct. 46), but obviously not subject to any form of death duty, since it bears no relation whatever to death. The 'generating source' of such a gift is to be found in the facts of life and not in the circumstance of death. And the death afterward of the donor in no way changes the situation; that is to say, the death does not result in a shifting, or in the completion of a shifting, to the donee of any economic benefit of property, which is the subject of a death tax, Chase Nat. Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327, 338\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 63 A.L.R. 388; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 346\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 48 S.Ct. 225; nor does the death in such case bring into being, or ripen for the donee or any one else, so far as the gift is concerned, and property right or interest which can be the subject of any form of death tax. Compare Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 503\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758. Complete ownership of the gift, together with all its incidents, has passed during the life of both donor and donee, and no interest of any kind remains to pass to one or cease in the other in consequence of the death which happens afterwards.' ( Italics added.) Heiner v. Donnan, \n285 \nU.S. 312, 322\n, 323 S., 32 S.Ct. 358, 359.\n\n The property brought into the estate by subdivision 302(c) for the purpose of the tax is, as said by this court in Reinecke v. Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 348\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 126, 66 A.L.R. 397, 'Either property transferred in contemplation of death or property passing out of the control, possession or enjoyment of the decedent at his death. ... In the light of the general purpose of the statute and the language of ( section 301(a), 26 USCA  410 note) explicitly imposing the tax on net estates of decedents, we think it at least doubtful whether the trusts or interests in a trust intended to be \n\n[296 U.S. 39, 43]\n\u00a0\n reached by the phrase in (section 302(c), 26 USCA  411 note) 'to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,' include any others than those passing from the possession, enjoyment or control of the donor at his death and so taxable as transfers at death under (section 301( a)). That doubt must be resolved in favor of the taxpayer.' (Italics added.)\n If, therefore, no interest in the property involved in a given case pass 'from the possession, enjoyment, or control of the donor at his death,' there is no interest with respect to which the decedent has created a trust intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death. The grantor here, by the trust instrument, left in himself no power to resume ownership, possession, or enjoyment, except upon a contingency in the nature of a condition subsequent, the occurrence of which was entirely fortuitous so far as any control, design, or volition on his part was concerned. After the execution of the trust he held no right in the trust estate which in any sense was the subject of testamentary disposition. His death passed no interest to any of the beneficiaries of the trust, and enlarged none beyond what was conveyed by the indenture. His death simply put an end to what, at best, was a mere possibility of a reverter by extinguishing it; that is to say, by converting what was merely possible into an utter impossibility. This is well stated by the court below, 75 F.(2d) 416, at page 418: 'It was only in the case of the happening of certain contingencies over which he had no control that the property would revert to him. One of these contingencies was the death of his daughter prior to his death, while the trust still continued; and the second was a termination by the trustee of the trust during the lifetime of the grantor. Neither of these contingencies occurred, and there was, during the decedent's lifetime, nothing more than a possibility that either would occur. In no proper sense was there an enlargement of the interests of the \n\n[296 U.S. 39, 44]\n\u00a0\n beneficiaries of the trust resulting from the death of the decedent. That event merely changed the possibility that the property would revert to him into an impossibility.'\n It is not, in reason, possible to find in the circumstances anything which suggests that the death of the grantor, whenever it might happen, would effect any change, or was intended to effect any change, in the extent or quality of the estates conveyed in trust. The only death which could have had any such effect was that of the daughter, the grantee; and that event did not take place.\n In that connection, see Matter of Barstow's Estate, 230 App.Div. 371, 372, 373, 244 N.Y.S. 588, 589, affirmed 256 N.Y. 647, 177 N.E. 177. There the donor transferred irrevocably certain property to a trustee to be held in trust for the benefit of two daughters, with the condition that upon the death of both the fund then in the hands of the trustee was to be transferred back to the donor if then living. The donor died leaving her daughters still living. The court held that the transfer took place when the deed of trust was executed and not when the donor died.\n'Mrs. Barstow could do nothing to change the effect of the deed. The corpus was beyond her control, except for the happening of the contingency that she might survive the two life tenants, and then she would have been revested with the corpus. The rights of the beneficiaries did not depend upon the death of the donor. The term of the trust was not measured by the life of the donor, but by the lives of her two daughters. They had an interest in principal and income, provided one or both survived the donor. They took a vested estate subject to being divested if the donor survived both daughters. If we 'are to view the sequence of events in the order of the actual rather than the possible' (In re Schmidlapp's Estate, 236 N.Y. 278, 286, 140 N.E. 697, 699), then we have not only a right, but are bound to conclude that because Mrs. Barstow died before \n\n[296 U.S. 39, 45]\n\u00a0\n the termination of the trust which she created, the transfer took place when the deed was executed, and not when she died. There was the contingency that she might survive her daughters, but that did not depend upon any affirmative or volitional act of the donor.'\n\n We think it unnecessary further to review the decisions which support our conclusion. In addition to those already cited, the following are in point: May v. Heiner, \n281 \nU.S. 238, 243\n, 50 S.Ct. 286, 67 A. L.R. 1244; Coolidge v. Long, \n282 \nU.S. 582\n, 51 S.Ct. 306; McCormick v. Burnet, \n283 \nU.S. 784\n, 51 S.Ct. 343, reversing the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, Commissioner v. McCormick, 43 F.(2d) 277, and in effect affirming the Board of Tax Appeals, 13 B.T.A. 423, 437; Duke v. Helvering, 23 B.T.A. 1104, 1113, affirmed Commissioner v. Duke (C.C.A.) 62 F. (2d) 1057, and affirmed by an equally divided court in \n290 \nU.S. 591\n, 54 S.Ct. 95; Wallace v. Helvering, 27 B.T.A. 902, 910, 913, affirmed Commissioner v. Wallace (C.C. A.) 71 F.(2d) 1002, certiorari denied \n293 \nU.S. 600\n, 55 S.Ct. 117; St. Louis Union Trust Co. v. Becker (C.C.A.) 76 F.(2d) 851.\n The case of Klein v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 231\n, 51 S.Ct. 398, which is strongly relied upon by the government, does not support its position. There the grantor, 15 months prior to his wife's death, conveyed to his wife by deed a life estate in certain lands. But in the event that she survived the grantor, 'and in that case only,' she was to take the lands in fee simple. The effect of this deed, we held, was that only a life estate was vested, the remainder being retained by the grantor; and whether that should ever become vested in the grantee depended upon the condition precedent that the grantor die during the life of the grantee. The grantor having died first, his death clearly effected a transmission of the larger estate to the grantee. But here the grantor parted with the title and all beneficial interest in the property, retaining no right with respect to it which would pass to any one as a result of his death. Unlike the Klein Case, where the death was the generating source of the title, here, as the court below \n\n[296 U.S. 39, 46]\n\u00a0\n said, the trust instrument and the death was the generating source. The death did not transmit the possibility, but destroyed it.\n Judgment affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n Decedent, in making disposition of his property by his trust deed, retained a valuable interest in the property by which he postponed final disposition of it until his death. I think that the value of that interest was rightly subjected to the tax imposed by section 302(c), 26 USCA  411 note. This conclusion is strengthened and not avoided by construing the section as imposing a tax on the value of the interest which is shifted from donor to donee on the former's death. Although the tax is a death tax, section 302(c) nevertheless applies to any interest in gifts inter vivos which, by their provisions, are 'intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death,' and such gifts are subjected to the tax as a death tax if they are not complete until the donor's death. Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., \n278 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A. L.R. 397; Klein v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 231, 232\n, 51 S.Ct. 398. The decedent's death, operating upon his gift inter vivos not complete until his death, is the event which calls the statute into operation. Klein v. United States, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 231, 234\n, 51 S.Ct. 398.\n The section, in its scope and purpose, is thus similar to section 302( d), 26 USCA  411 note which includes in the decedent's taxable estate the value of his interest held as joint tenant or tenant by the entirety, although created by deed inter vivos. Tyler v. United States, \n281 \nU.S. 497\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758; Phillips v. Dime Trust & S.D. Co., \n284 \nU.S. 160\n, 52 S.Ct. 46. Both provisions prevent tax evasion by subjecting to the death tax forms of gifts inter vivos which may be resorted to, as a substitute for a will, in making dispositions of property operative at death. See Tyler v. United States, supra, \n281 \nU.S. 497, 505\n, 50 S.Ct. 356, 69 A.L.R. 758. \n\n[296 U.S. 39, 47]\n\u00a0\n Compare No. 10, Helvering v. City Bank Farmers Trust Co., \n296 \nU.S. 85\n, 56 S.Ct. 70.\n It seems plain that the gift here was not complete until decedent's death. He did not desire to make a complete gift. He wished to keep the property for himself in case he survived his daughter. He kept this hold upon it by reversing from his gift an interests, terminable only at his death, by which full ownership would be restored to him if he survived his daughter. If he had reserved a power to revoke the trust, if he survived her, Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., supra, would have made the gift taxable, as would Klein v. United States, supra, if he had reserved a remainder in himself with gift over, if he did not survive his daughter. Instead, by using a different form of words, he attained the same end and has escaped the tax.\n Having in mind the purpose of the statute and the breadth of its language it would seem to be of no consequence what particular conveyances' device, what particular string, the decedent selected to hold in suspense the ultimate disposition of his property until the moment of his death. In determining whether a taxable transfer becomes complete only at death we look to substance, not to form. Klein v. United States, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 231, 234\n, 51 S.Ct. 398; Chase National Bank v. United States, \n278 \nU.S. 327, 335\n, 49 S.Ct. 126, 63 A.L.R. 388; Reinecke v. Northern Trust Co., supra, \n278 \nU.S. 339, 345\n, 49 S.Ct. 123, 66 A.L.R. 397; Saltonstall v. Saltonstall, \n276 \nU.S. 260, 271\n, 48 S.Ct. 225. However we label the device is it but a means by which the gift is rendered incomplete until the donor's death. The extent to which it is incomplete marks the extent of the 'interest' passing at death, which the statute taxes.\n The judgment should be reversed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE, Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 302 provides that there shall be included in the gross estate the value of all property-\n'(c) To the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at any time made a transfer, or with respect to which he has at any time created a trust, in contemplation of or intended to take effect in possession or enjoyment at or after his death.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","85":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHELVERING v. TAYLOR(1935)\nNo. 289\nArgued: December 7, 1934Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 507, 508]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for Petitioner.\n Mr. Truman Henson, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Commissioner determined a deficiency of $9,156.69 on account of respondent's 1928 income tax. The Board of Tax Appeals made the same determination. The court held it excessive and that the evidence did not show the correct amount, reversed the order of the Board, and remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance with the opinion. (C.C.A.) 70 F.( 2d) 619. The petition for our writ states the question: 'Whether the Circuit Court of Appeals erred in remanding this case to the Board of Tax Appeals for a new hearing on the ground that the Commissioner's determination of the amount of income was incorrect, although the taxpayer had failed to prove facts from which a correct determination could be made.'\n In August, 1927, respondent acquired all the stock of four utilities at a total cost of $96,030, organized a holding company, and October 13 transferred to it all the \n\n[293 U.S. 507, 509]\n\u00a0\n utilities stock and received therefor all the shares of the holding company-1,000 of preferred having no par value, entitled to a dividend of $ 6 annually, $100 on liquidation and callable at $105 per share; 2,500 of no par value class A common callable at $35 per share; 5,000 of no par value class B common stock having the voting power. As this transaction was 'reorganization' under Revenue Act of 1926,  203(b)(2), 44 Stat. 12, 26 USCA  934(b)(2), no taxable gain resulted.\n In May, 1928, the holding company sold the stock of the four utilities to the Colonial Corporation for $194,930.16. Later in that year the holding company bought or retired all the preferred and paid the taxpayer $99,000 therefor. In his 1928 return he assigned the $96,030 for which he procured the utilities to the preferred stock of the holding company, deducted that amount from the $99,000 received therefor, and reported the difference, $2,970, as the gain derived from the sale. The applicable statutory provisions are contained in Revenue Act of 1928,  111(a)(d), 112(b)(3), 113(a)(6), 45 Stat. 815-519, 26 USCA  2111(a, d), 2112(b)(3), 2113(a)(6).1 \n\n[293 U.S. 507, 510]\n\u00a0\n They prescribe no rule that is applicable for the ascertainment of the cost of the preferred stock or the apportionment of the total cost between preferred and common. But Regulations 74, art. 58, declares: 'Where common stock is received as a bonus with the purchase of preferred stock or bonds, the total purchase price shall be fairly apportioned between such common stock and the securities purchased for the purpose of determining the portion of the cost attributable to each class of stock or securities, but if that should be impracticable in any case, no profit on any subsequent sale of any part of the stock or securities will be realized until out of the proceeds of sales shall have been recovered the total cost.'\n The Commissioner, holding the taxpayer not entitled to charge the cost of all to the preferred, apportioned between the preferred and common. He made his calculation upon the assumption that the cost, in 1927, attributable to the preferred shares, bears the same relation to cost of all the shares then acquired as the amount respondent received, in 1928, for the preferred, bears to the amount paid the holding company by Colonial Corporation for all the utilities shares. \n2\n On that basis, he found that of the total 1927 cost, $96,030, there was chargeable to the preferred only $48,771.16, which, deducted from $99,000 received by respondent for the preferred in 1928, leaves $50,228.84 upon which he determined the deficiency of $9,156.69. \n\n[293 U.S. 507, 511]\n\u00a0\n Before the Board of Tax Appeals the taxpayer introduced evidence to show the details of the transaction and that there was no change in value of the utilities stock between the time he got it in August, 1927, and the date, October 13 of the same year, on which he transferred it to the holding company in exchange for its shares, and that the entire increase in value came after that transfer. No opposing evidence was offered. On the facts shown, the taxpayer maintained that, as total cost was less than $ 100 per share for the preferred having prior rights to that extent on liquidation, the common stock had no value. Rejecting that contention, the Board of Tax Appeals filed a memorandum opinion in which it said: 'It may well be that the properties acquired or all the classes of stocks received by the petitioner were worth only $96,030 ... and yet the preferred stock ... may have had the value of $48,771.16. ... It is obvious that even if all the securities were worth only $96,030 that the proportionate value of the preferred stock to all the stocks would not necessarily be different from that determined by the Commissioner. ... The question ... is one of fact to be determined by testimony and not theory. It is conceivable that common stocks may actually sell on the market when preferred stocks in the same corporation are selling at less than par.' It was upon that basis, without specific findings of fact, that the Board made the redetermination at the figure set by the Commissioner.\n The only question for consideration is that stated in the petition for the writ of certiorari. Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 98\n, 50 S.Ct. 231. That question in effect assumes, and here it is taken as granted, that the court rightly held the evidence sufficient to require a finding that the Commissioner's apportionment of total cost as between preferred and common stock was unfair and erroneous and that therefore the Commissioner's determination was exces- \n\n[293 U.S. 507, 512]\n\u00a0\n sive. We also assume that the total purchase price is susceptible of fair apportionment and that upon another hearing the correct amount may be found. Taylor v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue (C.C.A.) 70 F. (2d) 619, 620. Regulations 74, art. 58, supra. The point to be considered is whether, the taxpayer having failed to establish the correct amount to be assigned to the preferred stock as its costs to him, the court erred in reversing and remanding for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion.\n The Commissioner does not contend that, in cases where Circuit Courts of Appeals properly reverse determinations of the Board, they are without power to remand for further hearing in the nature of a new trial. \n3\n His contention is that in this case the burden on the taxpayer was not only to prove that the Commissioner's determination is erroneous, but to show the correct amount of the tax. In substance he says that, because of the taxpayer's failure to establish facts on which a fair apportionment may be made, the Board's redetermination at the Commissioner's erroneous figure was valid, and, there being no error of law, should have been sustained by the court. And he maintains that, in the absence of error on the part of the Board, the court was without power to remand for further hearing.\n He cites Revenue Act of 1926,  274(e), 44 Stat. 56 (26 USCA  1048c): 'The board shall have jurisdiction to redetermine the correct amount of the deficiency even if the amount so redetermined is greater than the amount of the deficiency, \n\n[293 U.S. 507, 513]\n\u00a0\n notice of which has been mailed to the taxpayer, and to determine whether any penalty, additional amount or addition to the tax should be assessed, if claim therefor is asserted by the commissioner at or before the hearing or a rehearing.' The purpose of that provision is to define the jurisdiction granted to the Board; it does not prescribe any rule of evidence or burden of proof. Plainly it does not support the Commissioner's contention that the taxpayer, even though he has shown the determination to be arbitrary and excessive, must nevertheless pay the added tax because he has not also shown that he owes nothing or the correct amount, if any, that legally may be laid upon him.\n He also cites Revenue Act of 1928,  51(a) and 54(a), 45 Stat. 807, 808, 26 USCA  2051(a), 2054(a). Neither gives any support to his contention. The first requires the taxpayer to make under oath a return stating specifically the amount of his gross income and the amounts of deductions and credits allowed. The other requires the taxpayer to keep such records, render under oath such statements, make such returns, and comply with such rules and regulations as the Commissioner may prescribe. These requirements give no support to the Commissioner's contention. They tend rather to suggest that taxpayers' returns are correct and may not arbitrarily be set at naught.\n He also cites Rule 30 adopted by the Board: 'The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner, except as otherwise provided by statute and except that in respect of any new matter pleaded in his answer, it shall be upon the respondent.' But there is nothing in it to suggest intention to require the taxpayer to prove not only that a deficiency assessment laid upon him was arbitrary and wrong, but also to show the correct amount. Moreover, the Board held the evidence not sufficient to show the \n\n[293 U.S. 507, 514]\n\u00a0\n apportionment erroneous, and on that ground alone sustained the assessment. Necessarily the Board did not come to the question that is here presented as to burden of proof. The fact that the Commissioner's determination of a deficiency was arbitrarily made may reasonably be deemed sufficient to require the Board to set it aside. Cf. Appeal of Bruce & Human Drug Co., 1 B.T.A. 342; Appeal of Acorn Refining Co., 2 B.T.A. 253; Appeal of Index Notion Co., 3 B.T.A. 90.\n The Commissioner cites United States v. Rindskopf, \n105 U.S. 418\n; United States v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 422, 443\n, 46 S.Ct. 131; Reinecke v. Spalding, \n280 \nU.S. 227, 232\n, 233 S., 50 S.Ct. 96. The first of these may be put aside without discussion as having no bearing upon the point here in controversy. The other two were adequately distinguished by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Each was an action to recover taxes paid. Obviously the burden was on the plaintiff, in order to establish a basis for judgment in his favor, specifically to show not merely that the assessment was erroneous, but also the amount to which he was entitled. For like reason the burden is upon the taxpayer to establish the amount of a deduction claimed. Burnet v. Houston, \n283 \nU.S. 223, 227\n, 51 S.Ct. 413; Helvering v. Ind. Life Ins. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 371, 381\n, 54 S.Ct. 758; New Colonial Co. v. Helvering, \n292 \nU.S. 435, 440\n, 54 S.Ct. 788\n\n\n We find nothing in the statutes, the rules of the Board or our decisions that gives any support to the idea that the Commissioner's determination shown to be without rational foundation and excessive will be enforced unless the taxpayer proves he owes nothing or, if liable at all, shows the correct amount. While decisions of the lower courts may not be harmonious, our attention has not \n\n[293 U.S. 507, 515]\n\u00a0\n been called to any that persuasively supports the rule for which the Commissioner here contends. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Unquestionably the burden of proof is on the taxpayer to show that the Commissioner's determination is invalid. Lucas v. Structural Steel Co., \n281 \nU.S. 264, 271\n, 50 S.Ct. 263; Wickwire v. Reinecke, \n275 \nU.S. 101, 105\n, 48 S.Ct. 43; Welch v. Helvering, \n290 \nU.S. 111, 115\n, 54 S.Ct. 8. Frequently, if not quite generally, evidence adequate to overthrow the Commissioner's finding is also sufficient to show the correct amount, if any, that is due. See, e.g., Darcy v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 66 F. (2d) 581, 585. But, where as in this case, the taxpayer's evidence shows the Commissioner's determination to be arbitrary and excessive, it may not reasonably be held that he is bound to pay a tax that confessedly he does not owe, unless his evidence was sufficient also to establish the correct amount that lawfully might be charged against him. On the facts shown by the taxpayer in this case, the Board should have held the apportionment arbitrary and the Commissioner's determination invalid. Then, upon \n\n[293 U.S. 507, 516]\n\u00a0\n appropriate application that further hearing be had, it should have heard evidence to show whether a fair apportionment might be made and, if so, the correct amount of the tax. The rule for which the Commissioner here contends is not consonant with the great remedial purposes of the legislation creating the Board of Tax Appeals. \n5\n The Circuit Court of Appeals rightly reversed and remanded the case for further proceedings in accordance with its opinion.\nAFFIRMED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n Affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (dissenting).\n I think the judgment should be reversed.\n As respondent failed to establish any amount by which the deficiency fixed by the Commissioner should be reduced, the Board of Tax Appeals was without authority, under the statute defining its jurisdiction, to disturb the determination of the Commissioner, Revenue Act 1926, c. 27,  274(b)( e), 906(c)(d), 44 Stat. 9, 55, 56, 107, 26 U.S.C.  1048a, 1048c, 1217(c)( d), 26 USCA  1048a, 1048c, 1217 note. If, under section 906(d), it was the duty of the Board to dismiss the petition and enter on its records a finding that it could not determine the amount of the deficiency, these requirements are formal only. Its failure to comply with them does not require a reversal of its order sustaining the action of the Commissioner or in any case afford ground for decision on appeal that the Board should have held the Commissioner's determination invalid or that it should now take further evidence. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Sec. 111.

Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for p titioner.\n Mr. Samuel Seabury, of New York City, for respondents. \n\n[296 U.S. 387, 388]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These causes involved deficiency assessments for income tax against the three respondents for the year 1924\n\n\n They were the sole stockholders of United States Ferro Alloys Corporation, herein Ferro Alloys, and the causes, alike in all essential particulars, were dealt with below in one opinion.\n The respondents maintain that they exchanged all stock of Ferro Alloys for shares of Vanadium Corporation of America and bonds of Ferro Alloys guaranteed by Vanadium; that these two corporations were parties to a reorganization, and that under section 203(b)(2), Revenue Act 1924, 43 Stat. 256 (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note), no taxable gain resulted. The Commissioner insists that the transaction was a sale of all the stock of the Ferro Alloys, and therefore taxable gain resulted. The applicable statutory provision is section 203, Revenue Act 1924, the pertinent parts of which are in the margin of the opinion in Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co ., \n296 \nU.S. 378\n, 56 S.Ct. 269.\n In December, 1924, respondents owned all the stock of Ferro Alloys Corporation. They exchanged this with the Vanadium Corporation for stock of the latter valued at $30 per share and for $1,161,184.50 mortgage bonds of Ferro Alloys guaranteed by Vanadium. Ferro Alloys continued to conduct business until its dissolution in 1928. Article 1574 of Treasury Regulations 65 provided that under the Act of 1924 no gain or loss shall be recognized to the shareholders from the exchange of stock made in connection with the reorganization, if two or more corporations reorganize; for example, by either the sale of the stock of B to A, or the acquisition by A of a majority of the total number of shares of all other classes of stock of B. \n\n[296 U.S. 387, 389]\n\u00a0\n The transaction here involved is within the description of reorganization recognized by the Treasury Regulation above quoted. And if the regulation can be taken as properly interpreting the statute, the challenged judgment must be affirmed.\n The court below recites the history of the Treasury Regulation above quoted, and concludes that, in view of the re-enactment of the paragraph to which it refers without change, Congress intended to approve the regulation as written.\n The Commissioner here maintains that the definition of reorganization found in section 203(h)(1)(A), Revenue Act 1924, 43 Stat. 256 (26 U.S.C.A .  112 note), should be limited to transactions which partake of the nature of mergers or consolidations, and that here the Vanadium merely made an investment in Ferro Alloys stock and obtained only the rights of a stockholder therein. It is also urged that an exchange of stocks for bonds results in a substantial change of position and that such bonds are 'other property' within the meaning of the statute, and, as such, subject to tax. Much of the argument presented is the same as the one considered in the Minnesota Tea Company Case, and it need not be again followed in detail. The bonds, we think, were securities within the definition, and cannot be regarded as cash, as were the short-term notes referred to in Pinellas Ice & Cold Storage Co. v. Commissioner, \n287 \nU.S. 462\n, 53 S.Ct. 257.\n The judgment of the court below must be affirmed. \n\n\n\n","87":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHENRY L. DOHERTY & CO. v. GOODMAN(1935)\nNo. 469\nArgued: February 11, 1935Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 623, 624]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Frederick W. Lehmann, Jr., of Des Moines, Iowa, for appellant.\n Mr. Joseph I. Brody, of Des Moines, Iowa, for appellee.\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 623, 625]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In 1926, Henry L. Doherty, citizen of New York, trading as Henry L. Doherty & Co., established an office at Des Moines, Polk county, Iowa, and there through agents carried on the business of selling corporate securities throughout the state. E. A. King, designated as district manager, took charge of this office in January, 1929, and continued to direct its affairs during the time here important. Under him were clerks and stock salesmen, paid directly from New York.\n A salesman operating from the Des Moines office, September 1, 1929, negotiated in that city a sale of stock to appellee Goodman, and out of this the present controversy arose. The only power or authority expressly conferred upon King by Doherty was to sell securities and supervise other employees; he never in terms consented that service of process upon this agent should constitute service upon himself.\n Section 11079, Iowa Code 1927, also 1931, in effect since 1851, provides: 'When a corporation, company, or individual has, for the transaction of any business, an office or agency in any county other than that in which the principal resides, service may be made on any agent or clerk employed in such office or agency, in all actions growing out of or connected with the business of that office or agency.'\n July 31, 1931, appellee Goodman commenced an action against Doherty in the District Court, Polk county, wherein he sought only a personal judgment for damages arising out of the sale contract of September 1, 1929. The usual summons or notice commanding the defendant to appear was served upon district manager King.\n Doherty appeared specially. He challenged the jurisdiction of the court; claimed he had not been within the state; King had no authority to accept service of process \n\n[294 U.S. 623, 626]\n\u00a0\n in his behalf; the alleged service was ineffective; and that to hold otherwise would deprive him of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. The District Court, relying upon Code,  11079, overruled the special plea and held the service adequate. Doherty made no further appearance. Judgment against him was affirmed by the Supreme Court (255 N. W. 667).\n The cause is here by appeal. Appellant insists that, if construed as applicable to him, a citizen of another state never in Iowa, in the circumstances disclosed by the record, section 11079 offends the Federal Constitution, section 2, art. 4, and section 1, Fourteenth Amendment.\n The Supreme Court affirmed the action of the trial court upon authority of Davidson v. Henry L. Doherty & Co. (1932) 214 Iowa, 739, 241 N.W. 700, 701, 91 A.L.R. 1308. The opinion in that cause construed section 11079, and, among other things, said:\n'By its terms, and under our holding, the statute is applicable to residents of 'any other county' than that in which the principal resides, whether such county be situated in Iowa or in some other state. In other words, the statute does apply to nonresidents of Iowa who come within its terms and provisions, as well as to residents. Our construction of the statute has stood since 1887. ... We adhere to our former holdings that the statute is applicable to individual nonresidents who come within its express terms and provisions. ...\n\n'The statute in question does not in any manner abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the several states. It treats residents of Iowa exactly as it treats residents of all other states. The citizens of each state of the United States are, under this statute, entitled to all the privileges and immunities accorded citizens of this state.\n\n'The justice of such a statute is obviojs. It places no greater or different burden upon the nonresident than \n\n[294 U.S. 623, 627]\n\u00a0\n upon the resident of this state. ... A nonresident who gets all the benefit of the protection of the laws of this state with regard to the office or agency and the business so transacted ought to be amenable to the laws of the state as to transactions growing out of such business upon the same basis and conditions as govern residents of this state. ... 'It makes no hostile discrimination against nonresidents, but tends to put them on the same footing as residents.' ...\n\n'Four things are under this statute essential to the validity of such service. The defendant must: (1) Have an office or agency in the county. ( 2) A county other than that in which he resides. (3) The action must grow out of or be connected with the business of that office or agency. (4) The agent or clerk upon whom service is made must be employed in such office or agency. ...\n\n'When a nonresident defendant establishes an office or agency for the transaction of business in any county in this state under this statute, he thereby voluntarily appoints his own agent, in charge of said office or agency, as one upon whom substituted service in actions in personam, growing out of that office or agency, may be made. ... 'Under our statute, the implied consent to be sued in this state is limited to proceedings growing out of the business transacted through the office or agency in this state.' It is required that the agent shall actually receive a copy of the notice of suit and that it shall be read to him . ... The action must grow out of the business of that very agency. Ample time is given the defendant to appear and defend; there is not only 'reasonable probability,' but practical moral certainty, that the defendant will receive actual notice of the pendency of the action.'\n\n Iowa treats the business of dealing in corporate securities as exceptional, and subjects it to special regulation. Laws 1913, c. 137; Laws 1921, c. 189; Laws 1929, c. 10, approved Mar. 19, 1929. The last- cited act requires reg- \n\n[294 U.S. 623, 628]\n\u00a0\n istration and written consent for service of process upon the secretary of state. See Merrick v. N. W. Halsey & Co., \n242 \nU.S. 568\n, 37 S.Ct. 227. Doherty voluntarily established an office in Iowa and there carried on this business. Considering this fact, and accepting the construction given to section 11079, we think to apply it as here proposed will not deprive him of any right guaranteed by the Federal Constitution.\n Flexner v. Farson, \n248 \nU.S. 289\n, 39 S.Ct. 97, much relied upon, does not sustain appellant's position. There the service was made upon one not then agent for the defendants; here the situation is different. King was manager of the appellant's office when the sale contract was made; also when process was served upon him. Moreover, under the laws of Iowa, neither her citizens nor nonresidents could freely engage in the business of selling securities.\n The power of the states to impose terms upon nonresidents, as to activities within their borders, recently has been much discussed. Hess v. Pawloski, \n274 \nU.S. 352\n, 47 S.Ct. 632; Wuchter v. Pizzutti, \n276 \nU.S. 13\n, 48 S.Ct. 259, 260, 57 A.L.R. 1230; Young v. Masci, \n289 \nU.S. 253\n, 53 S.Ct. 599, 88 A.L.R. 170. Under these opinions it is established doctrine that a state may rightly direct that nonresidents who operate automobiles on her highways shall be deemed to have appointed the secretary of state as agent to accept service of process, provided there is some 'provision making it reasonably probable that notice of the service on the secretary will be communicated to the nonresident defendant who is sued.'\n So far as it affects appellant, the questioned statute goes no farther than the principle approved by those opinions permits. Only rights claimed upon the present record are determined. The limitations of section 11079 under different circumstances we do not consider.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","88":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHERNDON v.

Walter Le Craw, of Atlanta, Ga., for the State of Georgia.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment upon conviction by a jury in a Georgia court of first instance of an attempt to incite insurrection by endeavoring to induce others to join in combined resistance to the authority of the state to be accomplished by acts of violence, in violation of section 56 of the Penal Code of Georgia. \n1\n The supreme court of the state affirmed the judgment. 178 Ga. 832, 174 S.E. 597, rehearing denied, 179 Ga. 597, 176 S.E. 620, 622. On this appeal, the statute is assailed as contravening the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in certain designated particulars. We find it unnecessary to review the points made, since this court is without jurisdiction for the reason that no federal question was seasonably raised in the court below or passed upon by that court.\n It is true that there was a preliminary attack upon the indictment in the trial court on the ground, among others, that the statute was in violation 'of the Constitution of \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 443]\n\u00a0\n the United States,' and that this contention was overruled. But, in addition to the insufficiency of the specification,2 the adverse action of the trial court was not preserved by exceptions pendente lite or assigned as error in due time in the bill of exceptions, as the settled rules of the state practice require. In that situation, the state supreme court declined to review any of the rulings of the trial court in respect of that and other preliminary issues; and this determination of the state court is conclusive here.

McGrew, \n188 \nU.S. 291, 308\n, 23 S.Ct. 375.\n The federal question was never properly presented to the state supreme court unless upon motion for rehearing; and that court then refused to consider it. The long-established general rule is that the attempt, to raise a federal question after judgment, upon a petition for rehearing, comes too late, unless the court actually entertains the question and decides it. Texas, etc., R. Co. v. Southern Pacific Co., \n137 \nU.S. 48, 54\n, 11 S.Ct. 10; Loeber v. Schroeder, \n149 \nU.S. 580, 585\n, 13 S.Ct. 934; Godchaux Co. v.

There is no doubt that the federal claim was timely if the ruling of the state court could not have been anticipated and a petition for rehearing presented the first opportunity for raising it. Saunders v. Shaw, \n244 \nU.S. 317, 320\n, 37 S.Ct. 638; Ohio v. Akron Park District, \n281 \nU.S. 74, 79\n, 50 S.Ct. 228, 66 A.L.R. 1460; Missouri v.

The whole point, therefore, is whether the ruling here assailed should have been anticipated.\n The trial court instructed the jury that the evidence would not be sufficient to convict the defendant if it did not indicate that his advocacy would be acted upon immediately; and that: 'In order to convict the defendant, ... it must appear clearly by the evidence that immediate serious violence against the State of Georgia was to be expected or was advocated.' Petitioner urges that the question presented to the state supreme court was whether the evidence made out a violation of the statute as thus construed by the trial court, while the supreme court construed the statute (178 Ga. 832, page 855, 174 S.E. 597, 610) as not requiring that an insurrection should follow instantly or at any given time, but that 'it would be sufficient that he (the defendant) intended it to happen at any time, as a result of his influence, by those whom he sought to incite,' and upon that construction determined the sufficiency of the evidence against the defendant. If that were all, the petitioner's contention that the federal question was raised at the earliest opportunity well might be sustained; but it is not all.\n The verdict of the jury was returned on January 18, 1933, and judgment immediately followed. On July 5, 1933, the trial court overruled a motion for new trial. The original opinion was handed down and the judgment of \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 445]\n\u00a0\n the state supreme court entered May 24, 1934, the case having been in that court since the preceding July.\n On March 18, 1933, several months prior to the action of the trial court on the motion for new trial, the state supreme court had decided Carr v. State, 176 Ga. 747, 169, S.E. 201. In that case section 56 of the Penal Code, under which it arose, was challenged as contravening the Fourteenth Amendment. The court in substance construed the statute as it did in the present case. In the course of the opinion it said (176 Ga. 747, page 750, 169 S.E. 201, 202): 'It (the state) cannot reasonably be required to defer the adoption of measures for its own peace and safety until the revolutionary utterances lead to actual disturbances of the public peace or imminent and immediate danger of its own destruction; but it may, in the exercise of its judgment, suppress the threatened danger in its incipiency. ... 'Manifestly, the legislature has authority to forbid the advocacy of a doctrine designed and intended to overthrow the government, without waiting until there is a present and imminent danger of the success of the plan advocated. If the State were compelled to wait until the apprehended danger became certain, then its right to protect itself would come into being simultaneously with the overthrow of the government, when there would be neither prosecuting officers nor courts for the enforcement of the law.\"\n The language contained in the subquotation is taken from People v. Lloyd, 304 Ill. 23, 35, 136 N.E. 505, and is quoted with approval by this court in Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 669\n, 45 S.Ct. 625\n\n\n In the present case, following the language quoted at an earlier point in this opinion to the effect that it was sufficient if the defendant intended an insurrection to follow at any time, etc., the court below, in its original opinion (178 Ga. 832, 855, 174 S.E. 597, 610) added: 'It was the intention of this law to arrest at its incipiency any effort to overthrow the state \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 446]\n\u00a0\n government, where it takes the form of an actual attempt to incite others to insurrection.' The phrase 'at any time' is not found in the foregoing excerpt from the Carr Case, but it is there in effect, when the phrase is given the meaning disclosed by the context, as that meaning is pointed out by the court below in its opinion denying the motion for a rehearing (179 Ga. 597, 600, 176 S.E. 620, 622), when it said that the phrase was necessarily intended to mean within a reasonable time-'that is, within such time as one's persuasion or other adopted means might reasonably be expected to be directly operative in causing an insurrection.'\n Appellant, of course, cannot plead ignorance of the ruling in the Carr Case, and was therefore bound to anticipate the probability of a similar ruling in his own case, and preserve his right to a review here by appropriate action upon the original hearing in the court below. It follows that his contention that he raised the federal question at the first opportunity is without substance, and the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO.\n The appellant has been convicted of an attempt to incite insurrection in violation of section 56 of the Penal Code of Georgia. He has been convicted after a charge by the trial court that to incur a verdict of guilty he must have advocated violence with the intent that his advocacy should be acted on immediately and with reasonable grounds for the expectation that the intent would be fulfilled. The appellant did not contend then, nor does he contend now, that a statute so restricted would involve an unconstitutional impairment of freedom of speech. However, upon appeal from the judgment of conviction the supreme court of Georgia repudiated the construction adopted at the trial and substituted another. Promptly thereafter the appellant moved for a rehearing upon the ground that the substituted meaning made the \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 447]\n\u00a0\n statute unconstitutional, and in connection with that motion invoked the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. A rehearing was denied with an opinion which again construed the statute and again rejected the construction accepted in the court below. Now in this court the appellant renews his complaint that the substituted meaning makes the statute void. By the judgment just announced the court declines to hear him. It finds that he was tardy in asserting his privileges and immunities under the Constitution of the United States, and disclaiming jurisdiction dismisses his appeal.\n I hold the view that the protection of the Constitution was seasonably invoked and that the court should proceed to an adjudication of the merits. Where the merits lie I do not now consider, for in the view of the majority the merits are irrelevant. My protest is confined to the disclaimer of jurisdiction. The settled doctrine is that when a constitutional privilege or immunity has been denied for the first time by a ruling made upon appeal, a litigant thus surprised may challenge the unexpected ruling by a motion for rehearing, and the challenge will be timely. Missouri v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313, 320\n, 50 S.Ct. 326; Brinkerhoff-Faris Trust & Savings Co. v. Hill, \n281 \nU.S. 673, 678\n, 50 S.Ct. 451; American Surety Co. v. Baldwin, \n287 \nU.S. 156, 164\n, 53 S.Ct. 98, 86 A.L.R. 298; Great Northern R. Co. v. Sunburst Oil & Refining Co., \n287 \nU.S. 358, 367\n, 53 S.Ct. 145, 85 A.L. R. 254; Saunders v. Shaw, \n244 \nU.S. 317, 320\n, 37 S.Ct. 638. Within that settled doctrine the cause is rightly here.\n Though the merits are now irrelevant, the controversy must be so far explained as to show how a federal question has come into the record. The appellant insists that words do not amount to an incitement to revolution, or to an attempt at such incitement, unless they are of such a nature and are used in such circumstances as to create 'a clear and present danger' ( Schenck v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 47, 52\n, 39 S.Ct. 247, 249) of bringing the prohibited result to pass. He insists that without this limitation a statute so lack- \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 448]\n\u00a0\n ing in precision as the one applied against him here is an unconstitutional restraint upon historic liberties of speech. For present purposes it is unimportant whether his argument be sound or shallow. At least it has color of support in words uttered from this bench, and uttered with intense conviction. Schenck v. United States, supra; cf. Whitney v. California, \n274 \nU.S. 357, 374\n, 375 S., 47 S.Ct. 641; Fiske v. Kansas, \n274 \nU.S. 380\n, 47 S.Ct. 655; Gitlow v. New York, \n268 \nU.S. 652, 672\n, 673 S., 45 S.Ct. 625; Schaefer v. United States, \n251 \nU.S. 466, 482\n, 40 S.Ct. 259. The court might be unwilling, if it were to pass to a decision of the merits, to fit the words so uttered within the framework of this case. What the appellant is now asking of us is an opportunity to be heard. That privilege is his unless he has thrown it away by silence and acquiescence when there was need of speech and protest.\n We are told by the state that the securities of the Constitution should have been invoked upon the trial. The presiding judge should have been warned that a refusal to accept the test of clear and present danger would be a rejection of the restraints of the Fourteenth Amendment. But the trial judge had not refused to accept the test proposed; on the contrary, he had accepted it and even gone a step beyond. In substance he had charged that even a present 'danger' would not suffice, if there was not also an expectation, and one grounded in reason, that the insurrection would begin at once. It is novel doctrine that a defendant who has had the benefit of all he asks, and indeed of a good deal more, must place a statement on the record that if some other court at some other time shall read the statute differently, there will be a denial of liberties that at the moment of the protest are unchallenged and intact. Defendants charged with crime are as slow as are men generally to borrow trouble of the future.\n We are told, however, that protest, even if unnecessary at the trial, should have been made by an assignment of \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 449]\n\u00a0\n error or in some other appropriate way in connection with the appeal, and this for the reason that by that time, if not before, the defendant was chargeable with knowledge as a result of two decisions of the highest court of Georgia that the statute was destined to be given another meaning. The decisions relied upon are Carr v. State (No. 1), 176 Ga. 55, 166 S.E. 827, 167 S.E. 103, and Carr v. State (No. 2), 176 Ga. 747, 169 S.E. 201. The first of these cases was decided in November, 1932, before the trial of the appellant, which occurred in January, 1933. The second was decided in March, 1933, after the appellant had been convicted, but before the denial or submission of his motion for a new trial. Neither is decisive of the question before us now.\n Carr v. State, No. 1, came up on demurrer to an indictment. The prosecution was under section 58 of the Penal Code, which makes it a crime to circulate revolutionary documents.* All that was held was that upon the face of the indictment there had been a wilful incitement to violence, sufficient, if proved, to constitute a crime. The opinion contains an extract covering about four pages from the opinion of this court in Gitlow v. New York, supra. Imbedded in that long quotation are the words now pointed to by the state as decisive of the case at hand. They are the words of Sanford, J., writing for this court. \n268 U.S. 652\n, at page 669, 45 S.Ct. 625, 631. 'The immediate danger is none the less real and substantial, because the effect of a given utterance \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 450]\n\u00a0\n cannot be accurately foreseen.' A state 'cannot reasonably be required to defer the adoption of measures for its own peace and safety until the revolutionary utterances lead to actual disturbances of the public peace or imminent and immediate danger of its own destruction; but it may, in the exercise of its judgment, suppress the threatened danger in its incipiency.'\n To learn the meaning of these words in their application to the Georgia statute we must read them in their setting. Sanford, J., had pointed out that the statute then before him, the New York criminal anarchy act, forbade the teaching and propagation by spoken word or writing of a particular form of doctrine, carefully defined and after such definition denounced on reasonable grounds as fraught with peril to the state. There had been a determination by the state through its legislative body that such utterances 'are so inimical to the general welfare and involve such danger of substantive evil that they may be penalized in the exercise of its police power.' \n268 U.S. 652\n, at page 668, 45 S.Ct. 625, 631. In such circumstances 'the question whether any specific utterance coming within the prohibited class is likely, in and of itself, to bring about the substantive evil, is not open to consideration. It is sufficient that the statute itself be constitutional and that the use of the language comes within its prohibition.' \n268 \nU.S. 652, 670\n, 45 S. Ct. 625, 631. In effect the words had been placed upon an expurgatory index. At the same time the distinction was sharply drawn between statutes condemning utterances identified by a description of their meaning and statutes condemning them by reference to the results that they are likely to induce. 'It is clear that the question in such cases (i.e. where stated doctrines are denounced) is entitrely different from that involved in those cases where the statute merely prohibits certain acts involving the danger of substantive evil, without any reference to \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 451]\n\u00a0\n language itself, and it is sought to apply its provisions to language used by the defendant for the purpose of bringing about the prohibited results.' \n268 U.S. 652\n, pages 670, 671, 45 S.Ct. 625, 631. Cf. Whitney v. California, supra; Fiske v. Kansas, supra.\n The effect of all this was to leave the question open whether in cases of the second class, in cases, that is to say, where the unlawful qualify of words is to be determined not upon their face but in relation to their consequences, the opinion in Schenck v. United States, supplies the operative rule. The conduct charged to this appellant-in substance an attempt to enlarge the membership of the Communist party in the city of Atlanta-falls, it will be assumed, within the second of these groupings, but plainly is outside the first. There is no reason to believe that the Supreme Court of Georgia, when it quoted from the opinion in Gitlow's case, rejected the restraints which the author of that opinion had placed upon his words. For the decision of the case before it there was no need to go so far. Circulation of documents with intent to incite to revolution had been charged in an indictment. The state had the power to punish such an act as criminal, or so the court had held. How close the nexus would have to be between the attempt and its projected consequences was matter for the trial.\n Carr v. State, No. 2, like the case under review, was a prosecution under Penal Code,  56 (not  58), and like Carr v. State, No. 1, came up on demurrer. All that the court held was that when attacked by demurrer the indictment would stand. This appears from the headnote, drafted by the court itself. After referring to this deadnote, the court states that it may be 'useful and salutary' to repeat what it had written in Carr v. State, No. 1. Thereupon it quotes copiously from its opinion in that case including the bulk of the same extracts from Gitlow v. New York. The extracts show upon their face that \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 452]\n\u00a0\n they have in view a statute denouncing a particular doctrine and prohibiting attempts to teach it. They give no test of the bond of union between an idea and an event.\n What has been said as to the significance of the opinions in the two cases against Carr has confirmation in what happened when appellant was brought to trial. The judge who presided at that trial had the first of those opinions before him when he charged the jury, or so we may assume. He did not read it as taking from the state the burden of establishing a clear and present danger that insurrection would ensue as a result of the defendant's conduct. This is obvious from the fact that in his charge he laid that very burden on the state with emphasis and clarity. True, he did not have before him the opinion in prosecution No. 2, for it had not yet been handed down, but if he had seen it, he could not have gathered from its quotation of the earlier case that it was announcing novel doctrine.\n From all this it results that Herndon, this appellant, came into the highest court of Georgia without notice that the statute defining his offense was to be given a new meaning. There had been no rejection, certainly no unequivocal rejection, of the doctrine of Schenck v. United States, which had been made the law of the case by the judge presiding at his trial. For all that the record tells us, the prosecuting officer acquiesced in the charge, and did not ask the appellate court to apply a different test. In such a situation the appellant might plant himself as he did on the position that on the case given to the jury his guilt had not been proved. He was not under a duty to put before his judges the possibility of a definition less favorable to himself, and make an argument against it, when there had been no threat of any change, still less any forecast of its form or measure. He might wait until the law of the case had been rejected by the reviewing court before insisting that the effect would be an invasion \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 453]\n\u00a0\n of his constitutional immunities. If invasion should occur, a motion for rehearing diligently pressed thereafter would be seasonable notice. This is the doctrine of Missouri v. Gehner and Brinkerhoff-Faris Co. v. Hill. It is the doctrine that must prevail if the great securities of the Constitution are not to be lost in a web of procedural entanglements.\n New strength is given to considerations such as these when one passes to a closer view of just what the Georgia court did in its definition of the statute. We have heard that the meaning had been fixed by what had been held already in Carr v. State, and that thereby the imminence of the danger had been shown to be unrelated to innocence or guilt. But if that is the teaching of those cases, it was discarded by the very judgment now subjected to review. True, the Georgia court, by its first opinion in the case at hand, did prescribe a test that, if accepted, would bar the consideration of proximity in time. 'It is immaterial whether the authority of the state was in danger of being subverted or that an insurrection actually occurred or was impending.' 'Force must have been contemplated, but ... the statute does not include either its occurrence or its imminence as an ingredient of the particular offense charged.' It would not be 'necessary to guilt that the alleged offender should have intended that an insurrection should follow instantly or at any given time, but it would be sufficient that he intended it to happen at any time, as a result of his influence, by those whom he sought to incite.' On the motion for a rehearing the Georgia court repelled with a little heat the argument of counsel that these words were to be taken literally, without 'the usual reasonable implications.' 'The phrase 'at any time' as criticized in the motion for rehearing was not intended to mean at any time in the indefinite future, or at any possible later time, however remote.' 'On the contrary, the phrase 'at any time' was necessarily intended, and should \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 454]\n\u00a0\n have been understood, to mean within a reasonable time; that is, within such time as one's persuasion or other adopted means might reasonably be expected to be directly operative in causing an insurrection.' 'Under the statute as thus interpreted, we say, as before, that the evidence was sufficient to authorize the conviction.'\n Here is an unequivocal rejection of the test of clear and present danger, yet a denial also of responsibility without boundaries in time. True, in this rejection, the court disclaimed a willingness to pass upon the question as one of constitutional law, assigning as a reason that no appeal to the Constitution had been made upon the trial or then considered by the judge. Brown v. State, 114 Ga. 60, 29 S.E. 873; Loftin v. Southern Security Co., 162 Ga. 730, 134 S.E. 760; Dunaway v. Gore, 164 Ga. 219, 230, 138 S.E. 213. Such a rule of state practice may have the effect of attaching a corresponding limitation to the jurisdiction of this court where fault can fairly be imputed to an appellant for the omission to present the question sooner. Erie R. Co. v. Purdy, \n185 \nU.S. 148\n, 22 S.Ct. 605; Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Woodford, \n234 \nU.S. 46, 51\n, 34 S.Ct. 739. No such consequence can follow where the ruling of the trial judge has put the Constitution out of the case and made an appeal to its provisions impertinent and futile. Cf. Missouri v. Gehner, supra; Rogers v. Alabama, \n192 \nU.S. 226, 230\n, 24 S.Ct. 257. In such circumstances, the power does not reside in a state by any rule of local practice to restrict the jurisdiction of this court in the determination of a constitutional question brought into the case thereafter. Davis v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 44 S.Ct. 13. If the rejection of the test of clear and present danger was a denial of fundamental liberties, the path is clear for us to say so.\n What was brought into the case upon the motion for rehearing was a standard wholly novel, the expectancy of life to be ascribed to the persuasive power of an idea. The defendant had no opportunity in the state court to \n\n[295 U.S. 441, 455]\n\u00a0\n prepare his argument accordingly. He had no opportunity to argue from the record that guilt was not a reasonable inference, or one permitted by the Constituted, on the basis of that test any more than on the basis of others discarded as unfitting. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, supra. The argument thus shut out is submitted to us now. Will men 'judging in calmness' ( Brandeis, J., in Schaefer v. United States, supra, \n251 U.S. 466\n, at page 483, 40 S.Ct. 259, 265) say of the defendant's conduct as shown forth in the pages of this record that it was an attempt to stir up revolution through the power of his persuasion and within the time when that persuasion might be expected to endure? If men so judging will say yes, will the Constitution of the United States uphold a reading of the statute that will lead to that response? Those are the questions that the defendant lays before us after conviction of a crime punishable by death in the discretion of the jury. I think he should receive an answer.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] ' 56.

MARTIN(1935)\nNo. 193\nArgued: Decided: December 16, 1935\n\n\n\n Appeals from the District Court of the United States for the District of New Jersey. \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 394]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Wm. A. Schnader, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellants.\n Messrs. Duane E. Minard and Geo. S. Hobart, both of Newark, N.J., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These suits were brought, on April 1, 1935, under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.A.  380), to enjoin the collection of an inheritance tax in the sum of $12,247,333.52, assessed by New Jersey upon the estate of John T. Dorrance, which was valued at more than $115,000,000. The bills charge that its Transfer Inheritance Tax Act, as construed and applied, violates the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution (art. 4,  1) and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The defendants are the State Tax Commissioner and other New Jersey officials. \n1\n In No. 193, the plaintiff is a daughter of the decedent and a beneficiary under his will. In No. 194, his executors are the plaintiffs. A temporary restraining order issued. An appli- \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 395]\n\u00a0\n cation was made for an interlocutory injunction; answers were filed; and the case was heard before three judges upon an elaborate record. But the injunction was denied for want of jurisdiction upon the allegations of the bill, because of the prohibition contained in section 265 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.A.  379).2 Dorrance v. Martin (D.C.) 12 F.Supp. 746. The cases are here on appeal.\n The material allegations are substantially the same in the two suits: Dorrance died on September 21, 1930, at his residence in Cinnaminson, Burlington county, N.J., leaving a will in which he named his wife, two brothers, and the Camden Trust Company executors. On October 2, 1930, his will was, upon petition of the executors, admitted to probate in the Orphans' Court of that county; letters testamentary issued; and the executors have administered the estate ever since under the jurisdiction of that court. Their petition for probate, like the will, had recited that Dorrance's domicil was in New Jersey. On April 6, 1931, they filed with the Inheritance Tax Bureau of New Jersey their return as a basis for the assessment of the inheritance tax. The estate consisted almost wholly of bonds, stocks, and other evidence of title to intangible personal property; and these were then, and still are located in New Jersey. On October 17, 1931, the Tax Commissioner, finding, upon evidence presented by the executors, that Dorrance was at the time of his death domiciled in New Jersey, assessed the amount stated as the tax on direct transfers payable under the New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Act of April 20, 1909, c. 228, as amended (4 Comp.St.N.J. 1910, p. 5301 et seq.,  537 et seq., Comp. St.Supps.N.J. 1924, 1930, and N.J.St.Annual 1931,  208-537 et seq.).\n On December 12, 1931, the assessment so made was, upon request to the executors, opened for the purpose of \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 396]\n\u00a0\n enabling them to submit additional information concerning the decedent's dom cil; and, introducing in evidence the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania hereafter referred to, first rendered September 26, 1932, they claimed that Dorrance was, or must be deemed to have been, domiciled in Pennsylvania, in view of that judgment and other evidence. On October 10, 1932, the New Jersey Tax Commissioner again assessed upon the estate the tax of $12,247,333.52. The executors appealed to the Prerogative Court, which, by final decree entered May 11, 1934, affirmed the assessment, subject to a modification not here material. In re Dorrance's Estate, 115 N.J.Eq. 268, 170 A. 601; Id., 116 N.J.Eq. 204, 172 A. 503. The executors procured, by writ of certiorari, a review of the assessment by the New Jersey Supreme Court. On February 8, 1935, that court affirmed the decree of the Prerogative Court and dismissed the writ of certiorari with costs. Dorrance v. Martin, 176 A. 902, 13 N.J.Misc. 168. On February 13, 1935, the executors notified the defendant Martin that they intended to take an appeal to the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals. They have not done so; but under the state practice an appeal may be taken at any time prior to February 11, 1936.3\n Dorrance had a residence also in Pennsylvania. That state claimed that he was domiciled there at the time of his death; and promptly commenced proceedings to subject his estate, including the intangible property, to the Pennsylvania inheritance tax. In March, 1933, it recovered in its Supreme Court a final judgment against the executors which, adjudging that Dorrance's domicil was at the time of his death in Pennsylvania, imposed an inheritance tax upon the intangible property, as well as upon the real estate and tangible personal property situ- \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 397]\n\u00a0\n ated there. In re Dorrance's Estate, 309 Pa. 151, 163 A. 303. No question under the Federal Constitution was presented. Certiorari was denied by this Court, Dorrance v. Pennsylvania, \n287 \nU.S. 660\n, 53 S.Ct. 222; Id., \n288 \nU.S. 617\n, 53 S.Ct. 507. In satisfaction of the judgment, the executors paid to Pennsylvania $14,394,698.88, and $104,278. 03 as interest thereon; and they also gave a bond in the sum of $4,000,000 to pay additional amounts, if upon final determination of the federal estate tax they should appear to be due.\n In the suits at bar, the plaintiffs insist that the Pennsylvania judgment was in rem and bond New Jersey and the defendants although they were not parties to that litigation; that the New Jersey courts and administrative authorities, in refusing to give effect to the Pennsylvania judgment holding that Dorrance was domiciled in the latter state, violated the full faith and credit clause of the Federal Constitution; and that if they construed the New Jersey Transfer Inheritance Tax Act as applying to intangible property the situs of which was outside New Jersey, they violated the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. The plaintiffs contend further that if the Pennsylvania judgment is not in rem, the federal court is now free to ascertain the facts as to domicil and reach its conclusion independently of the prior decisions of the courts of the two states; and that the evidence introduced below establishes that Dorrance's domicil was in Pennsylvania.\n The plaintiffs claim that the District Court erred in holding that section 265 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.A.  379) prevents the federal court from granting the injunctions prayed for, since at the time of the institution of these suits in the federal court the proceedings in New Jersey had not passed into the judicial stage; and since, in any case, an independent judicial proceeding was necessary to collect the tax. The defendants concede that section 265 would not bar federal courts from staying collection of the tax if the state pro- \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 398]\n\u00a0\n ceedings had not passed from the administrative into the judicial stage. See City Bank armers' Trust Co. v. Schnader, \n291 \nU.S. 24\n, 54 S.Ct. 259; Id., \n293 \nU.S. 112\n, 55 S.Ct. 29. But they assert that the proceedings in the Supreme Court of New Jersey reviewing by certiorari the final decree of the Prerogative Court (itself a judicial tribunal) were proceedings judicial in their nature; and that the stay sought is of proceedings pending in a court of New Jersey. The defendants contend also that the judgment of the New Jersey Supreme Court to which the executors were parties is res judicata as to the domicile of the deceased and as to the liability of the estate for the taxes assessed by New Jersey; and they set up other reasons why the relief prayed should be denied. We have no occasion to consider any of these defenses, since we agree with the District Court that it was without jurisdiction to grant the injunction.\n First. To determine whether a judicial proceeding was pending when these suits were brought, we turn to the law of New Jersey. The proceedings, administrative and judicial, governing the assessment and the collection of its inheritance tax are, in substance, these: The assessment is made by the State Tax Commissioner, his duty being to 'assess and fix the cash value of such estate and levy the tax to which the same is liable.' He performs this duty after receiving the report of an appraiser appointed by him. The appraiser makes the appraisal and essential findings after notice to the interested parties and hearing evidence and argument. \n4\n Any person dissatisfied with the appraisal or the assessment may appeal therefrom to the 'Ordinary,' that is, the Prerogative Court. Bugbee v. Van Cleve, 99 N.J.Eq. 825, 834, 134 A. 646. Upon that court is conferred jurisdiction 'to hear and determine all questions in relation to any tax levied under the \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 399]\n\u00a0\n provisions of' the act. \n5\n The decree of the Prerogative Court is reviewable on writ of certiorari by the New Jersey Supreme Court;6 and its judgment is reviewable by the Court of Errors and Appeals. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n As to the collection of the tax, section 21 of the Transfer Inheritance Tax Act provides that 'if it shall appear to the State Tax Commissioner that any tax ... has not been paid according to law,' he shall report such fact to the register of the Prerogative Court, who must issue a citation citing the interested paties to 'show cause why such tax should not be paid.' \n8\n The Attorney General, if he has probable cause to believe that a tax is due and unpaid, and is so notified by the commissioner, shall prosecute the proceeding before the Prerogative Court. 9 The service of the citation, and subsequent proceedings thereon, shall conform to the practice prevailing in the Prerogative Court, including the power to commit for contempt. \n10\n Such proceedings would be the same in character whether the review of the original assessment had ended with the appeal to the Prerogative Court, or had been followed by certiorari to the Supreme Court; and whether or not an appeal was taken from the judgment of the Supreme Court to the Court of Errors and Appeals. Upon the making by the Prerogative Court of any decree, a copy thereof filed by the commissioner with the clerk of the Supreme Court has the same effect as a judgment at law, and execution may issue thereon. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[296 U.S. 393, 400]\n\u00a0\n Thence forward, collection is pursued as prescribed for civil judgments in 'an Act respecting executions.' 2 Comp.Stats. of N.J. of 1910, p. 2243 et seq.,  1 et seq. Paragraph Fifth of section 1 of the Inheritance Tax Act as amended (4 Comp.St.N.J. 1910, p. 5301,  537, par. 5 and Comp.St.Supp. 1924,  208-537, par. 5) provides hat under certain conditions executors ( and others) 'shall be personally liable for any and all such taxes until the same sahll have been paid as hereinafter directed, for which an action of debt shall lie in the name of the State of New Jersey.'\n Second. The Supreme Court's review of the administrative act of assessing was judicial action. It is a court created by the Constitution; and its jurisdiction to review, on certiorari, proceedings of inferior tribunals is an inheritance from the Court of Kings Bench. The Supreme Court has broad powers. It may, as recited in the New Jersey Certiorari Act of 1903, as amended (1 Comp.St.N.J. 1910, p. 402 et seq.,  1 et seq., Comp.St.Supps.N.J. 1924, 1930,  32-14), 'determine disputed questions of fact, as well as of law'; and when inquiring into the facts, is not limited to the evidence introduced before the tribunal whose proceeding is under review. It may act 'by depositions taken on notice, or in such other manner as is according to the practice of the court'; and it 'may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, such tax or assessment.' \n12\n Power to review the facts is conferred in New Jersey not only upon the Supreme Court but also upon its highest appellate tribunal-the Court of Errors and Appeals. Power, upon inquiry into the facts, to take evidence additional to that introduced before the tribunal whose action is under review is a power not uncommonly possessed by appellate \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 401]\n\u00a0\n courts in proceedings strictly judicial. The power to 'reverse or affirm, in whole or in part' does not imply that the court may exercise administrative discretion. Such power is a common incident of the judicial review of taxation. As the administrative proceeding of assessing the tax had ended when the Supreme Court granted its writ of certiorari, we have no occasion, in this connection, to enquire whether it had not already ended when the appeal to the Prerogative Court was allowed.\n Third. The plaintiffs contend that even if the action of the Supreme Court was judicial, the federal court had jurisdiction of this controversy because the judgment of the New Jersey courts was limited to a review of the assessment; that in order to collect the tax-to translate the assessment into an enforceable judgment-the state officials must institute a new and independent action, namely either an action for debt in the name of the state or a statutory proceeding against the persons interested in the estate; and that since no such action or proceeding had been taken at the time when these suits were filed, there is here no application to 'stay proceedings in any court of' New Jersey. That is, the plaintiffs contend that the determination of the amount and validity of the tax is to be treated as an isolated and distinct proceeding, not as a step in the process of determining and collecting the tax imposed.\n It is true that if the executors fail to pay the tax adjudged to be due, New Jersey must take further proceeding to compel the executors to discharge their obligation. This is so even if the executors do not avail themselves of heir existing right to appeal to the Court of Errors and Appeals, or if upon such appeal that court affirms the judgment of the Supreme Court. But it is not true that such further proceeding would be, in legal contemplation, independent action. Upon dismissal of the certiorari, the \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 402]\n\u00a0\n cause was remanded to the Prerogative Court. By the appeal of the executors, it had acquired jurisdiction not only to determine the tax due, but to take appropriate proceedings for its collection. Its jurisdiction continues until its decree is satisfied.\n The further proceedings required to compel satisfaction of the decree establishing liability for the tax do not differ in essence from those required to satisfy any judgment for a debt recovered at law or any decree in chancery for the payment of money. The procedure of the Prerogative Court subsequent to a decree follows that of the equity courts, which had, ordinarily, no power to enforce their decrees except by citation for contempt. \n13\n Chapter 148 of the laws of 1900, which provides, as a means of collection, that the Prerogative Court shall issue a citation if it appears that a tax found to be due has not been paid, is declaratory of the existing procedure. \n14\n Section 21 of the Transfer Inheritance Tax Act provides that the lien created by docketing a decree 'shall have the same effect \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 403]\n\u00a0\n as a lien by judgment, and execution shall issue thereon according to the rules and practice appertaining to other judgments.' \n15\n\u00a0\n\n Fourth. The prohibition of section 265 is against a stay of 'proceedings in any court of a State.' That term is comprehensive. It includes all steps taken or which may be taken in the state court or by its officers from the institution to the close of the final process. \n16\n It applies to appellate as well as to original proceedings; and is independent of the doctrine of res judicata. It applies alike to action by the court and by its ministerial officers; applies not only to an execution issued on a judgment,17 but to any proceeding supplemental or ancillary taken with a view to making the suit or judgment effective. \n18\n The prohibition is applicable whether such supplementary or ancillary proceeding is taken in the court which rendered the judgment or in some other. And it governs a privy to the state court proceeding-like Elinor Dorrance Hill-as well as the parties of record. Thus, the prohibition applies whatever the nature of the proceeding, unless the case presents facts which bring it within one of the recognized exceptions to section 265.19 It is not suggested that there is a basis here for any such exception.\n The conclusion reached by the lower court is consistent with City Bank Farmers' Trust Co. v. Schnader, 291 U.S. \n\n[296 U.S. 393, 404]\n\u00a0\n 24, 54 S.Ct. 259; and with all the other decisions of this Court distinguishing administrative from judicial proceedings to which the plaintiffs have called our attention; with the cases which hold that this Court lacks jurisdiction where the review sought is legislative or administrative in character; with those which hold that the lower court lacked jurisdiction because the plaintiff had not exhausted his administrative remedies; and with those which hold that the assessment of taxes is not an order within the meaning of section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C.A.  380).20\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] These are the state supervisor of the Inheritance Tax Bureau, the Comptroller of the State, the State Treasurer, and the Attorney General. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Section 265 provides: 'The writ of injunction shall not be granted by any court of the United States to stay proceedings in any court of a State, except in cases where such injunction may be authorized by any law relating to proceedings in bankruptcy.'

The complaint prayed for a decree annulling the proceedings whereby the state association had attempted to convert itself into a federal one, and compelling the directors and officers to continue the busi- \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 328]\n\u00a0\n ness in accordance with Wisconsin law or else to wind it up. The state court granted the decree upon grounds to be considered later. State ex rel. Cleary v. Hopkins Street B. & L. Ass'n, 217 Wis. 179, 257 N.W. 684.\n In Nos. 56 and 57, suits were brought by Wisconsin corporations, the Reliance Building & Loan Association (plaintiff in No. 56) and the Northern Building & Loan Association (plaintiff in No. 57) to restrain the banking commission and the supervisor of building and loan associations from interfering with the plaintiffs in the attempt to convert themselves into federal corporations. Decrees of the trial court in favor of the plaintiffs were reversed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin with directions to enter judgment in favor of the Commission. State ex rel. Cleary v. Hopkins Street B. & L. Ass'n, 217 Wis. 179, 257 N.W. 684.\n Building and loan associations organized in Wisconsin are subject to strict supervision by the administrative agencies of the state both in the course of doing business and in that of liquidation. They are quasi public corporations, chartered to encourage thrift and promote the ownership of homes, with powers and immunities peculiarly their own. See Wisconsin St. 1933, c. 215,  215.01 et seq.; cf. Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, \n277 \nU.S. 32, 40\n, 48 S.Ct. 423; United States v. Cambridge Loan & Building Co., \n278 \nU.S. 55, 57\n, 49 S.Ct. 39. 1 They may loan their moneys to members only. Wisconsin St. 1933,  215.07( 1). They must submit many of their proposed investments for the approval of the commissioner of \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 329]\n\u00a0\n banking. Section 215.07(6)(7)(8). They must conform to precise restrictions as to the quality of mortgages accepted as security for loans. Section 215.15;2 cf. section 215.01(10)(11). At the close of every year they must submit to the commissioner a report of their condition (section 215.31); and at all times they shall be subject to his control and supervision (section 215.31). If their business has been conducted in a manner contrary to law, or if their financial condition appears to be unsound, the commissioner may take charge of the business and liquidate the assets. Section 215.33. In recognition of their quasi public functions, they are given an exemption from income taxes payable by corporations generally. Section 71.05(d). Cf. United States v. Cambridge Loan & Building Co., supra. The statute contains provisions governing the consolidation of such associations and their voluntary dissolution. Corporations formed thereunder may consolidate with other building and loan associations located in the same county, but only with the consent of the commissioner of banking and that of two-thirds of the outstanding shares as well as the consent of a majority of the directors. Section 215. 335. A vote of approval by two-thirds of the outstanding shares is necessary also for voluntary dissolution. Section 215.36(1). With the consent of the commissioner an association formed under the act may become a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank, or a borrower therefrom. Section 215. 07(7)(8). Membership in such a bank grows out of a subscription to its shares, and has no effect upon the corporate life of the subscribing member. On the other hand, there is nothing in the statutes of Wisconsin whereby building and loan associations chartered in that state may be transmuted into associations chartered by the federal government. \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 330]\n\u00a0\n The petitioners insist that without the consent of Wisconsin the transmutation from a state into a federal association has become possible now by virtue of an Act of Congress. The act relied upon for that purpose is section 5 of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (48 Stat. 128, 132), as amended in April, 1934 (48 Stat. 643, 645, 646), and again in May, 1935 ( 49 Stat. 297), 12 U.S.C.  1464 (12 USCA  1464). By subdivision (a) of that section the Federal Home Loan Board is empowered to issue charters for the creation of Federal Savings and Loan Associations 'in which people may invest their funds and in order to provide for the financing of homes.' By subdivision (e), 'no charter shall be granted, except to persons of good character and responsibility,' nor unless in the judgment of the board the institution is likely to be successful and is necessary for the well-being of the community to be served. By other subdivisions (b, c, d, f, g, h, j, and k), the powers and duties of the associations are defined. Subdivision (i), the one that concerns us specially, permits state associations to be converted into federal ones. As amended in April, 1934, 12 USCA  1464(i), its provisions are as follows:\n'(i) Any member of a Federal Home Loan Bank may convert itself into a Federal savings and loan association under this Act upon a vote of 51 per centum or more of the votes cast at a legal meeting called to consider such action; but such conversion shall be subject to such rules and regulations as the Board may prescribe, and thereafter the converted association shall be entitled to all the benefits of this section and shall be subject to examination and regulation to the same extent as other associations incorporated pursuant to this Act (chapter).'3 \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 331]\n\u00a0\n The exchange of a state for a federal charter may be made under this section by any member of a Federal Home Loan Bank. To ascertain the limits of that membership, we turn to the 'Federal Home Loan Bank Act' of 1932, as amended from time to time. 47 Stat. 725, 48 Stat. 128, 643, 1246, 12 U. S.C. c. 11 (12 USCA  1421 et seq.); cf. 49 Stat. 297. We learn from that act that the term 'member' means any institution which has subscribed for the stock of a Federal Home Loan Bank (section 2(4), 12 USCA  1422(4), and that 'any building and loan association, savings and loan association, cooperative bank, homestead association, insurance company, or savings bank,' shall be eligible to become a member of a Federal Home Loan Bank, or a nonmember borrower from such a bank, upon compliance with conditions not important at this time (sections 4 and 5 (12 USCA  1424, 1425).\n\n Each of the three building and loan associations, the petitioners before us, was a member in good standing of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, Ill. After application in proper form, each received from the board permission to convert itself into a federal association under section 5(i) of the Federal Home Owners' Loan Act (12 USCA  1464(i). Each convened a meeting of its shareholders to consider such action and approve or disapprove it. At the meeting of the Hopkins Street Building & Loan Association, held on May 31, 1934, 5,973 shares were represented in person or by proxy. A resolution authorizing the change was unanimously adopted. Shares outstanding and not represented numbered 976. This association ( under the name of Hopkins Federal Savings & Loan Association) has received a charter from the board, under which it will act unless restrained. At the meeting of Reliance Building \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 332]\n\u00a0\n & Loan Association, held August 20, 1934, 7,286 shares were voted in favor of the change and 66 against it; shares outstanding and not represented numbered 3,533. At the meeting of Northern Building & Loan Association, held August 14, 1934, 23,291 shares were voted in favor of the change and 11 against it; shares outstanding and not represented numbered 12,006.\n The state of Wisconsin, acting through its banking commission, came forward at this point to check the process of conversion. It took the position (1) that section 5(i) of the Home Owners' Loan Act was subject to an implied condition whereby no conversion was to be permitted in contravention of local laws; and (2) that if this reading of the section were to be rejected as erroneous, the statute to that extent was void under the Tenth Amendment as an unconstitutional trespass upon the powers of the states. Other provisions of the Constitution, believed not to be material, were invoked at the same time.\n The Supreme Court of Wisconsin placed its decision upon the first of these positions to the exclusion of the other. It read the federal statute as subject to the implied condition contended for by the state officials. It did this to avoid embarrassing and doubtful questions of constitutional power, which it described without deciding. To determine the meaning and, if need be, the validity of an important federal statute writs of certiorari were granted by this court. \n4\n\u00a0\n295 \nU.S. 721\n, 55 S.Ct. 925\n\n\n First: Congress did not mean that the conversion from state associations into federal ones should be conditioned upon the consent of the state or compliance with its laws. \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 333]\n\u00a0\n Under section 5(i) as enacted in 1933, the argument could have been made with force that the laws of the state must be obeyed in the process of conversion. The provision then was, as we have already pointed out, that the association was to act 'upon a vote of its stockholders as provided by the law under which it operates.' But Congress would not leave it so. By an amendment of the statute, approved April 27, 1934 (12 USCA  1464(i), there was substituted a provision that conversion would be effective 'upon a vote of 51 per centum or more of the votes cast at a legal meeting called to consider such action.' Thus Congress erected a standard of its own, which was to be uniform in all the states irrespective of the local laws. A bare majority of the shares voted at a meeting was to be enough to give authority for fundamental changes of policy and power, no matter how many other shares were unrepresented at the meeting. We are unable to accede to the suggestion of the court below that the percentage was meant to be a minimum which the local laws might raise, though they were powerless to reduce it. Nothing in the wording of the statute gives support to that construction. On the contrary, comparison of the act as amended with the act as first adopted impels to the conclusion that Congress had in mind to take possession of the field to the exclusion of other occupants. Thereafter the procedure for conversion and the power to convert were to be governed by a uniform rule, irrespective of repugnant limitations prevailing in the states.\n Whatever doubt might exist as to the correctness of this view disappears when other and cognate statutes are subjected to our scrutiny.\n The National Banking Act of 1864 (13 Stat. 99, 112, 113 (See 12 USCA  1 et seq.)) gave permission to the banks incorporated in the states to become national associations upon the consent of the owners of two-thirds of the capital stock, the consent to be evidenced by an appropriate certificate. This \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 334]\n\u00a0\n court in Casey v. Galli, \n94 U.S. 673\n, decided in 1876, refused to read into the act a condition that the state as well as the stockholders must consent to the conversion, though no question of constitutional power was necessary to the decision, as will be shown later on. The statute as thus interpreted remained substantially unchanged until 1913, when the percentage was reduced from two-thirds to a majority, with the addition of a proviso 'that said conversion shall not be in contravention of the State law.' R.S.  5154, as amended by Act Dec. 23, 1913, 38 Stat. 258, 12 U.S.C.  35 (12 USCA  35). Cf. 12 U.S.C.  342 (12 USCA  342); Ex parte Worcester County National Bank, \n279 \nU.S. 347\n, 49 S. Ct. 368, 61 A.L.R. 987.5\n Again, in the Act of March 4, 1923, whereby agricultural or live stock financing corporations organized in the states were permitted to convert themselves into National Agricultural Credit Corporations, the permission was coupled with a similar proviso. 42 Stat. 1454, 1469; 12 U.S. C.  1281 (12 USCA  1281).\n Congress had no difficulty in finding fit and simple phrases for the expression of its will when power was to be conditioned upon the approval of the states. Cf. Westfall v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 256, 259\n, 47 S.Ct. 629. The form chosen by its draftsman for the statute here involved takes on a new significance when read in the revealing light of the forms that were rejected.\n We think the light is so strong as to flood whatever places in the statute might otherwise be dark. Courts have striven mightily at times to canalize construction along the path of safety. Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, \n289 \nU.S. 373, 379\n, 53 S.Ct. 620, 622. When a statute is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, they have preferred the meaning that preserves to the meaning that destroys. \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 335]\n\u00a0\n United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 407\n, 29 S.Ct. 527; Knights Templars' Indemnity Co. v. Jarman, \n187 \nU.S. 197, 205\n, 23 S.Ct. 108; cf. Illinois Central R. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n245 \nU.S. 493, 510\n, 38 S.Ct. 170; Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S.Ct. 715. 'But avoidance of a difficulty will not be pressed to the point of disingenuous evasion.' Moore Ice Cream Co. v. Rose, supra. 'Here the intention of the Congress is revealed too distinctly to permit us to ignore it because of mere misgivings as to power.' Id. The problem must be faced and answered.\n Second: The Home Owners Loan Act, to the extent that it permits the conversion of state associations into federal ones in contravention of the laws of the place of their creation, is an unconstitutional encroachment upon the reserved powers of the states. United States Constitution, Amendment 10.\n If section 5(i) may be upheld when state laws are inconsistent, any savings bank or insurance company as well as any building and loan association may be converted into a savings and loan association with a charter from the central government, provided only that 51 per cent. of the shares represented at a meeting vote approval of the change. Indeed, as counsel for the petitioners insisted at our bar, the power of transformation, if it is adequate in such conditions, is not confined to building and loan associations or savings banks or insurance companies or to members of the Home Loan Bank, except by the adventitious features of this particular enactment. It extends in that view to moneyed corporations generally and even to other corporations if Congress chooses to convert them into creatures of the federal government. Compulsion, by hypothesis, being lawful, the percentage of assenting shares voted in a given instance or exacted by a given statute assumes the aspect of an accident. Fifty-one per cent. is the minimum required here. Another act may reduce the minimum to 10 per cent. or \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 336]\n\u00a0\n even one, or dispense with approval altogether. If nonassenting shareholders or creditors were parties to these suits, the question would be urgent whether property interests may be so transformed consistently with the restraints of the Fifth Amendment. The Wisconsin courts hold that the protest of a single shareholder will check 'a fundamental and radical change' in the powers and purposes of the corporation, though the change be brought about by voluntary amendment. See opinion of the court below ( 217 Wis. 179, 257 N.W. 684, 688); also Martin Orchard Co. v. Fruit Growers' Canning Co., 203 Wis. 97, 233 N.W. 603; Huber v. Martin, 127 Wis. 412, 105 N.W. 1031, 1135, 3 L.R.A.(N.S.) 653, 115 Am.St.Rep. 1023, 7 Ann. Cas. 400. Shareholders and creditors being absent, we have instead the question whether consistently with the Tenth Amendment the change may be made under license of the central government against the protest of the state.\n For the purposes of these cases, we find it needless to consider whether Congress has the power to create building and loan associations and thereupon to invest them with corporate capacity. As to that, we do not indicate an opinion either one way or the other. The critical question here is something very different. The critical question is whether along with such a power there goes the power also to put an end to corporations created by the states and turn them into different corporations created by the nation.\n A corporation is a juristic person organized by government to accomplish certain ends, which may be public or quasi public, though for other purposes of classification the corporation is described as private. Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat. 518, 668-672. Cf. the statutes and decisions collected by Brandeis, J., in Liggett Co. v. Lee, \n288 U.S. 517\n, 548 et seq., 53 S.Ct. 481, 85 A.L.R. 699. This is true of building and loan associations in Wisconsin and in other states. They have been given corporate capacity in the belief \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 337]\n\u00a0\n that their creation will advance the common weal. The state, which brings them into being, has an interest in preserving their existence, for only thus can they attain the ends of their creation. They are more than business corporations. They have been organized and nurtured as quasi public instruments. Louisville Gas & Electric Co. v. Coleman, supra. They may not divest themselves of a franchise when once it is accepted if the local statutes or decisions command them to retain it. See opinion of the court below, 217 Wis. 179, 257 N.W. 684, and cf. Thomas v. West Jersey R. Co., \n101 U.S. 71\n; Central Transportation Co. v. Pullman's Car Co., \n139 \nU.S. 24\n, 11 S.Ct. 478. How they shall be formed, how maintained and supervised, and how and when dissolved are matters of governmental policy, which it would be an intrusion for another government to regulate by statute or decision, except when reasonably necessary for the fair and effective exercise of some other and cognate power explicitly conferred.\n Wisconsin, planning these agencies in furtherance of the common good and purposing to preserve them that the good may not be lost, is now informed by the Congress, speaking through a statute, that the purpose and the plan shall be thwarted and destroyed. By the law of the state, associations such as these may be dissolved in ways and for causes carefully defined, in which event the assets shall be converted into money and applied, so far as adequate, to the payment of the creditors. By the challenged Act of Congress, the same associations are dissolved in other ways and for other causes, and from being creatures of the state become creatures of the Nation. In this there is an invasion of the sovereignty or quasi sovereignty of Wisconsin and an impairment of its public policy, which the state is privileged to redress as a suitor in the courts so long as the Tenth Amendment preserves a field of autonomy against federal encroachment. \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 338]\n\u00a0\n We are not concerned at this time with the applicable rule in situations where the central government is at liberty (as it is under the commerce clause when such a purpose is disclosed) to exercise a power that is exclusive as well as paramount. Minnesota Rate Cases, \n230 \nU.S. 352, 399\n, 400 S., 33 S.Ct. 729, 48 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18; Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501, 533\n, 32 S.Ct. 715; Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 485\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 33 A.L.R. 472; Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346, 350\n, 53 S.Ct. 611. That is not the situation here. No one would say with reference to the business conducted by these petitioners that Congress could prohibit the formation or continuance of such associations by the states, whatever may be its power to charter them itself. So also we are not concerned with the rule to be applied where the business of an association under charter from a state is conducted in such a way as to be a menace or obstruction to the legitimate activities of its federal competitors. Cf. Northern Securities Co. v. United States, \n193 \nU.S. 197, 344\n, 345 S., 346, 24 S.Ct. 436; Houston, E. & Texas R. Co. v. United States, \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 34 S.Ct. 833; New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591, 600\n, 601 S., 42 S.Ct. 239. For anything here shown, the two classes of associations, federal and state, may continue to dwell together in harmony and order. A concession of this possibility is indeed implicit in the statute, for conversion is not mandatory, but dependent upon the choice of a majority of the voters. The power of Congress in the premises, if there is any, being not exclusive, but at most concurrent, and the untrammeled co-existence of federal and state associations being a conceded possibility, we are constrained to the holding that there has been an illegitimate encroachment by the government of the Nation upon a domain of activity set apart by the Constitution as the province of the states. Cf. Linder v. United States, \n268 \nU.S. 5, 17\n, 45 S.Ct. 446, 39 A.L.R. 229; United States v. De Witt, 9 Wall. 41, 45. The destruction of associations established by a state is not an \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 339]\n\u00a0\n exercise of power reasonably necessary for the maintenance by the central government of other associations created by itself in furtherance of kindred ends. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n Given the encroachment, the standing of the state to seek redress as suitor is not to be gainsaid, unless protest without action is the only method of resistance. Analogy combines with reason in telling us that this is not the law. By writs of quo warranto as well as through other remedial devices the state has been accustomed to keep its juristic creatures within the limits of the charters that define the purpose of their being. People v. Ballard, 134 N.Y. 269, 32 N.E. 54, 17 L.R.A. 737; Attorney General v. Utica Insurance Co., 2 Johns. Ch. (N.Y.) 371. The practice is so inveterate that it may be ranked as rudimentary. Indeed, there are many situations where no one other than the state will be held to be aggrieved, with the result that capacity to sue is either there or nowhere. Kerfoot v. Farmers' & Merchants' Bank, \n218 \nU.S. 281, 286\n, 287 S., 31 S.Ct. 14; Union National Bank v. Matthews, \n98 U.S. 621\n, 629. As against the protest of the state, asserting its public policy or the prohibition of a statute, no assent by shareholders, however general or explicit, will be permitted to prevail. McCandless v. Furlaud (Nov. 11, 1935) \n296 \nU.S. 140\n, 56 S.Ct. 41. It is of no moment in such conditions that the interest of the state in repelling the encroachment is other than pecuniary. Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416, 431\n, 40 S.Ct. 382, 11 A.L.R. 984. At least there is 'a matter of grave public concern in which the state, as the representative of the public, has an interest apart from \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 340]\n\u00a0\n that of the individuals affected.' Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 553, 591\n, 592 S., 43 S.Ct. 658, 663, 32 A.L.R. 300; Cf. North Dakota v. Minnesota, \n263 \nU.S. 365, 374\n, 44 S.Ct. 138; New York v. New Jersey, \n256 \nU.S. 296, 301\n, 302 S., 41 S.Ct. 492; Heckman v. United States, \n224 \nU.S. 413, 439\n, 440 S., 32 S.Ct. 424; Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 \nU.S. 125, 141\n, 142 S., 22 S.Ct. 552; Id., \n206 \nU.S. 46, 99\n, 27 S.Ct. 655; Georgia v.

Bell Telephone Co., \n128 \nU.S. 315, 357\n, 367 S., 9 S.Ct. 90. In its capacity of quasi sovereign, the state repulses an assault upon the quasi public institutions that are the product and embodiment of its statutes and its policy. Finding them about to deviate from the law of their creation, it is met by the excuse that everything done or purposed is permitted by an Act of Congress. The excuse is inadequate unless the power to give absolution for overstepping such restrictions has been surrendered by the state to the government at Washington.\n The standing of Wisconsin to resist a trespass on its powers is confirmed if we view the subject from another angle of approach. In the creation of corporations of this quasi public order and in keeping them thereafter within the limits of their charters, the state is parens patriae, acting in a spirit of benevolence for the welfare of its citizens. Shareholders and creditors have assumed a relation to the business in the belief that the assets will be protected by all the power of the government against use for other ends than those stated in the charter. Aside from the direct interest of the state in the preservation of agencies established for the common good, there is thus the duty of the parens patriae to keep faith with those who have put their trust in the parental power. True, most of the shareholders in the cases now before us assented to the change. Even so, an important minority were not represented at the meetings, and their approval is not \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 341]\n\u00a0\n shown. Creditors other than shareholders have not been heard from at all. To these nonvocal classes the parens owes a duty which it is free to vindicate by suit. \n7\n Hudson Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 356 S., 28 S.Ct. 529, 14 Ann.Cas. 560; Kansas v. Colorado, supra; Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., supra; New York v. New Jersey, supra; Pennsylvania v. West Virginia, supra.\n The ruling in Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 \nU.S. 447\n, 43 S.Ct. 597, is nothing to the contrary, though it is made a cornerstone of the argument in favor of the statute. There the state of Massachusetts attempted to enjoin the enforcement of an Act of Congress appropriating money to be used in co-operation with the states to reduce maternal and infant mortality. The ruling was that it was no part of the duty or power of a state to enforce the rights of its citizens in respect of their relations to the federal government. Cf. Florida v. Mellon, \n273 \nU.S. 12\n, 47 S.Ct. 265. Here, on the contrary, the state becomes a suitor to protect the interests of its citizens against the unlawful acts of corporations created by the state itself.\n Much reliance is placed in behalf of the petitioners upon the decision of this court in Casey v. Galli, supra. The Bank of New Orleans, a Louisiana corporation, became a national banking association by vote of its stockholders. The state did not oppose the conversion, though it was not shown to have consented. The reorganized \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 342]\n\u00a0\n corporation did business for more than two years, when it failed and a receiver was appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency. In an action by the receiver against a shareholder to enforce the individual liability under the provisions of the federal statute, the defendant filed three pleas in abatement, to which the plaintiff demurred. The pleas were as follows: (1) Nul tiel corporation; (2) that there was not then, nor when the plaintiff became receiver of the New Orleans Banking Association, any such corporation in existence, because the Bank of New Orleans had no power under its charter, nor authority otherwise from the state of Louisiana, to change its organization to that of a national banking association under the laws of the United States; and (3) that there had been a failure to comply with the statutory conditions as to the method of conversion if conversion was permissible. The first plea was abandoned, and the third is without bearing upon the causes now before us. The court sustained the demurrer to the second plea upon two independent grounds, which will be stated inversely to the order in which they appear in the opinion. Thus stated they are these: (a) The defendant was estopped from contesting the validity of the change after standing by for over two years without making his objection known; and (b) apart from any estoppel, 'no authority from the State was necessary to enable the bank so to change its organization.' \n94 U.S. 673\n, at page 678. 'The act is silent as to any assent or permission by the State. It was as competent for Congress to authorize the transmutation as to create such institutions originally.' Id.\n No question of constitutional power was in the case, for nowhere in the record did the defendant invoke the Tenth Amendment or the Fifth or any other provision of the Federal Constitution. The substance of the plea was this, that the change from one form of association to \n\n[296 U.S. 315, 343]\n\u00a0\n another was to be condemned as ultra vires. The meaning of the statute was thus the pivot of the controversy. The argument in the briefs was directed in the main to the formal correctness of the pleadings, the validity of the act being taken for granted. The assumption was one that could hardly be avoided when the controversy was viewed in the setting of the facts. Louisiana, like the defendant shareholder, had apparently acquiesced in the attempt of the central government to take over the state banks. The time had gone by to vindicate her majesty. What she might have done if she had been vigilant is a question not before us. Distinctions may conceivably exist between the power of the Congress in respect of banks of issue and deposit and its power in respect of associations to encourage industry and thrift. Whether that be so or not, all that was said in Casey v. Galli as to the condition of consent was unnecessary to the decision if it was meant to do more than define the meaning of the statute. We cannot accept it as determining the constitutional rights and privileges of a party not then before the court, least of all when it appears that constitutional rights and privileges were not invoked or argued.\n Confining ourselves now to the precise and narrow question presented upon the records here before us, we hold that the conversion of petitioners from state into federal associations is of no effect when voted against the protest of Wisconsin. Beyond that we do not go. No question is here as to the scope of the war power or of the power of eminent domain or of the power to regulate transactions affecting interstate or foreign commerce. The effect of these, if they have any, upon the powers reserved by the Constitution to the states or to the people will be considered when the need arises.\n The judgments are\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Cf.

(48 Stat. 134). \n\n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] At the same time we dismissed the appeals that had been taken from the judgments, the remedy of appeal being held to be inappropriate for the reason that the validity of the statute was untouched by the decision brought here for review. Section 237(a), Judicial Code, 43 Stat. 936, 937, 28 USCA  344(a). \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Complementary statutes permitting the conversion are common in the states. See, e.g., Mich. Comp. Laws, 1929,  11957; N.Y. Banking Law ( McKinney's Consol. Laws, c. 2)  137; Purdon's PS Pa., title 7, c. 14,  431 et seq.; Wis. Stats. 1933,  221.21. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The court has upheld the validity of a statute whereby national banks are given the same power as state banks to act as executors or administrators, to the end that the two classes of banks may compete on equal terms. First National Bank v. Union Trust Co., \n244 \nU.S. 416\n, 37 S.Ct. 734, L.R.A. 1918C, 283, Ann.Cas. 1918D, 1169. This is far from a holding that the function of acting as executors and administrators may be withdrawn from the state banks and lodged by the Congress in the national banks alone. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The fact is not ignored, but is thought to be unimportant, that the vote in favor of conversion at two of the three meetings, being more than two-thirds of the outstanding shares of stock, would have been sufficient to authorize a voluntary dissolution at a meeting duly called to consider such action. The same shareholders who voted to go on with the business under a charter from the federal government might have opposed dissolution as inexpedient or wasteful. Moreover, liquidation would then have followed under the supervision of the state. \n\n\n\n\n","92":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHULBURD v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1935)\nNo. 39\nArgued: November 14, 1935Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 300, 301]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John E. Hughes and Henry A. Gardner, both of Chicago, Ill., for petitioner. \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 302]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. N. A. Townsend, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy is one as to the liability of the executor and legatee of a shareholder in a dissolved corporation for a deficiency of income and profits taxes assessed against the company.\n In September, 1919, the Van Sicklen Company, an Illinois corporation, sold all its assets to a Delaware corporation, the Van Sicklen Speedometer Company, and was thereupon dissolved. In consideration of the sale it received $250,000 in cash and 5,000 shares in the new company, which it distributed forthwith among its own shareholders. One of these shareholders was Charles H. Hulburd. His distributive portion on the dissolution of the company was $8,000 in cash and 160 shares of nopar stock. He died on January 14, 1924, leaving a will by which his son, De Forest Hulburd, and Hugh McBirney Johnston were appointed executors. The son, who is the petitioner in this court, was also a legatee and devisee. The coexecutor, Johnston, is dead.\n In December, 1919, the Van Sicklen Company filed a corporation income and profits tax return for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1919. The return, however, was inadequate. Accordingly, on November 17, 1924, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue made an additional assessment in the sum of $227,872.06, with penalties in the sum of $113,936.03. Unable to collect this deficiency from the company after the distribution of its assets, he turned to the shareholders. On October 27, 1926, he mailed a letter to the 'Estate of Charles H. \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 303]\n\u00a0\n Hulburd, c\/o De Forest Hulburd, 86 East Randolph Street, Chicago, Illinois.' In this he gave notice of a proposed assessment 'against the estate' by reason of its liability as transferee of the assets of the Illinois corporation. The amount of that liability was stated to be $24,000, but was afterwards reduced to $8,000, the cash received by the testator. In announcing this assessment, the Commissioner acted in reliance on section 280 of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 U.S.C. App.  1069, 26 USCA  1069 and note); which permits an assessment against the transferee of a taxpayer upon the taxpayer's default. Before the passage of that act, shareholders who had received the assets of a dissolved corporation might be compelled to discharge unpaid corporate taxes, but only by bill in equity or action at law. Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 \nU.S. 589, 592\n, 593 S., 51 S.Ct. 608. A summary procedure was added by the statute. Phillips v. Commissioner, supra. Upon the default of the taxpayer, the Commissioner is to apportion the deficiency among the transferees of the property and to give notice accordingly. Revenue Act 1926,  274(a), 26 USCA  1048. If the transferee is dissatisfied, he may petition the Board of Tax Appeals to redetermine the existence of liability and its proper distribution.\n On October 27, 1926, when notice of the proposed assessment was sent to the petitioner, the estate of Charles H. Hulburd had been settled, the assets distributed, and the executors discharged. \n1\n The discharged executors sub- \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 304]\n\u00a0\n mitted to the Board of Tax Appeals a petition for review disclaiming liability. They stated in effect that they were the persons who had been appointed executors by the will of Charles H. Hulburd, but that their responsibilities as such were ended. Enumerating their objections to the assessment, they alleged that the action of the Commissioner was erroneous for the reason that the estate had been 'wholly distributed and settled and your petitioners duly discharged as executors thereof.' Thus, as early as December, 1926 (when the petition for review was filed), and before the period of limitation under the statute had run against a new assessment against legatees or devisees (Revenue Act 1926,  280(b)(2), 26 USCA  1069(b)(2), the Commissioner was put upon notice that the deficiency had been assessed against persons no longer liable and was given the opportunity to impose it upon others. Instead of doing this, he stood his ground and prayed for an order that his determination be confirmed.\n The Board of Tax Appeals held that 'at the time the notice was mailed there was no liability of the estate or of the petitioners as executors.' It put aside the consideration of a possible 'liability of any of the beneficiaries \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 305]\n\u00a0\n under the will or the distributees of the assets of the estate' on the ground that no such question was in the case. 27 B.T.A. 1123; cf. 21 B.T.A. 23. The decision of the Board was reviewed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. That court decided that the executors were liable de bonis testatoris because they had failed to give notice to the Commissioner that their fiduciary capacity had terminated. Revenue Act 1926,  281(b), 26 USCA  1070(b). Besides this, the court held that De Forest Hulburd was liable individually to the extent of $4,000 because in the record there was evidence, not confirmed by any finding, that as legatee under the will he had received half of the $8,000 paid to his father on the dissolution of the company. The order of the Board was accordingly reversed, and the cause remanded for proceedings to conform to the opinion. 76 F.(2d) 736. The power was thus assumed to change a deficiency assessed against the executors of an estate into a deficiency to be assessed against a legatee who had shared in the estate. To determine the validity of that assumption and to settle other questions of statutory construction, a writ of certiorari was granted by this court.\n First: The petitioner is not chargeable in this proceeding with liability as legatee under the will of a deceased shareholder in the taxpayer, a corporation now dissolved.\n The act of 1926 (chapter 27, 44 Stat. 9,  280; 26 U.S.C. App.  1069, 26 USCA  1069 and note), in supplementing by a summary procedure the cumbrous remedy of suit, laid the duty of assessment upon the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 'The liability, at law or in equity, of a transferee of property of a taxpayer' was to be 'assessed, collected and paid in the same manner and subject to the same provisions and limitations' as in the case of any other tax deficiency. Id.,  280(a)(1), 26 USCA  1069(a)(1). Pursuant to this mandate, the Commissioner did assess a liability and gave notice to the transferee accordingly. He assessed it to the estate re- \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 306]\n\u00a0\n presented by executors, and not to any one else. 'As provided by section 280 of the Revenue Act of 1926, there is proposed for assessment against the estate the sum of $24,000 constituting its liability as a transferee of the assets of the Van Sicklen Company, Elgin, Illinois.' The Board of Tax Appeals upon petition for review had power to redetermine the deficiency thus charged to the estate (Revenue Act 1926,  274(e), 26 USCA  1048c), but not to charge it to another. Cf. 26 U.S.C. (1934 Ed.)  600, 601, 619 (26 USCA  600, 601, 619); Williamsport Wire Rope Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 551, 562\n, 564 S., 48 S.Ct. 587. If some one else was to be charged, there would be need of a new assessment, which the Commissioner might make at any time within a year after the enactment of the statute. Revenue Act 1926,  280(b)(2). In making it he would consider any facts material and relevant for arriving at a just apportionment of benefits and burdens. The duty to inquire and determine was imposed by the statute upon him and not upon an agency of government established for the purpose of revising his decision. These restraints upon jurisdiction were duly heeded by the Board. It disclaimed the power or the purpose to pass upon the liability of legatees or devisees or to assess a tax against them. The same restraints upon jurisdiction were binding upon the Court of Appeals in reviewing the action of the Board, and binding with greater emphasis, for the court was without power to choose between conflicting inferences unless only one was possible, or to try the case de novo. Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123\n, 55 S.Ct. 732. The adjudication of liability as to Hulburd individually was made in seeming forgetfulness of these jurisdictional restrictions. It was error to ignore them.\n In so holding, we are not unmindful of the argument for the respondent that the form of the petition to review the action of the Commissioner was effective in some way to enlarge the scope of the proceeding and to subject the \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 307]\n\u00a0\n legatee to a new and different assessment. The argument will not stand. There is nothing in the petition submitted to the Board whereby power was extended beyond the statutory limits, if we assume provisionally that consent might be effective, at least in certain circumstances, to bring that result about. The petitioners, having been discharged as executors, were unwilling to describe themselves as if they were still acting in that capacity. What they did was to state the facts and ask the judgment of the Board thereon. Far from conceding that the assessment ran against either of them personally, they protested that in form and in purpose it was an assessment against the estate and hence was of no validity after the estate had been settled and the executors discharged. The meaning of their protest was not subject to misconstruction, nor in fact was it misconstrued, as the opinion of the Board shows if the fact might otherwise be doubtful. When the protest had been made, the remedy available to the Commissioner was obvious and ample. He had time even then as we have already pointed out, to announce a new assessment, which would have brought up the question whether the liability once resting on the executors had devolved upon another. For reasons not disclosed, he determined not to do so. In such circumstances, the cases cited by the government, where a formal defect has been ignored in circumstances tending toward an inference of waiver or estoppel,2 have no relation to the case at hand. We are not required at \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 308]\n\u00a0\n this time to approve or disapprove them. In this case there was neither waiver nor estoppel, but a steady insistence that the deficiency had been assessed against the estate and no one else, and that the liability of the estate had ended. To hold that by consent, either tacit or express, the proceeding had been turned into one to review the validity of a different assessment, and one never in fact made, would be a perversion of the record.\n Second: The estate having been settled and the executors discharged, the petitioner was functus officio under the law of Illinois, and was no longer subject to an assessment in his representative capacity.\n The Court of Appeals in upholding the liability of the executors as such put its ruling upon the ground that they had failed to give notice to the Commissioner of the termination by decree or otherwise of their fiduciary capacity. The notice was thought to be requisite under section 281(b) of the Revenue Act of 1926 (26 USCA  1070(b), which is quoted in the margin. \n3\n But the Revenue Act of 1926 became a law in February of that year (section 286, of the act, 26 USCA  931 note), and the executors were discharged in February, 1925. If there liability as executors was ended at that time, the statute will not be read as attempting to revive it. White v. United States, \n191 \nU.S. 545\n, 24 S.Ct. 171; Winfree v. Northern Pacific R. Co. \n227 \nU.S. 296\n, 33 S.Ct. 273; Union Pacific R. Co. v. Laramie Stock Yards Co., \n231 \nU.S. 190, 199\n, 34 S.Ct. 101; Shwab v.

Commissioner (C.C.A.) 54 F.(2d) 527. \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 309]\n\u00a0\n Section 281(b) being found to be inapplicable, we have still to determine whether executors who have been discharged after a full settlement of the estate are subject by the law of Illinois to assessment or suit in their representative capacity.\n By the common law of England an executor was deemed to carry forward the persona of the testator. Holmes, The Common Law, pp. 344, 345; Holdsworth's History of English Law, vol. 3, pp. 563, 573, 574, 583; Littleton's Tenures,  337; Co. Litt. 209, a, b; Mechanics' Savings Bank v. Waite, 150 Mass. 234, 235, 22 N.E. 915; Chipman v. Manufacturers' National Bank, 156 Mass. 147, 149, 30 N.E. 610. Unless the appointment was qualified in respect of time, it continued during life. Williams, Executors (12th Ed.) vol. 1, pp. 131, 147, 342. There was no such thing as a discharge upon a showing of plene administravit. There was no such thing as a resignation because of mere unwillingness to go on. Rogers v. Frank, 1 Younge and Jervis 409, 414; In the Goods of Heslop, 1 Robertson's Ecclesiastical Rep. 457, 458; In the Goods of Veiga, 3 Swabey & Tristram 13, 15. The power to act might be suspended or revoked through the appointment of a committee or a receiver if the executor was found to be physically or mentally incapable. In the Goods of Binckes, 1 Curteis 286; In the Goods of Newton, 3 Curteis 428; In the Goods of Cooke, (1895) P.D. 68; In the Goods of Goldschmidt, 78 L.T. (N.S.) 763; In the Estate of Shaw , (1905) P.D. 92. There might be like relief if he had become insolvent after probate or had disappeared or had misappropriated the assets or otherwise abused his trust. In the Goods of Covell, (1889) P.D. 8; Estate of Thomas, (1912) P.D. 177; Utterson v. Mair, 2 Ves. Jr. 95, 97, 98; In the Goods of Loveday, (1900) P.D. 154, 156; Oldfield v. Cobbett, 4 L.J.(N. S.)

In the absence of peril to the estate, responsibility and power were not to be renounced when once they had been assumed. So the law of England continues even now. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The common-law rule is preserved in some of our states today, but in many has been abandoned, at times as the result of statute, at times through the combined force of statute and decision. The diversity of doctrine is surprising, and so often is its obscurity. The commentators tell us, however, and, as the cases show, correctly, that the growing tendency in this country is away from the English rule. \n5\n Some states, though they make provision for an accounting, make none for a discharge, and hold the executor suable after the estate has been distributed upon the chance that other property may be discovered later on. The judgment will be collectible out of assets in futuro, or quando acciderint, as was said in early days. Williams, supra, vol. 2, p. 1253; Mary Shipley's Case, 8 Co. 134, a, b; Noell v. Nelson, 2 Saund. 226. This in effect is the practice in New York (Mahoney v. Bernhard, 45 App.Div. 499, 501, 63 N.Y.S. 642, affirmed 169 N.Y. 589, 62 N.E. 1097; Willets v. Haines, 96 App.Div. 5, 7, 88 N.Y.S. 1018; Rosen v. Ward, 96 App.Div. 262, 266, 89 N.Y.S. 148; Pearse v. National Lead Co., 162 App.Div. 766, 769, 147 N.Y.S. 989; Paff v. Kinney, 1 Bradf. (N.Y.) 1, 9), where a judicial settlement of accounts is conclusive as to the past, but is never ultimate in the sense that it relieves the fiduciary from liability for the future. See, also, Hazlett v. Estate of \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 311]\n\u00a0\n Blakely, 70 Neb. 613, 617, 97 N.W. 808; Weyer v. Watt, 48 Ohio St. 545, 551, 28 N.E. 670. On the other hand, there are states where by express provision of the statutes the executor is to be discharged upon a showing of full administration, and others where the requirement of a discharge has been read into the statutes by a process of construction. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n The courts of Illinois, as we interpret their opinions, maintain a middle ground, which is neither that of the common law on the one side nor its opposite on the other. This is not to say that there is any case in that state so like in its essential features to the one for decision here as to make the Illinois position certain. On the contrary, \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 312]\n\u00a0\n support will be found for the strict rule of the common law if what has been said in some of the opinions is taken from its framework and considered without reference to what was actually decided. See, e.g., Starr v. Willoughby, 218 Ill. 485, 493, 75 N.E. 1029, 2 L.R.A.(N.S.) 623. The aspect becomes different, however, when attention is directed to the setting of the facts and to the provisions and implications of the applicable statutes. What emerges, it would seem, is this: A discharge upon an accounting will be vacated in a direct proceeding if it appears that there were assets, not inventoried by the executor or included in his report, for which, when the decree was passed, he was properly accountable ( Fraser v. Fraser, 149 Ill.App. 186, 187, 195, 196; cf. Musick v. Beebe, 17 Kan. 47, 53, 54); in the absence of such a showing, the discharge when decreed upon a finding of full administration will relieve the executor for the future of responsibility and power. Cf. Reizer v. Mirtz, 223 Ill. 555, 562, 564, 79 N.E. 283; Robinson v. Robinson, 214 Ill.App. 262, 268, 269.7 \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 313]\n\u00a0\n Whatever doubt may survive a reading of the case is dispelled or greatly attenuated when we pass to an examination of the statutes and the plan that they reveal.\n First in order of importance is the statute regulating the settlement of accounts. \n8\n An executor is required to exhibit a report of his administration within thirty days after the expiration of one year from the date of his letters. That being done, he must exhibit a report thereafter, whenever required by the court, 'until the duties of administration are fully completed.' He may from time to time at his own volition file 'a final report of his administration to a specified date,' which, even if approved, will not terminate his office. He may also make a final report 'at the conclusion of administration.' \n9\n Such a report, if approved upon notice to all parties in interest, shall be binding upon them 'in the absence of fraud, accident or mistake.' A final report 'at the conclusion of administration' assumes that there is a stage when administration is over. The executor is functus officio when discharged by the court after that stage has been attained.\n Another statute of high significance is one that makes provision for an appraisal of the assets. \n10\n If the executor discovers after the making of an inventory and appraisal that the assets of the estate do not exceed the amount of the widow's allowance, after deducting necessary expenses, he is to report the facts to the court. Thereupon the court, if it finds the report to be true, shall order the assets to be delivered to the widow, 'and discharge the executor \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 314]\n\u00a0\n or administrator from further duty.' Plainly such a discharge is equivalent to a termination of the office. There is not only exoneration for the past, but absolution for the future. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n The decree of the Probate Court discharging this executor must be read against the background of this statutory scheme. It is too precise in its terms to be dismissed as amounting to nothing more than a confirmation of the report as submitted for approval. If words can express an intention to declare administration ended, the expression is not lacking here. We may not put all this aside as surplusage. If there was no power in the Illinois court to give relief so comprehensive, the defect should be very clear before a federal court will undertake to wrest the words of the decree from their natural and ordinary meaning or hold them to be futile. Especially is that so in view of the growing tendency of probate courts throughout the land to break the shackles of the ancient rule. Weighty considerations of expediency and justice explain this tendency and support it. In the thought of many judges, an executor discharged after a full and fair accounting is no longer to be vexed by the annoyance and expense of defending fruitless suits with assets no longer available for reimbursement or indemnity. If suitors or taxgatherers wish to go against the estate or against those who have shared in it, they must either vacate the decree upon a showing of assets unaccounted for, or procure upon a showing of necessity the appointment of an administrator, or pass over the estate and its representatives and pursue the legatees to the extent of benefits received. There was no attempt to tread those paths, though the last at all events was open. \n\n[296 U.S. 300, 315]\n\u00a0\n The controversy in this aspect is one of local law, which, once it is ascertained, must be accepted as controlling. Security Trust Co. v. Black River National Bank, supra; Forrest v. Jack, \n294 \nU.S. 158\n, 55 S.Ct. 370, 96 A.L.R. 1457; Seabury v. Green, \n294 \nU.S. 165\n, 55 S.Ct. 373, 96 A.L.R. 1463. The decree discharging the executors amounts to a construction of the Illinois statute by a court of the state, and a court of special competence and experience in disposing of such questions. There being no satisfactory showing that the decision overpasses the bounds of jurisdiction, we yield to its authority.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed and the order of the Board of Tax Appeals affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The decree of the probate court of Cook county, Ill., the place of administration, was made on February 26, 1925, and, the text being important, is quoted in full:\n'In the Matter of the Estate of Charles H. Hulburd, Deceased.\n\n'This day came Hugh McBirney Johnston and De Forest Hulburd, executors of the last will and testament of Charles H. Hulburd, deceased, and presented to the court and filed herein their final account with the estate of said decedent, showing that said estate has been fully administered.\n\n'And it now appearing to the court that more than one year has elapsed since the granting of letters testamentary herein; that due notice has been given to all of the heirs at law, legatees and beneficiaries; that all assets of said estate have been collected; that no claims have been filed against said estate; that specific legacies have been paid; that the Inheritance tax, Federal estate tax, Income tax, court costs and all other costs and expenses of administration herein have been paid, and that the balance of said estate has been distributed according to the last will and testament of said decedent, and guardian ad litem consenting to the approval of said final account.\n\n'It is therefore ordered by the court that said final account be approved and recorded, that the estate be and it is declared settled and that the executors be and they are hereby discharged.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Commissioner v.

People v. Pardin, 171 Ill.App. 226, 230); Bayless v. People, 56 Ill. App. 55, 58, holds that a surety is liable on an executor's bond where a balance available for creditors was wrongfully distributed; Starr v. Willoughby, 218 Ill. 485, 492, 75 N.E. 1029, 2 L.R.A.(N.S.) 623, holds that a power in trust, unrelated to the office of executor, will survive a decree which purports to discharge him; and Maguire v. City of Macomb, 293 Ill. 441, 453, 127 N.E. 682, is substantially to the same effect.

Humphrey, the decedent, on December 10, 1931, was nominated by President Hoover to succeed himself as a member of the Federal Trade Commission, and was confirmed by the United States Senate. He was duly commissioned for a term of seven years, expiring September 25, 1938; and, after taking the required oath of office, entered upon his duties. On July 25, 1933, President Roosevelt addressed a letter to the commissioner asking for his resignation, on the ground 'that the aims and purposes of the Administration with respect to the work of the Commission can be carried out most effectively with personnel of my own selection,' but disclaiming any reflection upon the commissioner personally or upon his services. The commissioner replied, asking time to con- \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 619]\n\u00a0\n sult his friends. After some further correspondence upon the subject, the President on August 31, 1933, wrote the commissioner expressing the hope that the resignation would be forthcoming, and saying: 'You will, I know, realize that I do not feel that your mind and my mind go along together on either the policies or the administering of the Federal Trade Commission, and, frankly, I think it is best for the people of this country that I should have a full confidence.'\n The commissioner declined to resign; and on October 7, 1933, the President wrote him: 'Effective as of this date you are hereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission.'\n Humphrey never acquiesced in this action, but continued thereafter to insist that he was still a member of the commission, entitled to perform its duties and receive the compensation provided by law at the rate of $10, 000 per annum. Upon these and other facts set forth in the certificate, which we deem it unnecessary to recite, the following questions are certified:\n'1. Do the provisions of section 1 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, stating that 'any commissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office', restrict or limit the power of the President to remove a commissioner except upon one or more of the causes named?\n\n'If the foregoing question is answered in the affirmative, then-\n\n'2. If the power of the President to remove a commissioner is restricted or limited as shown by the foregoing interrogatory and the answer made thereto, is such a restriction or limitation valid under the Constitution of the United States?'\n\n The Federal Trade Commission Act, c. 311, 38 Stat. 717, 718,  1, 2, 15 U.S.C.  41, 42 (15 USCA  41, 42), creates a commission of five \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 620]\n\u00a0\n members to be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and section 1 provides: 'Not more than three of the commissioners shall be members of the same political party. The first commissioners appointed shall continue in office for terms of three, four, five, six, and seven years, respectively, from the date of the taking effect of this Act (September 26, 1914), the term of each to be designated by the President, but their successors shall be appointed for terms of seven years, except that any person chosen to fill a vacancy shall be appointed only for the unexpired term of the commissioner whom he shall succeed. The commission shall choose a chairman from its own membership. No commissioner shall engage in any other business, vocation, or employment. Any commissioner may be removed by the President for inefficiency. neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. ...'\n Section 5 of the act (15 USCA  45) in part provides that:\n'Unfair methods of competition in commerce are declared unlawful.\n\n'The commission is empowered and directed to prevent persons, partnerships, or corporations, except banks, and common carriers subject to the Acts to regulate commerce, from using unfair methods of competition in commerce.'\n\n In exercising this power, the commission must issue a complaint stating its charges and giving notice of hearing upon a day to be fixed. A person, partnership, or corporation proceeded against is given the right to appear at the time and place fixed and show cause why an order to cease and desist should not be issued. There is provision for intervention by others interested. If the commission finds the method of competition is one prohibited by the act, it is directed to make a report in writing stating its findings as to the facts, and to issue and cause to be served a cease and desist order. If the order is disobeyed, the commission may apply to the appropriate Circuit Court of \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 621]\n\u00a0\n Appeals for its enforcement. The party subject to the order may seek and obtain a review in the Circuit Court of Appeals in a manner provided by the act.\n Section 6 (15 USCA  46), among other things, gives the commission wide powers of investigation in respect of certain corporations subject to the act, and in respect of other matters, upon which it must report to Congress with recommendations. Many such investigations have been made, and some have served as the basis of congressional legislation.\n Section 7 (15 USCA  47), provides that: 'In any suit in equity brought by or under the direction of the Attorney General as provided in the antitrust Acts, the court may, upon the conclusion of the testimony therein, if it shall be then of opinion that the complainant is entitled to relief, refer said suit to the commission, as a master in chancery, to ascertain and report an appropriate form of decree therein. The commission shall proceed upon such notice to the parties and under such rules of procedure as the court may prescribe, and upon the coming in of such report such exceptions may be filed and such proceedings had in relation thereto as upon the report of a master in other equity causes, but the court may adopt or reject such report, in whole or in part, and enter such decree as the nature of the case may in its judgment require.'\n First. The question first to be considered is whether, by the provisions of section 1 of the Federal Trade Commission Act already quoted, the President's power is limited to removal for the specific causes enumerated therein. The negative contention of the government is based principally upon the decision of this court in Shurtleff v. United States, \n189 \nU.S. 311\n, 23 S.Ct. 535, 537. That case involved the power of the President to remove a general appraiser of merchandise appointed under the Act of June 10, 1890, 26 Stat. 131. Section 12 of the act provided for the appointment by the President, by and with the advice and con- \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 622]\n\u00a0\n sent of the Senate, of nine general appraisers of merchandise, who 'may be removed from office at any time by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.' The President removed Shurtleff without assigning any cause therefor. The Court of Claims dismissed plaintiff's petition to recover salary, upholding the President's power to remove for causes other than those stated. In this court Shurtleff relied upon the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius; but this court held that, while the rule expressed in the maxim was a very proper one and founded upon justifiable reasoning in many instances, it 'should not be accorded controlling weight when to do so would involve the alteration of the universal practice of the government for over a century, and the consequent curtailment of the powers of the Executive in such an unusual manner.' What the court meant by this expression appears from a reading of the opinion. That opinion, after saying that no term of office was fixed by the act and that, with the exception of judicial officers provided for by the Constitution, no civil officer had ever held office by life tenure since the foundation of the government, points out that to construe the statute as contended for by Shurtleff would give the appraiser the right to hold office during his life or until found guilty of some act specified in the statute, the result of which would be a complete revolution in respect of the general tenure of office, effected by implication with regard to that particular office only.\n'We think it quite inadmissible,' the court said (\n189 U.S. 311\n, at pages 316, 318, 23 S.Ct. 535, 537), 'to attribute an intention on the part of Congress to make such an extraordinary change in the usual rule governing the tenure of office, and one which is to be applied to this particular office only, without stating such intention in plain and explicit language, instead of leaving it to be implied from doubtful inferences. ... We cannot bring ourselves to the belief that Congress ever \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 623]\n\u00a0\n intended this result while omitting to use language which would put that intention beyond doubt.'\n\n These circumstances, which led the court to reject the maxim as inapplicable, are exceptional. In the face of the unbroken precedent against life tenure, except in the case of the judiciary, the conclusion that Congress intended that, from among all other civil officers, appraisers alone should be selected to hold office for life was so extreme as to forbid, in the opinion of the court, any ruling which would produce that result if it reasonably could be avoided. The situation here presented is plainly and wholly different. The statute fixes a term of office, in accordance with many precedents. The first commissioners appointed are to continue in office for terms of three, four, five, six, and seven years, respectively; and their successors are to be appointed for terms of seven years-any commissioner being subject to removal by the President for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. The words of the act are definite and unambiguous.\n The government says the phrase 'continue in office' is of no legal significance and, moreover, applies only to the first Commissioners. We think it has significance. It may be that, literally, its application is restricted as suggested; but it, nevertheless, lends support to a view contrary to that of the government as to the meaning of the entire requirement in respect of tenure; for it is not easy to suppose that Congress intended to secure the first commissioners against removal except for the causes specified and deny like security to their successors. Putting this phrase aside, however, the fixing of a definite term subject to removal for cause, unless there be some countervailing provision or circumstance indicating the contrary, which here we are unable to find, is enough to establish the legislative intent that the term is not to be curtailed in the absence of such cause. But if the intention of \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 624]\n\u00a0\n Congress that no removal should be made during the specified term except for one or more of the enumerated causes were not clear upon the face of the statute, as we think it is, it would be made clear by a consideration of the character of the commission and the legislative history which accompanied and preceded the passage of the act.\n The commission is to be nonpartisan; and it must, from the very nature of its duties, act with entire impartiality. It is charged with the enforcement of no policy except the policy of the law. Its duties are neither political nor executive, but predominantly quasi judicial and quasi legislative. Like the Interstate Commerce Commission, its members are called upon to exercise the trained judgment of a body of experts 'appointed by law and informed by experience.' Illinois Cent. &c. R.R. v. Inter. Com. Comm., \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S.Ct. 700, 704; Standard Oil Co. v. United States, \n283 \nU.S. 235, 238\n, 239 S., 51 S.Ct. 429.\n The legislative reports in both houses of Congress clearly reflect the view that a fixed term was necessary to the effective and fair administration of the law. In the report to the Senate (No. 597, 63d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 10, 11) the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, in support of the bill which afterwards became the act in question, after referring to the provision fixing the term of office at seven years, so arranged that the membership would not be subject to complete change at any one time, said: 'The work of this commission will be of a most exacting and difficult character, demanding persons who have experience in the problems to be met-that is, a proper knowledge of both the public requirements and the practical affairs of industry. It is manifestly desirable that the terms of the commissioners shall be long enough to give them an opportunity to acquire the expertness in dealing with these special questions concerning industry that comes from experience.' \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 625]\n\u00a0\n The report declares that one advantage which the commission possessed over the Bureau of Corporations (an executive subdivision in the Department of Commerce which was abolished by the act) lay in the fact of its independence, and that it was essential that the commission should not be open to the suspicion of partisan direction. The report quotes (p. 22) a statement to the committee by Senator Newlands, who reported the bill, that the tribunal should be of high character and 'independent of any department of the government. ... a board or commission of dignity, permanence, and ability, independent of executive authority, except in its selection, and independent in character.'\n The debates in both houses demonstrate that the prevailing view was that the Commission was not to be 'subject to anybody in the government but ... only to the people of the United States'; free from 'political domination or control' or the 'probability or possibility of such a thing'; to be 'separate and apart from any existing department of the government- not subject to the orders of the President.'\n More to the same effect appears in the debates, which were long and thorough and contain nothing to the contrary. While the general rule precludes the use of these debates to explain the meaning of the words of the statute, they may be considered as reflecting light upon its general purposes and the evils which it sought to remedy. Federal Trade Commission v. Raladam Co., \n283 \nU.S. 643, 650\n, 51 S.Ct. 587, 79 A.L.R. 1191\n\n\n Thus, the language of the act, the legislative reports, and the general purposes of the legislation as reflected by the debates, all combine to demonstrate the congressional intent to create a body of experts who shall gain experience by length of service; a body which shall be independent of executive authority, except in its selection, and free to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other official \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 626]\n\u00a0\n or any department of the government. To the accomplishment of these purposes, it is clear that Congress was of opinion that length and certainty of tenure would vitally contribute. And to hold that, nevertheless, the members of the commission continue in office at the mere will of the President, might be to thwart, in large measure, the very ends which Congress sought to realize by definitely fixing the term of office.\n We conclude that the intent of the act is to limit the executive power of removal to the causes enumerated, the existence of none of which is claimed here; and we pass to the second question.\n Second. To support its contention that the removal provision of section 1, as we have just construed it, is an unconstitutional interference with the executive power of the President, the government's chief reliance is Myers v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 52\n, 47 S.Ct. 21. That case has been so recently decided, and the prevailing and dissenting opinions so fully review the general subject of the power of executive removal, that further discussion would add little of value to the wealth of material there collected. These opinions examine at length the historical, legislative, and judicial data bearing upon the question, beginning with what is called 'the decision of 1789' in the first Congress and coming down almost to the day when the opinions were delivered. They occupy 243 pages of the volume in which they are printed. Nevertheless, the narrow point actually decided was only that the President had power to remove a postmaster of the first class, without the advice and consent of the Senate as required by act of Congress. In the course of the opinion of the court, expressions occur which tend to sustain the government's contention, but these are beyond the point involved and, therefore, do not come within the rule of stare decisis. In so far as they are out of harmony with the views here set forth, these expressions are disapproved. A like situation was \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 627]\n\u00a0\n presented in the case of Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat, 264, 399, in respect of certain general expressions in the opinion in Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch, 137. Chief Justice Marshall, who delivered the opinion in the Marbury Case, speaking again for the court in the Cohens Case, said: 'It is a maxim, not to be disregarded, that general expressions, in every opinion, are to be taken in connection with the case in which those expressions are used. If they go beyond the case, they may be respected, but ought not to control the judgment in a subsequent suit, when the very point is presented for decision. The reason of this maxim is obvious. The question actually before the court is investigated with care, and considered in its full extent. Other principles which may serve to illustrate it, are considered in their relation to the case decided, but their possible bearing on all other cases is seldom completely investigated.'\n And he added that these general expressions in the case of Marbury v. Madison were to be understood with the limitations put upon them by the opinion in the Cohens Case. See, also, Carroll v. Lessee of Carroll et al., 16 How. 275, 286-287; O'Donoghue v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 516, 550\n, 53 S.Ct. 740.\n The office of a postmaster is so essentially unlike the office now involved that the decision in the Myers Case cannot be accepted as controlling our decision here. A postmaster is an executive officer restricted to the performance of executive functions. He is charged with no duty at all related to either the legislative or judicial power. The actual decision in the Myers Case finds support in the theory that such an officer is merely one of the units in the executive department and, hence, inherently subject to the exclusive and illimitable power of removal by the Chief Executive, whose subordinate and aid he is. Putting aside dicta, which may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but which are not controlling, the necessary reach of the decision goes far enough to include \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 628]\n\u00a0\n all purely executive officers. It goes no farther; much less does it include an officer who occupies no place in the executive department and who exercises no part of the executive power vested by the Constitution in the President.\n The Federal Trade Commission is an administrative body created by Congress to carry into effect legislative policies embodied in the statute in accordance with the legislative standard therein prescribed, and to perform other specified duties as a legislative or as a judicial aid. Such a body cannot in any proper sense be characterized as an arm or an eye of the executive. Its duties are performed without executive leave and, in the contemplation of the statute, must be free from executive control. In administering the provisions of the statute in respect of 'unfair methods of competition,' that is to say, in filling in and administering the details embodied by that general standard, the commission acts in part quasi legislatively and in part quasi judicially. In making investigations and reports thereon for the information of Congress under section 6, in aid of the legislative power, it acts as a legislative agency. Under section 7, which authorizes the commission to act as a master in chancery under rules prescribed by the court, it acts as an agency of the judiciary. To the extent that it exercises any executive function, as distinguished from executive power in the constitutional sense, it does so in the discharge and effectuation of its quasi legislative or quasi judicial powers, or as an agency of the legislative or judicial departments of the government. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 602, 629]\n\u00a0\n If Congress is without authority to prescribe causes for removal of members of the trade commission and limit executive power of removal accordingly, that power at once becomes practically all-inclusive in respect of civil officers with the exception of the judiciary provided for by the Constitution. The Solicitor General, at the bar, apparently recognizing this to be true, with commendable candor, agreed that his view in respect of the removability of members of the Federal Trade Commission necessitated a like view in respect of the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Court of Claims. We are thus confronted with the serious question whether not only the members of these quasi legislative and quasi judicial bodies, but the judges of the legislative Court of Claims, exercising judicial power (Williams v. United States, \n289 U.S. 553\n, 565-567, 53 S.Ct. 751), continue in office only at the pleasure of the President.\n We think it plain under the Constitution that illimitable power of removal is not possessed by the President in respect of officers of the character of those just named. The authority of Congress, in creating quasi legislative or quasi judicial agencies, to require them to act in discharge of their duties independently of executive control cannot well be doubted; and that authority includes, as an appropriate incident, power to fix the period during which they shall continue, and to forbid their removal except for cause in the meantime. For it is quite evident that one who holds his office only during the pleasure of another cannot be depended upon to maintain an attitude of independence against the latter's will.\n The fundamental necessity of maintaining each of the three general departments of government entirely free from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect, of either of the others, has often been stressed and is hardly open to serious question. So much is implied in \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 630]\n\u00a0\n the very fact of the separation of the powers of these departments by the Constitution; and in the rule which recognizes their essential coequality. The sound application of a principle that makes one master in his own house precludes him from imposing his control in the house of another who is master there. James Wilson, one of the framers of the Constitution and a former justice of this court, said that the independence of each department required that its proceedings 'should be free from the remotest influence, direct or indirect, of either of the other two powers.' Andrews, The Works of James Wilson (1896), vol. 1, p. 367. And Mr. Justice Story in the first volume of his work on the Constitution (4th Ed.)  530, citing No. 48 of the Federalist, said that neither of the departments in reference to each other 'ought to possess, directly or indirectly, an overruling influence in the administration of their respective powers.' And see O'Donoghue v. United States, supra, \n289 U.S. 516\n, at pages 530-531, 53 S.Ct. 740.\n The power of removal here claimed for the President falls within this principle, since its coercive influence threatens the independence of a commission, which is not only wholly disconnected from the executive department, but which, as already fully appears, was created by Congress as a means of carrying into operation legislative and judicial powers, and as an agency of the legislative and judicial departments.\n In the light of the question now under consideration, we have re- examined the precedents referred to in the Myers Case, and find nothing in them to justify a conclusion contrary to that which we have reached. The so-called 'decision of 1789' had relation to a bill proposed by Mr. Madison to establish an executive Department of Foreign Affairs. The bill provided that the principal officer was 'to be removable \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 631]\n\u00a0\n from office by the President of the United States.' This clause was changed to read 'whenever the principal officer shall be removed from office by the President of the United States,' certain things should follow, thereby, in connection with the debates, recognizing and confirming, as the court thought in the Myers Case, the sole power of the President in the matter. We shall not discuss the subject further, since it is so fully covered by the opinions in the Myers Case, except to say that the office under consideration by Congress was not only purely executive, but the officer one who was responsible to the President, and to him alone, in a very definite sense. A reading of the debates shows that the President's illimitable power of removal was not considered in respect of other than executive officers. And it is pertinent to observe that when, at a later time, the tenure of office for the Comptroller of the Treasury was under consideration, Mr. Madison quite evidently thought that, since the duties of that office were not purely of an executive nature but partook of the judiciary quality as well, a different rule in respect of executive removal might well apply. 1 Annals of Congress, cols. 611-612.\n In Marbury v. Madison, supra, 1 Cranch, 137, at pages 162, 165-166, it is made clear that Chief Justice Marshall was of opinion that a justice of the peace for the District of Columbia was not removable at the will of the President; and that there was a distinction between such an officer and officers appointed to aid the President in the performance of his constitutional duties. In the latter case, the distinction he saw was that 'their acts are his acts' and his will, therefore, controls; and, by way of illustration, he adverted to the act establishing the Department of Foreign Affairs, which was the subject of the 'decision of 1789.'\n The result of what we now have said is this: Whether the power of the President to remove an officer shall prevail over the authority of Congress to condition the power by fixing a definite term and precluding a removal except for cause will depend upon the character of the office; the Myers decision, affirming the power of the President \n\n[295 U.S. 602, 632]\n\u00a0\n alone to make the removal, is confined to purely executive officers; and as to officers of the kind here under consideration, we hold that no removal can be made during the prescribed term for which the officer is appointed, except for one or more of the causes named in the applicable statute.\n To the extent that, between the decision in the Myers Case, which sustains the unrestrictable power of the President to remove purely executive officers, and our present decision that such power does not extend to an office such as that here involved, there shall remain a field of doubt, we leave such cases as may fall within it for future consideration and determination as they may arise.\n In accordance with the foregoing, the questions submitted are answered:\n Question No. 1, Yes.\n Question No. 2, Yes.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS agrees that both questions should be answered in the affirmative. A separate opinion in Myers v. United States, \n272 U.S. 52\n, at page 178, 47 S.Ct. 21, at page 46, states his views concerning the power of the President to remove appointees. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The provision of section 6(d) of the act (15 USCA  46(d) which authorizes the President to direct an investigation and report by the commission in relation to alleged violations of the anti-trust acts, is so obviously collateral to the main design of the act as not to detract from the force of this general statement as to the character of that body. \n\n\n\n\n","94":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nICKES v.

Motion to dismiss the bill of complaint was denied, and, on defendant's refusal to plead further, plaintiff obtained a decree which the Court of Appeals affirmed. 63 App.D.C. 47, 69 F.(2d) 123. This Court granted a writ of certiorari (\n292 \nU.S. 620\n, 54 S.Ct. 780) in view of the question as to the construction of the Mineral Leasing Act, February 25, 1920, c. 85,  1, 37, 41 Stat. 437; 30 U.S.C.  181, 193 (30 USCA  181, 193). \n\n[295 U.S. 639, 643]\n\u00a0\n The bill alleged that in June, 1917, under section 2324 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C.  28 (30 USCA  28)), plaintiff located certain oil shale placer claims on mineral lands of the United States in Colorado and thereupon became the owner of the claims and entitled to their exclusive possession; that from that time until, and including, the year ending July 1, 1930, the annual assessment work required by the statute was performed on each of the claims; that during the year ending July 1, 1931, the assessment work was not performed and had not been resumed before September 4, 1931, or since, but that plaintiff then intended to resume work, and had made arrangements for that resumption which would have been had but for the action of defendant; that plaintiff had not abandoned, or intended to abandon, any of the claims, and that no charge to that effect had been made; that about September 4, 1931, adverse proceedings were initiated by the Department of the Interior, through the General Land Office, with the filling of a 'challenge' to plaintiff's title and right of possession and by 'posting such challenge on the said claims'; that the challenge was based on the sole ground that plaintiff had not performed the annual assessment work and that 'the United States resumed possession of said land.'\n Plaintiff further alleged that there had been 'no relocation of any of the claims by any person since plaintiff's failure to perform the annual assessment work, and that there had been no application by anyone to lease any of the claims from the United States.' Plaintiff recited the answer he had made to the challenge, in substance, that, notwithstanding his failure to perform the described work, he had the right to retain possession of the claims and to resume work thereon 'at any time prior to a valid subsequent location of said claims'; but that the Commissioner of the General Land Office had held that the claims were null and void, and his ruling had been af- \n\n[295 U.S. 639, 644]\n\u00a0\n firmed by the Secretary of the Interior, whose decision had been promulgated declaring that the United States had taken possession for its own purposes, thus in effect decreeing a forfeiture.\n Plaintiff then set forth the provisions of the Mineral Leasing Act of February 25, 1920, which authorized the Secretary of the Interior to execute leases of mineral lands, but contained an exception as to valid claims existing on the date of the passage of the act 'and thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated, which claims may be perfected under such laws, including discovery.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n\n 1. \nThe character and extent of the right which plaintiff acquired by virtue of its location of the mining claims, in 1917, are well established. Restating the rule declared by many decisions, we said in Wilbur v. U.S. ex rel. Krushnic, \n280 \nU.S. 306, 316\n, 50 S.Ct. 103, 104, that such a location, perfected under the law, 'has the effect of a grant by the United States of the right of present and exclusive possession. The claim is property in the fullest sense of that term.' It is alienable, inheritable, and taxable. See Forbes v. Gracey, \n94 U.S. 762\n, 767; Belk v. Meagher, \n104 U.S. 279\n, 283; Manuel v. Wulff, \n152 \nU.S. 505, 510\n, 511 S., 14 S.Ct. 651; Elder v. Wood, \n208 \nU.S. 226, 232\n, 28 S.Ct. 263; Bradford v.

Under section 2324 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C.  28 (30 USCA  28)), the owner is required to perform labor of the value of $100 annually, but a failure to do so does not ipso facto forfeit his claim, but only renders it subject to loss by relocation. The law is clear 'that no relocation can be made if work be resumed after default and before such relocation.' Thus, prior to the passage of the Leasing Act of 1920, the annual performance of labor 'was not necessary to preserve the possessory right, with all the incidents of ownership above stated, as against the United States, but only as against subsequent relocators. So far as the government was concerned, failure to do assessment work for any year was without effect. Whenever $500 worth of labor in the aggregate had been performed, other requirements aside, the owner became entitled to a patent, even though in some years annual assessment labor had been omitted.' Wilbur v. U.S. ex rel. Krushnic, supra.\n There was authority in the Secretary of the Interior, by appropriate proceedings, to determine that a claim was invalid for lack of discovery, fraud, or other defect, or that it was subject to cancellation by reason of abandonment. Cameron v. United States, \n252 \nU.S. 450, 460\n, 40 S.Ct. 410; Cole v. Ralph, \n252 \nU.S. 286, 296\n, 40 S.Ct. 321; Black v. Elkhorn Mining Co., \n163 \nU.S. 445, 450\n, 16 S.Ct. 1101; Brown v.

Instead of the acquisition or rights by location, the act provided for leases. But by express provision, the act saved existing valid claims 'thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated, which claims may be perfected under such laws.' Section 37 of the act (30 USCA  193).2 What then was the status of plaintiff's claims under this exception? They were originally valid claims. No question is raised to the contrary. There is no suggestion of \n\n[295 U.S. 639, 646]\n\u00a0\n lack of discovery, fraud, or other defect. There is no ground for a charge of abandonment. The allegations of the bill, admitted by the motion to dismiss, dispose of any such contention. Plaintiff had lost no rights by failure to do the annual assessment work; that failure gave the government no ground of forfeiture. Wilbur v. U.S. ex rel. Krushnic, supra.\n How could the valid claims of plaintiff be 'thereafter maintained in compliance with the laws under which initiated'? Manifestly, by a resumption of work. Plaintiff was entitled to resume, and the bill alleged that plaintiff had made arrangements for resumption, and that work would have been resumed if the Department of the Interior had not intervened. Plaintiff's rights after resumption would have been as if 'no default had occurred.' Belk v. Meagher, supra. Such a resumption would have been an act 'not in derogation, but in affirmance, of the original location,' and thereby the claim would have been 'maintained.' As we said in Wilbur v. U. S. ex rel. Krushnic, supra, \n280 U.S. 306\n, page 318, 50 S.Ct. 103, 105, 'Such resumption does not restore a lost estate; ... it preserves an existing estate.'\n In this view, plaintiff came directly within the exception. The government invokes the new policy of the Leasing Act abolishing the practice of location. But the saving provision of section 37 is a part of the policy of the act. Its terms explicitly declare the will of Congress as to valid existing claims, with full understanding of the status of such claims under the prior law.\n The government refers to the reservation in the opinion in Wilbur v. U.S. ex rel. Krushnic, supra, as to the maintenance of a claim by a resumption of work 'unless at least some form of challenge on behalf of the United States to the valid existence of the claim has intervened.' But that was a reservation, not a decision, and it does not aid the government in its contention here. To be effective, the \n\n[295 U.S. 639, 647]\n\u00a0\n 'challenge' to the 'valid existence' of a claim must have some proper basis. No such basis is shown.\n We think that the Department's challenge, its adverse proceedings, and the decision set forth in the bill went beyond the authority conferred by law. The decree is affirmed.\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Section 37 of the Act of February 25, 1920, c. 85, 41 Stat. 437, 451 (30 U.S.C.  193 (30 USCA  193)) is as follows:\n'Sec. 37.

Gen., and David E. Hudson, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, as executors of the estate of William M. Greene, who died in 1930, filed an estate tax return and \n\n[296 U.S. 220, 221]\n\u00a0\n paid the amount of the federal estate tax disclosed thereby. A paid-up life insurance policy of $42,000 was omitted from the return. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue declared a deficiency and included the amount of this policy in the gross estate. Petitioners filed a claim for refund, which was rejected by the Commissioner. Thereupon, this proceeding was brought in the Court of Claims to recover the amount of the claim. That court held against the right to recover and dismissed the petition.\n The policy, issued in 1892, promised to make payment to the wife of the decedent, as sole beneficiary if living; and, if not living, to the surviving children of the decedent; and, in the event of none surviving, then to the executors, administrators, or assigns of the decedent. In 1912, the policy became a paid-up policy requiring no futher payment of premiums. No power was reserved to change beneficiaries, borrow on the policy, or surrender it. The wife of the decedent predeceased him; but he was survived by three children, to whom the proceeds of the policy were paid upon his death.\n The case of Lewellyn v. Frick, \n268 \nU.S. 238\n, 45 S.Ct. 487, arose under the Revenue Act of 1918. This case arises under the Act of 1926,  302(g), 26 USCA  411(g), which is the same as section 402(f) of the former act (40 Stat. 1097). Subdivision (h) of the 1926 act, 26 USCA  411(h), however, provides that subdivisions (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) shall apply to 'transfers, trusts, estates, interests, rights, powers, and relinquishment of powers, as severally enumerated and described therein, whether made, created, arising, existing, exercised, or relinquished before or after the enactment of this Act (February 26, 1926).' Whether any of these terms apply to an amount receivable by a beneficiary, under a policy such as we have here, is fairly debatable. See Wyeth v. Crooks (D.C.) 33 F.(2d) 1018, 1019. If any of them do apply, the provision is open to grave doubt as to its constitutionality, and the rule of the Frick Case controls. \n\n[296 U.S. 220, 222]\n\u00a0\n The foregoing facts bring the case clearly within our decision just announced in Bingham v.

Zucker, both of Newark, N.J., for petitioner.\n Mr. Saul Nemser, of Jersey City, N.J., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In this case the question is whether a creditor of a bankrupt, who has recovered a portion of the debt owed him by foreclosure of a mortgage on property not owned by the bankrupt, may prove for the full amount of the debt, or only for the balance required to make him whole.\n The owners of real estate in Newark, N.J., executed to the petitioner a bond in the penal sum of $23,000, conditioned for the payment of $11,500, secured by a mortgage on the land. The mortgagors subsequently conveyed the premises to the Eastern Sash & Door Company, which expressly assumed the mortgage debt. That company afterward conveyed to one Yavne. A default occurred, and the petitioner filed a foreclosure bill against Yavne. The amount due was found to be $10,220.96, \n\n[295 U.S. 243, 245]\n\u00a0\n with interest and costs. The property was sold by the sheriff and bid in by the petitioner for $100. Meanwhile the sash and door company had been adjudicated a bankrupt. The petitioner presented a claim against the estate for $10,739.94, the amount then due on the bond less the $100 bid at the sale. It was stipulated that the mortgaged property acquired in foreclosure was worth $9,000. The referee reduced the claim to the difference-$1,739.94-and ruled the petitioner was not entitled to prove for any greater sum. The District Court and the Circuit Court of Appeals have held the referee's ruling was right. \n1\n The result appearing to be contrary to the weight of authority2 we granted certiorari. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Decision must be governed by relevant provisions of the Bankruptcy Act. The definition found in section 1(23)4 is:\n\"Secured creditor' shall include a creditor who has security for his debt upon the property of the bankrupt of a nature to be assignable under this Act (title), or who owns such a debt for which some indorser, surety, or other persons secondarily liable for the bankrupt has such security upon the bankrupt's assets.'\n\n Section 57e5 directs that 'claims of secured creditors ... shall be allowed for such sums only as to the courts seem to be owing over and above the value of their securities. ...'\n Unless the petitioner was a secured creditor as defined by section 1( 23), it was not bound to have its security or the avails thereof valued and to prove only for the difference between that value and the face amount of the debt. Petitioner does not come within the definition, for at the date of bankruptcy it held no security against the bank- \n\n[295 U.S. 243, 246]\n\u00a0\n rupt company's property nor security given by any other person who in turn was secured by the bankrupt's assets. \n6\n Sections 1(23) and 57e do not, therefore, forbid the proof of a claim for the principal of the bond with interest, though the petitioner may not collect and retain dividends which with the sum realized from the foreclosure will more than make up that amount. The court below was of this opinion, but thought that section 68a7 forbade proof of a claim for more than the balance of the debt after application of the avails of the foreclosure. That section directs: 'In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other, and the balance only shall be allowed or paid.' The theory upon which this section was held to control the right to prove was thus stated:\n'While the obligation of the bankrupt to pay the mortgage still remained, the mortgagee had gotten possession of the security, and, in enforcing this obligation against the bankrupt, the appellant-creditor ( petitioner) must reduce its claim by the admitted value of the security less the $100 paid for it. The bankrupt owed the appellant (petitioner) the amount of the mortgage, and the appellant (petitioner) equitably owed the bankrupt the value of the security in his possession.' \n\n[295 U.S. 243, 247]\n\u00a0\n This novel application of section 68a is, we think, inadmissible. A creditor holding security, who realizes upon it, does not 'owe' his debtor the amount realized. The wellunderstood concept of mutual debts does not embrace such a situation as is here disclosed.\n\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 73 F.(2d) 609, 610. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rule 38, subd. 5(b), 28 USCA following section 354. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n294 \nU.S. 700\n, 55 S.Ct. 507, 79 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] U.S.C. tit. 11,  1(23), 11 USCA  1(23). \n[\nFootnote 5\n] U.S.C. tit. 11,  93(e), 11 USCA  93(e). \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] The point was involved and necessarily decided, though not adverted to, in Hiscock v.

The question is whether the trust may be upheld.\n On December 29, 1931, the Commercial Trust Company of Gary, Ind., as maker, delivered to the respondent, United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, a check to the order of respondent in the sum of $2,196.89 upon the Gary State Bank of Gary, Ind., as drawee. The check, duly indorsed by the payee, was deposited in a bank in Indianapolis, and thereafter was transmitted for collection to the National Bank of America at Gary, Ind., being received for that purpose on December 31, 1931. At that time both the collecting bank (the National Bank of America) and the drawee bank ( Gary State Bank) were members of the Gary Clearing House Association. In accordance with banking custom, the National Bank of America delivered to the local clearing house whatever checks in its possession were payable by the member banks (a total of $10,425.45) including the foregoing item of $ 2,196.89, and received in return the checks drawn on itself ($11,470.19). The outcome was a debit balance of $1,044.74, which it paid on the same day by a draft, thereafter duly honored, to the order of the clearing house. At the same time it delivered to the forwarding bank in Indianapolis a draft for $3,660.83, which covered along with other items the check for $2,196.89, collected from the drawee in the manner just described. Before the draft so transmitted could be honored, its maker, the collecting bank, had been forced to close its doors (January 4, 1932), and the Comptroller of the Currency was in possession of the business. \n\n[294 U.S. 216, 219]\n\u00a0\n This action which was begun in a state court in Indiana and was thereupon removed to a United States District Court, was brought by the United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, payee of the check for $2,196. 89, against the collecting bank and Jennings, its receiver, to impress a trust upon the assets to the extent of the proceeds of collection, and for payment accordingly. The District Court held that the payee was entitled to a preference over the general creditors of the insolvent bank, and entered a decree for the face amount of the check with interest.

Upon appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the decree was modified as to the interest, and as modified affirmed. National Bank v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 71 F.(2d) 618. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n293 \nU.S. 543\n, 55 S.Ct. 112, 79 L.Ed. --.\n There was in force in Indiana in 1931 a statute known as the Bank Collection Code (Indiana Acts 1929, c. 1641), which is applicable to national banks in so far as it is consistent with the policy or provisions, express or reasonably implied, of the National Bank Act (12 USCA  21 et seq.) or of other federal acts of paramount authority. Lewis v. Fidelity & Deposit Co. of Maryland, \n292 \nU.S. 559, 566\n, 54 S.Ct. 848, 92 A.L.R. 794; First National Bank v. Missouri, \n293 \nU.S. 640, 656\n, 44 S.Ct. 213. Under that Code ( 2), the relation between the forwarding bank and the collecting bank is that of principal and agent until the agent has completed the business of collection. Whether a fiduciary relation continues even afterwards, upon the theory that the proceeds of the collection until remitted to the forwarder are subject to a trust, depends upon the circumstances. In the absence of tokens of a contrary intention, the better doctrine is, where the common law prevails, that the agency of the collecting bank is brought \n\n[294 U.S. 216, 220]\n\u00a0\n to an end by the collection of the paper, the bank from then on being in the position of a debtor, with liberty, like debtors generally, to use the proceeds as its own.

Austin (C.C.) 48 F. 25, 32.2 'One who collects commercial paper through the agency of banks must be held to impliedly contract that the business may be done according to their wellknown usages, so far as to permit the money collected to be mingled with the funds of the collecting bank.' Freeman's National Bank v. National Tube-Works, supra. There is a contention for the respondent that the rule at common law has been modified by statute. We shall consider later on whether the change, if any, is material upon the record now before us.\n At the closing of its doors on January 4, 1932, the collecting bank at Gary had finished the business of collection, and had arrived at the stage when it was subject to a duty, either as trustee or as debtor, to make remittance of the proceeds. In the method of collection there had been no departure from the ruling of this court in Federal Reserve Bank v. Malloy, \n264 \nU.S. 160\n, 44 S.Ct. 296, 31 A.L.R. 1261, that an agent bank is at fault when it accepts anything but cash in the absence of custom or agreement for the acceptance \n\n[294 U.S. 216, 221]\n\u00a0\n of a substitute. To preclude the extension of that ruling to collections through a clearing house the Bank, Collection Code makes provision in section 9 (Acts Ind. 1929, c. 164) for media of payment that are to be deemed equivalent to currency. There may now be acceptance of a bank draft, or settlement through a clearing house in the customary manner, without involving the agent in liability for damages if the draft is dishonored or the credit subsequently revoked. \n3\n On the other hand, when credit ceases to be provisional, or when the accepted instrument is paid, the collecting bank is liable as debtor, if not otherwise, to the same extent as if payment had been made in cash over the counter. One duty (the duty to collect) is at an end, and another (the duty to remit) has arisen in its place.\n To say that a collecting agent may be held to the liability of a debtor 'as if' payment had been made in cash is not to say that the two methods of collection are \n\n[294 U.S. 216, 222]\n\u00a0\n equivalent for every other purpose. More particularly it does not mean that they are equivalent for the purpose of identifying a res to be subjected to a trust. The distinction is made definite by the controversy before us. What happened in the clearing house was this, that a check for $ 2,196.89, due to the collecting bank as agent or fiduciary, was used to cancel or extinguish liability upon a check or checks of equal amount due from it as principal, all with the sanction of statute and with the tacit assent of the forwarder or owner. At the close of the day there was not a dollar in the treasury of the agent that could be identified as part of the proceeds of collection or as a substitute therefor. If the money had been paid over the counter with the understanding that it was accepted as a special deposit (Blakey v. Brinson, \n286 \nU.S. 254, 262\n, 263 S., 52 S.Ct. 516, 82 A.L.R. 1288; People v. City Bank of Rochester, 96 N.Y. 32; Genesee Wesleyan Seminary v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 247 N.Y. 52, 55, 159 N.E. 720, 56 A.L.R. 964), the doctrine of a continuing trust would charge the agent with a duty to set the proceeds of collection apart from other assets, and hold them intact for transmission to the forwarder. Nothing of the kind was done. Nothing of the kind was required or expected to be done. On the contrary, the statute gave notice to the agent that instead of establishing a trust, it was at liberty to set off what was due to it in one capacity against what was owing by it in another, being liable, however, as debtor when the set off became final.\n We are not concerned at this time with a constructive trust in the strict sense, a trust ex maleficio, which may be fastened upon a wrongdoer irrespective of intention. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence, vol. 1,  155; vol. 3,  1044, 1046. There was no wrongdoing here, but conduct wholly regular, with the result that any trust existing must be one implied in fact. In that situation there is no basis for a holding that a trust was transferred \n\n[294 U.S. 216, 223]\n\u00a0\n from the proceeds of collection to an equivalent part of the cash resources of the agent, the beneficial interest of the principal being unaffected by the set off. Cf. Knatchbull v. Hallett, 13 Ch.Div. 696; Central National Bank v. Insurance Co., \n104 U.S. 54\n, 68; Schuyler v. Littlefield, \n232 \nU.S. 707\n, 34 S.Ct. 466. To draw such an inference, far from promoting intention, would ignore and override it. By a permitted course of dealing the proceeds of the check, instead of being deposited upon collection in the vaults of the collecting agent, were specifically appropriated to the discharge of other obligations. There was not even a partial or proportionate payment that could have found its way into the vaults, for the balance at the close of the operations of the day was adverse to the collector and in favor of the clearing house. These being the facts, there is no room in our view for the use of those presumptions that affect the conduct of a wrongdoer who draws upon a mingled fund made up of his own moneys and another's. Knatchbull v. Hallett, supra; Central National Bank v. Insurance Co., supra. The presumption collapses when there is neither trust nor wrong.\n For the purposes of this case we do not need to determine whether the Bank Collection Code has changed the preexisting rule whereby in the absence of tokens of a contrary intention a bank ceases to be an agent and is turned into a debtor when collection is complete, without reference to the form or manner of the payment. If we assume for present purposes that a trust will attach under the statute when the proceeds of the collection are in the hands of the collector, the assumption will not hold where there are no proceeds of collection that have ever come into his hands, or where such proceeds as there were have been so mingled and confused that it is impossible to follow them. Currency paid over the counter and deposited in a vault is a thing that can be identified and so subjected to a trust whenever in equity and conscience \n\n[294 U.S. 216, 224]\n\u00a0\n a trust should be implied. Not only that, but a trust so created will not fail though other dollars may have taken the place of those originally received, for dollars are fungibles and any one of them will be accepted as a substitute for another. Knatchbull v. Hallett, supra. But the situation is very different when what has been received by the collecting agent is not a thing at all, but a reduction of liabilities by set off or release.

What was done by the collecting bank through a settlement in the clearing house has not increased the assets available for distribution in the hands of the receiver. What was done through that settlement has had no effect after insolvency except to diminish liabilities. The dividend that would be due upon the debts canceled through the set off if they were now \n\n[294 U.S. 216, 225]\n\u00a0\n to be revived is the measure of any benefit accruing to the creditors. Decisions of other courts, to the extent that they give support for a different conclusion are built, as we think, upon an inadequate analysis, and do not win our approval. \n5\n It is the benefit to the creditors, not the loss to the respondent, that marks the gain to the fund now held by the receiver. If the respondent is permitted to prove against the assets on a parity with other creditors, the share thus allotted will correspond accurately to whatever accretion has resulted from the act of set off and cancellation in the operations of the clearing house.\n One other section of the Bank Collection Code is still to be considered. This is section 13 (Acts Ind. 1929, c. 164), which has to do, as its caption indicates, with the procedure following insolvency. What is regulated in that section is not the relation between a bank and its correspondents during the normal course of business. What is regulated is the relation and the remedy when insolvency has set in and business is suspended. \n6\n Then for the first time a trust comes into \n\n[294 U.S. 216, 226]\n\u00a0\n being through the action of the statute, a trust coextensive in its subject matter with all the assets of the bank, irrespective of their nature, and yet a trust for a special class, the owners of negotiable instruments whose debts remain unsatisfied after payment of the paper has been collected by the agent. Cf. Spradlin v. Royal Manufacturing Co. (C.C. A.) 73 F. (2d) 776. 'Such owner or owners shall be entitled to a preferred claim upon such assets, irrespective of whether the fund representing such item or items can be traced and identified as part of such assets or has been intermingled with or converted into other assets of such failed bank.' Section 13. A trust so created, to arise upon insolvency, is a preference under another name. As applied to a national bank, the preference is plainly inconsistent with the system of equal distribution established by the federal law. Rev. St.  5236, 12 U.S.C.  194 (12 USCA  194); Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank, \n161 \nU.S. 275, 283\n, 284 S., 16 S.Ct. 502; Easton v. Iowa, \n188 \nU.S. 220, 229\n, 23 S.Ct. 288; Cook County National Bank v.

'Where ordinary care is exercised, any agent collecting bank may receive in payment of an item without becoming responsible as debtor therefor, whether presented by mail, through the clearing house or over the counter of the drawee or payor, in lieu of money, either (a) the check or draft of the drawee or payor upon another bank or (b) the check or draft of any other bank upon any bank other than the drawee or payor of the item or (c) such method of settlement as may be customary in a local clearing house or between clearing banks or otherwise: Provided, That whenever such agent collecting bank shall request or accept in payment an unconditional credit which has been given to it on the books of the drawee or payor or on the books of any other bank, such agent collecting bank shall become debtor for such item and shall be responsible therefor as if the proceeds were actually received by it in money.'\n The time within which credit, when once given, may be revoked is defined by section 3 (Acts Ind. 1929, c. 164): 'A credit given by a bank for an item drawn on or payable at such bank shall be provisional, subject to revocation at or before the end of the day on which the item is deposited in the event the item is found not payable for any reason. Whenever a credit is given for an item deposited after banking hours such right of revocation may be exercised during the following business day.' \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Many cases are collected in Bogert, Failed Banks, Collection Items and Trust Preferences, 29 Mich.

NELSON CO. v. HELVERING(1935)\nNo. 61\nArgued: Decided: December 16, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 374, 375]\n\u00a0\n Mr. J. S. Seidman, of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. J. Louis Monarch, of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner contests a deficiency income assessment made on account of alleged gains during 1926. It claims that the transaction out of which the assessment arose was reorganization within the statute. Section 203, Revenue Act, 1926, c. 27, 44 Stat. 9, 11 (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note), is relied upon. The \n\n[296 U.S. 374, 376]\n\u00a0\n pertinent parts are in the margin of the opinion in Helvering v. Minnesota Tea Co., \n296 \nU.S. 378\n, 56 S.Ct. 269, announced this day.\n In 1926, under an agreement with petitioner, the Elliott-Fisher Corporation organized a new corporation with 12,500 shares non-voting preferred stock and 30,000 shares of common stock. It purchased the latter for $2,000,000 cash. This new corporation then acquired substantially all of petitioner's property, except $100,000, in return for $2,000,000 cash and the entire issue of preferred stock. Part of this cash was used to retire petitioner's own preferred shares, and the remainder and the preferred stock of the new company went to its stockholders. It retained its franchise and $100,000, and continued to be liable for certain obligations. The preferred stock so distributed, except in case of default, had no voice in the control of the issuing corporation.\n The Commissioner, Board of Tax Appeals, and the court all concluded there was no reorganization. This, we think, was error.\n The court below thought the facts showed 'that the transaction essentially constituted a sale of the greater part of petitioner's assets for cash and the preferred stock in the new corporation, leaving the Elliott-Fisher Company in entire control of the new corporation by virtue of its ownership of the common stock.'\n'The controlling facts leading to this conclusion are that petitioner continued its corporate existence and its franchise and retained a portion of its assets; that it acquired no controlling interest in the corporation to which it delivered the greater portion of its assets; that there was no continuity of interest from the old corporation to the new; that the control of the property conveyed passed to a stranger, in the management of which petitioner retained no voice. \n\n[296 U.S. 374, 377]\n\u00a0\n 'It follows that the transaction was not part of a strict merger or consolidation or part of something that partakes of the nature of a merger or consolidation and has a real semblance to a merger or consolidation involving a continuance of essentially the same interests through a new modified corporate structure. Mere acquisition by one corporation of a majority of the stock or all the assets of another corporation does not of itself constitute a reorganization, where such acquisition takes the form of a purchase and sale and does not result in or bear some material resemblance to a merger or consolidation.'\n\n True, the mere acquisition of the assets of one corporation by another does not amount to reorganization within the statutory definition. Pinellas, Ice & Cold Storage Co. v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, \n287 \nU.S. 462\n, 53 S.Ct. 257, so affirmed. But where, as here, the seller acquires a definite and substantial interest in the affairs of the purchasing corporation, a wholly different situation arises. The owner of preferred stock is not without substantial interest in the affairs of the issuing corporation, although denied voting rights. The statute does not require participation in the management of the purchaser; nor does it demand that the conveying corporation be dissolved. A controlling interest in the transferee corporation is not made a requisite by section 203(h)(1)( A) (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note). This must not be confused with paragraph (h)( 2) (26 U.S.C.A.  112 note).\n Finally, as has been pointed out in the Minnesota Tea Case, paragraph ( h)(1) (B) was not intended to modify the provisions of paragraph (h)(1)(A). It describes a class. Whether some overlapping is possible is not presently important.\n The judgment below must be reversed. \n\n\n\n","100":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJURNEY v.

The writ issued; the body of the petitioner was produced before that court; and the case was then heard on demurrer to the petition. The trial court discharged the writ and dismissed the petition. The Court of Appeals, two justices dissenting, reversed that judgment and remanded the case to the Supreme Court of the District, with directions to discharge the prisoner from custody. 63 App.D.C. 342, 72 F.(2d) 560. This Court granted certiorari because of the importance of the question presented. \n293 \nU.S. 543\n, 55 S.Ct. 113, 79 L.Ed. --.\n The petition alleges that McCracken was, on February 12, 1934, arrested, and is held, under a warrant issued on February 9, 1934, after MacCracken had respectfully declined to appear before the bar of the Senate in response to a citation served upon him pursuant to Resolution 172, adopted by the Senate on February 5, 1934. The resolution provides: \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 144]\n\u00a0\n 'Resolved, That the President of the Senate issue a citation directing William P. MacCracken, Jr., L. H. Brittin, Gilbert Givven, and Harris M. Hanshue to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt of the Senate, on account of the destruction and removal of certain papers, files, and memorandums from the files of William P. MacCracken, Jr., after a subpoena had been served upon william P. MacCracken, Jr., as shown by the report of the Special Senate Committee Investigating Ocean and Air Mail Contracts.'\n It is conceded that the Senate was engaged in an inquiry which it had the constitutional power to make; that the committee1 had authority to require the production of papers as a necessary incident of the power of legislation; and that the Senate had the power to coerce their production by means of arrest. McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135\n, 47 S.Ct. 319, 50 A.L.R. 1. No. question is raised as to the propriety of the scope of the subpoena duces tecum, or as to the regularity of any of the proceedings which preceded the arrest. The claim of privilege hereinafter referred to is no longer an issue. MacCracken's sole contention is that the Senate was without power to arrest him with a view to punishing him, because the act complained of-the alleged destruction and removal of the papers after service of the subpoena-was 'the past commission of a completed act which prior to the arrest and the proceedings to punish had reached such a stage of finality that it could not longer affect the proceedings of the Senate or any Committee thereof, and which, and the effects of which, had been undone long before the arrest.'\n The petition occupies, with exhibits, 100 pages of the printed record in this Court; but the only additional aver- \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 145]\n\u00a0\n ments essential to the decision of the question presented are, in substance, these: The Senate had appointed the special committee to make 'a full, complete and detailed inquiry into all existing contracts entered into by the Postmaster General for the carriage of air mail and ocean mail.' MacCracken had been served, on January 31, 1934, with a subpoena duces tecum to appear 'instanter' before the committee and to bring all books of account and papers 'relating to air mail and ocean mail contracts.' The witness appeared on that day; stated that he is a lawyer, member of the firm of MacCracken & Lee, with offices in the District; that he was ready to produce all papers which he lawfully could; but that many of those in his possession were privileged communications between himself and corporations or individuals for whom he had acted as attorney; that he could not lawfully produce such papers without the client first having waived the privilege; and that, unless he secured such a waiver, he must exercise his own judgment as to what papers were within the privilege. He gave, however, to the committee the names of these clients; stated the character of services rendered for each; and, at the suggestion of the committee, telegraphed to each asking whether consent to disclose confidential communications would be given. From some of the clients he secured immediately unconditional consent; and on February 1 produced all the papers relating to the business of the clients who had so consented.\n On February 2, before the committee had decided whether the production of all the papers should be compelled despite the claims of privilege, MacCracken again appeared and testified as follows: On February 1 he personally permitted Givven, a representative of Western Air Express, to examine, without supervision, the files containing papers concerning that company; and authorized \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 146]\n\u00a0\n him to take therefrom papers which did not relate to air mail contracts. Givven, in fact, took some papers which did relate to air mail contracts. On the same day, Brittin, vice president of Northwest Airways, Inc., without MacCracken's knowledge, requested and received from his partner Lee permission to examine the files relating to that company's business and to remove therefrom some papers stated by Brittin to have been dictated by him in Lee's office and to be wholly personal and unrelated to matters under investigation by the committee. Brittin removed from the files some papers; took them to his office; and, with a view to destroying them, tore them into pieces and threw the pieces into a waste paper basket.\n Upon the conclusion of MacCracken's testimony on February 2, the committee decided that none of the papers in his possession could be withheld under the claim of privilege. \n2\n Later that day MacCracken received from the rest of his clients waivers of their privilege; and thereupon promptly made available to the committee all the papers then remaining in the files. On February 3 (after a request therefor by MacCracken), Givven restored to the files what he stated were all the papers taken by him. The petition does not allege that any of the papers taken by \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 147]\n\u00a0\n Brittin were later produced. \n3\n It avers that, prior to the adoption of the citation for contempt under Resolution 172, MacCracken had produced and delivered to the Senate of the United States, 'to the best of his ability, knowledge and belief, every paper of every kind and description in his possession or under his control, relating in any way to air mail and ocean mail contracts; (and that) on February 5, 1934 ... all of said papers were turned over and delivered to said Senate Committee and since that date they have been, and they now are, in the possession of said Committee.'\n First. The main contention of MacCracken is that the so-called power to punish for contempt may never be exerted, in the case of a private citizen, solely qua punishment. The argument is that the power may by used by the legislative body merely as a means of removing an existing obstruction to the performance of its duties; that the power to punish ceases as soon as the obstruction has been removed, or its removal has become impossible; and hence that there is no power to punish a witness who, having been requested to produce papers, destroys them after service of the supoena. The contention rests upon a misconception of the limitations upon the power of the Houses of Congress to punish for contempt. It is true that the scope of the power is narrow. No act is so punish- \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 148]\n\u00a0\n able unless it is of a nature to obstruct the performance of the duties of the Legislature. There may be lack of power, because, as in Kilbourn v. Thompson, \n103 U.S. 168\n, there was no legislative duty to be performed, or because, as in Marshall v. Gordon, \n243 \nU.S. 521\n, 37 S.Ct. 448, L.R.A. 1917F, 279, Ann. Cas. 1918B, 371, the act complained of is deemed not to be of a character to obstruct the legislative process. But, where the offending act was of a nature to obstruct the legislative process, the fact that the obstruction has since been removed, or that its removal has become impossible, is without legal significance.\n The power to punish a private citizen for a past and completed act was exerted by Congress as early as 1795;4 and since then it has been exercised on several occasions. \n5\n It was asserted, before the Revolution, by the colonial \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 149]\n\u00a0\n assemblies, in imitation of the British House of Commons; and afterwards by the Continental Congress and by state legislative bodies. \n6\n In Anderson v. Dunn, 6 Wheat. 204, decided in 1821, it was held that the House had power to punish a private citizen for an attempt to bribe a member. No case has been found in which an exertion of the power to punish for contempt has been successfully challenged on the ground that, before punishment, the offending act had been consummated or that the obstruction suffered was irremediable. The statements in the opinion in Marshall v. Gordon, supra, upon which MacCracken relies, must be read in the light of the particular facts. It was there recognized that the only jurisdictional test to be applied by the court is the character of the offense; and that the continuance of the obstruction, or the likelihood of its repetition, are considerations for the discretion of the legislators in meting out the punishment.\n Here, we are concerned, not with an extension of congressional privilege, but with vindication of the estab- \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 150]\n\u00a0\n lished and essential privilege of requiring the production of evidence. For this purpose, the power to punish for a past contempt is an appropriate means. \n7\n Compare Ex parte Nugent, Fed. Cas. No. 10,375; Stewart v. Blaine, 1 MacArthur (8 D.C.) 453. The apprehensions expressed from time to time in congressional debates, in opposition to particular exercises of the contempt power, concerned, not the power to punish, as such, but the broad, undefined privileges which it was believed might find sanction in that power. \n8\n The ground for such fears has since been effectively removed by the decisions of this Court which hold that assertions of congressional privilege are subject to judicial review, Kilbourn v. Thompson, supra; and that the power to punish for contempt may not be extended to slanderous attacks which present no immediate obstruction to legislative processes, Marshall v. Gordon, supra. \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 151]\n\u00a0\n Second. The power of either House of Congress to punish for contempt was not impaired by the enactment in 1857 of the statute, Rev. St.  102 ( 2 USCA  192), making refusal to answer or to produce papers before either House, or one of its committees, a misdemeanor. Compare Sinclair v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 263\n, 49 S.Ct. 268. The statute was enacted, not because the power of the Houses to punish for a past contempt was doubted, but because imprisonment limited to the duration of the session was not considered sufficiently drastic a punishment for contumacious witnesses. \n9\n That the purpose of the statute was merely to supplement the power of contempt by providing for additional punishment was recognized in In re Chapman, \n166 \nU.S. 661, 671\n, 672 S., 17 S.Ct. 677, 681: 'We grant that congress could not devest itself, or either of its houses, of the essential and inherent power to punish for contempt, in cases to which the power of either house properly extended; but because congress, by the act of 1857, sought to aid each of the houses in the discharge of its constitutional functions, it does not follow that any delegation of the power in each to punish for contempt was involved, and the statute is not open to objection on that account.' Punishment, purely as such, through contempt proceedings, legislative or judicial, is not precluded because punishment may also be inflicted for the same act as a statutory offense. Compare Ex parte Hudgings, \n249 \nU.S. 378, 382\n, 39 S.Ct. 337, 11 A.L.R. 333.10 As was said in In re Chapman, supra, 'the same act may be an offense against one jurisdiction and also an offense against another; and indictable statutory offenses may be punished as such, while the offenders may likewise be sub- \n\n[294 U.S. 125, 152]\n\u00a0\n jected to punishment for the same acts as contempts, the two being diverso intuitu, and capable of standing together.'\n Third. MacCracken contends that he is not punishable for contempt, because the obstruction, if any, which he caused to legislative processes, had been entirely removed and its evil effects undone before the contempt proceedings were instituted. He points to the allegations in the petition for habeas corpus that he had surrendered all papers in his possession; that he was ready and willing to give any additional testimony which the committee might require; that he had secured the return of the papers taken from the files by Givven, with his permission; and that he was in no way responsible for the removal and destruction of the papers by Brittin. This contention goes to the question of guilt, not to that of the jurisdiction of the Senate. The contempt with which MacCracken is charged is 'the destruction and removal of certain papers.' Whether he is guilty, and whether he has so far purged himself of contempt that he does not now deserve punishment, are the questions which the Senate proposes to try. The respondent to the petition did not, by demurring, transfer to the court the decision of those questions. The sole function of the writ of habeas corpus is to have the court decide whether the Senate has jurisdiction to make the determination which it proposes. Compare Barry v. United States ex rel. Cunningham, \n279 \nU.S. 597\n, 49 S.Ct. 452; Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219\n, 35 S.Ct. 54; In re Gregory, \n219 \nU.S. 210\n, 31 S.Ct. 143.\n The judgment of the Court of Appeals should be reversed; and that of the Supreme Court of the District should be affirmed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pursuant to Senate Resolution 349, Seventy-Second Congress, Second Session. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Upon the conclusion of the hearing on February 2, the committee made to the Senate a report (No. 254) setting forth the facts elicited. Thereupon the Senate, by Resolution No. 169, directed a warrant to issue, commanding the sergeant at arms to take MacCracken into custody before the bar of the Senate; 'to bring with him the correspondence ... referred to and then and there to answer such questions pertinent to the matter under inquiry ... as the Senate may propound. ...' The warrant was served on February 2, 1934; MacCracken was paroled in the custody of his counsel to appear at the bar of the Senate at noon, February 5, 1934. On that day (in view of Resolution No. 172) he was released from custody under Resolution No. 169; and the proceedings under Resolution No. 169 are not here involved. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] But the brief for MacCracken, the respondent, states: 'By February 6th every recoverable paper involved in the Brittin incident had been recovered and delivered to the Senate.' The reference in the brief is to the fact (to which attention was called by counsel for Jurney) that, after MacCracken and Brittin had testified, post office inspectors, acting for the committee, searched the sacks of waste papers taken from Brittin's office; and succeeded in collecting most of the pieces of the papers which Brittin destroyed. By pasting these pieces together they were able to restore for the committee most of the papers removed from the Northwest Airways, Inc., files. (Senate Document No. 162, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 106-116.) \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Robert Randall and Charles Whitney were taken into custody by the House of Representatives, on December 28, 1975, on charges of attempting to bribe some of its members. Whitney was discharged on January 7, 1796, before trial. Randall, however, on January 6, was found guilty of a contempt and of a breach of the privileges of the House, was reprimanded by the Speaker, and was committed to the custody of the sergeant at arms until further order of the House. On January 13 his petition to be discharged from custody was granted, upon payment of fees. 5 Annals, 4th Cong., 1st Sess., 166-195, 232, 200-229, 237, 243. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] In 1832, Samuel Houston, having been arrested and tried by the House of Representatives for assaulting a member, was reprimanded and discharged on payment of fees. 8 Debates, 22d Cong., 1st Sess., 2512-2620, 2810-3022.

NORTHWEST ENGINEERING CORP.(1935)\nNo. 131\nArgued: December 5, 1934Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 42, 43]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Clarence P. Byrnes, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for petitioner.\n Mr. Frank Parker Davis, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The petitioner brought suit against each respondent in the District Court for Eastern Wisconsin, charging infringement of claim 4 of the Clutter patent, No. 1,317,431, claims 6 and 7 of the Wagner patent, No. 1, 476,121, and claims 6 and 9 to 14, inclusive, of the Downie patent, No. 1, 511,114. The suits were consolidated, and the court found that the claims were valid and infringed. The Circuit Court of Appeals concluded that none of the respondents' machines infringed claim 4 of the Clutter patent, and that the specified claims of the Wagner and Downie \n\n[294 U.S. 42, 44]\n\u00a0\n patents were invalid for lack of invention. \n1\n By reason of asserted conflict of decision2 we granted certiorari. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The patents in question relate to excavator attachments used in connection with a base carrying suitable machinery for operating the lines or cables controlling the attachments. As the machinery on the base is no part of the structure disclosed, it is not the subject of any of the patents.\n\n 1. \nThe Clutter Patent.\n Claim 4 of the patent is:\n'In an excavating machine a pivoted boom, a scoop-carrying member pivotally connected therewith, a pulling member for elevating and lowering said boom, a pivotal \n\n[294 U.S. 42, 45]\n\u00a0\n means carried by the boom and connecting the pulling member therewith, and ( with) said scoop-carrying member, a scoop connected with the scoop- carrying member and projecting toward the boom, and a pulling member connected with said scoop.'\n\n In the patent drawing is shown a boom pivoted at its base, and a scoop-carrying member, often called a ditcher stick, pivoted to the outer end of the boom. On the boom near its outer end are two uprights, pivoted to the boom, which support a pulley. Two links extend from the axle of the pulley to the top of the ditcher stick, to which they are pivotally attached. The purpose of the contrivance is to raise and lower the boom and to advance or retract the scoop by taking up or slacking a cable passed through the pulley. A second cable, attached to the scoop, limits the outreach of the ditcher stick and pulls the scoop toward the base to fill it with earth. Thus by tension on the hoisting line the boom can be raised and the scoop held out beyond the end of the boom; by slacking on that line the boom can be lowered until the scoop comes into contact with the earth; by tension on the scoop line the scoop can be pulled against the earth until it is filled. By again taking up on the hoisting line the boom can be raised, the scoop extended, and placed in position for the discharge of its contents. The respondents found they could accomplish the same results by doing away with the links pivoted to the boom, carrying the pulley and the cross-links connecting the pulley with the stick. In some of their apparatus the line passes over pulleys in brackets rigidly mounted on the boom and is fastened to the upper end of the stick; in others a pulley is attached to a link pivoted to the top of the stick; and in still others the pulley is firmly fixed upon the end of the stick.\n No claim of novelty is made for a pivoted boom, a ditcher stick pivoted on the end of the boom, or a scoop fastened to the bottom of the stick opening toward the \n\n[294 U.S. 42, 46]\n\u00a0\n base. The petitioner asserts that the invention consisted in the pivotal means carried by the boom and pivotally attached to it and to the ditcher stick; that this constituted a revolutionary improvement, which for the first time made in-digging excavators practicable for use in all sorts of material; that, as the patent is basic, it should be liberally construed and a large range of equivalents allowed. The respondents, on the other hand, say the invention is in a developed and crowded art, and both the prior art and the evolution of the claims in the Patent Office proceedings require a strict construction of the claim in suit. They assert that in those of their appliances wherein the pulley is held by immovable brackets on the boom there is no 'pivotal attachment' of the pulley to the boom, and in those wherein the pulley is linked to the upper end of the ditcher stick, or firmly affixed to it, they neither use a 'pivotal means' nor one 'carried by the boom.' The petitioner replies that any pivotal means comes within the claim; that the method shown in the drawing and described in the specifications is merely a preferred form of application; that a pulley is a pivotal means, and, since the ditcher stick is attached to the boom, if the pulley is affixed or linked to the stick, it is necessarily 'carried' by the boom. And as in each of the accused devices the respondents employ a pulley either fixed on the boom or the stick or linked to the latter, each employs pivotal means carried by the boom and pivotally connected with the boom and the stick.\n We hold, in view of the prior art and of the file wrapper, the petitioner is not entitled to a broad reading of the claim. It is unnecessary to determine whether within the language used a pulley is 'a pivotal means,' or if attached only to the stick it is 'carried by the boom,' or whether a pulley so attached can properly be said to connect the pulling member, i.e., the cable, with the boom and the ditcher stick, since a reading of the terms employed as petitioner's position requires precludes patent \n\n[294 U.S. 42, 47]\n\u00a0\n ability, in view of the prior art, and, in addition, would be contrary to the limitation which the Patent Office file wrapper shows the applicant placed upon his asserted invention.\n At the date of filing the application, excavators with pivoted booms, with ditcher sticks pivoted to the booms, with lines attached to the scoop and the ditcher stick, and with sheaves upon the boom and at the upper end of the stick, had been patented, and some had been used. Contrivances of these sorts, in which the same line or cable could be used to elevate the boom and to extend the lower end of the ditcher stick, had been in use and had been patented. \n4\n Prior to Clutter, several excavating machines had embodied the device of attaching a pulley by a link to the top of the ditcher stick of the fixing of a pulley on the end of the stick. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n Clutter's application as shown by the file wrapper broadly claimed 'means for operating the other (upper) end of the pivotally attached member (ditcher stick) so as to adjust either scoop or boom, singly or together, at the will of the operator.' The claim was rejected on the earlier Cross and Fairbanks patents. All of the claims were canceled and new ones submitted, which included claims 3 and 4 of the patent. These two were alike in the use of the phrase 'a pivoted (or pivotal) means carried by the boom and connecting the pulling member therewith and with the scoop- carrying member.' In order to distinguish this construction from that of Cross or Fairbanks, the applicant's solicitor in a printed argument said:\n'... None of the references disclose ... means carried by the boom for connecting the pulling member. ... The applicant was the first in the art to mount a means \n\n[294 U.S. 42, 48]\n\u00a0\n upon the boom for connecting a pulling member therewith but also for connecting the pulling member with the scoop-carrying member.'\n\n Claims 3 and 4 so phrased were allowed, but the applicant continued, without success, to press other claims not so narrowly limited. \n6\n\u00a0\n\n We do not attribute the force of an estoppel to what was said by the claimant in seeking to avoid the prior art cited against his broad claims, but we do apply the principle that, where such broad claims are denied and a narrower substituted, the patentee is estopped to read the granted claim as the equivalent of those which were rejected. \n7\n If the claim should be held to comprehend a pulley linked or fixed to the top of the ditcher stick or immovably fastened to the boom, we find such applications in the prior art, upon the basis of which claims worded so broadly as to embrace this method were rejected by the Patent Office and abandoned by the applicant.\n The claim in suit would not have been allowed without the limitations that the pivotal means was to be 'carried' by the boom, and to 'connect' the pulling member (the cable) with both the boom and the stick. In other words, we find no justification for enlarging the \n\n[294 U.S. 42, 49]\n\u00a0\n scope of what is described, but rather the requirement of strict limitation to that which is specified, namely, a pivotal means carried by the boom and connecting the pulling member with the boom and the stick. We think the court below was right in holding that the respondent's devices did not infringe.\n\n 2. \nThe Wagner Patent.\n This patent is for an 'Excavating Scoop.' Some of the claims have to do with the construction of the scoop and the manner of mounting it on the ditcher stick. These are not in issue. Claims 6 and 7, on which petitioner relies, differ from claim 4 of the Clutter patent only in this respect: The first claims 'means for mounting a sheave to the upper end of the stick' and 'a hoisting line passed about the sheave for raising and lowering the boom and stick, and also for moving the stick outwardly lengthwise of the boom; ...' and the second claims 'a hoisting line connected to the top of the ditcher stick.' One or the other of these claims unquestionably reads upon the respondents' accused devices. But in this patent the applicant adopted the very means of the prior art which was cited against Clutter's application, and necessitated the narrowing of his claims as a condition of allowance. In this prior art both methods described in the Wagner patent for connecting the pulling member to the ditcher stick were employed in excavating appliances. 8 The claims were properly held void for want of novelty.\n\n 3. \nThe Downie Patent.\n Generally speaking, the claimed invention includes three features: In an excavator operating on the principles of that described in the Clutter patent, a certain form of link to connect a pulley to the top of the ditcher stick, a scoop \n\n[294 U.S. 42, 50]\n\u00a0\n rigidly connected to the lower end of the stick, having a drop bottom to insure accurate discharge of the excavated material, and side rake teeth on the scoop. Only the claims as to the two last-named elements are involved in these cases. It is uncontradicted that prior to Downie's application drop-bottom scoops had been used on out-digging machines. As designed they would probably not have worked upon an indigging machine operated upon Clutter's principle. The question is then, as stated by petitioner's counsel, Was invention involved in taking a known form of out- digging bucket or scoop, rebuilding and applying it to the Clutter in- digging excavator, and making the changes necessary so that it would perform the alleged new functions and results of Downie? We are convinced that the fixation of the scoop to the stick, the pivoting of a drop bottom near the front of the scoop which could be unlatched to drop the contents and closed by checking the momentum of the scoop, and the addition of rake teeth at the sides of the scoop, were all old in the art, and that the combination of them and adaptation of the combined result was a mere aggregation of old elements requiring no more than mechanical skill, and was not, therefore, patentable invention. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment are affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 70 F.(2d) 13. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] In Byers Machine Co. v. Keystone Driller Co., 44 F.(2d) 283 (C.C.A. 6) the claims were held valid and infringed. In General Excavator Co. v. Keystone Driller Co., 62 F.(2d) 48; Id., 64 F.(2d) 39, the same court found that the owner of the patents had attempted suppression of evidence of prior use, so as to render more certain the sustaining of the Downie patent which was involved in the Byers Case, and had then used the decree in that case as the basis of application for preliminary injunction in the General Excavator Case. Without passing on the merits, therefore, the court, because of the plaintiff's unclean hands, reversed a decree finding validity and infringement. We affirmed the judgment. \n290 \nU.S. 240\n, 54 S.Ct. 146. Meantime the Circuit Court of Appeals has permitted reopening of the Byers Case, and the District Court, after considering the proofs as to suppression, has again found the patents valid and infringed. 4 F.Supp. 159, 160. Its decree has been set aside by the Circuit Court of Appeals (71 F.(2d) 1000), but it is not clear whether this action nullifies the finding on the merits. Meantime, also, the District Court which decided the Byers and General Excavator Cases has, in another suit ( against Day & Maddock Company), found validity and infringement, and this cause is now pending on appeal. The petitioner asserts that the original decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the Byers Case has never been set aside so far as concerns the issues of validity and infringement. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n293 \nU.S. 539\n, 55 S.Ct. 83, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See the following patents: Rood, 386,438; Cross, 808,345; Benedick, 876,517; Fairbanks, 1,056,268. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] See Benedick, 876,517; Fairbanks, 1,056,268. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Claims presented and rejected on the prior art embodied such descriptions as: 'Means carried by the boom for connecting the pulling member therewith and with said scoop-carrying member'; 'a pulling member for operating said boom and said scoop-carrying member'; 'pulling means for simultaneously shifting said boom and scoop-carrying member.'

It provides: 'That all claims of whatsoever nature' the plaintiffs may have against the United States 'which have not heretofore been determined by the Court of Claims' may be submitted to that court for determination of the amount, if any, 'due said Indians from the United States under any treaties, agreement, or laws of Congress, or for the misappropriation of any of the funds of said Indians, or for the failure of the United States to pay said Indians any money or other property due; and jurisdiction is hereby conferred upon the Court of Claims, with the right of either party to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States, to \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 246]\n\u00a0\n hear and determine all legal and equitable claims, if any, of said Indians, against the United States, and to enter judgment thereon' (section 1); that if any claim be submitted to said courts they shall settle the rights therein, both legal and equitable, 'notwithstanding lapse of time or statutes of limitation, and any payment which may have been made upon any claim so submitted shall not be pleaded as an estoppel, but may be pleaded as an offset in such suits or actions.' Section 2.\n The claim in suit is for the value of plaintiffs' rights in respect of about 87,000 acres which, less an admitted payment, is alleged to be $5, 891,250. The answer is a general traverse. At the trial much evidence was taken, and the contentions of the parties were fully presented. The court made findings of fact, stated its conclusions of law, and dismissed the case.\n The questions for decision are:\n Whether, assuming that before its passage plaintiffs gave defendant a valid release of the claim in suit, the act empowers the court to adjudicate that claim.\n Whether the facts found are sufficient to show that the release given is invalid.\n The findings are sufficiently reflected by the following narration. In 1864, plaintiffs held by immemorial possession more than 20,000,000 acres located within what now constitutes Oregon and California. By an act 2 of March 25 of that year the President was authorized to conclude with them a treaty for the purchase of the country they occupied. The treaty was made October 14 following. \n3\n A proviso sets apart a tract within the ceded country, to be held until otherwise directed by the President, as a residence for plaintiffs with specified privileges. Rights \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 247]\n\u00a0\n of way for public roads were reserved. \n4\n Shortly before the treaty was made Congress granted Oregon, to aid in the construction of a road from the city of Eugene to the eastern boundary of the state, the odd-numbered sections for three in width on each side of the proposed road. \n5\n Oregon accepted the grant and assigned it to a road company which undertook to construct the road. Congress recognized the assignment. 6 Patents were issued to the state and to the road company for in all 420,240.67 acres, title to which was later acquired by a land company. Exclusive of right of way, 111,385 acres so acquired by that company were within the boundaries of the reservation and had been allotted in severalty to members of the tribe.\n The act of March 2, 1889,7 directed suit by the United States to forfeit the grants for noncompliance with the specified conditions saving, however, the rights of bona fide purchasers. The company's title was held valid. United States v. California & O. Land Co., \n148 \nU.S. 31\n, 13 S.Ct. 458. Then the United States brought another suit to recover the part of the lands within the reservation on the ground that by the terms of the grant they were expressly excepted. But, as that issue could have been raised in the first suit, it was held res adjudicata. United States v. California & Ore. Land Co., \n192 \nU.S. 355\n, 24 S.Ct. 266.\n The Secretary of the Interior reported the result of the litigation and expressed the opinion that the Indians should have compensation. Congress, by an act of June 21, 1906,8 authorized the Secretary to exchange unallotted lands in the reservation for the allotted lands earlier con- \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 248]\n\u00a0\n veyed. The Secretary made an agreement with the land company pursuant to which on August 22, 1906, it conveyed the 111,385 acres back to the United States and in return the latter conveyed 87,000 acres of unallotted lands to the company. That transfer was made without the knowledge or consent of plaintiffs and without giving them any compensation for the lands so taken from their reservation.\n As found below, the value of plaintiffs' title was then $2,980,000.9 An act of April 30, 1908,10 appropriated.$108,750 to be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Indians and to be expended for their benefit. A proviso declares: 'That this appropriation shall not be effective until said Indians, through the usual channels, shall execute a release of any claims and demands of every kind against the United States for the land involved.'\n The Indian population on the reservation was then 1,038, including 640 adults, of whom 287 were men. The adult males alone were allowed to vote in Indian councils. The superintendent called a council to assemble at the general agency on December 5, 1908, for the purpose of considering compliance with the act. The Indians were by the superintendent given timely notice in the usual way. The council, assembled in pursuance of the notice, was attended by 200 or more Indians. The superintendent presided, and through an interpreter explained the terms of the measure and what would have to be done to get the appropriated money. There was some opposition, but the release was signed by 100 or more Indians present. The superintendent 'neither did nor said anything to mislead the assembly.' Forty or fifty miles from \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 249]\n\u00a0\n the general agency there was a subagency at Yainax. The Indians in that section rarely attended councils at the general agency headquarters. The superintendent called another council at that place. In general, the proceedings were the same as before; at that meeting others signed. In the end the release was signed by 150 adult males of the tribes on the reservation.\n January 6, 1909, the Secretary received the release from the superintendent. In form it complied with the requirements of the act and concluded: 'Now, therefore, the undersigned, being a majority of the Indians of the Klamath Reservation in council assembled, do hereby relinquish any and all claims and demands of every kind and character which they now have or may hereafter have against the United States for the lands involved.' The Secretary accepted it as sufficient compliance with the act and accordingly.$108,750 was placed in the Treasury to the credit of the plaintiffs. Except by the petition in this suit, they have made no claim for additional compensation.\n\n 1. \nThe jurisdictional act is a special law passed for the benefit of plaintiffs upon consideration of their application for relief. Their memorial specified other claims but made no reference to the one before us. There is nothing in what they presented (see H. Rep. No. 672, 66th Cong., 2d Sess., p. 8), the reports of the committees or the act itself to identify, or to indicate that they wanted to have determined, any claim for compensation for their right to the 87,000 acres conveyed by the United States to the land company. Their failure, between the settlement in 1909 and the suit in 1925, to seek further payment and their omission to mention this very large demand, when seeking congressional action in their favor, makes strongly against their contention that the jurisdictional act was intended to cover this claim. Cf. United States v. Creek Nation, \n295 \nU.S. 103, 108\n, 109 S., 55 S.Ct. 681. \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 250]\n\u00a0\n The meaning of the general language of section 1 that 'all claims of whatsoever nature' which plaintiffs have against the United States 'may be submitted' is limited by the clause 'which have not heretofore been determined by the Court of Claims' and is further much narrowed by the definitions of the classes of claims meant to be included. And correspondingly restrained is the meaning of the phrase 'all legal and equitable claims' in the clause conferring jurisdiction upon the court 'to hear and determine.' Thus the privilege of plaintiffs to submit and the power of the court to determine are made coextensive. The act grants a special privilege to plaintiffs and is to be strictly construed and may not by implication be extended to cases not plainly within its terms. Schillinger v. United States, \n155 \nU.S. 163, 166\n, 15 S.Ct. 85; Price v. United States and Osage Indians, \n174 \nU.S. 373, 375\n, 19 S.Ct. 765; Blackfeather v. United States, \n190 \nU.S. 368, 376\n, 23 S.Ct. 772\n\n\n This claim is plainly not, within the meaning of section 1, for an amount due under treaty, agreement or law of Congress or for misappropriation of funds of the Indians. Plaintiffs maintain that it is covered by the clause 'for the failure of the United States to pay said Indians any money or other property due.' There is here involved no question as to the adequacy of that language to cover any of the claims referred to in plaintiffs' application to the Congress; we are considering whether it extends to this claim, assuming that prior to the enactment it had been effectively released. If the release stands, no money or property is due plaintiffs, for the settlement and release wiped out the claim. If the act is sufficient to give jurisdiction of this claim, then it permits plaintiffs to bring into the Court of Claims for determination de novo all claims, whether released or not, that they ever had against the United States, excepting only those already there determined. It goes without saying that, if Congress in- \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 251]\n\u00a0\n tended to grant so sweeping and unique a privilege, it would have made that purpose unmistakably plain. As shown in the opinion below, acts intended to waive settlements employ terms quite different from the provisions under consideration. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n Plaintiffs turn for support to the provision of section 2 which prevents 'payment ... upon any claim' from being pleaded as an estoppel, but permits it to be asserted as an offset. And they insist that, if this clause does not relate to payments made and accepted as being in full, it means nothing. But that contention is based on a misunderstanding of the language used. Payment upon a claim means payment on account or in part as distinguished from one made and accepted as payment in full. The quoted provision made no grant of jurisdiction; it was inserted merely to eliminate defenses. Neither it nor any other part of section 2 may be held to add claims to those \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 252]\n\u00a0\n covered by the language of section 1. As jurisdiction will not be extended beyond the terms of the act by any implication or other resort to construction, no force can be given to plaintiffs' suggestion that intention to include claims already settled and released is shown by the clause in section 2 allowing defendant credit for money it expended for plaintiffs.\n Plaintiffs say the committees recommended inclusion of a released claim and suggest that therefore the intention of Congress was to include the one in suit. Plaintiffs brought that claim forward; it arose under the Treaty of October 14, 1864, and involved questions concerning boundaries of the reservation meant to be defined by the treaty and boundaries as attempted to be established by surveys, and whether the release referred to extends to the area in respect of which the claim is asserted. The circumstances attending the enactment might be thought to have favorable bearing as to that claim. But as shown above, plaintiffs' failure to disclose that it had and wanted to submit the claim in suit supports defendant's contention that the court below was without jurisdiction.\n\n 2. \nHave plaintiffs shown the release invalid?\n The question is not whether under the circumstances disclosed the United States may set up the release as a defense. It is whether the special act brings the claim within the court's jurisdiction. As this claim, if released, is not covered, it follows that in the court below the burden was on plaintiffs to prove the absence of valid release and that here their burden is to show that, as a matter of law, the facts found compel the conclusion that the release given is not valid. It is to be remembered that the act of April 30, 1908, was passed by Congress in the exertion of its untrammeled power in behalf of the United States to fix, as it deems appropriate and just under the circumstances, the amount of compensation to be paid the Indians for the rights of the plaintiffs lost by the tak- \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 253]\n\u00a0\n ing of the 87,000 acres from their reservation. Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 294, 306\n, 308 S., 23 S.Ct. 115; Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 553, 565\n, 566 S., 23 S.Ct. 216; Choate v. Trapp, \n224 \nU.S. 665, 670\n, 671 S., 32 S.Ct. 565. Cf. United States v. Mille Lac Band Chippewa Indians, \n229 \nU.S. 498, 506\n, 509 S., 510, 33 S.Ct. 811; United States v. Creek Nation, supra, \n295 \nU.S. 103, 110\n, 55 S.Ct. 681. They gave and through the Secretary of the Interior the United States accepted the release as sufficient to comply with the act. It served to make the appropriation effective and was treated as fulfillment of the conditions upon which the money was paid into the Treasury to be disbursed from time to time for plaintiffs' benefit. In the absence of findings of fact requiring conclusion to the contrary, it is to be presumed that all things necessary to make the appropriation effective and the release valid were done regularly and in accordance with the expressed will of Congress. United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 15 S., 47 S.Ct. 1.\n The phrase 'through the usual channels' is used in stating the condition without which payment would not have been made. There the expression is one of indefinite import. It does not necessarily mean the manner in which plaintiffs or other or all of the Indian tribes were then accustomed to make treaties or to negotiate other agreements with the United States. For aught that appears in the act or findings of the court, 'usual channels' may have been used to signify something less than the proceedings, if any there were, usually followed by plaintiffs or Indian tribes generally. If this ambiguous phrase be held to require adherence to custom, there is nothing in the findings to show what the custom was. They fail to show that anything required by the act was omitted.\n Plaintiffs contend that the release is invalid because obtained by duress. But duress will not be presumed; nor will it be inferred from incomplete, doubtful, or ambiguous findings. There is nothing to suggest that, in \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 254]\n\u00a0\n the making of the settlement, anything was done to overreach plaintiffs. On the contrary, the circumstances disclosed by the findings tend quite strongly to indicate that the negotiations were fairly conducted.\n Plaintiffs say that the plain inadequacy of the payment, when taken in connection with the unequal positions of the parties, is enough without more to invalidate the release. The findings show that the amount paid plaintiffs was less than 4 per cent. of the value of the land. It was grossly inadequate. Where, in litigation between private parties, a release of claim is by the party who gave it challenged as invalid, inadequacy of consideration coupled with lack of business capacity and inferiority of position in respect of the transaction or in relation to that of the other party are elements having significance. Wheeler v. Smith, 9 How. 55, 82; Thorn Wire Hedge Co. v. Washburn & Moen Mfg. Co., \n159 \nU.S. 423, 443\n, 16 S.Ct. 94. But the rules that govern in such cases have no application in suits by these Indian tribes against the United States. The relation between them is different from that existing between individuals whether dealing at arm's length, as trustees and beneficiaries or otherwise. See Choctaw Nation v. United States, \n119 \nU.S. 1, 28\n, 7 S.Ct. 75; Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock, ubi supra; Choate v. Trapp, ubi supra. Regard being had to the nature of duties, resembling those arising out of the relation of guardian and ward, 12 owed by the United States to Indian tribes, and in view of the undoubted power of Congress to determine the amount and to fix the terms of payment of compensation for the rights lost to plaintiffs, it is clear that, in the absence of specific authorization, they may not avoid the release given in accordance with the act upon the \n\n[296 U.S. 244, 255]\n\u00a0\n ground that the payment was too small. That would enable them to question the laws of Congress in fields where, because of the relationship referred to, they are supreme.\n The obligation of the United States to make good plaintiffs' loss is a moral one calling for action by Congress in accordance with what it shall determine to be right. Save to the extent that Congress may authorize, the government's dealings with Indian tribes are not subject to judicial review. 13 Even if judicially cognizable, as would be a like contention in ordinary litigation between individuals, plaintiffs' insistence that inadequacy of consideration invalidates the release could not here be sustained. That is so because the findings fail to show that any person acting for the United States deceived or misled plaintiffs as to the value of the land, or, indeed, had knowledge of any fact bearing upon its value that was not well known by plaintiffs when they made the settlement and gave the release. Mere inadequacy of consideration is not enough. Eyre v. Potter, 15 How. 42, 59. Pomeroy, Equity Jurisprudence (14th Ed.)  926. Williston on Contracts,  115.\n As the act does not extend to this claim if released, and as the facts found fail to establish invalidity of the release admittedly given, the jurisdictional act does not extend to the claim in suit and the Court of Claims rightly dismissed the case. If plaintiffs are to have additional compensation, it must be obtained through legislation dealing with the merits or authorizing effective judicial determination.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 41 Stat. 623. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 13 Stat. 37. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] Ratified July 2, 1866; proclaimed February 17, 1870. 16 Stat. 707. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] 16 Stat. 708. \n[\nFootnote 5\n] Act July 2, 1864, 13 Stat. 355. \n[\nFootnote 6\n] Act June 18, 1874, 18 Stat. 80 (43 USCA  862). \n[\nFootnote 7\n] 25 Stat. 850. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] 34 Stat. 325, 368. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The court allowed counterclaims set up by defendant amounting to.$1, 978.431.24. \n[\nFootnote 10\n] 35 Stat. 70, 92. \n\n[\nFootnote 11\n] For instances where Congress authorized submission to the Court of Claims of Indian claims theretofore settled or adjusted, see Act of February 7, 1925, 43 Stat. 812, as amended March 3, 1927, 44 Stat. 1358: 'The said courts shall consider all such claims de novo ... and without regard to any decision, finding, or settlement heretofore had in respect of any such claims'; construed in Delaware Tribe v.

Myers, both of New York City, for petitioner in No. 496 and respondent in No. 292.\n Mr. Emil Hersh, of Milwaukee, Wis., for petitioner in No. 292.\n Mr. Meyer Marlow, of New York City, for respondents in No. 496. \n\n[294 U.S. 116, 117]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These causes require consideration of General Order in Bankruptcy No. 32, as amended, effective April 24, 1933 (11 USCA  53). This order, as it stood before that day, and the amendments then adopted, follow. Deleted words are within the brackets; words added are italicized.\n'XXXII. Opposition to Discharge or Composition or extension.\n\n'A creditor opposing (the) an application (of a bankrupt) for (his) discharge, or for the confirmation of a composition or extension proposal, shall enter his appearance in opposition thereto on the day when the creditors are required to show cause, and shall at the same time file a specification in writing of the grounds of his opposition (within ten days thereafter, unless the time shall be shortened or enlarged by special order of the judge).'\n\n Whether, under the amended order, bankruptcy courts may permit a creditor opposing an application for discharge to file written specifications showing the grounds of his opposition after 'the day when creditors are required to show cause,' is the question for determination.\n In No. 292 the Circuit Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit (70 F.(2d) 938), held that when good cause is shown, such an extension may be granted. In No. 496 the Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit (73 F.(2d) 56), ruled to the contrary. The latter court, we think reached the proper conclusion. Reversal of the challenged judgment must follow in No. 292; affirmance in No. 496.\n The purpose of the 1933 amendments to Order No. 32 was to prevent continuation of abuses then apparent.\n The so-called 'Donovan Report,' March 22, 1930, on 'Administration of Bankrupt Estates,' printed (1931) \n\n[294 U.S. 116, 118]\n\u00a0\n for the House Judiciary Committee, 71st Congress, 3d Session, p. 116, stated: 'An unscrupulous creditor who desires to get something more than the others may be tempted to file a notice of appearance (a simply 4-line document) at the time of the hearing on confirmation, knowing that this will hold up the entire proceeding for at least another ten days even if he does not follow up the notice of appearance with detailed specifications of objection. During this 10-day period he may hope to get paid off by the bankrupt. If the bankrupt refuses or is unable to strike a bargain, the creditor may then file his specifications of objection, so that the bankrupt will face another three weeks' delay, during the process of which he may be finally induced to come to terms.'\n Reporting on 'Bankruptcy Law and Practice' (December 8, 1931), Senate Document No. 65, 72d Congress, 1st Session (p. 16), the Attorney General asserted:\n'The clerks of 72 district courts reported to us that out of the 49, 928 cases closed by them in the fiscal year 1930, 27,426 applications for discharge had been disposed of.\n\n'In only 1,042 of these cases individual creditors at the time of the hearing before the judge on the bankrupt's application filed notices of appearance stating that they intended to oppose the discharge. Under General Order XXXII, these creditors were then required to file specifications in writing within 10 days, setting forth the grounds of this opposition, upon the filing of which the issues would be tried.\n\n'But in 330 of these 1,042 cases the creditors did not follow up their notices of appearance by filing written specifications. Why?\n\n'Presumably, because the creditors were either bought off by the bankrupt as already described, or because indifferent, or were unwilling to incur further expense. ...' \n\n[294 U.S. 116, 119]\n\u00a0\n By memorandum of April 3, 1933, submitted to us, Solicitor General Thacher, who had devoted much time and thought to bankruptcy proceedings, suggested certain amendments and additions to the General Orders-among them, those to No. 32 adopted as above shown. After referring to the passages from congressional publications, which we have quoted, he declared: 'For these reasons it is recommended with respect both to discharges and to compositions that the specifications of opposition should be filed with the appearances. Ample time is afforded by the Act to opposing parties to obtain their evidence and make up their minds. Under section 58 (11 USCA  94) creditors must be given at least 30 days' notice of all applications for discharge, and may after receipt of the notice, if they have not done so already, examine the bankrupt and other parties under section 21a (11 USCA  44(a)). Under compositions creditors may examine the bankrupt or debtor at the first meeting and at any time thereafter under section 21a, and must be given at least ten days' notice of the application for confirmation.'\n\n Having considered the facts, thus brought to our attention, and those otherwise known, it seemed proper to adopt the suggested amendment to Order 32.\n The language of the amended order is mandatory; it is controlling in circumstances like those here presented; strict compliance should be accorded. Under Order 37 (11 USCA  53), and permissive provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, we think the courts may exercise discretion sufficient for the successful conduct of proceedings in varying circumstances. Thus, while an objecting creditor must file specifications showing the grounds of his opposition on the day when creditors are required to show cause, that day may be fixed or postponed by the court in view of the existing situation. \n No. 496\n affirmed.\n No. 292 reversed. \n\n\n\n","105":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLINDERHOLM v.

The federal court for Western Kentucky (In re Radford (D.C.) 8 F.Supp. 489) and the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (74 F.(2d) 576) held it valid in this case; and it has been sustained elsewhere. \n2\n In view of the novelty and importance of the question, we granted certiorari (\n294 \nU.S. 702\n, 55 S. Ct. 547, 79 L.Ed. --).\n In 1922 (and in 1924) Radford mortgaged to the Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank a farm in Christian county, Kentucky, comprising 170 acres, then presumably of the appraised value of at least $18,000.3 The mortgages were given to secure loans aggregating $9,000, to be repaid in instalments over the period of 34 years with interest at the rate of 6 per cent. Radford's wife joined in the mortgages and the notes. In 1931 and subsequent years, the Radfords made default in their covenant to pay the taxes. In 1932 and 1933, they made default in their promise to pay the instalments of interest and principal. In 1933, \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 574]\n\u00a0\n they made default, also, in their covenant to keep the buildings insured. The Bank urged the Radfords to endeavor to refinance the indebtedness pursuant to the provisions of the Emergency Farm Mortgage Act, May 12, 1933, c. 25, 48 Stat. 41.4 After they declined to do so, the Bank having declared the entire indebtedness immediately payable, commenced, in June, 1933, a suit in the circuit court for Christian county against the Radfords and their tenant to foreclose the mortgages; and, invoking a covenant in the mortgage expressly providing therefor, sought the appointment of a receiver to take possession and control of the premises and to collect the rents and profits.\n The application for the appointment of a receiver was denied, and all proceedings in the suit were stayed, upon request of the Conciliation Commissioner for Christian County appointed under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act (see 11 USCA  203), as he stated that Radford desired to avail himself of the provisions of that section. Proceeding under it, Radford filed, in the federal court for Western Kentucky, a petition \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 575]\n\u00a0\n praying that he be afforded an opportunity to effect a composition of his debts. The petition was promptly approved and a meeting of the creditors was held. But Radford failed to obtain the acceptance of the requisite majority in number and amount to the composition proposed. Then, the Bank offered to accept a deed of the mortgaged property in full satisfaction of the indebtedness to it and to assume the unpaid taxes. Radford refused to execute the deed; and on June 30, 1934, the state court entered judgment ordering a foreclosure sale.\n Meanwhile, the Frazier-Lemke Act had been passed on June 28, 1934 (11 USCA  203(s); and on August 6, 1934, and again on November 10, 1934, Radford filed amended petitions for relief thereunder. The second amended petition prayed that Radford be adjudged a bankrupt; that his property, whether free or encumbered, be appraised; and that he have the relief provided for in paragraphs 3 and 7 of subsection(s) of the Frazier-Lemke Amendment, 11 USCA  203(s)(3, 7). That act provides, among other things, that a farmer who has failed to obtain the consents requisite to a composition under section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act, may, upon being adjudged a bankrupt, acquire alternative options in respect to mortgaged property:\n\n 1. \nBy paragraph 3, the bankrupt may, if the mortgagee assents, purchase the property at its then appraised value, acquiring title thereto as well as immediate possession, by agreeing to make deferred payments as follows: 2 1\/2 per cent. within two years; 2 1\/2 per cent. within three years; 5 per cent. within four years; 5 per cent. within five years; the balance within six years. All deferred payments to bear interest at the rate of 1 per cent. per annum.\n\n 2. \nBy paragraph 7, the bankrupt may, if the mortgagee refuses his assent to the immediate purchase on the above basis, require the bankruptcy court to 'stay all proceedings for a period of five years, during which five years the debtor shall retain possession of all or \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 576]\n\u00a0\n any part of his property, under the control of the court, provided he pays a reasonable rental annually for that part of the property of which he retains possession; the first payment of such rental to be made within six months of the date of the order staying proceedings, such rental to be distributed among the secured and unsecured creditors, as their interests may appear, under the provisions of this Act (title). At the end of five years, or prior thereto, the debtor may pay into court the appraised price of the property of which he retains possession: Provided, That upon request of any lien holder on real estate the court shall cause a reappraisal of such real estate and the debtor may then pay the reappraised price, if acceptable to the lien holder, into the court, otherwise the original appraisal price shall be paid into court, and thereupon the court shall, by an order, turn over full possession and title of said property to the debtor and he may apply for his discharge as provided for by this Act (title): Provided, however, That the provisions of this Act (subsection) shall apply only to debts existing at the time this Act becomes effective (on June 28, 1934).'\n Answering the amended petition, the Bank duly claimed that the Frazier-Lemke Act is, and the relief sought would be, unconstitutional. It prayed that Radford's amended petition be dismissed; that the Bank be permitted to pursue its remedies in the state court; and that it be allowed to proceed with the foreclosure sale in accordance with the judgment of that court. It refused to accept the composition and extension proposal offered by Radford; declined to consent to the proposed sale of that property to Radford at the appraised value or any value on the terms set forth in paragraph 3; and also objected to his retaining possession thereof with the privilege of purchasing the same provided by paragraph 7. The federal court overruled the Bank's objections; denied its prayers; adjudged Radford a bankrupt within the meaning of the Frazier-Lemke Act; and appointed a referee to take proceedings \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 577]\n\u00a0\n thereunder. There was no claim that the farm was exempt as a homestead or otherwise.\n The referee ordered an appraisal of all of Radford's property, encumbered and unencumbered. The appraisers found that 'the fair and reasonable value of the property of the debtor on which Louisville Joint Stock Bank has a mortgage' and also the 'market value of said land' was then $4,445.5 The referee approved the appraisal, although the Bank offered in open court to pay $9,205.09 in cash for the mortgaged property; and counsel for the bankrupt admitted that the Bank had a valid lien upon it for the amount so offered to be paid, and that, under the law, if the Bank's offer to purchase the property were accepted, all the money paid in in cash would be immediately returned to it in satisfaction of the mortgage indebtedness.\n The Bank refused to consent to a sale of the mortgaged property to Radford at the appraised value and filed written objections to such sale and to the manner of payments prescribed by paragraph 3 of subsection (s). Thereupon, the referee ordered that, for the period of five years, all proceedings for the enforcement of the mortgages be stayed; and that the possession of the mortgaged property, subject to liens, remain in Radford, under the control of the court, as provided in paragraph 7 of subsection ( s). The referee fixed the rental for the first year at $325; and ordered that for each subsequent year the rental be fixed by the court. It was stipulated, that the \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 578]\n\u00a0\n annual taxes and insurance premium amount to $105; and admitted that administration charges said to amount to $22.75 must be paid from the rental. All the orders of the referee were, upon a petition for a review, duly approved by the District Court; and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals on February 11, 1935\n\n\n Since entry of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, this Court has held unconstitutional provisions of state legislation in some respects comparable to the Frazier-Lemke Act. W.B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, \n295 \nU.S. 56\n, 55 S.Ct. 555, 557, 79 L.Ed. --. There we said: 'With studied indifference to the interests of the mortgagee or to his appropriate protection they have taken from the mortgage the quality of an acceptable investment for a rational investor,' and, 'So viewed they are seen to be an oppressive and unnecessary destruction of nearly all the incidents that give attractiveness and value to collateral security.' The Bank insists, among other things, that the Frazier-Lemke Act has been here applied with like result; that the provisions of the act, even if applied solely to mortgages thereafter executed, would transcend the bankruptcy power; and that, in any event, to apply them to pre-existing mortgages violates the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. Radford contends that the Frazier-Lemke Act is valid because it is a proper exercise of the power conferred by article 1,  8 of the Constitution, which declares: 'Congress shall have Power ... To establish ... uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States.' Before discussing these contentions, it will be helpful to consider the position occupied generally by mortgagees prior to the enactment here challenged.\n First. For centuries efforts to protect necessitous mortgagors have been persistent. Gradually the mortgage of real estate was transformed from a conveyance upon condition into a lien; and failure of the mortgagor to pay on the day fixed ceased to effect an automatic foreclosure. \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 579]\n\u00a0\n Courts of equity, applying their established jurisdiction to relieve against penalties and forfeitures, created the equity of redemption. Thus the mortgagor was given a reasonable time to cure the default and to require a reconveyance of the property. Legislation in many states carried this development further, and preserved the mortgagor's right to possession, even after default, until the conclusion of foreclosure proceedings. \n6\n But the statutory command that the mortgagor should not lose his property on default had always rested on the assumption that the mortgagee would be compensated for the default by a later payment, with interest, of the debt for which the security was given; and the protection afforded the mortgagor was, in effect, the granting of a stay. No instance has been found, except under the Frazier-Lemke Act (11 USCA  203(s), of either a statute or decision compelling the mortgagee to relinquish the property to the mortgagor free of the lien unless the debt was paid in full. 7 \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 580]\n\u00a0\n This right of the mortgagee to insist upon full payment before giving up his security has been deemed of the essence of a mortgage. His position in this respect was not changed when foreclosure by public sale superseded strict foreclosure or when the Legislatures of many states created a right of redemption at the sale price. To protect his right to full payment or the mortgaged property, the mortgagee was allowed to bid at the judicial sale on foreclosure. \n8\n In many states other statutory changes were \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 581]\n\u00a0\n made in the form and detail of foreclosure and redemption. \n9\n But practically always the measures adopted for the mortgagor's relief, including moratorium legislation enacted by the several states during the present depression,10 resulted primarily in a stay; and the relief afforded rested, as theretofore, upon the assumption that no substantive right of the mortgagee was being impaired, since payment in full of the debt with interest would fully compensate him.\n Statutes for the relief of mortgagors, when applied to pre-existing mortgages, have given rise, from time to time, to serious constitutional questions. The statutes were sustained by this court when, as in Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481, they were found to preserve substantially the right of the mortgagee to obtain, through application of the security, payment of the indebtedness. They were stricken down, as in W.B. Worthen Co. v. Kavanaugh, \n295 \nU.S. 56\n, 55 S.Ct. 555, 79 L.Ed. --, when it appeared that this substantive right was substantially abridged. Compare W.B. Worthen Co. v. Thomas, \n292 \nU.S. 426\n, 54 S.Ct. 816, 93 A.L.R. 173.\n Second. Although each of our national bankruptcy acts followed a major or minor depression,11 none had prior \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 582]\n\u00a0\n to the Frazier-Lemke amendment, sought to compel the holder of a mortgage to surrender to the bankrupt either the possession of the mortgaged property or the title, so long as any part of the debt thereby secured remained unpaid. The earlier bankruptcy acts created some exemptions of unencumbered property;12 but none had attempted to enlarge the rights or privileges of the mortgagor as against the mortgagee. The provisions of the acts, so far as concerned the debtor, were aimed to 'relieve the honest debtor from the weight of oppressive indebtedness, and permit him to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities consequent upon business misfortunes,' and to give him 'a new opportunity in life and a clear field for future effort, unhampered by the pressure and discouragement of pre-existing debt.' Local Loan Co. v. Hunt, \n292 \nU.S. 234, 244\n, 54 S.Ct. 695, 699, 93 A.L.R. 195. No bankruptcy act had undertaken to supply him capital with which to engage in business in the future. Some states had granted to debtors extensive exemptions of unencumbered property from liability to seizure in satisfaction of debts; and these exemptions were recognized by the Bankruptcy Act of 1867, as well as that of 1898. But unless the mortgagee released his security, in order to prove in bankruptcy for the full amount of the debt, a \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 583]\n\u00a0\n mortgage even of exempt property was not disturbed by bankruptcy proceedings. Long v. Bullard, \n117 \nU.S. 617\n, 6 S.Ct. 917.13\n No bankruptcy act had undertaken to modify in the interest of either the debtor or other creditors any substantive right of the holder of a mortgage valid under federal law. Supervening bankruptcy had, in the interest of other creditors, affected in some respects the remedies available to lienholders. In Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry., \n294 \nU.S. 648\n, 55 S.Ct. 595, 606, 79 L.Ed. --, where, in a proceeding for reorganization of a railroad under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  205) the District Court was held to have the power to enjoin temporarily the sale of pledged securities, this court said: 'The injunction here in no ways impairs the lien, or disturbs the preferred rank of the pledgees. It does not more than suspend the enforcement of the lien by a sale of the collateral pending further action. It may be, as suggested, that during the period of restraint the collateral will decline in value; but the same may be said in respect of an injunction against the sale of real estate upon foreclosure of a mortgage; and such an injunction may issue in an ordinary proceeding in bankruptcy. Straton v. New, \n283 \nU.S. 318, 321\n, 51 S.Ct. 465, and cases cited.' 'The injunction here goes no further than to delay the enforcement of the contract. It affects only the remedy.'\n Bankruptcy acts had, either expressly, or by implication, as was held in Van Huffel v. Harkelrode, \n284 \nU.S. 225, 227\n, 52 S.Ct. 115, 116, 78 A.L.R. 453, authorized the court to direct, in the interest of other creditors, that all liens upon property forming a part of the bankrupt's estate be marshaled; that the property be sold free of encumbrances; and that the \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 584]\n\u00a0\n rights of all lienholders be transferred to the proceeds of the sale-a power which 'had long been exercised by federal courts sitting in equity when ordering sales by receivers or on foreclosure.' First National Bank v. Shedd, \n121 \nU.S. 74, 87\n, 7 S.Ct. 807, Mellen v. Moline Malleable Iron Works, \n131 \nU.S. 352, 367\n, 9 S.Ct. 781. Compare Ray v. Norse-worthy, 23 Wall. 128, 135. But there had been no suggestion that such a sale could be made to the prejudice of the lienor, in the interest of either the debtor or of other creditors. By the settled practice, a sale free of liens will not be ordered by the bankruptcy court if it appears that the amount of the encumbrance exceeds the value of the property. \n14\n And the sale is always made so as to obtain for the property the highest possible price. No court appears ever to have authorized a sale at a price less than that which the lien creditor offered to pay for the property in cash. \n15\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 555, 585]\n\u00a0\n Thus, a sale free of liens in no way impairs any substantive right of the mortgagor; and such a sale is not analogous to the sale to the bankrupt provided for by paragraph 7 of the Frazier-Lemke Act 11 USCA  203(s)(7).\n Nor do the provisions of the bankruptcy acts concerning compositions afford any analogy to the provisions of paragraph 7. So far as concerns the debtor, the composition is an agreement with the creditors in lieu of a distribution of the property in bankruptcy-an agreement which 'originates in a voluntary offer by the bankrupt, and results, in the main, from voluntary acceptance by his creditors.' Nassau Smelting & Refining Works, Ltd. v. Brightwood Bronze Foundry Co., \n265 \nU.S. 269, 271\n, 44 S.Ct. 506, 507; Myers v. International Trust Co., \n273 \nU.S. 380, 383\n, 47 S.Ct. 372. So far as concerns dissenting creditors, the composition is a method of adjusting among creditors rights in property in which all are interested. In ordering the adjustment, the bankruptcy court exercises a power similar to that long exercised by courts of law, Head v. Amoskeag Manufacturing Co., \n113 \nU.S. 9, 21\n, 5 S.Ct. 441; and of admiralty, The Orleans v. Phoebus, 11 Pet. 175, 183. It is the same power which a court of equity exercises when it compels dissenting creditors, in effect, to submit to a plan of reorganization approved by it as beneficial and assented to by the requisite majority of the creditors. Shaw v. Railroad Co., \n100 U.S. 605\n; Kansas City Terminal Ry. Co. v. Central Union Trust Co., \n271 \nU.S. 445\n, 46 S.Ct. 549. Compare National Surety Co. v. Coriell, \n289 \nU.S. 426\n, 53 S.Ct. 678, 88 A.L.R. 1231; First National Bank of Cincinnati v. Flershem, \n290 \nU.S. 504\n, 54 S.Ct. 298, 90 A.L.R. 391. In no case of composition is a secured claim affected except when the holder is a member of a class; and then only when the composi- \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 586]\n\u00a0\n tion is desired by the requisite majority and is approved by the court. \n16\n Never, so far as appears, has any composition affected a secured claim held by a single creditor. Compositions are comparable to the voluntary adjustment with the mortgagee provided for in paragraph 3 of the Frazier- Lemke amendment (11 USCA  203(s)(3). They are not analogous to the so- called adjustment compelled by paragraph 7 (11 USCA  203(s)(7).\n Third. The bank contends that the Frazier-Lemke Act is void, because it is not a law 'on the subject of Bankruptcies'; that it does not deal with that subject; and hence, that it is in contravention of the Tenth Amendment, which declares: 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.' The argument is that the essential features of a bankruptcy law are these: The surrender by the debtor of his property for ratable distribution among his creditors, except so far as encumbered or exempt, and the discharge by his creditors of all claims against the debtor; that, on the other hand, the main purpose and the effect of the Frazier-Lemke Act is to prevent distribution of the farmer-mortgagor's property; to enable him to remain in possession despite persisting default; to scale down the mortgage debt; and to give the mortgagor the option to acquire the full title to the property upon paying the reduced amount. Thus, it is urged, the act effects a fundamental change in the relative rights of mortgagor and mortgagee \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 587]\n\u00a0\n of real property as determined by the law of the state in which the property is located. The bank argues that, if the bankruptcy clause were construed to permit the making of such fundamental changes, Congress could deal with every phase of the relations between an insolvent or nonpaying debtor and his creditors; that it might, among other things, divest state courts of jurisdiction over suits upon promissory notes between citizens of the same state; that commercial controversies arising from breach of contract might be brought under like control; that the obtaining of goods or credits by false pretenses, for example, could be made a crime against the United States, despite the rule declared in United States v. Fox, \n95 U.S. 670\n; that the commercial and financial life of each state would be in large measure subject to federal regulation; and that the lines between state and federal government could thus be redrawn by Congress.\n It is true that the original purpose of our bankruptcy acts was the equal distribution of the debtor's property among his creditors; and that the aim of the legislation was to do this promptly. \n17\n But, the scope of the bankruptcy power conferred upon Congress is not necessarily limited to that which has been exercised. The first act provided only for compulsory proceedings against traders, \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 588]\n\u00a0\n bankers, brokers, and underwriters. The operation of later ones has been gradually extended so as to include practically all insolvent debtors; to provide for voluntary petitions; and to permit compositions with creditors, even without an adjudication of bankruptcy. The discharge of the debtor has come to be an object of no less concern than the distribution of his property. Hanover National Bank v. Moyses, \n186 \nU.S. 181\n, 22 S.Ct. 857. As was said in Continental Illinois National Bank & Trust Co. v. Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Ry. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 648\n, 55 S.Ct. 595, 604, 79 L.Ed. --: 'The fundamental and radically progressive nature of these extensions becomes apparent upon their mere statement; but all have been judicially approved or accepted as falling within the power conferred by the bankruptcy clause of the Constitution.' \n18\n\u00a0\n\n It is true that the position of a secured creditor, who has rights in specific property, differs fundamentally from that of an unsecured creditor, who has none; and that the \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 589]\n\u00a0\n Frazier-Lemke Act (11 USCA  203(s) is the first instance of an attempt, by a bankruptcy act, to abridge, solely in the interest of the mortgagor, a substantive right of the mortgagee in specific property held as security. But we have no occasion to decide in this case whether the bankruptcy clause confers upon Congress generally the power to abridge the mortgagee's rights in specific property. Paragraph 7, 11 USCA  203(s)(7), declares that 'the provisions of this Act (subsection) shall apply only to debts existing at the time this Act becomes effective (on June 28, 1934).' The power over property pledged as security after the date of the act may be greater than over property pledged before; and this act deals only with pre-existing mortgages. Because the act is retroactive, in terms, and, as here applied, purports to take away rights of the mortgagee in specific property, another provision of the Constitution is controlling.\n Fourth. The bankruptcy power, like the other great substantive powers of Congress, is subject to the Fifth Amendment. \n19\n Under the bankruptcy power Congress may discharge the debtor's personal obligation, because, unlike the states, it is not prohibited from impairing the obligations of contracts. Compare Mitchell v. Clark, \n110 \nU.S. 633, 643\n, 4 S.Ct. 170, 312. But the effect of the act here complained of is not the discharge of Radford's personal obligation. \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 590]\n\u00a0\n It is the taking of substantive rights in specific property acquired by the bank prior to the act. In order to determine whether right of that nature have been taken, we must ascertain what the mortgagee's rights were before the passage of the Act. We turn, therefore, first to the law of the state.\n Under the law of Kentucky, a mortgage creates a lien which may be foreclosed only by suit resulting in a judicial sale of the property. Civil Code of Practice,  375, 376; Insurance Co. of North America v. Cheathem, 221 Ky. 668, 672, 299 S.W. 545. While mere default does not entitle the mortgagee to possession, Newport & Cincinnati Bridge Co. v. Douglass, 12 Bush (Ky.) 673, 705, section 299 of the Civil Code of Practice provides that, in an action for the sale of mortgaged property a receiver may be appointed if it appears 'that the property is probably insufficient to discharge the mortgage debt,' Mortgage Union of Penn v. King, 245 Ky. 691, 54 S.W.(2d) 49; and where there is (as here) a pledge in the mortgage of rents, issues, and profits, and provision for appointment of a receiver, the mortgagee is entitled as of right to have a receiver appointed to collect them for his benefit, Brasfield & Son v. Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co., 233 Ky. 94, 25 S.W.(2d) 72; Watt's Adm'r v. Smith, 250 Ky. 617, 630, 63 S.W.(2d) 796, 91 A.L.R. 1206. Under section 374 of the Civil Code of Practice a sale may be ordered at any time after default. Under Carroll's Ky. St. (1930),  2362, 2364, there must be an appraisal before the sale; and if the sale brings less than two- thirds of the appraised value, the mortgagor may redeem within a year by paying the original purchase money and interest at 10 per cent. But inadequacy of price is not alone ground for setting aside a sale. Kentucky Joint Land Bank of Lexington v. Fitzpatrick, 237 Ky. 624, 36 S.W.(2d) 25. No provision permits the mortgagor to obtain a release or surrender of the property before foreclosure without paying in full the indebtedness secured. Nor does any provision prohibit a mortgagee \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 591]\n\u00a0\n from protecting his interest in the property by bidding at the foreclosure sale. Thus, the controlling purpose of the law of Kentucky was and is that mortgaged property shall be devoted primarily to the satisfaction of the debt secured; and the provisions of its law are appropriate to ensure that result.\n For the rights acquired and possessed by the mortgagee under the law of Kentucky, the act substituted only the following alternatives:\n (A) Under paragraph 3, 11 USCA  203(s)(3), the mortgagee may, if the bankrupt so requests, assent to a so-called sale by the trustee to the bankrupt at a so-called appraised value; and upon such assent an implied promise arises to purchase the property on the terms prescribed in that paragraph. But, the transaction would not confer upon the mortgagee the ordinary fruits of an immediate sale; nor would the agreement of sale, if performed by the bankrupt, result in payment at the appraised value. The mortgagee would not get the ordinary fruits of an immediate sale on deferred payments; for the bankrupt would make no down payment at the time of taking possession and would give no other assurance that the payments promised would in fact be made. And, if all such payments were duly made, the sale would not be at the appraised value; for the value of money 'even if there were no risk) is obviously more than one per cent. \n20\n By restricting, throughout the period of six years, the annual interest on the deferred payments to 1 per cent., a sale at much less than the appraised value is prescribed. The aggregate payments of principal and interest prescribed would in no year before the end of the sixth be as much \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 592]\n\u00a0\n as 6 per cent. on the appraised value. \n21\n Moreover, before any deferred payment of the purchase price is made, there is serious danger that the bank's investment might be further impaired. The mortgaged property might be lessened in value by waste. It might become burdened with the liens for accruing unpaid taxes;22 for, while interest at the rate of 1 per cent. of the appraised value of the Radford farm is $44.45, the present annual taxes (plus insurance premium) are, as stipulated, $105. Thus if the alternative offered by paragraph 3 were accepted, the transaction would result merely in a transfer of possession to the bankrupt for six years with an otherwise unsecured promise to purchase at the end of the period for a price less than the appraised value.\n (B) If the mortgagee refuses to consent to the agreement to sell under paragraph 3, he is compelled, by paragraph 7, to surrender to the bankrupt possession of the property for the period of five years; and during those \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 593]\n\u00a0\n years, the bankrupt's only monetary obligation is to pay a reasonable rental fixed by the court. There is no provision for the payment of insurance or taxes, save as these may be paid from the rental received. During that period the bankrupt has an option to purchase the farm at any time at its appraised, or reappraised, value. \n23\n The mortgagee is not only compelled to submit to the sale to the bankrupt, but to a sale made at such time as the latter may choose. Thus, the bankrupt may leave it uncertain for years whether he will purchase; and in the end he may decline to buy. Meanwhile the mortgagee may have had (and been obliged to decline) an offer from some other person to take the farm at a price sufficient to satisfy the full amount then due by the debtor. The mortgagee cannot require a reappraisal when, in its judgment, the time comes to sell; it may ask for a reappraisal only if and when the bankrupt requests a sale. Thus the mortgagee is afforded no protection if the request is made when values are depressed to a point lower than the original appraisal. While paragraph 7 declares that the bankrupt's possession is 'under the control of the court,' this clause gives merely supervisory power. Such control leaves the court powerless to terminate the option unless there has been the commission of waste or failure to pay the prescribed rent. \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 594]\n\u00a0\n Fifth. The controlling purpose of the act is to preserve to the mortgagor the ownership and enjoyment of the farm property. It does not seek primarily a discharge of all personal obligations; a function with which alone bankruptcy acts have heretofore dealt. Nor does it make provision of that nature by prohibiting, limiting, or postponing deficiency judgments, as do some state laws. \n24\n Its avowed object is to take from the mortgagee rights in the specific property held as security; and to that end 'to scale down the indebtedness' to the present value of the property. \n25\n As here applied it has taken from the Bank the following property rights recognized by the law of Kentucky:\n\n\n (1)\n The right to retain the lien until the indebtedness thereby secured is paid.\n\n\n (2)\n The right to realize upon the security by a judicial public sale.\n\n\n (3)\n The right to determine when such sale shall be held, subject only to the discretion of the court.\n\n\n (4)\n The right to protect its interest in the property by bidding at such sale whenever held, and thus to assure having the mortgaged property devoted primarily to the satisfaction of the debt, either through receipt of the pro- \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 595]\n\u00a0\n ceeds of a fair competitive sale or by taking the property itself.\n\n\n (5)\n The right to control meanwhile the property during the period of default, subject only to the discretion of the court, and to have the rents and profits collected by a receiver for the satisfaction of the debt.\n Strong evidence that the taking of these rights from the mortgagee effects a substantial impairment of the security is furnished by the occurrences in the Senate which led to the adoption there of the amendment to the bill declaring that the act 'shall apply only to debts existing at the time this Act becomes effective.' The bill as passed by the House applied to both pre-existing and future mortgages. It was amended in the Senate so as to limit it to existing mortgages; and, as so amended, was adopted by both Houses pursuant to the report of the Conference Committee. 26 This was done because, in the Senate, it was pointed out that the bill, if made applicable to future mortgages, would destroy the farmer's future mortgage credit. \n27\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 555, 596]\n\u00a0\n Sixth. Radford contends that these changes in the position of the bank, wrought pursuant to the act, do not impair substantive rights, because the bank retains every right in the property to which it is entitled. The contention rests upon the unfounded assertion that its only substantive right under the mortgage is to have the value of the security applied to the satisfaction of the debt. It would be more accurate to say that the only right under the mortgage left to the bank is the right to retain its lien until the mortgagor, some time within the five-year period, chooses to release it by paying the appraised value of the property. A mortgage lien so limited in character and incident is of course legally conceivable. It might be created by contract under existing law. \n28\n If a part of the mortgaged property were taken by eminent domain, a mortgagee would receive payment on a similar basis. \n29\n But the Frazier-Lemke Act does not purport to exercise the right of eminent domain; and neither the law of Kentucky nor Radford's mortgages contain any provision conferring upon the mortgagor an option to compel, at any time within five years, a release of the farm upon payment of its appraised value and a right to retain meanwhile possession, upon paying a rental to be fixed by the bankruptcy courts.\n Equally unfounded is the contention that the mortgagee is not injured by the denial of possession for the five years, \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 597]\n\u00a0\n since it receives the rental value of the property. \n30\n It is argued that experience has proved that five years is not unreasonably long, since a longer period is commonly required to complete a voluntary contract for the sale and purchase of a farm; or to close a bankruptcy estate; or to close a railroad receivership. And it is asserted that Radford is, in effect, acting as receiver for the bankruptcy court. Radford's argument ignores the fact that in ordinary bankruptcy proceedings and in equity receiverships, the court may in its discretion order an immediate sale and closing of the estate; and it ignores, also, the fundamental difference in purpose between the delay permitted in those proceedings and that prescribed by Congress. When a court of equity allows a receivership to continue, it does so to prevent a sacrifice of the creditor's interest. Under the act, the purpose of the delay in making a sale and of the prolonged possession accorded the mortgagor is to promote his interests at the expense of the mortgagee.\n Home Building & Loan Ass'n v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481, upon which Radford relies, lends no support to his contention. There the statute left the period of the extension of the right of redemption to be determined by the court within the maximum limit of two years. Even after the \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 598]\n\u00a0\n period had been decided upon, it could, as was pointed out, 'be reduced by the order of the court under the statute, in case of a change in circumstances. ...' (\n290 U.S. 398\n, page 447, 54 S.Ct. 231, 243, 88 A.L.R. 1481); and at the close of the period, the mortgagee was free to apply the mortgaged property to the satisfaction of the mortgage debt. Here, the option and the possession would continue although the emergency which is relied upon as justifying the act ended before November 30, 1939.31\n Seventh. Radford contends further that the changes in the mortgagee's rights in the property, even if substantial, are not arbitrary and unreasonable, because they were made for a permissible public purpose. That claim appears to rest primarily upon the following propositions: (1) The welfare of the nation demands that our farms be individually owned by those who operate them. (2) To permit widespread foreclosure of farm mortgages would result in transferring ownership, in large measure, to great corporations; would transform farmer owners into tenants or farm laborers; and would tend to create a peasant class. (3) There was grave danger at the time of the passage of the act that foreclosure of farms would become widespread. The persistent decline in the prices of agricultural products, as compared with the prices of articles which farmers are obliged to purchase, had been accentuated by the long continued depression and had made it impossible \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 599]\n\u00a0\n for farmers to pay the charges accruing under existing mortgages. (4) Thus had arisen an emergency requiring congressional action. To avert the threatened calamity the act presented an appropriate remedy. Extensive economic data, of which in large part we may take judicial notice, were submitted in support of these propositions.\n The bank calls attention, among other things, to the fact that the act is not limited to mortgages of farms operated by the owners; that the finding of the lower courts that Radford is a farmer within the meaning of the act does not necessarily imply that he operates his farm; and that at least part of it must have been rented to another, since a tenant is joined as defendant in the foreclosure suit. Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Act (to which this act is an amendment), provides, in sub-section (r), 11 USCA  203 (r), that 'the term 'farmer' means any individual who is personally bona fide engaged primarily in farming operations or the principal part of whose income is derived from farming operations.' Thus, the act affords relief not only to those owners who operate their farms, but also to all individual landlords the 'principal part of whose income is derived' from the 'farming operations' of share croppers or other tenants; and, among these landlords, to persons who are merely capitalist absentees. \n32\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 555, 600]\n\u00a0\n It has been suggested that the number of farms operated by tenants was very large before the present depression;33 that the increase of tenancy had been progressive for more than half a century;34 that the increase has not been attributable, in the main, to foreclosures;35 and that, \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 601]\n\u00a0\n in some regions, the increase in tenancy has been marked during the period when farm incomes were large and farm values, farm taxes and farm mortgages were rising rapidly. \n36\n\u00a0\n\n We have no occasion to consider either the causes or the extent of farm tenancy; or whether its progressive increase would be arrested by the provisions of the act. Nor need we consider the occupations of the beneficiaries of the legislation. These are matters for the consideration of Congress; and the extensive provision for the refinancing of farm mortgages which Congress has already made, shows that the gravity of the situation has been appreciated. \n37\n The province of the Court is limited to deciding whether the Frazier-Lemke Act (11 USCA  203(s) as applied has taken from the bank without compensation, and given to Radford, rights in specific property which are of substantial value. Compare Ochoa v. Hernandez y Morales, \n230 \nU.S. 139, 161\n, 33 S.Ct. 1033; Citizens' Savings & Loan Association v. Topeka, 20 Wall. 655, 662, 664; In re Dillard, 7 Fed. Cas. page 706, No. 3,912. As we conclude that the act as applied has done so, we must \n\n[295 U.S. 555, 602]\n\u00a0\n hold it void; for the Fifth Amendment commands that, however great the nation's need, private property shall not be thus taken even for a wholly public use without just compensation. If the public interest requires, and permits, the taking of property of individual mortgagees in order to relieve the necessities of individual mortgagors, resort must be had to proceedings by eminent domain; so that, through taxation, the burden of the relief afforded in the public interest may be borne by the public.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Motion for stay of mandate denied 55 S.Ct. 918, 79 L.Ed. --.[ Louisville Joint Stock Land Bank v.

Section 12 of the act (12 USCA  771) provided that loans should not exceed 50 per cent of the value of the land mortgaged and 20 per cent of the value of permanent insured improvement thereon. The Bank loaned the Radfords $8,000 in 1922 and an additional $1, 000 in 1924. The stocks and bonds of the Bank are privately owned. The bonds 'being instrumentalities of the Government of the United States' are tax exempt. Compare Smith v.

Mortgage loans made to farmers by the institutions subject to the Farm Credit Administration outstanding June 30, 1934, aggregated $2,029,305,081. As of March 31, 1935, the loans had been increased to $2,661,558,017. Farm Credit Administration, Monthly Reports on Loans and Discounts, March, 1935. 'The proceeds of the loans closed (in 1933- 34) both by the land banks and by the Land Bank Commissioner were used principally to refinance existing indebtedness. Of the loans closed by the land banks, approximately 86.8 per cent were used for this purpose, and of those closed by the Commissioner, 92 per cent were so used.'

Circular No. 354 of United States Department of Agriculture, April, 1935, p. 5. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] The appraisal dated December 1, 1934 recited originally that $4,445 was the 'fair and reasonable value,' without mentioning the market value. It was, by leave of court, amended on December 4, 1934, to read as stated in the text. Besides the mortgaged property, Radford had a one-half interest in a half-acre lot and house thereon appraised at $150; exempt personal property appraised at $568; and nonexempt personal property at $ 831.50. The amount of the indebtedness other than to the Bank, and the terms of the composition offered do not appear. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] (1, 2) See Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence,  162-3, 376, 381-2, 1180, 1186-1190, 1219; H.W.

The second Bankruptcy Act, August 19, 1841, c. 9, 5 Stat. 440, followed the severe depression of 1837. The third Bankruptcy Act, March 3, 1867, c. 176, 14 Stat. 517, followed the financial disturbances incident to the Civil War. The fourth Bankruptcy Act, July 1, 1898, c. 541, 30 Stat. 544 (see 11 USCA) followed the depression of 1893.

When in Re Klein (reported in a note to Nelson v. Carland, 1 How. 265, 277), the constitutionality of the Bankruptcy Act of 1841 was challenged because it brought within its scope insolvent debtors other than traders and provided for voluntary proceeding, Mr. Justice Catron, sitting in Circuit said: 'I hold, it (the bankruptcy power) extends to all cases where the law causes to be distributed the property of the debtor among his creditors; this is its least limit. Its greatest, is a discharge of the debtor from his contracts. And all intermediate legislation, affecting substance and form, but tending to further the great end of the subject-distribution and discharge-are in the competency and discretion of Congress.' Judge Blatchford, when sustaining the provision for composition in Re Reiman, 20 Fed.Cas. 490, 496, No. 11,673, said that the subject of bankruptcy cannot properly be defined as 'anything less than the subject of the relations between an insolvent or non-paying or fraudulent debtor, and his creditors, extending to his and their relief.' And Mr. Justice Hunt, sitting in that case, on appeal to the Circuit Court said that 'whatever relates to the subject of bankruptcy is within the jurisdiction of congress.'

Ryan, Usury and Usury Laws (1924), pp. 28- 31. In Kentucky, 6 per cent. is both the legal and the lawful rate. Carroll's Ky. St.  2218, 2219. \n\n[\nFootnote 21\n] The prescribed payment (interest) for the first year is 1 per cent. on the appraised value. The prescribed payment for the second year is 3 1\/2 per cent. thereof (1 per cent. for interest, 2 1\/2 per cent. on account of principal). The prescribed payment for the third year is 2 1\/2 per cent. of the principal and as interest 1 per cent. on 97 1\/2 per cent. of the principal. The prescribed payment for the fourth year is 5 per cent. on account of the principal, and as interest, 1 per cent. on 95 per cent. of the principal. The prescribed payment for the fifth year is 5 per cent. on account of principal, and as interest, 1 per cent. on 90 per cent. of the principal. The prescribed payment at the end of the sixth year is 85 per cent. of the principal, and as interest 1 per cent. of 85 per cent. of the principal. The present value calculated on a 6 per cent. basis, of all deferred payments (principal and interest) would be only 76.6 per cent. of the appraised value. In other words, the agreement to sell if assented to by the mortgagee would require him to relinquish his security not for its appraised value in cash, but for deferred payments which, if met, would yield (on a 6 per cent. basis) only 76.6 per cent. of the appraised value. \n[\nFootnote 22\n] When the decree complained of was issued there had already been defaults in tax payments continuing more than two years. See page 1. \n\n[\nFootnote 23\n] This is the construction given to paragraph 7 by both of the lower courts, by both of the parties in their briefs and oral arguments here, and, so far as appears, by all other courts and judges that have passed upon the act, except District Judge Lindley, who, in Re Miner (D.C.) 9 F. Supp. 1, held that paragraph 7, as well as paragraph 3, was conditioned upon the mortgagee's consent to a sale to the debtor at the appraised value.

When a farmer goes to his advancing merchant, or goes to his banker, or applies to an insurance company for a loan under this bill, I want to know; and I am inquiring with earnest anxiety about it, what effect is it going to have upon those credit facilities for the farmers of this country.' Id. p. 12.074.\n Senator Fess: 'It does seem to me that we might destroy the credit which he insists the farmers have, because everyone realizes that by the passage of this bill we may be making it impossible for the farmer in the future to borrow money.' Id. p. 12,075.\n Representative Peyser expressed the same view: 'I believe that many of the Members are overlooking a very vital point in connection with this legislation-that is the fact that you are removing from the farmer the possibility of securing any mortgage assistance in the future. I believe in the enactment of this law and the scaling down of values you are going to take away the possibility of help that may be needed by these farmers in the future.' Id. p. 12,137. \n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] Many instances can be found of mortgages which provide that parcels of the mortgaged property shall be released upon payment of fixed amounts or upon payment of their value upon an appraisal therein provided for. See 1 Jones, Mortgages (8th Ed. 1928),  98. Compare Clarke v. Cowan, 206 Mass. 252, 92 N.E. 474, 138 Am.St.Rep. 388. \n[\nFootnote 29\n] See 2 Jones, Mortgages (8th Ed. 1928),  843. \n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] Counsel for the debtor suggests that the reasonable rental provided for in paragraph 7, is more than the secured creditor ordinarily receives in bankruptcy, since interest on secured as well as unsecured claims ceases with the filing of the petition. But the rule relied upon applies only when the secured creditor, having realized upon his security, is seeking as a general creditor to prove for the deficiency against the bankrupt estate. Sexton v. Dreyfus, \n219 \nU.S. 339\n, 31 S.Ct. 256. It has no application when the mortgagee has a preferred claim against proceeds realized by the trustee from a sale of the security free of liens. Coder v. Arts, \n213 \nU.S. 223, 228\n, 245 S., 29 S.Ct. 436, 16 Ann.Cas. 1008, affirming (C.C.A.) 152 F. 943, 950, 15 L.R.A.(N.S.) 372; People's Homestead Ass'n v. Bartlette (C.C.A.) 33 F.(2d) 561; Mortgage Loan Co. v. Livingston (C.C.A.) 45 F.(2d) 28, 34. \n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] As by section 75 the petition of the farmer mortgagor may be filed at any time within five years after March 3, 1933, and the period of the possession and of the option extends for five years, the provision might bar enforcement of an existing mortgage until 1943.\n Counsel for Radford contends that the five-year provision of paragraph 7 is not inflexible, because, under the rule of Chastleton Corporation v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543\n, 44 S.Ct. 405, it would cease to be effective on the termination of the emergency which is relied upon to justify the act. But the act does not make the five-year option period dependent upon the continuance of a national emergency; and the options conferred upon the farmer owner show that it was the needs of the particular debtor to which consideration was given. \n\n[\nFootnote 32\n] In 1930, only 56 per cent. of the farm mortgage debt of the country rested on farms operated by their owners. The Farm Debt Problem, Letter from the Secretary of Agriculture, House Doc. No. 9, p. 9, 73d Cong ., 1st Sess. Of the landlords of farms throughout United States: 'More than a third are engaged in agricultural occupations, nearly another third are retired farmers, and the remaining third are in non-agricultural occupations, mostly country bankers, merchants and professional men in the country towns and villages who have either come into farm ownership through inheritance or marriage, or have purchased farms for purposes of investment or speculation.' Yearbook of Agriculture (1923), p. 538. 'Furthermore, the percentage of cases in which landlords were remote from their farms is higher in some of the more recently developed farming regions than in some of the older farming regions. Thus in eastern North Dakota 40 per cent of the tenant farms were owned by landlords not residing in the same county and the proportion is nearly as large in central Kansas and in Oklahoma.' Id. p. 535. \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] Of the 6,288,648 farms in 1930, 42.4 per cent. were operated by tenants. The percentage in Kentucky operated by tenants was 35.9 per cent.; in Iowa, 47.3 per cent.; in Georgia, 68.2 per cent. In the South, 1,790, 783 families were working as tenant farmers. See Hearings, March 5, 1935, on S. 2367, the Bill to create the Farm Tenant Homes Corporation, pp. 6, 14, 15, 16, 18, 39, 70, 72, 75, and Sen. Rep. 446, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., April 11, 1935. \n[\nFootnote 34\n] During the half century prior to the present business depression, every decennial census recorded a progressive increase in farm tenancy. Of the 4,008,907 farms in the United States in 1880, 25.6 per cent. were operated by tenants; of the 6,448,343 farms in 1920, 38.1 per cent. were operated by tenants. Farm Tenure, Census of 1920, Agriculture, vol. V, p. 133, T. 11. The percentage of improved farm land operated by owners in 1920 was only 46.8. Farm Ownership & Tenancy, Yearbook of Agriculture ( 1923), p. 509. \n[\nFootnote 35\n] 'Causes underlying this upward trend of tenancy are complex and obscure. The trend has apparently continued through the various shades of adversity and prosperity. Farms operated by managers are not classed with tenancy. As has been pointed out before, the best, most productive lands have the greatest tenancy. Apparently tenancy does not thrive on poor lands. It is hardly thinkable that high productiveness is a result of tenancy. It is a fact, however, that the largest uptrend in the yield of corn per acre is in the area of greatest tenancy.' Iowa Year Book of Agriculture (1931), p. 349. In Iowa, 1927, tenant operated acres were 53.9 per cent. of the total acres in farms. In 1930, the percentage was 54.8; in 1931, it was 55.4. In 1932, it was 57.7; in 1933, 58.6. Id. (1932) p. 168; (1933) p. 213. See, also, Yearbook of Agriculture (1923), pp. 539-547; Turner, Ownership of Tenant Farms in the United States. Bull. No. 1432, and Ownership of Tenant Farms in North Central States, Bull. No. 1433, U.S. Dep't of Agriculture (1926). \n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] 'The increase in tenancy in the West North Central States is without doubt the result of the price situation. Land bought in the period of high prices could not be paid for, with the result that it is now operated by tenants.' Yearbook of Agriculture, 1932, p. 494. From 1910 to 1920, farm mortgage debt increased from $3,320,470,000 to $7,857,700,000. See The Farm Debt Problem, House Doc. No. 9, p. 5, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. In 1910, the total acreage of farm land was 878,798,325; in 1920, it was 955, 883,715. Census of 1920, Agriculture, vol. V, p. 32, T. 3. The greatly increased local tax rate, in connection with increased land values, has been suggested as being an important cause of increasing farm tenancy. Hearings on S. 2367, p. 16. The average value of farm property per acre in 1880, was $22.72; in 1920, $81,52; in 1930, $58.01. Census of 1930, Agriculture, vol. II, p. 10, T.I. Farm property taxes in 1910 amounted to approximately $268 millions; in 1920, to $452 millions; in 1932, to $629 millions. See The Farm Debt Problem, supra, p. 21. \n[\nFootnote 37\n] See note 4. \n\n\n\n\n","107":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMANUFACTURERS' FINANCE CO. v. MCKEY(1935)\nNo. 522\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 442, 443]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edward I. Rothbart, of Chicago, Ill., and Samuel A. Dew, of Kansas City, Mo., for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas L. Marshall, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This writ brings here for consideration certain questions in respect of the enforcement of a contract between petitioner and Grigsby-Grunow Company (hereinafter referred to as the company) made October 5, 1933. The \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 444]\n\u00a0\n contract purports to be one for the purchase of designated accounts receivable for which petitioner promised to pay 100 per cent. of the actual net amounts thereof, less a charge for interest on the purchase money outstanding and less compensation for certain services rendered or to be rendered by petitioner. Fifty per cent. of the actual net amounts was to be paid in cash upon acceptance of the accounts; and the remainder, with specified deductions and additions, was to be paid immediately upon payment of the accounts. All original checks, drafts, notes, etc., received by the company in full or partial payment of any of the accounts so purchased were to be delivered to petitioner at its office on the day of their receipt. Attorneys' fees, costs and expenses incurred by petitioner were to be paid by the company. Compensation for services was to be at the rate of 83 1\/2 per cent. of one-thirtieth of 1 per cent. of the net face amount of accounts for each day from the date of purchase. Total charges against the company, as estimated by the parties, would equal about 20 per cent. per annum upon the outstanding balance of cash advances up to November 24, 1933\n\n\n Among other services, petitioner agreed to furnish to the company specified information upon request in respect of customers; to furnish information and advice as to the most desirable method of keeping books, records, and accounts of the company; to give, upon request, financial and business advice; to obtain and have on hand at all times funds to make prompt remittance for acceptable accounts; to supply forms needed for assignment of accounts; to put its credit and collection department at the disposal of the company; and to furnish advice and opinions as to the form and legality of the company's sales contracts with its customers.\n On November 24, 1933, in a suit brought by a creditor against the company, a federal District Court for the Northern District of Illinois appointed receivers to preserve the property and assets of the company. The company was \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 445]\n\u00a0\n solvent, having assets greatly exceeding its liabilities; and the receivers were directed to continue the business as a going concern and to do all things necessary to that end and to preserve the property. They were directed to take charge of all assets, books of account, etc.; to employ and discharge and fix compensation of employees, agents, etc.; to collect, sell, and liquidate accounts, etc.; and to purchase on credit or otherwise such supplies and equipment as might be necessary to continue the business as a going concern. All persons were enjoined from interfering with the receivers in their possession of the property, the administration of their trust, or in the performance of the duties imposed upon them.\n The receivers refused to pay over to petitioner anything collected on the assigned accounts unless directed to do so by the court. Subsequently, such direction being given, the receivers from time to time paid to petitioner various sums which, together with an amount collected by the petitioner itself, finally liquidated the amount due petitioner up to the time when the receivers were appointed. This liquidation was effected between the date of the receivership and December 29, 1933; a period of 35 days. Petitioner had already (on November 29, 1933) intervened in the receivership proceeding with a petition seeking compliance on the part of the receivers with the terms of its contract; and, after the liquidation to the extent stated above had been effected, petitioner continued the proceeding under its petition, demanding payment at the contract rate of a sum aggregating, at the end of the 35-day period, $4,394.48, together with reasonable attorneys' fees and costs. No accounts were purchased or assigned after the receivership, and the only obligation which remained was to carry out the terms of the contract in so far as they affected the accounts already assigned.\n The gross sum which petitioner received under the contract for the time prior to the receivership was equal to \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 446]\n\u00a0\n the estimated 20 per cent. per annum on the moneys actually advanced to the company. The amount which it was claimed had accrued during the 35-day period was equivalent to an average of about 28.3 per cent. per annum from the date of the appointment of the receivers. The petition asked for reasonable attorneys' fees without specifying any amount. The only testimony on the subject was that of an attorney who said the sum of $7, 800 was reasonable.\n The District Court entered a decree in favor of petitioner for.$1,087. 93, being at the rate of 7 per cent. instead of 28.3 per cent. per annum, upon the outstanding balances. That court denied all further relief on the sole ground that petitioner's demand was inequitable and that in making it petitioner had not come into equity with clean hands. The decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. P. R. Mallory & Co. v. Grigsby- Grunow Co., 72 F.(2d) 471, 473. The basis of that court's decision cannot be better stated than in its own words: 'The insistence of appellant upon its claim for the full rate of interest plus attorneys' fees at a preposterous rate, when it appeared that there was no more business to be done under the contract because of the receivership of the Company savors too much of the exaction of the pound of flesh from the creditors of the insolvent company to be enforcible in a court of equity. If this case arose in an action at law between the original parties it may well be that the court could not refuse to enforce the contract according to its strictest terms. But where the creditor goes beyond the practice of the parties under the original contract and tries to enforce rights never asserted against the other contracting party, and in addition tries to collect counsel fees exceeding 177% of the maximum amount claimed against the receiver who is attempting to salvage the assets for the benefit of the other creditors who have a substantial interest in the estate of the debtor, we can not \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 447]\n\u00a0\n feel that a court of equity is any place for him to press his demands.'\n February 18, 1934, while the appeal was pending in the Court of Appeals, a petition in bankruptcy was filed in the federal District Court against the company; and this was followed by an adjudication of bankruptcy and the selection, April 16, 1934, and qualification, later, of the respondent McKey as trustee in bankruptcy. Subsequently, upon the application of both parties, McKey was substituted in the Court of Appeals as appellee.\n In connection with the discussion which follows, two considerations are to be borne in mind: (1) When the receivers were appointed November 24, 1933, the company was solvent, having assets exceeding its liabilities in the sum of $13,000,000, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that this condition of solvency did not continue until after the completion of the 35-day period here involved. (2) What effect, if any, an act of bankruptcy might have had upon the life or operation of the contract we need not determine, since it is plain that the appointment of a receiver upon the application of a creditor is not an act of bankruptcy except in cases of insolvency. Title 11, U.S.C.  21(a), as amended May 27, 1926, Title 11, U.S.C. Supp. VII,  21(a)(5), 11 USCA  21(a), (5); Nolte v. Hudson Nav. Co. (C.C.A.) 8 F.(2d) 859, 866; Meek v. Beezer (C.C.A.) 28 F.( 2d) 343, 345; In re Edward Ellsworth Co. (D.C.), 173 F. 699, 700, 701; In re Guardian Building & Loan Ass'n (D.C.) 53 F.(2d) 412, 415.\n The effect of the contract was to bind the company as agent of petitioner to collect the purchased accounts and deliver to the latter the proceeds in kind from day to day as fast as they were collected. The receivers were equally bound.\n The extent of the benefit which accrued to the company by reason of the advantages which evidently were expected to result from the opportunity to avail itself of the \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 448]\n\u00a0\n use of a large part of the proceeds of the accounts in advance of their payment, and from the services of petitioner, is not a matter for judicial inquiry. The parties dealt at arm's length. The contract was voluntarily executed by the board of directors of the company. It is not suggested that there was any mistake or any fraud or overreaching on the part of petitioner. The contract, it is conceded, is valid under the statutes of Illinois as construed by the Supreme Court of the state, Tennant v. Joerns, 329 Ill. 34, 160 N.E. 160; and, so far as the record discloses, it was performed on the part of petitioner in all respects up to, at least, the appointment of the receivers.\n But the court below refused to be bound by the law of Illinois, upon a theory which it had advanced in a former case, In re Chicago Reed & Furniture Co., 7 F.(2d) 885, namely, that a state law cannot 'abrogate the rule that courts of equity will not lend their aid to enforce contracts which upon their face are so manifestly harsh and oppressive as to shock the conscience.' With that view as here applied we are unable to agree.\n The contract was in force when the receivers were appointed; and it continued effective until the expiration of 35 days thereafter, at which time it was brought to an end. During that period, if there were no default on petitioner's part, the contract, in so far as it remained unperformed, was enforceable against these receivers as theretofore it had been against the company. Merchants' & Manufacturers' Securities Co. v. Johnson (C.C.A.) 69 F. (2d) 940, 945; compare Fosdick v. Schall, \n99 U.S. 235\n, 251.\n The mere fact that a party is obliged to go into a federal court of equity to enforce an essentially legal right arising upon a contract valid and unassailable under controlling state law does not authorize that court to modify or ignore the terms of the legal obligation upon the claim, \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 449]\n\u00a0\n or because the court thinks, that these terms are harsh or oppressive or unreasonable. A party may stand upon the terms of a valid contract in a court of equity as he may in a court of law. 'If he asks no favors, he need grant none. But if he calls upon a court of chancery to put forth its extraordinary powers and grant him purely equitable relief, he may with propriety be required to submit to the operation of a rule which always applies in such cases, and do equity in order to get equity.' Fosdick v. Schall, supra, at page 253 of 99 U.S. The petitioner here did not seek equitable relief. It sought an enforcement of its legal rights; and, as said by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, 'Legal rights are as safe in chancery as they are in a court of law, and, however strong an appeal may be to the conscience of a chancellor for equitable relief, he is powerless to grant it if the one from whom it must come will be deprived of a legal right.' Colonial Tr. Co., Appellant, v. Central Tr. Co., 243 Pa. 268, 276, 90 A. 189, 191. The maxim 'he who seeks equity must do equity' presupposes that equitable, as distinguished from legal, rights, substantive or remedial, have arisen from the subject-matter in favor of each of the parties; and it requires that such rights shall not be enforced in favor of one who affirmatively seeks their enforcement except upon condition that he consent to accord to the other his correlative equitable rights. But it is well settled, this court said in Hedges v. Dixon County, \n150 \nU.S. 182, 189\n, 14 S.Ct. 71, 73, 'that a court of equity, in the absence of fraud, accident, or mistake, cannot change the terms of a contract.'\n Missouri, Kansas, etc., Trust Co. v. Krumseig, \n172 \nU.S. 351\n, 19 S.Ct. 179, dealt with the precise question now under consideration. The situation presented there was the converse of that presented here, but the applicable principle is the same. There, suit was brought in equity in a state court to cancel a mortgage and certain notes secured there \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 450]\n\u00a0\n by, on the ground that they embodied a contract bad for usury under a state statute. The suit was removed to a federal District Court. That court granted the relief which was sought, conditionally, and its decree was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. The state law declared such a contract to be wholly void. Both courts, however, invoking the equitable maxim 'he who seeks equity must do equity,' held that the plaintiff could not have the relief except on the generally recognized equitable condition that he pay to the lender the money loaned together with legal interest. This Court, rejecting the view of the lower courts that a federal court in the exercise of its jurisdiction cannot be deprived of the power or relieved of the duty to enforce and apply the established principle of equity embodied in the maxim, said, pages 358, 359 of 172 U.S., 19 S.Ct. 179, 182: 'We think it a satisfactory reply to such a proposition that the complainants in the present case were not seeking equity, but to avail themselves of a substantive right under the statutory law of the state . ... With the policy of the state legislation the federal courts have nothing to do. If the states ... think that the evils of usury are best prevented by making usurious contracts void, and by giving a right to the borrowers to have such contracts unconditionally nullified and canceled by the courts, such a view of public policy, in respect to contracts made within the state and sought to be enforced therein, is obligatory on the federal courts, whether acting in equity or at law. The local law, consisting of the applicable statutes as construed by the supreme court of the state, furnishes the rule of decision.' Compare Brine v. Insurance Co., \n96 U.S. 627\n.\n Again, in City of Columbus v. Mercantile Trust Co., \n218 \nU.S. 645, 662\n, 31 S.Ct. 105, this court declined to apply the maxim in favor of a plaintiff who had failed to prove his case against a \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 451]\n\u00a0\n defendant, who had filed a cross-bill for defensive relief, holding that the maxim applied only against one who had affirmatively sought equitable relief.\n It seems to be conceded, or, if not, it must be, that in an action at law against the receivers the court would have been bound to enforce the contract under review strictly in accordance with its terms. And, not to go beyond the case in hand, the rule is not otherwise where plaintiff, precluded by judicial order from proceeding at law, is obliged to submit the determination of his strictly legal rights to a chancery court because it has plenary control of the remedy.\n The maxim that 'he who comes into equity must come with clean hands,' which the District Court invoked and made the basis of its decision, for reasons similar to those already stated, is equally inapplicable. Certainly no unconscionable or inequitable conduct can be attributed to petitioner because it undertook to secure the fruits of a perfectly valid, albeit a hard, contract in the only court to which it could apply without being subject to a charge of contempt. Moreover, the maxim, if applicable, required the District Court to halt petitioner at the threshold and refuse it any relief whatsoever; not to compromise with it, as the court did, by allowing a part of what was claimed. It seems plain enough that in no aspect of the case is any equitable principle involved.\n The decisions of the court below in the present case and in the Reed & Furniture Co. Case, supra, are contrary to every other decision called to our attention or that we have been able to find involving a similar situation. A case practically the same as that presented here is Merchants' & Manufacturers' Securities Co. v. Johnson, supra. The contracts there involved were identical with the one here, and were likewise governed by the law of Illinois denying to a corporation the defense of usury. A receiver had been \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 452]\n\u00a0\n appointed to continue the business of the corporate parties to the contract. In deciding the case, the Court of Appeals of the Eighth Circuit emphasized the fact that the receiver was appointed (as the receivers were here) not to wind up the affairs of the corporations, but to carry on their business as going concerns; and it held that he succeeded to their property subject to the contract rights which obtained at the time of his appointment. 'He had no greater or different rights than those that might have been asserted by the companies.' Reversing a decree of the District Court, the Court of Appeals directed the entry of a decree in favor of the securities company for the full amount claimed; that amount to constitute a special lien upon all accounts receivable still unpaid and upon the proceeds of the same in the hands of the receiver. In re International Raw Material Corporation (C.C.A.) 22 F. (2d) 920, involved a contract which, although not in identical terms, was in principle the same as that here under consideration. That court, resting upon a New York statute denying to a corporation the defense of usury, enforced the contract against a trustee in bankruptcy. It considered and definitely rejected the doctrine announced in the Reed & Furniture Co. Case, holding there was no justification for nullifying the agreement of the parties because the interest and commissions deliberately arranged were too large to satisfy the ideas of a court. See, also, to the same effect, In re Gotham Can Co. ( C.C.A.) 48 F.(2d) 540; Ramsey v. Marlin Firearms Corporation (D.C.) 14 F.( 2d) 314; Estes v. E. B. Estes & Sons (D.C.) 24 F.(2d) 756.\n We see no escape from the logic of these decisions.\n The receivers alleged as a defense, apparently by way of recoupment, that they had expended a large sum of money in making collection of the accounts which inured to the benefit of petitioner by assuring to it a return of its advances. The District Court found that the receivers, among other things, had expended $35,000 in advertising \n\n[294 U.S. 442, 453]\n\u00a0\n in order to maintain the good will of the company and preserve its receivables as live and valuable assets, and seemed to think that the petitioner had been benefited thereby. No suggestion, however, is made by either of the lower courts or by the respondent as to how much of these expenditures should be borne by petitioner; and the record affords no information by which the amount can be calculated. Even less does it appear how much, if any, of these expenditures related to the assigned accounts.\n Whether, upon further and more definite evidence, under all the circumstances and consistently with the provisions of the contract, petitioner may be held for any part of these expenditures, we do not determine.\n Both lower courts refused to allow any amount for attorneys' fees, apparently on the ground, which we have rejected, that to do so would be contrary to equitable principles. The contract seems to contemplate a reasonable allowance for such fees, but the amount, if any, remains to be fixed by the District Court upon consideration of all pertinent facts relating to services rendered by the attorneys after the date of the receivership, and with due relation to its ultimate determination upon the merits.\n As already appears from what has been said, the decrees below rest wholly on the untenable assumption that petitioner's rights are subject to denial or curtailment in virtue of equitable principles applicable only against one who affirmatively has sought equitable relief; and here that was not the case. The question, or extent, of petitioner's legal rights, relieved of this assumption, has been neither determined nor considered upon the facts or the applicable law. The duty and responsibility of that consideration and determination lie primarily with the lower courts; and, in the light of the peculiar circumstances disclosed by the record, should not, we think, be assumed in the first instance by this Court.

FURLAUD(1935)\nNo. 26\nArgued: Decided: November 11, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 140, 143]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ralph Royall, of New York City, for petitioner.\n\n\n[296 U.S. 140, 145]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Louis B. Eppstein and Ira W. Hirshfield, both of New York City, for respondents.\n\n\n[296 U.S. 140, 149]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The suit is by a receiver of an insolvent corporation to compel its promoters and their confederates to restore illicit gains.\n At the time of the challenged acts Maxime H. Furlaud was the president and principal shareholder of Furlaud & Company, Inc., a corporation now dissolved. For convenience the name Furlaud, unless qualified, will be used to designate the company. Carlos Reuter was an officer of the same corporation and a holder of a block of shares. He was named as a defendant, but was not served with process, and hence is out of the case, except in so far as his acts affect the liability of others. Kingston Corporation was a subsidiary of Furlaud and was owned and controlled by the same persons. Byron Corporation and Chaucer Corporation were closely related to Furlaud and Kingston; the wife of Maxime Furlaud being an important shareholder in Byron and the wife of Carlos Reuter an important shareholder in Chaucer.\n Furlaud was known as an investment banking house, and was interested in the issue and sale of corporate securities. Particularly it was interested in a project for the formation of a Company that would own and operate gas fields in Western Pennsylvania. Reuter, representing Furlaud, took options from the owners of nine separate tracts. These options, which at first were gratuitous, were acquired in the name of a subsidiary, Kingston. \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 150]\n\u00a0\n Engineers were then employed to examine the fields and appraise their value. One of them, Davis, made report to his employer in February, 1930, that five of the tracts, which were afterwards acquired for about $1,300, 000, had a value of about $1,700,000 at the time of the appraisal. The record permits the inference that the report was unsatisfactory to Reuter, who was hoping for a valuation that would make investment in the enterprise more attractive to the public. Accordingly, the business of appraisal for the four remaining tracts was taken out of the hands of Davis and placed in charge of others. The new engineers were less conservative than their predecessor. They fixed the value of the four tracts at about $5,000,000, nearly five times the purchase price. Lands to be conveyed by Nuss for $660,000 figured in the appraisal as worth the price and a million over. A value of $850,000 was assigned to undeveloped acres which he agreed to convey for nothing. The purchase price for the nine tracts was $2,572,989; $7,000,000, or nearly that, was the appraisal for the whole. A witness for the complainant stated at the trial that the fair value of all the tracts was about $2,700,000, the cost, and little more.\n With the appraisals thus completed, a company was organized in February, 1930, to take title to the gas fields covered by the options. This was the Duquesne Gas Corporation, now in the hands of the complainant as receiver. The options for the lands were still in the name of Kingston. Furlaud had made a payment ($45,510) to give them binding force, but title had not passed. The new company when organized had an authorized capital of 1,000 shares of no-par common stock. Furlaud subscribed for the whole issue, paying for the shares at the rate of 50 cents a share. The nominees and representatives of Furlaud were then the sole stockholders. They were also the sole directors. Provision was made after- \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 151]\n\u00a0\n wards for an increase of the capital stock, but of this there will be more later.\n With the options still outstanding Furlaud formed a syndicate of bankers to market the securities. The syndicate published an advertisement in a newspaper inviting subscriptions by the public to an issue of bonds and notes. There were to be $4,000,000 6 per cent. mortgage bonds (to be sold at 97 1\/2 per cent.), and $1,000,000 6 1\/2 per cent. mortgage notes ( to be sold at 98 per cent.). Each circular contains the caption 'purpose of issue.' In the bond circular the statement is: 'These bonds are issued by the corporation in connection with the acquisition of properties, and to provide cash for developments, extensions and other corporate purposes.' There is a like statement in the other circular as to the purpose of the notes. Investors were informed that the appraisals of the engineers covering the properties of the corporation, including working capital of $ 365,000, aggregate $7,038,000; the properties examined by Davis being appraised at $1,743,520, and those examined by his successors at $4,929, 787. The circulars as first drafted lumped the two appraisals as if they had been the work of the two appraisers jointly. Davis objected, with the result that the appraisals became several.\n In the meantime Duquesne was preparing the resolutions and agreements that would be necessary to satisfy the bankers. On March 5, 1930, the directors, still dominated by Furlaud, authorized the increase of the capital stock to 1,250,000 shares. On April 3, Furlaud subscribed for 139, 000 shares at 50 cents a share. On April 7 Duquesne agreed with Kingston to take over the gas fields covered by the options as soon as Kingston got the title. The consideration was to be cash in the sum of $3,015,000 ( which was $565,100 more than Kingston was expected to pay to the grantors); bonds of the par value of $1,300, \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 152]\n\u00a0\n 000, part of the forthcoming issue; and 535,000 shares of no-par stock. On the same day there was an agreement between Duquesne and Furlaud whereby Furlaud agreed to take all the forthcoming mortgage notes ($1,000,000) at a price of 88 per cent.; and $2,700,000 mortgage bonds at a price of 90 per cent. The whole issue of mortgage bonds was thus divided up between Furlaud and its subsidiary, Kingston; $2,700,000 to the one and $1,300,000 to the other. Furlaud and Kingston being one, the situation was the same in substance as if Furlaud had taken them all.\n The public offering of the bonds was a spectacular success. It began on March 25. By the first week of April subscriptions of the par value of $ 2,350,000 were on hand, and other subscriptions were coming in from day to day. The responses made it clear that an avid and credulous public would absorb the entire issue. Furlaud could safely go ahead and exercise the options, for, at the pace subscriptions were coming in, the proceeds of the bonds would pay for all the gas lands and leave a handsome margin over. Even so, there was need of ingenuity to work out a plan that would synchronize the two transactions, the cashing of the subscriptions, and the payment for the lands. The cash would not be paid on the subscriptions till the bonds with the deed of trust were ready for delivery, and delivery was impossible until Duquesne, the mortgagor, had title to the fields. A way had to be found for providing the money necessary to get possession of the deeds, which had been placed by the grantors in escrow with banks in Western Pennsylvania. A way had to be found also for making the proceeds of the subscriptions available as a fund that could be applied with a minimum of delay upon account of the purchase price. To those ends Maxime Furlaud made arrangements with the Central Hanover Bank & Trust Company of New York that for one day the Kingston Corporation should \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 153]\n\u00a0\n have a credit with the trust company of $3,015,000, and the Furlaud Company for the same time a credit of $3,379,500. The day chosen for that purpose was April 9. The credits would be used to procure title to the lands and to supply the new corporation with a fund of working capital. The subscriptions would be used so far as possible to liquidate the credits. Precautions were taken to make certain that the credits would be applied to the expected uses and not otherwise. In the words of a witness, 'the bank always had a string on the money.'\n The appointed day arrived. Kingston drew against the credit of $3,015, 000 set up in its favor, and delivered certified checks to banks in New York with which to meet drafts drawn by those banks on the banks in Western Pennsylvania. The amount thus withdrawn was $2,449,900. On report by telephone and telegraph that the checks had been received the Pennsylvania banks released the deeds from escrow and caused them to be placed on record. Title being thereby vested in the mortgagor, the mortgage bonds were handed over to the trust company for transmission to the banking houses that had collected the subscriptions. A long queue of messengers, employed by these houses, was on hand throughout the day with checks from the subscribers for delivery against the bonds. Nearly $2,000, 000 (if the defendants' figures are accepted, $1,886,330) was paid then and there upon account of the subscriptions with other payments close at hand. What was paid from these sources was turned over to Furlaud, who applied it at once toward the liquidation of the loan.\n The loan had been fixed at the precise amount necessary to enable Furlaud to discharge its obligations to Duquesne. Of the credit for account of Furlaud, $2,430,000 was used to pay for $2,700,000 bonds at 90; $ 880,000 for $1,000,000 notes at 88; and $69,500 for 139,000 shares of stock at 50 cents a share ($3,379,500 in all). But Du- \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 154]\n\u00a0\n quesne was no sooner in receipt of the money than it paid the greater part out again. Of the $3,379,500, $3,015,000 was paid back to the Trust Company to be credited to the account of Kingston. This canceled the Kingston loan, reimbursed the Trust Company for the $2,449,900 withdrawn earlier in the day to obtain title to the lands, and left $565,100 over. This balance was not kept by Kingston. It was transferred at once to Furlaud; the circuit was then complete.\n Furlaud had been well assured, when it closed the title on April 9, that there would be no difficulty in disposing of every bond and note. The event justified its faith. Within a few weeks all the remaining bonds had been converted into cash. Also within a few weeks the notes had been sold in bulk for $861,097.69 to a firm of investment bankers. Even the worthless shares of stock were unloaded on the public. The shares that were to go to Kingston (535,000) and those that were to go to Furlaud (139, 000) were taken in the name of Parisette, one of Furlaud's employees. Of the part belonging to Kingston, 85,000 shares were assigned to the Byron and the Chaucer Companies, which sold them to the public through Bergen, a stock operator, for $850,000,  425,000 being paid to Byron and a like amount to Chaucer. What became of the other shares the record does not show.\n Checks and credits have now been traced through their bewildering entanglements. None the less, when the process of analysis is over, it is legitimate to forget the details and fix our minds on the results. The situation can be simplified without obscuring its essential features. Indeed, only in that way will the realities of what was done be manifest.\n After all the circuits had been traveled from one company to another and back to the point of origin, what had been accomplished for Duquesne and Furlaud stood out in clear relief. Duquesne had the ownership of gas fields, \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 155]\n\u00a0\n worth at cost about $2,500,000, though extravagantly appraised at many millions more. It had also $365,000 for working capital. True, it had received $3,379,500, but it had paid out at once $3,015,000. The working capital was the difference ($364,500) together with $500 received for the first issue of its shares. These are the credit items that any balance sheet must show. The liabilities were the bonds and notes and the nopar shares of stock. The bonds and notes, when distributed to the public, became liens for $5,000,000, more than $2,000,000 in excess of the cost of all the assets with working capital included. The shares of stock, issued in vast quantities, had nothing of substance back of them. If cost and value were about the same, there was thus insolvency at the beginning as well as at the end, unless the proceeds of the securities were devoted to the uses of the debtor, as the circulars published in the newspaper in effect stated they would be. Nothing of the kind was done. The bonds and the notes, instead of being used by Furlaud and its allies for the benefit of Duquesne, were disposed of as their own and at a large profit to themselves. The record supports the inference that some of the shares of stock were used in the same way. The promoters and their confederates pocketed the spoils. Less than two years later the victimized company was in the hands of a receiver.\n The District Judge held that the appraisal of the Duquesne assets was excessive and fraudulent. 'There is little doubt,' he said, 'that the circulars which Furlaud & Company, Inc., issued in connection with the sale and distribution of the bonds and notes of Duquesne Gas Corporation grossly and fraudulently misrepresented the value of the property by which they were secured.' He held also that by force of the statements in the circulars as to 'the purpose of the issue,' the proceeds of the subscriptions were chargeable with a trust for the benefit of Duquesne and the holders of its mortgage debt. He \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 156]\n\u00a0\n gave judgment against Furlaud individually (the Furlaud Company was then dissolved) and also against Kingston for $1,554,779.73, with interest (a total of $1,834,640.08), which was the difference between the moneys realized by the promotors through the sale of bonds and notes ($4,492,768. 73), and the amount paid to Duquesne and devoted to its proper uses ($2, 937,989). He refused to give judgment against any of the defendants for the proceeds of the shares of stock. There were cross-appeals to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; Furlaud individually and Kingston appealing from the decree in so far as it held them accountable for the proceeds of the bonds and notes, and the receiver from so much of the decree as relieved all the defendants from liability growing out of the disposition of the shares. Upon the first hearing of the cause, the Court of Appeals declined to pass upon the merits and dismissed the bill on the ground that the appointment of the ancillary receiver was void for want of jurisdiction. 68 F.(2d) 925. This court reversed and remanded the cause for a determination of the merits. \n293 \nU.S. 67\n, 55 S.Ct. 42. Upon a second hearing in the Court of Appeals, the defendants were again the victors. The court took the view that Furlaud and Kingston had acted with the knowledge and consent of Duquesne, the promoters and their agents being then the only shareholders, and that under the doctrine of Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co. v. Lewisohn, \n210 \nU.S. 206\n, 28 S. Ct. 634, the corporation, its incoming shareholders, and the receiver were bound by that consent, whatever remedies might be available at the suit of a defrauded creditor. 75 F.(2d) 977. A second writ of certiorari brings the case to us again.\n Promoters of a corporation stand in a fiduciary relation to it to this extent at least, that they will be chargeable as trustees if they deal with it unconscionably or oppressively or in violation of a statute, unless the liability for such misconduct has been effectually released. Dicker- \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 157]\n\u00a0\n man v. Northern Trust Co., \n176 \nU.S. 181, 203\n, 204 S., 20 S.Ct. 311; Brewster v. Hatch, 122 N.Y. 349, 362, 25 N.E. 505, 19 Am.St.Rep. 498; Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co., 3 A.C. 1218; affirming 5 Ch.Div. 73; Gluckstein v. Barnes, (1900) A.C. 240; Yeiser v. United States Board & Paper Co. (C.C.A.) 107 F. 340, 344, 52 L.R.A. 724. To what extent the approval of all the shareholders will relieve them of that burden is a question not susceptible of answer without considering the nature of the wrong and the interests affected. To some extent their position is akin to that of directors, though the limits of their duty are less definite and certain. Even for erring directors, however, there may at times be absolution if all the shareholders are satisfied. Holmes, Booth & Haydens v. Willard, 125 N.Y. 75, 25 N.E. 1083, 11 L.R.A. 170. The interests affected by approval will shape the power to approve.\n Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co. v. Lewisohn was a case where promoters made a sale to a corporation in return for shares of stock; the par value of the shares being greatly in excess of the cost to the sellers of the property conveyed. The existence of this profit was known to the shareholders, for the shares belonging to the promoters were all that had then been issued. There was no evidence that the effect of the transaction was to make the company insolvent or to work a fraud upon its creditors or to divert the assets to forbidden used or to violate a statute. 'At the time of the sale to the plaintiff ... there was no wrong done to any one.' Id., \n210 U.S. 206\n, at page 212, 28 S.Ct. 634, 636. The grantors and their syndicate 'were on both sides of the bargain, and they might issue to themselves as much stock in their corporation as they liked in exchange for their conveyance of their land.' Id., \n210 U.S. 206\n, at page 212, 28 S.Ct. 634, 636. Far from planning to defraud, they 'believed in the enterprise' and 'preferred to take stock at par rather than cash.' Id., \n210 U.S. 206\n, at page 215, 28 S. Ct. 634, 637. They had paid for the mines with their own money, and there were no creditors to be \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 158]\n\u00a0\n affected by anything they did. In such circumstances the ruling was that incoming shareholders, subscribing for new shares, were in the plight of those ahead of them and could have no better case. Davis v. Las Ovas Co., \n227 \nU.S. 80\n, 33 S.Ct. 197, declined to extend the ruling to a case where the approval was by less than all the shareholders and without disclosure of the facts to others.\n Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co. v. Lewisohn does not rule the case at hand. The effect of the promoters' conduct here was to saddle the company with liens beyond the value of its assets, mortgaged and unmortgaged. Through the diversion of the proceeds of the subscriptions to the use of Furlaud and confederates, the company became crippled and, indeed, insolvent at the outset of its business life. True, the findings of the District Court do not state in so many words that the company in its beginnings was insolvent as well as crippled. They do state, however, that the appraisals were grossly and fraudulently and wantonly excessive. Cost in and of itself, though far from conclusive, is still evidence of value (Parmenter v. Fitzpatrick, 135 N.Y. 190, 199, 31 N.E. 1032), especially where there is no market value in the strict or proper sense ( Sinclair Refining Co. v. Jenkins Petroleum Process Co., \n289 \nU.S. 689, 697\n, 53 S.Ct. 736, 88 A.L.R. 496). In this case a witness for the complainant places a valuation upon the property in substantial correspondence with the cost. There is no opposing evidence in behalf of the defendants, and so the District Judge points out. In that state of the record, the promoters had the burden of answering and repelling the inculpatory evidence by proof that they had been true to their fiduciary duties and that their conduct had been fair and just. Geddes v. Anaconda Copper Mining Co., \n254 \nU.S. 590, 599\n, 41 S.Ct. 209; In re Smith, 95 N.Y. 516, 522; Allen v. La Vaud, 213 N.Y. 322, 326, 107 N.E. 570. The public had been invited to invest in the securities on the representation that the proceeds would be used \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 159]\n\u00a0\n for the purchase of the lands and for cash capital necessary or useful for the business. In fact, about three-fifths of the money was applied to the designated uses, the rest being kept for the use of the promoters. If this could be done without cutting down the value of the assets below the mortgage debt, the act would be so near to magic as to call for explanation from promoters not professing to be magicians. No word of explanation was offered at the trial or is now suggested in the briefs. In those conditions, only one legitimate inference was open to the trier of the facts, and this he must be taken to have drawn. The appraisals having been shown to be fraudulent, the one legitimate inference to be drawn from the defendants' silence was that the value of the lands was not greater than the cost, at least in any large amount. If that be so, the company was made insolvent at the outset when the proceeds of the subscriptions were devoted to the use of the promoters.\n No consent of shareholders could make such conduct lawful when challenged by the receiver as the representative of creditors. If the shareholders and the directors had combined with the promoters to despoil the corporation and defeat the remedies of creditors by a gift of half the assets, the gift could have been annulled either by the creditors directly or in their behalf by a receiver. Casey v. Cavaroc, \n96 \nU.S. 467, 489\n, 490 S.; Atlantic Trust Co. v. Chapman, \n208 \nU.S. 360, 371\n, 28 S.Ct. 406, 13 Ann.Cas. 1155; Hamor v. Taylor-Rice Engineering Co. ( C.C.) 84 F. 392, 399; American Can Co. v. Erie Preserving Co. (C.C.) 171 F. 540, 542; Sweet v. Lang (D.C.) 14 F.(2d) 758, 760; Gillet v. Moody, 3 N.Y. 479; Pittsburg Carbon Co. v. McMillin, 119 N.Y. 46, 53, 23 N.E. 530, 7 L.R. A. 46. The distinction between such a situation and the present is one solely of degree. This is not a case where at the time of issuing the securities the shareholders and the promoters were the only ones concerned. Here at the moment of the conveyance the interests of bond- \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 160]\n\u00a0\n holders and noteholders were put in jeopardy by a division of the proceeds that would make their mortgage worthless. The promoters could not receive for themselves or deliver to subscribers the bonds and notes of the company secured by deed of trust until title had been acquired to the lands covered by the deed. On the other hand, they could not pay the purchase price and acquire title to the lands without the proceeds of subscriptions, the contributions of the public. All this was known to the shareholders and known to the directors, for the promoters were the shareholders and the directors men of straw. In its effect upon subscribers the transaction was the same as if the proceeds of the bonds and notes had been paid into the treasury of the company and then paid out to the directors for the use of their confederates. It was not within the power of the shareholders to legalize this waste to the detriment of others. It would not have been within their power to bring that result to pass, though shareholders and promoters had been different persons, acting at arm's length. Still more clearly it was not within their power when shareholders and promoters were in substance the same persons. Cf. California-Calaveras Mining Co. v. Walls, 170 Cal. 285, 299, 149 P. 595; Pittsburg Mining Co. v. Spooner, 74 Wis. 307, 42 N.W. 259, 17 Am.St.Rep. 149. Consent in such conditions, so far as it gives approval to conduct in fraud of the rights of others, is a word and nothing more. It is not in concord with realities. There is no occasion to consider whether the corporation itself at the instance of new shareholders would be permitted to disaffirm the fraud and maintain a suit in equity for appropriate relief. We put that question by. Enough that the receiver has the requisite capacity. A court of equity has taken hold of the assets of this company, intangible assets as well as tangible, for administration as a trust in accordance with equitable principles. Hollins v. Brierfield Coal & Iron Co., \n150 \nU.S. 371, 380\n, 14 S.Ct. 127. \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 161]\n\u00a0\n Included in those assets are moneys fraudulently diverted to the prejudice of creditors. Cf. McClure v. Law, 161 N.Y. 78, 55 N.E. 388, 76 Am.St.Rep. 262; Bosworth v. Allen, 168 N.Y. 157, 166, 61 N.E. 163, 55 L.R.A. 751, 85 Am.St.Rep. 667. There is power at the instance of the receiver to bring them back into the trust.\n These considerations without more would separate Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co. v. Lewisohn from the case before us now. Other aspects of the present case accentuate the division. What was done by the promoters here was in the teeth of a prohibition of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, the state where the corporation was formed and where its business was to be done. The Constitution of Pennsylvania provides ( article 16,  7): 'No corporation shall issue stocks or bonds except for money, labor done, or money or property actually received; and all fictitious increase of stock or indebtedness shall be void.' See, also, Act April 17, 1876, P.L. 30, 32,  4; Purdon's Penna. Stats., title 15,  131 (15 PS Pa.  131). The prohibition is not escaped through the receipt of some property or money if the amount or value is inadequate. Big Spring Electric Co. v. Kitzmiller, 268 Pa. 34, 38, 110 A. 783; Commonwealth v. Reading Traction Co., 204 Pa. 151, 53 A. 755; In re Wyoming Valley Ice Co. ( D.C.) 153 F. 787, 793, affirmed sub nom. Wiegand v. Albert Lewis Lumber & Mfg. Co. (C.C.A.) 158 F. 608, 610. True, the securities are valid in the hands of innocent purchasers, whatever the consideration (Guarantee Title & Trust Co. v. Dilworth Coal Co., 235 Pa. 594, 84 A. 516), but the liability of the directors or other fiduciaries who have put them into circulation is not thereby released. There are decisions in Pennsylvania that the Constitution is not self-executing. Grange National Bank v. Collman, 306 Pa. 200, 159 A. 26. That holding is irrelevant as to corporations such as this one, for there exists as to them an 'implementing' statute (Purdon's Penna. Stats., supra), without restriction as to the form of remedy. Precedents exist for a \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 162]\n\u00a0\n suit at the instance of incoming shareholders, though the corporation was solvent and there was no injury to creditors. Spangler Brewing Co. v. McHenry, 242 Pa. 522, at page 530, 89 A. 665. Precedents exist in cases of insolvency for a suit by a trustee as the representative of creditors, and this though they became such after the securities were issued. Bingaman v. Commonwealth Trust Co., 15 F.(2d) 119 (D.C.M.D. Pa.), and cases there collected. Cf. Coleman v. Tepel, 230 F. 63, 70 (C.C.A. 3), affirming (D.C.) 229 F. 300; In re Wyoming Valley Ice Co., supra; Krebs v. Oberrender, 274 Pa. 154, 118 A. 19; Finletter v. Acetylene Light, Heat & Power Co., 215 Pa. 86, 64 A. 429. Nowhere is it held that delinquent fiduciaries who have nullified the statute may keep the profits for themselves when creditors will be injured unless the profits are returned. At times and for certain purposes the consent of shareholders may give validity to acts that would otherwise be voidable, if the only interests affected are those of the shareholders consenting. It can never be operative to the prejudice of others where consent is in derogation of the public policy of the state or the prohibition of a statute. Central Transportation Co. v. Pullman's Palace-Car Co., \n139 \nU.S. 24, 59\n, 60 S., 11 S.Ct. 478; Kent v. Quicksilver Mining Co., 78 N.Y. 159, 185, 186, 187; Sheldon Hat Blocking Co. v. Eickemeyer Hat Blocking Mach. Co., 90 N.Y. 607, 613; Mann v. Edinburgh Northern Tramways Co. (H.L.) 68 L.T.(N.S.) 96; Society of Practical Knowledge v. Abbott, 2 Beav. 560, 568. This case is plainly within the scope of that exception. There was here a statutory prohibition, rooted in public policy. Gearhart v. Standard Steel Car Co., 223 Pa. 385, 389, 72 A. 699. The shareholders were not at liberty, at all events to the prejudice of creditors or other shareholders, present or prospective, to set that policy at naught. If the effect of what they did was to put illicit profits in the pockets of trustees, \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 163]\n\u00a0\n their consent will not avail to block pursuit and reclamation.\n We have assumed in all this that the corporation was insolvent at the beginning of its business life. The assumption is well founded for reasons already stated, yet we do not need to go so far. Even though the company was not literally insolvent, the result would be the same. There would be a wrong to bondholders and noteholders if assets were depleted to the very brink of insolvency after fraudulent misrepresentations to the effect that there was an ample margin of security. What was taken out of the company in such circumstances would be taken subject to a trust and would so continue until the security thus depleted had paid the debt in full. The defendants do not assert that it is adequate for that today. Confusion of thought is inevitable unless the position of the wrongdoers as trustees is steadily kept in mind. What is here is something more than a tort of fraudulent representations to be redressed by the recovery of damages at the suit of the defrauded creditors. What is here is a tort growing out of the fraudulent depletion of the assets by men chargeable as trustees if they have failed to act with honor. There are important differences, moreover, between an overissue of stock, which may leave the assets unimpaired, and a withdrawal of cash, which puts the enterprise in peril. Cf. Arnold v. Searing, 78 N.J.Eq. 146, 162, 78 A. 762; Id., 73 N.J.Eq. 262, 265, 266, 67 A. 831; Eureka Mining, Smelting & Power Co. v. Lively, 59 Wash. 550, 110 P. 425. The duty of reclaiming assets so diverted and holding the wrongdoers to their duty as trustees is one that rests on the receiver. It is not within the power of wrongdoers and shareholders by any compact between themselves to make the duty less.\n In considering the effect of Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co. v. Lewisohn, we have spoken until now of the bonds and \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 164]\n\u00a0\n notes only. It is necessary at this point to say something about the stock. Of the total issue, 535,000 shares went to Kingston as a bonus. The only pretense of value was a conveyance of the gas fields covered by the options, which were worth, as we have seen, no more than Kingston paid for them. In return for the conveyance of these lands, Kingston received $3, 015,000 in cash, or more than the actual value of anything conveyed. It also received bonds of the par value of $1,300,000; and last of all the stock. Plainly the stock was a bonus and nothing else.\n Furlaud and Kingston, having made themselves parties to a scheme whereby Duquesne was to be despoiled and its creditors were to be defrauded, became accountable, we think, for everything that came to them as a result of the conspiracy in excess of the consideration furnished on their side. They were not trustees as to the bonds and notes, and lawful owners of the shares, but trustees as to all; the transaction being a unit, infected with a common vice. Everything of profit arising out of the abused relation must now be yielded up. Even after this is done, reparation will be incomplete. Restitution of the profits will not make up, without more, for the inadequacy of the overvalued land to return to the lienors their principal and interest. In such circumstances the shares, like the bonds and notes, must contribute what they can. The certificates, were they on hand, might be turned into the treasury of the company for sale, if they still had any value. The shares having been sold to others and the certificates being no longer subject to the mandate of the court, the trust that attached to them has been transferred to the proceeds, which, when paid to the receiver, will be used like other assets in reduction of the debts.\n We are not unmindful of the contention that the sale by Kingston was at the rate of 50 cents as share (which for 85,000 shares would amount to $ 42,500), and that the sale for $850,000 was made by two other corporations, the \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 165]\n\u00a0\n Byron and the Chaucer. In view of the initial fraud, the burden was on Kingston and Furlaud to show that Byron and Chaucer were purchasers in due course, and not agents and confederates wearing the cloak of purchasers. King v. Doane, \n139 \nU.S. 166, 173\n, 11 S.Ct. 465; Canajoharie National Bank v. Diefendorf, 123 N.Y. 191, 204, 205, 25 N.E. 402, 10 L.R.A. 676; Seymour v. McKinstry, 106 N.Y. 230, 240, 12 N.E. 348, 14 N.E. 94. We think that Byron and Chaucer were subject to an equal burden. Many suspicious circumstances point to guilty knowledge and justify a holding that the burden has not been borne.\n The respondents make the point that Maxime Furlaud is not subject to personal liability for wrongs committed by the Furlaud Company or Kingston. He was the head and front of the conspiracy. For anything done in fulfillment of the Common purpose either by himself or by any of the corporations dominated by him, he and his confederates are liable in solido. Mack v. Latta, 178 N.Y. 525, 532, 71 N.E. 97, 67 L.R.A. 126; Anderson v. Daley, 38 App.Div. 505, 56 N.Y.S. 511; Id., 159 N.Y. 146, 53 N. E. 753; Irving Trust Co. v. Deutsch (C.C.A.) 73 F.(2d) 121, 123; Jackson v. Smith, \n254 \nU.S. 586, 589\n, 41 S.Ct. 200.\n The objection is also made that testimony as to the value of the lands should have been excluded by the court as not within the pleadings. The complaint was based upon the theory that the promoters had been guilty of unconscionable conduct. Whether that was so could not be known without exploring the transaction to the depths and all the circumstances attending it. To this it may be added that the trial judge received the testimony provisionally and subject to a motion to strike when all the evidence was in. The motion was not made. Nor at any stage of the trial was there a motion to dismiss on the ground of a variance between the pleading and the proof.\n Another objection is that the defendants should have been credited with expenses for commissions, attorneys' \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 166]\n\u00a0\n fees, printing disbursements and the like, expenses incidental, it is claimed, to the acquisition of the lands. A fund of $300,000 was set aside for that purpose. The record makes it clear, however, that only a part of this fund was necessary for expenses of any kind and that only a small part of the expenses, if any, were of such a nature as to be permissible deductions for parties to a fraud. It is likely that some items would be allowable, if properly identified. Loos v. Wilkinson, 113 N.Y. 485, 499, 21 N.E. 392, 4 L.R.A. 353, 10 Am.St.Rep. 495; Frank v. Von Bayer, 236 N.Y. 473, 477, 478, 141 N.E. 920; Randolph v. Scruggs, \n190 \nU.S. 533, 539\n, 23 S. Ct. 710. The difficulty is that we are unable on this record to determine their amount. The judge might have required the defendants to separate the good from the bad while the case was still on trial. Instead of doing this he put the defendants off their guard by saying that matters of that sort would be reserved for an accounting. Unless the receiver and the defendants find it possible to agree as to the allowance for expenses, an accounting will be necessary to determine what part of the $300,000, the total amount reserved, is an appropriate deduction.\n Other objections put forward in argument at the bar can be dismissed in a few words.\n If and when the defendants shall restore to the receiver the moneys taken unto themselves, it will be time enough to consider problems as to the marshalling of assets between creditors who were such at the commission of the wrong and those of later date. No attempt is made to forecast the answer now. The principles that govern the distribution of assets conveyed in fraud of creditors, present or prospective, and after such conveyance reclaimed by a receiver, are adequate to work out justice, however great the complications. \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 167]\n\u00a0\n We find it immaterial that the defendants or some of them may be liable to creditors in common-law actions to recover damages for false representations as to the value of the assets. That is not the basis of the suit before us now. Moreover, the question is not here whether restitution of illicit profits as the outcome of this suit may be proved to mitigate the damages in actions by other plaintiffs, if any such there are. As we have striven to make clear, the receiver does not claim to have succeeded to the rights of bondholders or noteholders to recover damages for deceit. The wrong that is here redressed is the unlawful depletion of the assets whereby the company was made insolvent and the creditors were defrauded of their lawful rights and remedies.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing the decree of the District Court had dismissing the bill of complaint is reversed.\n The decree of the District Court is modified by increasing the recovery against the defendants Maxime H. Furlaud and the Kingston Corporation in the sum of $850,000, with interest from June 6, 1930, when the shares of stock were sold, and by the award of judgment against the Byron Corporation in the sum of $425,000, with interest from June 6, 1930, and against the Chaucer Corporation for the same amount.\n There will be a further modification by the allowance to the defendants Furlaud and the Kingston Corporation of so much of the sum of $ 300,000 as may be found on an accounting to have been disbursed for expenses that are chargeable in equity to the Duquesne Corporation, unless the amount of such allowance is fixed by agreement, approved by the court to which the receiver is accountable, in which event the judgment against those defendants shall be reduced accordingly. \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 168]\n\u00a0\n The decree of the District Court as thus modified is affirmed.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS, dissenting.\n I think that the decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed. I concur in the view that the promoters of Duquesne Gas Corporation took an unconscionable profit which they reaped at the expense of a credulous and avid purchasing public. This fact, however much it may invite animadversion, ought not to induce the courts to disregard settled principles in an effort to deprive the respondents of the fruits of their scheme.\n An examination of the pleadings and the facts found leads me to the conclusion that the receiver of the corporation is without standing to recover from the promoters.\n The bill recites in somewhat different sequence the facts which are set out in the opinion of the court. It does not state that the properties were not worth the amount in bonds, stocks, and cash which the Duquesne Corporation paid for them. It fails to allege any fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of the respondents to purchasers of bonds or stock of the corporation. The allegation is made that Furlaud & Co., Inc. was, in the sale of the securities, a house of issue, meaning, of course, that it purchased the securities and resold them for its own account. Although the facts pleaded demonstrate that for some time after the organization of the Duquesne Corporation, and the issuance of its bonds and stock, Furlaud & Co., Inc., by itself and its subsidiaries, was the owner of every share of stock and every bond issued and outstanding, the bill asseverates, first, that the profit obtained on the sales of securities was a secret profit for which Furlaud and associates are accountable to the receiver, and, secondly, that they stood in a fiduciary relation to Dequesne and 'caused all the pro- \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 169]\n\u00a0\n ceeds of the sale of the bonds and notes in excess of $2,937,989, plus legitimate expenses, to be diverted from the Duquesne Corporation for whose use and benefit the proceeds of the sale of said bonds and notes were intended and defendants Furlaud and Reuter fraudulently misappropriated said moneys to their own use.' The last assertion is the nearest approach to an allegation of agency or trust for or on behalf of the corporation. The prayer is for an accounting by the defendants of the moneys received by them, apparently on the theory that such moneys were received as agents for the corporation. On its face the pleading is self- contradictory. If what the defendants took constituted promoters' profits, the bill discloses that these were not secret profits taken to the disadvantage of innocent stockholders who had been brought into the corporation. Furlaud & Co. and the other defendants were on both sides of the transaction, and cannot be said to have deceived themselves as stockholders and bondholders and, upon familiar principles, those who took title to stock or bonds through them cannot assert rights higher than theirs. If, on the other hand, Furlaud & Co. was a house of issue, dealing on its own account, it cannot have been an agent of Duquesne for the sale of bonds and stock.\n The District Court denied a motion to make the pleading more specific and certain, and the cause went to trial on the bill and answers. The proofs disclosed in detail the mechanics of the transaction whereby the promoters, at an expenditure of something in excess of $3,000,000, acquired $4,000,000 par value of first mortgage bonds, $1,000,000 of secured notes, and 675,000 shares of no-par common stock. Evidence was offered to prove that, at the date of the transfer, the property acquired was worth not to exceed $2,700,000. The defendants objected to this evidence on the ground that it was unsupported by any allegation in the bill. The court, nevertheless, received the proof and relied upon it for certain conclusions. \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 170]\n\u00a0\n There was also evidence that in the bond circulars issued by the defendants as a house of issue, and by a syndicate of bankers formed by the defendants to sell the securities to the public, these statements were made: That the properties had been appraised at something over $7,000,000 and that the bonds and notes were issued by the corporation 'in connection with the acquisition of properties and to provide cash for developments, extensions and other corporate purposes.' The proofs conclusively show, and it is not disputed, that Furlaud & Co., upon its individual credit and that of its subsidiary, the Kingston Corporation, obtained the funds with which to make settlement for the bonds, notes, and stock with the Duquesne Corporation and reimbursed themselves for these loans out of moneys paid by brokers in the purchase of the securities.\n It is quite true that Furlaud & Co., Inc. had, prior to receipt of the bonds, notes, and stock, arranged for the sale of the bulk of the bonds to brokerage houses when, if, and as issued. This, however, is not an uncommon method of dealing, and in itself is insignificant so far as the fairness or unfairness of the transaction goes.\n In its final analysis the situation comes, as the District Court indicated, to this: That Furlaud & Co., Inc. advanced the purchase money for the gas properties, contributed $364,500 to Duquesne as working capital and in return received the securities. The court added that, if without the circuity here resorted to, Furlaud & Co., Inc. had thus bought the securities direct at an inordinately low price, they could have done with them as they pleased. It held that they could not do with them as they pleased because of the method of settlement with the corporation to which they resorted. There is no specific finding by the District Court of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of Furlaud & Co., Inc., in the sale of the bonds. What is said is that the circulars misrepre- \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 171]\n\u00a0\n sented the facts. There is no finding that any present bondholder relied on any misrepresentation. Although it is insisted that Duquesne was insolvent from the moment of the settlement with Furlaud & Co., Inc. there is no finding to that effect. The District Court held that the promoters stood in a fiduciary relation to the corporation. It made no finding that the purchasers of bonds and notes were induced to purchase by misrepresentation; made no finding of loss or damage to such purchasers; made no finding that the purchasers understood Furlaud & Co., Inc. were acting as agents for Duquesne in the sale of its securities, but reached the conclusion, without any evidence to support it, that those who purchased bonds and notes from the promoters understood that the money which they paid in the purchase of the securities was to go in solido into the treasury of Dequesne. A moment's reflection will show that this could not have been the case. The very circulars which were issued and on which the bonds were sold showed that they were not being sold for par and that commissions were being paid for their sale. It is quite evident from the circulars that these commissions were not being paid by Duquesne but by the brokers who were selling the bonds as principals.\n Upon principle, and upon authority, the corporation had no cause of action in the circumstances against the promoters and the receiver's rights could rise no higher.\n First. The District Court held, and the Circuit Court of Appeals concurred, that the promoters were not answerable in respect of the no-par value common stock issued to them and thereafter sold by them. This Court reverses the holding and makes them liable to account for all they received for the stock. This is in the teeth of Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co. v. Lewisohn, \n210 \nU.S. 206\n, 28 S.Ct. 634. There, as here, stock was issued for property. The claim was that the property was worth vastly less than the par of \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 172]\n\u00a0\n the stock issued for it. Additional shares were later subscribed for by the public. This Court, in a unanimous opinion, speaking by Mr. Justice Holmes, held that any wrong which had been done to the innocent subscribers could not be redressed in an action by the corporation. Here we have a much stronger case, for all the stock was subscribed for and taken by the promoters. There were no innocent subscribers. In such a situation the courts with practical unanimity hold that the corporation has no right of action. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n Second. On its face the transaction under investigation amounted to this and nothing more: The promoters paid themselves an exorbitant price in bonds, notes, stock, and cash for property which they turned over to the corporation they had promoted. The bonds and notes thus acquired they sold in the open market and as principals. If in such sale they misrepresented the value of the security, they are liable to those whom they deceived. This is not denied. It was stated at the bar that numerous actions had been brought against them on this basis. Although purporting to be purchasers of securities and sellers of the same in turn for their own account, they are now converted into trustees for the corporation which corporation they were in essence at the time of the transaction and which corporation had therefore full and complete knowledge of every factor in the transaction. This again is in the teeth of Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co. v. Lewisohn, supra.\n In support of its holding the court cites Dickerman v. Northern Trust Co., \n176 \nU.S. 181\n, 20 S.Ct. 311; Brewster v. Hatch, 122 N.Y. 349, 25 N.E. 505, 19 Am.St.Rep. 498; Erlanger v. New Sombrero Phosphate Co ., 3 App.Cas. 1218; Gluckstein v. Barnes, (1900) A.C. 240, and Yeiser v. United States Board & \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 173]\n\u00a0\n Paper Co. (C.C.A.) 107 F. 340, 52 L.R.A. 724. An examination of the opinion in the Old Dominion Copper Mining & Smelting Co. Case will show that it was there said the relevant observations in the Dickerman Case were obiter and could not control the case in hand; that the New Sombrero Phosphate Co. Case and the Gluckstein Case were distinguishable, as was the Yeiser Case, the latter on the ground that the transaction was carried through after innocent subscribers had paid for stock; and that Blum v. Whitney, 185 N.Y. 232, 77 N.E. 1159 (a later case than the New York case relied upon by the majority) was properly cited in support of this court's decision. The facts just stated clearly indicate that the decision now made in effect overrules the Old Dominion Case. The so-called fiduciary relation of promoters may be availed of by the corporation only in virtue of the equity of innocent stockholders defrauded by the promoters' scheme. So holds the Old Dominion Case, and so hold many authorities which are in accord. It is said that the right of the corporation to pursue the promoters depends upon the circumstances under which the stockholders gave their consent to the transaction involved in the promoters' scheme. Nothing is disclosed in the opinion of the court to differentiate this case from the Old Dominion Case save that, as asserted, but not found below, the transaction caused insolvency to the Dequesne Corporation and the suit is here brought by a receiver.\n Third. It is of course true that a receiver represents creditors and stockholders; but the proposition is true only in the sense that what he recovers as assets of his corporation is dedicated first to the payment of creditors and afterwards to the liquidation of outstanding shares. It has never been doubted that his right of action for a fraud committed upon the corporation by a third person is no greater than, and no different from, that available to the corporation. It is a novel doctrine that, if individual creditors have at the date of the receivership their own \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 174]\n\u00a0\n causes of action against third parties for fraud or misrepresentation, upon the appointment of a receiver these causes of action are assigned in law to the receiver. We know of no authority for such a proposition, and none is cited in the opinion of the court. Courts which have considered the question have decided against the right of a receiver to maintain a suit such as this one. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The opinion goes further, and holds not only that these individual causes of action may be grouped in the receiver, but that he as assignee is not subject to the rules as to allegation and proof by which the bondholder would be bound in an action for fraud, misrepresentation, or deceit. This is to confuse separate causes of action fundamentally differing both in their substance and in their incidents. Any amount recovered by the receiver in this action will go into the corporate treasury and be distributed therefrom to the creditors of the corporation. It appears from the record that the bondholders have brought a foreclosure suit upon their mortgage. They will in that action first avail themselves of the security pledged under the mortgage. They will become general creditors as to any amount by which their security is deficient. The record does not inform us how many such general creditors-sellers of merchandise, lenders on unsecured paper, or employees and the like-there are. Certainly these have no equity and no vestige of claim against the promoters arising out of the promotion of the Duquesne Corporation. And yet a recovery here will inure to their benefit as well as to that of the bondholders. If, as is said, the receiver represents the bondholders, shall the obtaining of a decree in this action operate as res judicata in the other actions brought by bondholders and now pending? The opinion \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 175]\n\u00a0\n does not answer the question. It seems clear that a suit by the receiver must be in the right of the corporation, and that the most he can claim is what the corporation could claim; namely, a derivative right of suit based upon fraud perpetrated upon innocent shareholders who were such at the time of the consummation of the scheme. Upon the facts pleaded and proved there can be no such derivative right in this case.\n Fourth. We are told that the action may be maintained by the petitioner in virtue of the fact that the transaction was forbidden by a provision of the Constitution of Pennsylvania, and a statute passed to implement it, voiding all fictitious increases of capital stock or indebtedness of corporations and forbidding the issuance of stocks or bonds except for work and labor done or money or property actually received. The point was apparently not made or considered below. It cannot avail the petitioner.\n The constitutional provision is not self-executing. \n3\n There is nothing in the law of Pennsylvania justifyign a suit by a receiver in circumstances such as here disclosed to recover for the corporation's alleged illicit profits; and the Supreme Court of the commonwealth has clearly indicated that such a bill will not lie by the corporation to recover for promoters' profits or alleged fraud in issuing stock at an overvaluation for property where, as here, all the stockholders approved the transaction. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n As we have above pointed out, the receiver's rights can in no way differ from those of the corporation. This \n\n[296 U.S. 140, 176]\n\u00a0\n Court ought not to create a trusteeship upon an assumption of a state policy which is not recognized by the courts of the state.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER concur in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n296 \nU.S. 664\n, 56 S.Ct. 304.[ McCandless v.

The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit took the same view and affirmed the decree. 70 F.(2d) 632.\n Certiorari was granted, \n293 \nU.S. 542\n, 55 S.Ct. 100, 79 L.Ed. --, upon a petition which urged that the decision below was erroneous because: (a) The provision for the recovery of double wages is compensatory and not for the imposition of a penalty; and (b), even though a penalty, it is one for which the government is liable by virtue of the provisions of the Suits in Admiralty Act and of the government's waiver of sovereign immunity by engaging in the business of operating vessels in competition with private owners. It is also insisted that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the decree first entered by the District Court, allowing recovery of double wages, was set aside and superseded by its later decree, which allowed recovery only for the amount claimed for loss of petitioner's clothing and for earned wages.\n We find it unnecessary to decide the questions raised with respect to the liability of the government for double wages. For upon examination of the record it is apparent that petitioner has failed to establish his right to the \n\n[294 U.S. 23, 26]\n\u00a0\n double wages demanded, regardless of the asserted immunity of the government.\n Both courts below are in substantial agreement as to the facts which, so far as now material, may be detailed as follows: Petitioner shipped as a fireman on the steamship American Shipper on a voyage from New York to London and return; on arrival at London, he demanded of the master his discharge, payment of the balance of wages due, one month's additional pay, and that he be provided with adequate employment on some other vessel bound for New York. As reason for his demand, he quoted the titles of section 2 of the Seamen's Act and R.S.  4583. The master, who was then occupied with his duties in advancing money to members of the crew who were about to take shore leave, offered to pay one-half the wages due, which petitioner refused. The master then told him that he did not know what he cited sections of the statute were about and that he would have to look them up. He asked petitioner to meet him in the office of the American consul in London, whose address he gave, shortly after noon of the following day, when he would discuss with petitioner the matter of his demand.\n Petitioner went to the consulate the next forenoon and left about 11: 30, after stating his complaint and being informed by the consul that he was not entitled to his discharge. He requested that the decision be placed in writing; this was done and sent to him in care of the vessel. The master, who had been busy preparing his papers for entry at the customs house, arrived at the consulate about 2 o'clock of the same day and was told that the petitioner had been there and had gone. He then returned to the vessel, where he remained most of the time it was in port, but did not see petitioner again. Petitioner testified that he returned to the vessel, knocked at the master's door that night and again the next morning, but received no answer at either time. He then asked \n\n[294 U.S. 23, 27]\n\u00a0\n the chief mate if the master was aboard and the mate said that he did not know. On that day he left the vessel, without making any further attempt to see the master, or leaving any information which would enable the officers to communicate with him. When he asked the mate for a pass for his clothes, he was told that the mate could not give him one and he was not allowed to take his clothes with him. He did not intend to return to the vessel when he left, and never did return. After some weeks in England, he purchased passage on another vessel and returned to the United States.\n\n 1. \nThe petitioner rests his claim for a month's extra pay and for the cost of his return passage on section 2 of the Seamen's Act and R.S.  4583. By section 2 a seaman is given the right to demand his discharge and payment of the wages due whenever the master of the vessel fails while at sea to divide the sailors into a least two, and firemen, oilers, and water- tenders into at least three, watches. In O'Hara v. Luckenbach Steamship Co ., \n269 \nU.S. 364, 367\n, 46 S.Ct. 157, we held that the purpose of this provision was to provide for the safety of vessels at sea rather than to regulate working conditions of the crew, and that it commands division of the specified classes of the crew into watches as nearly equal as the number in each class will permit.\n Section 4583 provides that:\n'Whenever on the discharge of a seaman in a foreign country by a consular officer on his complaint that the voyage is continued contrary to agreement, or that the vessel is ... unseaworthy, ... it shall be the duty of the consul or consular agent to institute a proper inquiry into the matter, and, upon his being satisfied of the truth and justice of such complaint, he shall require the master to pay to such seaman one month's wages over and above the wages due at the time of discharge, and to provide him with adequate employment on board some other vessel, or provide him with a passage on board \n\n[294 U.S. 23, 28]\n\u00a0\n some other vessel bound to the port from which he was originally shipped . ...'\n\n As the government sought no review, either in the Court of Appeals or in this Court, of the determination of the District Court that petitioner was entitled to demand his discharge and payment of his earned wages because of the failure to make proper division of the crew into watches, there is no occasion for us to pass on that question. Nor do we decide the further one, which the petitioner raises, whether a seaman is entitled to claim the benefits of section 4583 by reason of a failure to provide equal watches as directed by section 2 of the Seamen's Act. Laying aside that question and possible doubts as to the correct construction of other parts of section 4583, it is plain that by its provisions the consul or consular agent is made the arbiter of the seaman's demand for the month's extra wages and for other relief which it affords, and that his favorable action upon the demand and his discharge of the seaman are prerequisite to any recovery under it. As in the present case, the consul refused to give petitioner his discharge and to certify that he was entitled to the relief demanded, his recovery under that section was rightly denied by the courts below.\n\n 2. \nThe seaman's right to double wages for failure of the master to pay wages due is conferred by R.S.  4529, as amended. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 23, 29]\n\u00a0\n By this section the master or owner of a vessel is required to pay a seaman his wages within a specified time after the termination of the agreement under which he was shipped or after the time of his discharge, whichever first happens. In the case of vessels making foreign voyages, payment is required within twenty-four hours after the cargo has been discharged or within four days after the seaman has been discharged, whichever first happens. In all cases the seaman is entitled at the time of his discharge to one-third of the balance of wages due him. It directs that 'every master or owner who refuses or neglects to make payment in the manner' specified 'without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to two days' pay for each and every day during which payment is delayed beyond the respective periods, which sum shall be recoverable as wages. ...'\n Since it does not appear in the present case when the cargo was discharged, the time within which the master could pay the wages due and thus avoid liability for double wages cannot be taken to be less than four days from the time of arrival. There is no question of failure to pay one- third of the wages due since petitioner did not avail himself of the master's offer to pay him one-half of his wages. As it has been determined that the petitioner was entitled to his discharge and to payment of the wages due, and as payment was not made within the time specified by the statute, we may assume, for present purposes, that he was entitled to the double pay demanded if the master's failure to pay the wages due was 'without sufficient cause.' \n\n[294 U.S. 23, 30]\n\u00a0\n We had occasion to pass upon the meaning of this phrase, as used in section 4529, in Colie v. Fergusson, \n281 \nU.S. 52\n, 50 S.Ct. 189, where it was held that there was no right to double wages where the failure to pay earned wages was occasioned by the insolvency of the owner and the arrect of the insolvency of the owner and the arrest of her value. After pointing out that the words 'without sufficient cause' must be taken to mean something more than the absence of valid defenses to the claim for wages, we said, page 55 of 281 U.S., 50 S.Ct. 189, 191:\n'The phrase is to be interpreted in the light of the evident purpose of the section to secure prompt payment of seamen's wages (H.R. Rep. 1657, Committee on the Merchant Marine and Fisheries, 55th Cong., 2d Sess.), and thus to protect them from the harsh consequences of arbitrary and unscrupulous action of their employers, to which, as a class, they are peculiarly exposed.\n\n'The words 'refuses or neglects to make payment ... without sufficient cause' connote, either conduct which is in some sense arbitrary or willful, or at least a failure not attributable to impossibility of payment. We think the use of this language indicates a purpose to protect seamen from delayed payments of wages by the imposition of a liability which is not exclusively compensatory, but designed to prevent, by its coercive effect, arbitrary refusals to pay wages, and to induce prompt payment when payment is possible.'\n\n The statute thus confers no right to recover double wages where the delay in payment of wages due was not in some sense arbitrary, willful, or unreasonable. In view of the many duties imposed, some by law, on the master of a vessel upon arrival in a foreign port, we cannot say that the statute compels him, on pain of subjecting himself or his owner to heavy loss, to make immediate decision of questions of law involved in a seaman's demands, \n\n[294 U.S. 23, 31]\n\u00a0\n of whose nature he is left in ignorance. In the circumstances, he did not unreasonably defer action by fixing the following day and the consul's office as the time and place for his decision. The failure of petitioner to keep the appointment and to communicate with the master again, after rejection by the consul of petitioner's demand, left the master uninformed whether or not petitioner still persisted in his demand. His departure from the vessel on the following day, without leaving an address, precluded payment of the wages due within the four days which the statute allowed. The case is not one of neglect to pay wages without sufficient cause.\n In its opinion before reargument, the District Court, notwithstanding its conclusion that the master had sufficient cause for his failure to pay wages, ruled that the petitioner was entitled to recover double pay for the number of days which had intervened after the suit was brought. Petitioner argues here that, as there was no excuse for delay in payment after the suit was brought, the duty to pay double wages accrued from that date. But the liability is conditioned by the statute upon the refusal or neglect to pay wages 'in the manner hereinbefore mentioned without sufficient cause.' The quoted phrase refers to the specified periods within which the seaman's wages are directed to be paid, and the section thus imposes the liability for neglect, without sufficient cause, to pay the wages within the prescribed period. Petitioner seeks, by a more liberal interpretation of the words, to impose the liability for such delay in payment, without sufficient cause, as may occur at any time after an excusable failure to pay within the prescribed period. This possibility is precluded by the further provision of the section that double wages shall be paid for each day 'during which payment is delayed beyond the respective periods' within which the payment is to be made. Thus, liability for double \n\n[294 U.S. 23, 32]\n\u00a0\n wages accrues, if at all, from the end of the period within which payment should have been made. It must be determined by the happening of an event within the period, failure to pay wages without sufficient cause. The statute affords a definite and reasonable procedure by which the seaman may establish his right to recover double pay where his wages are unreasonably withheld. But it affords no basis for recovery if, by his own conduct, he precludes compliance with it by the master or owner. He cannot afterward impose the liability by the mere expedient of bringing suit upon it.\n\n 3. \nFollowing the trial of the cause in the District Court, a decree was entered allowing recovery for loss of petitioner's clothing, for wages, and double wages. After the reargument, a second decree was entered which did not in terms vacate or modify the first one, but which granted recovery as in its first decree, except for double wages. After the appeal was taken to the Circuit Court of Appeals, the District Court amended the second decree by the addition of a direction that the first decree be vacated.\n The application for rehearing was seasonably made and by granting it the District Court retained jurisdiction of the case. The decree entered on the rehearing thus became the final decree in the cause and superseded the earlier one, as the court below held. Barrell v. Tilton, \n119 \nU.S. 637, 643\n, 7 S.Ct. 332; see Wolff Packing Co. v. Industrial Court, \n267 \nU.S. 552\n, 45 S.Ct. 441.\n It is unnecessary to inquire whether, after the appeal was taken, the District Court retained jurisdiction to correct its own records by vacating the first decree, which had already become functus officio. See Hovey v. McDonald, \n109 \nU.S. 150, 157\n, 158 S., 3 S.Ct. 136.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Motion for reargument denied \n294 \nU.S. 382\n, 55 S.Ct. 443. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Sec. 4529. The master or owner of any vessel making coasting voyages shall pay to every seaman his wages within two days after the termination of the agreement under which he was shipped, or at the time such seaman is discharged, whichever first happens; and in case of vessels making foreign voyages, or from a port on the Atlantic to a port on the Pacific, or vice versa, within twenty-four hours after the cargo has been discharged, or within four days after the seaman has been discharged, whichever first happens; and in all cases the seaman shall be entitled to be paid at the time of his discharge on account of wages a sum equal to one-third part of the balance due him. Every master or owner who refuses or neglects to make payment in the manner hereinbefore mentioned without sufficient cause shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to two days' pay for each and every day during which payment is delayed beyond the respective periods, which sum shall be recoverable as wages in any claim made before the court; but this section shall not apply to masters or owners of any vessel the seamen of which are entitled to share in the profits of the cruise or voyage. 46 U.S.C.  596 (46 USCA  596). \n\n\n\n\n","110":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCCREA v. UNITED STATES(1935)\nNo. 249\nArgued: Decided: February 18, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. John M. Scoble and K. Courtenay Johnston, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner has moved for reargument of the question whether the failure to pay his wages was 'without sufficient cause,' on the ground that this Court 'misapprehended the facts shown by the record' in accepting the finding of the District Court, 3 F.Supp. 184, that petitioner 'departed the ship without seeing the captain' on the second day after her arrival at the port of London.\n In support of this contention, petitioner, for the first time, invites our attention to an excerpt from the vessel's log, an exhibit in the case, which states that he was 'aboard ship from 3:20 PM Feb. 29th to 9:00 AM March 1st, 1928' and that he was 'last ... seen aboard ship at 9: 00 AM March 1st, 1928.' It is conceded that the vessel arrived in port on Sunday, February 26, 1928, and sailed the following Friday, March 2d. As the year was a leap year, petitioner argues that he is thus shown to have been on board on the morning of the fourth calendar day after arrival; that, as the vessel sailed the \n\n[294 U.S. 382, 383]\n\u00a0\n following day, it may be inferred that he did not leave until the cargo was discharged; and that the failure to pay wages before his departure on March 1st was therefore without sufficient cause.\n The details of petitioner's leaving the vessel were not considered by the Circuit Court of Appeals, presumably because its decision was placed on other grounds. 70 F.(2d) 632. But in this Court respondent properly sought to sustain the decision below on the ground that the failure to pay wages was not without sufficient cause. In its brief it specifically relied on the finding of the District Court that petitioner had abandoned the vessel two days after arrival, and cited the record in support of the finding. Petitioner in this Court neither challenged the finding of the District Court nor assailed the sufficiency of the evidence to support it, and we are now asked, for the first time, by a motion for reargument, to weigh the evidence.\n The petitioner, in his testimony in his own behalf, both on direct and cross-examination, testified at four different points in the record that he abandoned the vessel on February 28th, which was on Tuesday, two days after arrival. He identified the day of abandonment by its date, as being on Tuesday, and as being the day after his visit to the Consul's office, which was on Monday, February 27th. He was equally specific in his testimony that when he left the vessel he did not intend to return and did not in fact return. We accept his testimony as correct and as abundantly supporting the finding of the District Court.\n We also think, as the opinion indicates, that petitioner's departure from the vessel, whenever it occurred, without informing the master whether he persisted in his demand, precludes the inference that, in the circumstances, the failure to pay wages was 'without sufficient cause.'\n The motion is denied. \n\n\n\n","111":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMCFEELY v.

McCulloch, of Chicago, Ill., for respondent in 111.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States and Helvering, Commissioner of Internal Revenue.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases were brought here on writs of certiorari to resolve a conflict between Circuits with respect to the application of section 101 of the Revenue Act of 1928,1 which permits taxpayers, at their option, to pay at the rate of 12 1\/2 per cent. on capital net gains. Subsection (c)(8 ), 26 USCA  101 note, so far as material, is: \"Capital assets' means property held by the taxpayer for more than two years.' Whether property acquired from a decedent through intestacy, or a general bequest, is, within the meaning of the clause, held by the taxpayer from the date of the decedent's death or from the date of distribution, is the matter in dispute.\n The taxpayers are: In Nos. 110, 111, and 494, residuary legatees, in No. 24 the donee of a widow who elected to take against her husband's will, and in No. 439 one of \n\n[296 U.S. 102, 106]\n\u00a0\n those entitled under the intestate laws. In each case the taxpayer sold the asset more than two years after the death of the decedent from whom title was derived but less than two years after distribution by the estate's representatives. In each a return was made of the profit on the sale as capital net gain taxable at twelve and one-half per cent, but the Commissioner refused to recognize the correctness of the returns and calculated the tax at the normal and surtax rates payable on ordinary income.\n The Board of Tax Appeals sustained the Commissioner in four of the cases. \n2\n In No. 110 the tax was paid and judgment recovered in a suit for refund. \n3\n The Circuit Courts of Appeals of the Third, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits affirmed the action of the Board; that of the First Circuit reversed the Board in No. 111 and affirmed the judgment of the District Court in No. 110.4\n The Commissioner contends that until actual distribution property cannot be said to be held by one having an interest in a decedent's estate, and, even if this be not true, section 113(a)(5), 26 USCA  113 note, making value at the date of distribution the basis for calculating gain in such cases, requires that the word 'held' in section 101(c)(8), 26 USCA  101 note, be construed to set the same date as the time at which the holding shall begin.\n The taxpayers on the other hand assert that property is, in contemplation of law, held from the date of acquisition and one deriving property from a decedent's estate through devise, bequest or intestacy acquires the property at the date of death and holds it from that date; that so all prior acts using similar phraseology have been interpreted by the Treasury; that the re-enactment of these \n\n[296 U.S. 102, 107]\n\u00a0\n without significant change constitutes a legislative confirmation of the administrative interpretation; and that section 113, having to do with the basis for the calculation of the tax, cannot alter the plain meaning of section 101 which prescribes the length of time property must be held to constitute it a capital asset. We conclude that the date of the decedent's death is that from which the period of holding should be computed.\n In the Revenue Act of 1921, the first which granted a special rate of tax on capital net gain, section 206(a)(6) defined 'capital assets' as 'property acquired and held by the taxpayer ... for more than two years.' 5 From the corresponding sections of the Revenue Acts of 1924, 1926 ( section 208(a)(8), 26 USCA  101 note), and Revenue Act 1928 (section 101( c)(8), 26 USCA  101 note), the word 'acquired' was omitted. 'Acquired' in the phrase 'acquired and held' was mere surplusage and doubtless was elided from the later acts for that reason. \n6\n As indicated in Helvering v. New York Trust Company, \n292 \nU.S. 455, 469\n, 54 S.Ct. 806, 808, the omission did not change the meaning of capital assets as defined in the earlier act.\n In common understanding to hold property is to own it. In order to own or hold one must acquire. The date of acquisition is, then, that from which to compute the duration of ownership or the length of holding. Whether under local law title to personal property passes from a decedent to the legatee or next of kin at death subject to a withholding of possession for purposes of administration,7 or passes to the personal representative for the purposes of administration,-the title of the beneficiary, though derived through the executor, relating back to the \n\n[296 U.S. 102, 108]\n\u00a0\n date of death,8-is for present purposes immaterial. In either case, the date of acquisition within the intent of the Revenue Act is the date of death. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n The Commissioner has heretofore administered the section upon this theory. As respects the Revenue Act of 1921, he so ruled in 1923,10 and again in a very full memorandum in 1924.11 It was stated in briefs and at the bar that these rulings have never been cancelled or revoked, and the statement was not challenged. The repetition of the definition without material change in the subsequent acts, including that of 1928, amounts to a confirmation of the administrative interpretation. \n12\n There is nothing in the section, its history, or the administrative practice, to enlarge or alter the connotation commonly ascribed to the word 'held.'\n The Commissioner says, however, that Congress has undoubted power to set the date of distribution as the terminus a quo and that an examination of the whole statute discloses that the purpose was to alter the pre- existing rule to that end.\n In support of this argument it is pointed out that section 113, \n\n[296 U.S. 102, 109]\n\u00a0\n which prescribes the basis for determining capital gain or loss, radically altered pre-existing law on the subject in such a way as to show an intent to change the normal meaning of the word 'held' in section 101(c)(8). In the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 the sections dealing with the basis for calculating capital gain or loss provided that in the case of property acquired by bequest, devise, or inheritance, the basis shall be the fair market price or value of such property at the time of such acquisition. \n13\n As we have seen, in common understanding, with which the administrative interpretation was in accord, the time of acquisition in such cases is the time of the decedent's death. The date for ascertaining the basic value, and the date of commencement of the two year holding period were, therefore, under these acts, identical. Committee Reports indicate that by reason of doubt as to what is in fact the moment of acquisition by persons having various relations to a decedent's estate, Congress resolved arbitrarily to fix the basis for the calculation of capital gain or loss.\n In consequence the Act of 1928, for the language used in the earlier acts, substituted this: 'Property Transmitted at Death. If personal property was acquired by specific bequest, or if real property was acquired by general or specific devise or by intestacy, the basis shall be the fair market value of the property at the time of the death of the decedent. If the property was acquired by the decedent's estate from the decedent, the basis in the hands of the estate shall be the fair market value of the property at the time of the death of the decedent. In all other cases if the property was acquired either by will or by intestacy, the basis shall be the fair market value of the property at the time of the distribution to the taxpayer.' Section 113(a)(5), 26 USCA  113 note. \n\n[296 U.S. 102, 110]\n\u00a0\n No change was made in the phraseology of section 101(c)(8) from that used in prior acts defining capital assets as 'property ... held by the taxpayer ... for more than two years.' The argument for the Commissioner is that the alteration of the basis date necessarily implies an intent to make a similar alteration in the origin date of the holding period. We think the argument cannot prevail. The Committee Reports disclose no purpose to alter the rule laid down in the earlier statutes and re-enacted in section 101(c)(8). Congress must be taken to have been familiar with the existing administrative interpretation. The fact that the two sections deal with the same general subject-capital gains-is cited in support of the Commissioner's position that they ought to be consistently applied. There is, however, nothing novel in the naming of arbitrary 'basis' dates differing from the admitted dates of acquisition. The outstanding example is the use of March 1, 1913, value in certain cases for property theretofore acquired. Indeed subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of section 101(c)(8), 26 USCA  101 note, fix arbitrary dates for calculation of the period of holding of capital assets which differ from the time of actual acquisition, showing that Congress, had it desired to change the connotation of the word 'held,' as used in section 101(c)(8), could readily have done so.\n Counsel urge that Helvering v. New York Trust Company, supra, requires us to construe section 101(c)(8) as fixing the same date for the beginning of the holding period as section 113(a)(5) sets for determining the basis. We think, however, that the case is not authority here. The Act of 1921 exhibited an inconsistency in that while a donee was not permitted to tack his tenure to that of his donor, he was required to use his donor's basis. This inconsistency flowed from a literal reading of the separate sections dealing with these two subjects. Such a result the court held would run counter to the very policy and purpose of \n\n[296 U.S. 102, 111]\n\u00a0\n the capital gains rate reduction, which was to encourage sales of capital assets, and would penalize the taxpayer making such sales. The departure from the strict terms of the act was justified in order to secure him the benefit intended to be conferred. The court was careful to say: 'The rule that, where the statute contains no ambiguity, it must be taken literally and given effect according to its language, is a sound one.' That rule was held inapplicable for the reasons stated.\n Here the rule obtains that a taxing statute, if of doubtful intent, should be construed favorably to the taxpayer. \n14\n To depart from the literal meaning of section 101(c)(8) would be to penalize the taxpayer by lengthening the period during which the capital asset must be held in what is really a single ownership to obtain the advantage of the reduced tax. Under these circumstances we ought not to depart from the plain meaning of the section in an effort to bring about a uniformity which it is claimed Congress intended but failed to express.\n The instant case is much closer to Helvering v. Bliss, \n293 \nU.S. 144\n, 55 S.Ct. 17, 95 A.L.R. 207, where the government asserted that a section in terms applicable to the taxpayer's right to make a deduction from gross income should be modified in meaning and effect by another dealing with a related topic-related in the sense that both sections bore on the ultimate amount of the tax-independent, however, in the sense that one related to the deduction permitted in ascertaining taxable income, while the other fixed the rate of tax on a portion of such income. We refused to modify the obvious meaning of the applicable section to accord, as was claimed, with the other. 15 \n\n[296 U.S. 102, 112]\n\u00a0\n A further argument of the Commissioner is that, since under section 101(c)(8) (B), 26 USCA  101 note, the period for which the taxpayer has held property, however acquired, is to include any period during which such property was held by any other person if, under section 113, the property has, for purposes of determining gain or loss, the same basis in the taxpayer's hands as it would have in the hands of such other person, it is impossible to construe section 101 independently of section 113. It is said that Congress has clearly indicated the successor in title should not have the benefit of his predecessor's tenure when he was not required to use the predecessor's basis, and, therefore, tenure and basis are so connected in the two sections that the one may not fairly be construed without reference to the other. The argument is not convincing.\n The reference in subparagraph (B) is not to paragraph (a)(5) of section 113 but to the entire section which embodies a number of instances of the arbitrary fixing of basis dates for ascertaining capital gain or loss. Subparagraph (B) has, on its face, no relevance to the facts in the cases here for decision.\n We are of opinion that section 101(c)(8) is clear on its face; that it deals solely with the tenure necessary to claim a rate of 12 1\/2 per cent. on capital net gain as distinguished from the normal and surtax rate upon ordinary gain; that section 113(a)(5) deals only with the basis for the calculation of the tax in cases falling under section 101(c)(8); that the sections are not inconsistent, and that each should be read as affecting the subject to which alone it applies. \n No. 24.\n Judgment reversed.\n No. 110.

Noel, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for petitioner.\n Messrs. Sidney S. Miller and Samuel D. Miller, both of Indianapolis, Ind., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case is here on writ of certiorari, \n292 \nU.S. 620\n, 54 S.Ct. 780, to review a judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, upholding an Indiana statute challenged as unconstitutional. Section 9139, Burns' Ann. St. 1926. Indiana Acts, 1865, Sp. Sess., c. 15,  6, section 39-1713, Burns' Ann. St. 1933\n\n\n Respondent's predecessor in interest brought suit in the District Court for Southern Indiana to recover upon an indemnity bond executed by petitioner. The petitioner set up by answer and demurrer that it is a corporation organized under the laws of New York, carrying on in Indiana the business of writing casualty insurance contracts and surety bonds; that the claim for which suit was brought was presented to petitioner more than fifteen months before the suit was begun; that the indemnity bond contained a stipulation that no proceedings upon a claim upon the bond should be brought more than fifteen months after the date of the presentation of the claim; and that the Indiana statute, section 9139, declaring such provision invalid, is void because a denial of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amend- \n\n[294 U.S. 580, 582]\n\u00a0\n ment. The District Court gave judgment on the pleadings for respondent which the Court of Appeals affirmed. 68 F.(2d) 481.\n The statute, construed by the Supreme Court of Indiana in Caywood v. Supreme Lodge, 171 Ind. 410, 86 N.E. 482, 23 L.R.A.(N.S.) 304, 131 Am.St. Rep. 253, 17 Ann.Cas. 503, as applicable only to insurance corporations organized in states other than Indiana, forbids them to insert in their policies certain specified conditions, not now material, and enacts that 'any provision or condition contrary to the provisions of this section, or any condition in said policy inserted to avoid the provisions of this section, shall be void, and no condition or agreement not to sue for a period of less than three years (3) shall be valid.' There is no similar legislation applicable to domestic insurance companies carrying on the same class of business as petitioner. They are free to insert reasonable stipulations in their policies for a short period of limitation. Cf. Caywood v. Supreme Lodge, supra. The statutory period of limitation for suits to recover money on indemnity policies is ten years. Section 2-602, Burns' Ann. St. 1933; cf. Fidelity & Casualty Co. v. Jasper Furniture Co., 186 Ind. 566, 117 N.E. 258.\n We may assume that the petitioner, by entering the state of Indiana and carrying on business there, is not barred from asserting that its legislation conflicts with the Federal Constitution, Power Mfg. Co. v. Saunders, \n274 \nU.S. 490, 497\n, 47 S.Ct. 678, and we pass directly to the single question presented, whether the prohibition applied here to a foreign casualty insurance company infringes the Fourteenth Amendment because it is not likewise applied to domestic companies. Petitioner does not assail the prohibition as not within the scope of the legislative power or as itself so arbitrary or unreasonable as to be a denial of due process. It is not argued, nor could it be on the record before us, that the restriction would be unconstitutional if applied equally to both classes of corporations. Discrimination alone is the target of the attack. \n\n[294 U.S. 580, 583]\n\u00a0\n The equal protection clause does not prohibit legislative classification and the imposition of statutory restraints on one class which are not imposed on another. But this Court has said that not every legislative discrimination between foreign and domestic corporations is permissible merely because they differ, and that with respect to some subjects of legislation the differences between them may afford no reasonable basis for the imposition of a statutory restriction upon foreign corporations, not applied to domestic corporations. The ultimate test of validity is not whether foreign corporations differ from domestic, but whether the differences between them are pertinent to the subject with respect to which the classification is made. Power Mfg. Co. v. Saunders, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 494\n, 47 S.Ct. 678. If those differences have any rational relationship to the legislative command, the discrimination is not forbidden. Washington ex rel. Bond & Goodwin & Tucker, Inc., v. Superior Court, \n289 \nU.S. 361, 366\n, 53 S.Ct. 624, 89 A.L.R. 653; National Union Fire Insurance Co. v. Wanberg, \n260 \nU.S. 71, 75\n, 43 S.Ct. 32. See State of Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, \n274 \nU.S. 392, 396\n, 47 S.Ct. 630.\n Here the classification relates to the legislative command that insurance companies shall not by agreement limit the period within which suit may be brought on their contracts to less than three years. The record, briefs, and arguments before us are silent as to legislation or other local conditions in Indiana bearing on the question whether there may be differences, in the circumstances attending suits brought against local companies and those brought against foreign companies, such as to justify a difference in the applicable periods of limitation. It is not argued that a reasonable time for bringing a suit against domestic insurance companies of Indiana may not, in some circumstances at least, differ from that for suing foreign corporations. We are not told whether, in 1865 when the challenged statute was enacted, or since, differences in the legislative schemes of the state affecting the two classes of casualty insurance companies, foreign and \n\n[294 U.S. 580, 584]\n\u00a0\n domestic, or differences in their business practices within the state, have or have not made more difficult and time-consuming the collection of claims and the preparations for litigation against foreign insurance companies than against domestic companies. But we are asked to say a priori that, in the circumstances attending the two classes of suits, there can be no differences pertinent to the legislative command; that there can be no reasonable basis for the legislative judgment that a different period of limitation should be applied to the one than to the other.\n It is a salutary principle of judicial decision, long emphasized and followed by this Court, that the burden of establishing the unconstitutionality of a statute rests on him who assails it, and that courts may not declare a legislative discrimination invalid unless, viewed in the light of facts made known or generally assumed, it is of such a character as to preclude the assumption that the classification rests upon some rational basis within the knowledge and experience of the legislators. 1 A statutory discrimination will not be set aside as the denial of equal protection of the laws if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 357\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, L.R.A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527, 537\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464. \n\n[294 U.S. 580, 585]\n\u00a0\n The statutes of Indiana disclose a legislative scheme applicable to domestic casualty insurance companies differing radically from that applied to foreign corporations, and in some respects more exacting. Compare chapter 17 of title 39, Burns' Ann. St. 1933, with other chapters of that title. A pertinent difference which may be noted relates to the maintenance of a fund with a public officer for the protection of policyholders. Domestic companies are required to maintain with the state commissioner of insurance a guaranty fund in cash or approved securities, Burns' Ann. St. 1933,  39-1101, 39-1105, to be augmented by the addition of 5 per cent. of all dividends paid, section 39-118. These provisions appear not to be extended to foreign companies, but they, like foreign corporations writing surety bonds, are permitted to maintain a guaranty fund of a different type with an officer of the state of incorporation. Sections 39-1703, 25-1401, 25-1402, 25-1301, 25-1304, Burns' Ann. St. 1933.\n There is no showing that the situation of foreign corporations, writing casualty insurance contracts in Indiana, is so similar to that of domestic corporations as to preclude any rational distinction between them as regards the time required for negotiating settlements of claims and the determination whether suits upon them should be prosecuted within or without the state. Where the record is silent, we cannot presume to declare that there is such similarity, or to say that a state is prohibited from making any distinction in the length of time within which suit must be brought. It is not beyond the range of probability that foreign casualty companies, as distinguished from domestic companies, generally keep their funds and maintain their business offices, and their agencies for the settlement of claims, outside the state. For aught that appears such is the actual situation. See Concordia Fire Insurance Co. v. Illinois, \n292 \nU.S. 535, 548\n, 54 S.Ct. 830. We cannot say that \n\n[294 U.S. 580, 586]\n\u00a0\n these considerations may not have moved the Legislature to insist that a longer time should be given for bringing suit against foreign companies than the latter. It was competent for the Legislature to determine whether such differences exist, and upon the basis of those differences, and in the exercise of a legislative judgment, to make choice of the method of guarding against the evil aimed at. Standard Oil Co. v. City of Marysville, \n279 \nU.S. 582, 584\n, 49 S.Ct. 430; Hardware Dealers Mut. Fire Insurance Co. v. Glidden Co., \n284 \nU.S. 151, 158\n, 159 S., 52 S.Ct. 69. It could likewise decide whether the differences are general enough, as respects foreign companies, to call upon it in the exercise of legislative judgment, not shown to be irrational, to say whether the legislative prohibition should be applied to them as a class rather than to members of it selected by more empirical methods. State of Ohio ex rel. Clarke v. Deckebach, supra, \n274 \nU.S. 397\n, 47 S.Ct. 630; Westfall v. United States, \n274 \nU.S. 256, 259\n, 47 S.Ct. 629; Silver v. Silver, \n280 \nU.S. 117, 123\n, 50 S.Ct. 57, 65 A.L.R. 939.\n For reasons already stated, the question presented here is not affected by the fact that the Indiana Legislature has pursued a different policy with respect to life insurance companies by extending, in 1909, to both domestic and foreign life insurance companies the prohibition applied here. Section 39-802, Burns' Ann. St. 1933. Discriminations between life and casualty insurance companies are not forbidden and cannot be assumed to be irrational. Considerations which may have led to the equality of treatment of foreign and domestic life insurance companies are not disclosed. Whatever they may have been, we cannot assume that they are equally applicable to casualty companies.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, and Mr. Justice BUTLER dissent, because they are of opinion that the principles stated and applied in Power Manufacturing Company v.

IRVING TRUST CO.(1935)\nNo. 67\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Robert D. Steefel and Sol M. Stroock, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Lester D. Melzer, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is as to provability of a claim growing out of the termination of a lease by petitioner to the bankrupt and recentry before lessee filed his petition in voluntary bankruptcy. There is involved a construction of sections 1(11), 17 and 63(a)(b) of the Bankruptcy Act.* The \n\n[296 U.S. 256, 257]\n\u00a0\n District Court for the Southern District of New York held the claim not provable. 10 F.Supp. 733. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, 77 F.(2d) 1012, following its decision in Urban Properties Co. v. Irving Trust Co., 74 F.(2d) 654, in which we granted a writ of certiorari, \n295 \nU.S. 725\n, 55 S.Ct. 826, dismissed on petitioner's motion. \n296 \nU.S. 658\n, 56 S.Ct. 81. The decision in the case now before us conflicts with that of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Lloyd Inv. Co. v. Schmidt, 66 F.(2d) 371. To resolve the conflict we granted this writ. \n295 \nU.S. 729\n, 55 S.Ct. 927\n\n\n The lease covered a store building in Newark, N.J., and was for a term of ten years commencing August 1, 1928. The lessee occupied the premises until April 27, 1932, when, by the above-named court, an equity receiver was appointed for it. The receiver, having disaffirmed the lease, vacated the premises July 18, and the lessor took possession July 25; the lessee filed its petition in bankruptcy August 27. Later, the lessor relet the premises for the balance of the term but for rents less than those reserved in the lease to the bankrupt.\n That lease provides that, if the premises shall become vacant or the term shall end prior to the expiration date because of any act of the tenant, the landlord may re-enter, relet the premises, and apply the rents received on \n\n[296 U.S. 256, 258]\n\u00a0\n the reletting to the payments of rents due under the lease, and that the tenant shall not be entitled to any surplus, but shall remain liable for any deficiency which, at the option of the landlord, shall become payable on demand or as it accrues from month to month.\n The petitioner filed a claim consisting of two items. The first was for $600 filed as a priority claim covering rent for March and April, 1932, and the second was for $16,025 filed as a general claim for the difference between the rent reserved in the lease and the fair rental value of the premises for the balance of the term. The trustee objected to the claim and sought to have it reduced to $1,000 admittedly owing for past due rent at the time of filing the petition in bankruptcy. The first item having been allowed and paid as a claim entitled to priority, under New Jersey law, the referee reduced the second item to $400.\n The covenant before us is like that considered in Manhattan Prop. v. Irving Trust Co., \n291 \nU.S. 320\n, 54 S.Ct. 385. The difference between the cases is that here the re-entry occurred before, while in that case there was no re-entry until after, bankruptcy. The petitioner's statement of claim does not follow the covenant in his lease. It is made as if it rested on a covenant providing for damages equal to rents reserved less rental value for the rest of the term, such as that on which the landlord prevailed in Irving Trust Co. v. A. W. Perry Co., \n293 \nU.S. 307\n, 55 S.Ct. 150. But petitioner's claim must be adjudged on the basis of the covenant that in his interest was inserted in the lease. The only measure available to him is the difference between the rents reserved in the lease and what he might choose or happen to get on reletting. Under the clause in question, it was, at the time the petition in bankruptcy was filed, uncertain, a mere matter of speculation, whether any liability ever would arise under it. Section 63(a); Riggin v. Magwire, 15 Wall. 549; Dunbar v. Dunbar, \n190 \nU.S. 340, 345\n, 23 S.Ct. 757; In \n\n[296 U.S. 256, 259]\n\u00a0\n re Merrill & Baker (C.C.A.) 186 F. 312; cf. Maynard v. Elliott, \n283 \nU.S. 273, 278\n, 51 S.Ct. 390. The method here prescribed is not governed by any rule or principle written into or derivable from the lease or recognized in law as governing in such cases as this. Without transgressing the covenant, he may make, terminate, and renew leases covering the premises without regard to rental value. He is free to fix or control the amount of lessee's liability, at least to the extent of the difference between free use and reasonable rental value of the premises. It is clear that the specified basis is not a valid one for the proving of claims under section 63 (11 USCA  103).\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Section 1(11). \"debt' shall include any debt, demand, or claim provable in bankruptcy.' 11 U.S.C.  1(11), 11 USCA  1(11).\n Section 17.

Lowrey, Jr., and Wallace Miller, both of Macon, Ga., for Petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Will G. Beardslee, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner enlisted in the United States Army June 7, 1917, and was honorably discharged April 3, 1919. On January 22, 1918, there was issued to him a war risk insurance policy, by the terms of which he was entitled to receive $57.50 per month in the event of his sustaining injuries causing total and permanent disability. No premiums were paid after the date of his discharge, and the policy then lapsed. Claim was made for insurance on June 5, 1931, twelve years later. The claim was disallowed by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs on April 1, 1932. Thereupon, this action to recover judgment upon the policy was brought.\n The facts upon which the action is based follow: On October 26, 1918, while in active service in France, petitioner sustained injuries in a railway accident resulting in the amputation of his right arm. He alleges that, for all practical purposes, the sight of his left eye was destroyed at the same time. Although the evidence shows that the \n\n[294 U.S. 435, 437]\n\u00a0\n defective condition of the eye was congenital, no point is made in respect of that fact; and for present purposes we put it aside. At the conclusion of the evidence before the trial court, the judge sustained a motion of the government for a directed verdict, on the ground that the injuries did not, as a matter of law, result in total and permanent disability. Verdict and judgment followed accordingly. The Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment, 71 F.(2d) 361, and we brought the case here on certiorari.\n Article 3 (section 301 et seq.) of the Act of 1917 (chapter 105, 40 Stat. 398, 405) relates to compensation for death or disability. The provisions in respect of insurance are dealt with separately in article 4 ( page 409,  400 et seq.) of the act; and this separation of the two subjects has been maintained a subsequent acts. The provision in respect of insurance (page 409,  400) is that upon application to the bureau, the United States 'shall grant insurance against the death or total permanent disability' of enlisted men and other classes of persons named in the act. The provision of the act (section 302) with respect to compensation was enlarged by the amending act of December 24, 1919, c. 16,  11, 41 Stat. 371, 373, so as to bring conclusively within the term 'total permanent disability' the loss of one hand and the sight of one eye; and this has since remained the law. No such amendment was carried into the insurance article of the act; and, in that respect, the statute has never been changed.\n Section 13 of the 1917 act, as amended, Act May 20, 1918, c. 77, 40 Stat. 555, confers upon the Director of the Bureau authority to make such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with the provisions of the act, as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out its purposes. Under that provision, a regulation was issued March 9, 1918, declaring: 'Any impairment of mind or body which renders it impossible for the disabled person to follow continuously any substantially gainful occupation shall be deemed, in Articles III and IV, to be total disability.' It was while this regulation was in \n\n[294 U.S. 435, 438]\n\u00a0\n effect that section 302 of the act was amended, as stated above, to provide in respect of compensation that the loss of one hand and the sight of one eye should be deemed total permanent disability. In May, 1930, Regulation 3140 was promulgated. That regulation, among other things, declares that the loss of one hand and one eye 'shall be deemed to be total permanent disability under yearly renewable term insurance.'\n Succinctly stated, petitioner contends (1) that section 302, as amended, applies to war risk insurance as well as to compensation allowances; (2) that regulation 3140 is within the power of the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs (who succeeded the Director of the Bureau), and controls the present case; and (3) that, the foregoing aside, the evidence was sufficient to justify a verdict in his favor.\n First. The argument as to the first point, in brief, is this: The amendment to the compensation article of the act, adopted in 1919, must be construed and applied in the light of the regulation of March 9, 1918, of which regulation congressional knowledge and approval are to be assumed. By that regulation, the bureau adopted a uniform rule applicable alike to compensation and insurance; and the contention seems to be, since Congress did not by express words limit the operation of the amendment of 1919 to compensation, it is fair to conclude that it was intended that the amendment, conforming to the principle of the regulation, should apply to both compensation and insurance. We see no warrant for that conclusion. When the regulations was adopted, neither article 3 nor article 4 contained any specific provision in respect of the disabling effect of the loss of one hand and the sight of one eye. By the amendment, not only was the formal expression of the new rule confined to article 3, but the opening words of the amendment quite clearly indicate a legislative intention to confine its application to that article. These words are: 'If and while the disability is rated as \n\n[294 U.S. 435, 439]\n\u00a0\n total and permanent, the rate of compensation shall be $100 per month,' etc. (Italics added.) It is hard to see why the intention of Congress to limit the operation of the amendment to compensation allowances is not thus definitely and clearly manifested.\n Second. Regulation 3140 was not adopted until eleven years after the insurance policy had lapsed and petitioner's cause of action thereon had fully matured. Undoubtedly, the regulation in terms declares that permanent loss of the use of one hand and one eye shall be deemed to be total permanent disability under an insurance policy such as that issued to petitioner. But the regulation is both inapplicable and invalid.\n It is inapplicable because it contains nothing to suggest that it was to be given a retrospective effect so as to bring within its purview a policy which had long since lapsed and which had relation only to an alleged cause of action long since matured. The law is well settled that generally a statute cannot be construed to operate retrospectively unless the legislative intention to that effect unequivocally appears. Twenty Per Cent. Cases, 20 Wall. 179, 187; Chew Heong v. United States, \n112 \nU.S. 536, 559\n, 5 S.Ct. 255; Fullerton-Krueger Lumber Co. v. Northern Pacific R. Co., \n266 \nU.S. 435, 437\n, 45 S.Ct. 143. The principle is strictly applicable to statutes which have the effect of creating an obligation An administrative regulation is subject to the rule equally with a statute; and accordingly, the regulation here involved must be taken to operate prospectively only.\n It is invalid because not within the authority conferred by the statute upon the Director (or his successor, the Administrator) to make regulations to carry out the purposes of the act. It is not, in the sense of the statute, a regulation at all, but legislation. The effect of the statute in force at the time of the adoption of the so-called regulation is that in respect of compensation allowances, loss of a hand and an eye shall be deemed total permanent dis- \n\n[294 U.S. 435, 440]\n\u00a0\n ability as a matter of law. There being no such provision with respect to cases of insurance, the question whether a loss of that character or any other specific disability constitutes total permanent disability is left to be determined as matter of fact. The vice of the regulation, therefore, is that it assumes to convert what in the view of the statute is a question of fact requiring proof into a conclusive presumption which dispenses with proof and precludes dispute. This is beyond administrative power. The only authority conferred, or which could be conferred, by the statute is to make regulations to carry out the purposes of the act-not to amend it. United States v. 200 Barrels of Whisky, \n95 U.S. 571\n, 576; Morrill v. Jones, \n106 \nU.S. 466, 467\n, 1 S.Ct. 423; United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 517\n, 31 S.Ct. 480; Campbell v. Galeno Chemical Co., \n281 \nU.S. 599, 610\n, 50 S.Ct. 412\n\n\n Third. The burden was on petitioner not only to show the character and extent of his injury, but also to show that the result of the injury was to disable him permanently from following any substantially gainful occupation. Proechel v. United States (C.C.A.) 59 F.(2d) 648, 652; United States v. McCreary (C.C.A.) 61 F.(2d) 804, 808. Petitioner lost his right arm; and the proof shows that he had been right-handed. Before the injury he was a practical engineer operating a surveying instrument; but with the loss of his right arm he could not operate such an instrument. In 1919 he obtained employment in a packing house, but found himself unable to retain the employment because it necessitated lifting heavy quarters of meat which he could not do with one arm. He was also unable to take orders for the house because he could not hold the receiver of the telephone and write orders at the same time. After three weeks, he was obliged to give up this employment. From time to time, he obtained other work which involved the use of both hands and which he was obliged to abandon. On the other hand, it appears that he worked for twenty-two months in the business of \n\n[294 U.S. 435, 441]\n\u00a0\n selling stocks on commission, and for a few months in that of selling goods, from neither of which he received much in the way of income-not because his injury incapacitated him for the work, but because he lacked ability as a salesman. It does not appear that he made any earnest endeavor to fit himself for this work, or any effort to engage in other work which ordinarily a one-armed man with one defective eye could do. See United States v. Thomas (C.C.A.) 53 F.(2d) 192, 195. He testified that he had received an average of $90 a month from the government as compensation since his discharge. He also received $2,500 from the sale of a farm in which he had an interest. He was, therefore, not without resources with which to obtain proper training. It does not appear that he undertook to do so. It is by no means infrequent for one-armed men to make a good living and support others by performing work adapted to their condition. It is clear from the evidence that the failure of petitioner in some of the things he undertook to do was not because of his crippled condition, but because of his general inaptitude for the work. The mere fact that he was unable to follow the occupation of surveyor or to do work of the kind he had been accustomed to perform before his injury does not establish the permanent and total character of his disability. Lumbra v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 551, 559\n, 54 S.Ct. 272. His long delay before bringing suit is wholly incompatible with a belief on his part that he was totally and permanently disabled during the period while his policy was in force. Id., page 560 of 290 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 272; United States v. Hairston ( C.C.A.) 55 F.(2d) 825, 827. If petitioner thought himself totally and permanently disabled, it is difficult to understand why he waited twelve years before attempting to assert his rights. The only explanation he makes for his delay is that he thought a man had to die to get the insurance. How he discovered his error after the extraordinary lapse of time indicated above we are not told. He was intelligent, had \n\n[294 U.S. 435, 442]\n\u00a0\n completed the third grade at high school, and a year at military school. It does not seem possible that he had never read the policy, which so plainly insures against total permanent disability. In the light of all the circumstances, his explanation is not credible.\n The court below, after reviewing the evidence and the decisions of this and other courts, reached the conclusion that petitioner had not sustained the burden of proof and that the trial court was justified in directing a verdict for the government. That conclusion is well supported by our recent decision in the Lumbra Case, supra, and by other decisions. See, e.g., Proechel v. United States, supra; United States v. Thomas, supra; Hanagan v. United States (C.C.A.) 57 F.(2d) 860, 861.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n294 \nU.S. 734\n, 55 S.Ct. 635, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n\n\n\n","115":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMILWAUKEE COUNTY v. M.E. WHITE CO.(1935)\nNo. 32\nArgued: Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 268, 269]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Herbert H. Naujoks, of Madison, Wis., and Clark J. A. Hazelwood, of Milwaukee, Wis., for Milwaukee County.\n Mr. Irving Herriott, of Chicago, Ill., for M. E. White Co.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case comes here under section 239 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C .  346, 28 U.S.C.A.  346, on certificate of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, which presents a question of law concerning which the instructions of this court are desired for the proper decision of the case.\n The relevant facts, as stated by the certificate, are that the appellant, Milwaukee county, a county and citizen of Wisconsin, brought suit in the District Court for Northern Illinois against M. E. White Company, appellee, \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 270]\n\u00a0\n a corporation and citizen of Illinois, to recover on a judgment for $52, 165.84 which appellant had duly recovered and entered against the appellee in the circuit court of Milwaukee county, Wis., a court of general jurisdiction. The judgment is siad to be for taxes duly assessed against appellee, under Wisconsin statutes, upon income received from its business transacted within the state under state license. The District Court dismissed the cause on the ground that, as the suit was in substance brought to enforce the revenue laws of Wisconsin, it could not be maintained in the District Court in Illinois.\n The question certified is as follows: 'Should a United States District Court in and for the State of Illinois, having jurisdiction of the parties, entertain jurisdiction of an action therein brought, based upon a valid judgment for over $3,000 rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Wisconsin against the same defendant, which judgment was predicated upon an income tax due from the defendant to the State of Wisconsin?'\n Appellee insists that the question should be answered in the negative ( 1) because such a suit is not within the judicial power conferred upon District Courts by the Constitution and laws of the United States; and (2) because a judgment for taxes constitutes an exception to the requirement of the Constitution and statutes of the United States that full faith and credit be given in each state to the public acts and judicial proceedings of every state.\n\n 1. \nBy section 24(1) of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  41(1), 28 U.S.C. A.  41(1), District Courts are given original jurisdiction 'of all suits of a civil nature, at common law or in equity,' where there is the requisite diversity of citizenship and the amount in controversy exceeds $ 3,000. In this grant of jurisdiction of causes arising under state as well as federal law the phrase 'suits of a civil nature' is used in contradistinction to 'crimes and offenses,' as to which the juris- \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 271]\n\u00a0\n diction of the District Courts is restricted by section 24(2), 28 U.S.C.A .  41(2), to offenses against the United States. Thus, suits of a civil nature within the meaning of the section are those which do not involve criminal prosecution or punishment, and which are of a character traditionally cognizable by courts of common law or of equity. Such are suits upon a judgment, foreign or domestic, for a civil liability, of a court having jurisdiction of the cause and of the parties, which were maintainable at common law upon writ of debt, or of indebitatus assumpsit. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n Even if the judgment is deemed to be colored by the nature of the obligation whose validity it establishes, and we are free to re-examine it, and, if we find it to be based on an obligation penal in character, to refuse to enforce it outside the state where rendered, see Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 U.S. 265\n, 292, et seq. 8 S.Ct. 1370, compare Fauntleroy v. Lum, \n210 \nU.S. 230\n, 28 S.Ct. 641, still the obligation to pay taxes is not penal. It is a statutory liability, quasi contractual in nature, enforceable, if there is no exclusive statutory remedy, in the civil courts by the common-law action of debt or indebitatus assumpsit. United States v. Chamberlin, \n219 \nU.S. 250\n, 31 S.Ct. 155; Price v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 492\n, 46 S.Ct. 180; Dollar Savings Bank v. United States, 19 Wall. 227; and see Stockwell v. United States, 13 Wall. 531, 542; Meredith v. United States, 13 Pet. 486, 493. This was the rule established in the English courts before the Declaration of Independence. Attorney General v. Weeks, Bunbury's Exch. Rep. 223; Attorney General v. Jewers and Batty, Bunbury's Exch. Rep. 225; Attorney General v. Hatton, Bunbury's Exch. Rep. \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 272]\n\u00a0\n 262; Attorney General v. _ _, 2 Ans.Rep. 558; see Comyn's Digest (Title 'Dett,' A, 9); 1 Chitty on Pleading, 123; cf. Attorney General v. Sewell, 4 M.&W. 77.\n The objection that the courts in one state will not entertain a suit to recover taxes due to another or upon a judgment for such taxes is not rightly addressed to any want of judicial power in courts which are authorized to entertain civil suits at law. It goes not to the jurisdiction, but to the merits, and raises a question which District Courts are competent to decide. See Illinois Central R. Co. v. Adams, \n180 \nU.S. 28\n, 21 S.Ct. 251; General Investment Co. v. New York Central R. Co., \n271 \nU.S. 228, 230\n, 46 S.Ct. 496; Becker Steel Co. v. Cummings, Attorney General, \n296 \nU.S. 74\n, 56 S.Ct. 15, decided November 11, 1935\n\n\n That defense is without merit if full faith and credit must be given the judgment. But even if full faith and credit is not commanded, there is nothing in the Constitution and laws of the United States which requires a court of a state to deny relief upon a judgment because it is for taxes. A state court, in conformity to state policy, may, by comity, give a remedy which the full-faith and credit clause does not compel. Young v. Masci, \n289 \nU.S. 253\n, 53 S.Ct. 599, 88 A.L.R. 170; Bond v. Hume, \n243 \nU.S. 15\n, 37 S.Ct. 366; cf. Tennessee Coal, Iron & R. Co. v.

A suit to recover taxes due under the statutes of another state has been allowed without regard to the compulsion of the full faith and credit clause. Holshouser Co. v. Gold Hill Copper Co., 138 N.C. 248, 50 S.E. 650, 70 L.R.A. 183. The privilege may be extended by statute. See Laws N.Y. 1932, c. 333. Where suits to enforce the laws of one state are entertained in the courts of another on the principle of comity, the federal District Courts sitting in that state may entertain them and should if they do not infringe federal law \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 273]\n\u00a0\n or policy.

Co., \n103 U.S. 11\n; see Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 161\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696.\n\n 2. \nThe faith and credit required to be given to judgments does not depend on the Constitution alone. Article 4,  1, not only commands that 'full Faith and Credit shall be given in each State to the public Acts, Records, and judicial Proceedings of every other State' but it adds 'Congress may be general Laws prescribe the Manner in which such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect thereof.' And Congress has exercised this power, by Act of May 26, 1790, c. 11, 28 U.S.C .  687, 28 USCA  687, which provides the manner of proof of judgments of one state in the courts of another, and specifically directs that judgments 'shall have such faith and credit given to them in every court within the United States as they have by law or usage in the courts of the State from which they are taken.'\n Such exception as there may be to this all-inclusive command is one which is implied from the nature of our dual system of government, and recognizes that consistently with the full-faith and credit clause there may be limits to the extent to which the policy of one state, in many respects sovereign, may be subordinated to the policy of another. That there are exceptions has often been pointed out, Broderick v. Rosner, \n294 \nU.S. 629, 642\n, 55 S.Ct. 589; Alaska Packers Ass'n v. Industrial Accident Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 532, 546\n, 55 S.Ct. 518; Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, supra, \n286 \nU.S. 145, 160\n, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696; Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 663\n, 13 S.Ct. 224; Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265, 293\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370; and in some instances decided. See Haddock v. Haddock, \n201 \nU.S. 562\n, 26 S.Ct. 525, 5 Ann.Cas. 1; Maynard v. Hill, \n125 \nU.S. 190\n, 8 S.Ct. 723; Hood v. McGehee, \n237 \nU.S. 611\n, 35 S.Ct. 718; Olmsted v. Olmsted, \n216 \nU.S. 386\n, 30 S.Ct. 292, 25 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1292; Fall v. Eastin, \n215 \nU.S. 1\n, 30 S.Ct. 3, 23 L.R.A.(N.S.) 924, 17 Ann.Cas. 853. Without attempting to \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 274]\n\u00a0\n say what their limits may be, we assume for present purposes that the command of the Constitution and of the statute is not all-embracing, and direct our inquiry to the question whether a state to which a judgment for taxes is taken may have a policy against its enforcement meriting recognition as a permissible limitation upon the full-faith and credit clause. Of that question this court is the final arbiter. See Alaska Packers Association v. Industrial Accident Commission, supra, \n294 \nU.S. 532, 547\n, 55 S.Ct. 518; Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, supra, \n286 U.S. 145\n, 157-162, 52 S.Ct. 571, 82 A.L.R. 696.\n It is said that in answering it the court should examine the record which supports the judgment and refuse to give credit to the judgment, if the cause of action upon which it is founded is one which it would not enforce, and appellee urges that a suit for taxes imposed by state statute will not be entertained outside the taxing state. It has often been said,2 and in a few cases held,3 that statutes imposing taxes are not entitled to full faith and credit. Other obligations to pay money arising under the statutes of one state must be given recognition in courts of another. Converse v. Hamilton, \n224 \nU.S. 243\n, 32 S.Ct. 415, Ann.Cas. 1913D, 1292; Broderick v. Rosner, supra; Bradford Electric Light Co. v. Clapper, supra. But it is insisted that to this rule taxing statutes constitute an exception, analogous to that relat- \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 275]\n\u00a0\n ing to penal laws, because the courts of one state should not be called upon to scrutinize the relations of a foreign state with its own citizens, such as are involved in its revenue laws, and thus commit the state of the forum to positions which might be seriously embarrassing to itself or its neighbors. See Moore v. Mitchell (C.C.A.) 30 F.(2d) 600, 602, 604, 65 A.L. R. 1354; Beale, Conflict of Laws,  610.1.\n Whether one state must enforce the revenue laws of another remains an open question in this court. See Moore v. Mitchell, \n281 \nU.S. 18, 24\n, 50 S. Ct. 175. But we do not stop to inquire whether the considerations which have been thought to preclude the enforcement of the penal laws of one state in the courts of another are applicable to taxing statutes; or whether the mere possibility of embarrassment in their enforcement should stay the hand of the court of another state in cases where in fact such embarrassment will not occur. For present purposes, we will assume that the courts of one state are not required to entertain a suit to recover taxes levied under the statutes of another, and confine our inquiry to the single question whether they must, nevertheless, give full faith and credit to judgments for such taxes.\n A cause of action on a judgment is different from that upon which the judgment was entered. In a suit upon a money judgment for a civil cause of action, the validity of the claim upon which it was founded is not open to inquiry, whatever its genesis. Regardless of the nature of the right which gave rise to it, the judgment is an obligation to pay money in the nature of a debt upon the specialty. Recovery upon it can be resisted only on the grounds that the court which rendered it was without jurisdiction, Pennoyer v. Neff, \n95 U.S. 714\n; D'Arcy v. Ketchum, 11 How. 165; Tilt v. Kelsey, \n207 \nU.S. 43\n, 28 S.Ct. 1, or that it has ceased to be obligatory because of payment or other discharge, Anderson v. Clark, 70 Ga. 362; Haggerty v. Amory, 7 Allen (Mass.) 458; First Nat. Bank v. \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 276]\n\u00a0\n Hahn, 197 Mo.App. 593, 198 S.W. 489; Revere Copper Co. v. Dimock, 90 N.Y. 33, or that it is a cause of action for which the state of the forum has not provided a court, Anglo-American Provision Co. v. Davis Provision Co., \n191 \nU.S. 373\n, 24 S.Ct. 92; compare Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, \n252 \nU.S. 411\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 10 A.L.R. 716, unless it is compelled to do so by the privileges and immunities clause (Const. Amend. 14,  1); compare Douglas v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n279 \nU.S. 377\n, 49 S. Ct. 355, McKnett v. St. Louis & S.F. Ry. Co., \n292 \nU.S. 230\n, 54 S.Ct. 690, and Broderick v. Rosner, supra; or possibly because procured by fraud, compare Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290; Maxwell v. Stewart, 21 Wall. 71, 22 Wall. 77; Hanley v. Donoghue, \n116 \nU.S. 1\n, 6 S.Ct. 242; Simmons v. Saul, \n138 \nU.S. 439\n, 11 S.Ct. 369, with Webster v. Reid, 11 How. 437; NcNitt v. Turner, 16 Wall. 352, 366; Cole v. Cunningham, \n133 \nU.S. 107, 122\n, 10 S.Ct. 269.\n Trial of these issues, even though the judgment be for taxes incurred under the laws of another state, requires no scrutiny of its revenue laws or of relations established by those laws with its citizens, and calls for no pronouncement upon the policy of a sister state. It involves no more embarrassment than the interstate rendition of fugitives from justice, the constitutional command for which is no more specific than that requiring full faith and credit. Foreign judgments are not liens and are not entitled to execution in the state to which they are brought. See M'Elmoyle v. Cohen, 13 Pet. 312; Cole v.

(N.S.) 1068, 20 Ann.Cas. 1061. They can no more demand priority over domestic claims for taxes than a judgment upon a simple contract debt, which is equally a binding obligation of the judgment debtor where rendered, and to which full faith and credit must be accorded.\n We can perceive no greater possibility of embarrassment in litigating the validity of a judgment for taxes and enforcing it than any other for the payment of money. The very purpose of the full-faith and credit \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 277]\n\u00a0\n clause was to alter the status of the several states as independent foreign sovereignties, each free to ignore obligations created under the laws or by the judicial proceedings of the others, and to make them integral parts of a single nation throughout which a remedy upon a just obligation might be demanded as of right, irrespective of the state of its origin. That purpose ought not lightly to be set aside out of deference to a local policy which, if it exists, would seem to be too trivial to merit serious consideration when weighed against the policy of the constitutional provision and the interest of the state whose judgment is challenged. In the circumstances here disclosed, no state can be said to have a legitimate policy against payment of its neighbor's taxes, the obligation of which has been judicially established by courts to whose judgments in practically every other instance it must give full faith and credit. Compare Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra.\n In numerous cases this court has held that credit must be given to the judgment of another state, although the forum would not be required to entertain the suit on which the judgment was founded; that considerations of policy of the forum which would defeat a suit upon the original cause of action are not involved in a suit upon the judgment and are insufficient to defeat it. Full faith and credit is required to be given to the judgment of another state, although the original suit on which it was based arose in the state of the forum and was barred there by the Statute of Limitations when the judgment was rendered. Christmas v. Russell, 5 Wall. 290; Roche v. McDonald, \n275 \nU.S. 449\n, 48 S. Ct. 142, 53 A.L.R. 1141, and where the original suit was upon a gambling contract invalid by the law of the forum where it was made, Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra. It was required where the judgment was for wrongful death, although it was thought that the statute giving the recovery was not entitled to full faith and credit. Kenney \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 278]\n\u00a0\n v. Supreme Lodge, supra; compare Converse v. Hamilton, supra; Broderick v. Rosner, supra; see, also, American Express Co. v. Mullins, \n212 \nU.S. 311\n, 29 S.Ct. 381, 15 Ann.Cas. 536.\n Appellee especially relies upon the statement in the opinion of this Court in Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., supra, \n127 \nU.S. 265, 292\n, 293 S., 8 S.Ct. 1370, 1375, that: 'The essential nature and real foundation of a cause of action are not changed by recovering judgment upon it; and the technical rules which regard the original claim as merged in the judgment, and the judgment as implying a promise by the defendant to pay it, do not preclude a court to which a judgment is presented for affirmative action (while it cannot go behind the judgment for the purpose of examining into the validity of the claim) from ascertaining whether the claim is really one of such a nature that the court is authorized to enforce it.' In that case it was held that this court was without original jurisdiction of a suit brought by Wisconsin to recover upon a judgment obtained in its own courts for a penalty imposed by its statutes for the failure of an insurance company to file an annual report. So far as the opinion can be taken to suggest that full faith and credit is not required with respect to a judgment unless the original cause of action would have been entitled to like credit, it is inconsistent with decisions of this court already noted, and was discredited in Fauntleroy v. Lum, supra, \n210 \nU.S. 230, 236\n, 237 S., 28 S.Ct. 641, and Kenney v. Supreme Lodge, supra, \n252 \nU.S. 411, 414\n, 40 S.Ct. 371, 10 A.L.R. 716.\n The precise question now presented appears to have been decided in only a single case, People of State of New York v. Coe Manufacturing Co., 112 N.J. Law, 536, 172 A. 198. In holding in that case that a New York judgment for taxes was entitled to full faith and credit, the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals pointed out that questions of the construction and application of the New York tax laws were not the subject of litigation in New Jersey, since \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 279]\n\u00a0\n they had been conclusively determined by the New York judgment, which established liability for the tax. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n We conclude that a judgment is not to be denied full faith and credit in state and federal courts merely because it is for taxes.\n We intimate no opinion whether a suit upon a judgment for an obligation created by a penal law, in the international sense, see Huntington v. Attrill, supra, \n146 \nU.S. 657, 677\n, 13 S.Ct. 224, is within the jurisdiction of the federal District Courts, or whether full faith and credit must be given to such a judgment even though a suit for the penalty before reduced to judgment could not be maintained outside of the state where imposed. See Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., supra.\n The findings of the Wisconsin court, upon which the judgment in the present case was predicated, are appended as an exhibit to the certificate. They indicate that the judgment included interest and a 'penalty' of \n\n[296 U.S. 268, 280]\n\u00a0\n 2 per cent. for delinquency in payment, but the record does not disclose that the nominal penalty arose under a penal law or is of such a nature as to preclude suit to recover it outside the state of Wisconsin. See Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 U.S. 657\n, 667, et seq., 13 S.Ct. 224. The certificate and question are framed on the assumption that it is not. The judgment is stated to be for taxes.\n The question is answered 'yes.'\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS and Mr. Justice BUTLER think that the question should be answered 'no.' \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Answer to certified questions conformed to in 81 F.(2d) 753. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Horsy v.

PORT HURON TERMINAL CO.(1935)\nNo. 678\nArgued: April 12, 1935Decided: June 3, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Eugene F. Black and Jesse P. Wolcott, both of Port Huron, Mich., for petitioner.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, a longshoreman, was injured at Port Huron while unloading a vessel lying in navigable water. He was about his work on the deck of the vessel when he was struck by a swinging hoist, lifting cargo from a hatch, and was precipitated upon the wharf. He sought compensation under the Compensation Act of the State of Michigan (Comp. Laws Mich. 1929,  8407 et seq., as amended). His employer, the Port Huron Terminal Company, contended that the accident occurred upon navi- \n\n[295 U.S. 647, 648]\n\u00a0\n gable water and that the state law did not apply. The defense was overruled by the state commission in the view that the injury must have been occasioned by petitioner's fall upon the wharf, and hence that the claim was within the state statute, although the injury would not have been received except for the force applied to his person while on the vessel. The Supreme Court of the State vacated the commission's award, holding that the federal law controlled. 269 Mich. 295, 257 N.W. 831. Because on an asserted conflict with decisions of this Court, a writ of certiorari was granted. \n294 \nU.S. 704\n, 55 S.Ct. 548, 79 L.Ed. --.\n We have held that the case of an employee injured upon navigable waters while engaged in a maritime service is governed by the maritime law. Southern Pacific Company v. Jensen, \n244 \nU.S. 205\n, 37 S.Ct. 524, L.R.A. 1918C, 451, Ann. Cas. 1917E, 900; Grant Smith-Porter Ship Company v. Rohde, \n257 \nU.S. 469, 477\n, 42 S.Ct. 157, 25 A.L.R. 1008. It is otherwise if the injury takes place on land. State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Corp., \n259 \nU.S. 263, 272\n, 273 S., 42 S.Ct. 473, 25 A.L.R. 1013; Nogueira v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co., \n281 \nU.S. 128, 133\n, 50 S.Ct. 303. In the instant case, the injury was due to the blow which petitioner received from the swinging crane. It was that blow received on the vessel in navigable water which gave rise to the cause of action, and the maritime character of that cause of action is not altered by the fact that the petitioner was thrown from the vessel to the land.\n We had the converse case before us in T. Smith & Son v. Taylor, \n276 \nU.S. 179\n, 48 S.Ct. 228. There a longshoreman, employed in the unloading of a vessel at a dock, was standing upon a stage that rested solely upon the wharf and projected a few feet over the water to or near the vessel. He was struck by a sling loaded with cargo, which was being lowered over the vessel's side, and was knocked into the water, where some time later he was found dead. It was urged that the suit was solely for the death which occurred in the water, and hence, that the case was exclusively within the admiralty jurisdiction. We held the argument \n\n[295 U.S. 647, 649]\n\u00a0\n to be untenable. We said: 'The blow by the sling was what gave rise to the cause of action. It was given and took effect while deceased was upon the land. It was the sole, immediate and proximate cause of his death. The G. R. Booth, \n171 U.S. 450\n, 460 (19 S.Ct. 9). The Substance and consummmation of the occurrence which gave rise to the cause of action took place on land.' Id., \n276 U.S. 179\n, page 182, 48 S.Ct. 228, 229.\n If, when the blow from a swinging crane knocks a longshoreman from the dock into the water, the cause of action arises on the land, it must follow, upon the same reasoning, that when he is struck upon the vessel and the blow throws him upon the dock the cause of action arises on the vessel. Compare Vancouver S.S. Co. v. Rice, \n288 \nU.S. 445, 448\n, 53 S.Ct. 420.\n The decision in L'Hote v. Crowell, \n286 \nU.S. 528\n, 52 S.Ct. 499, upon which petitioner relies, is not opposed. In that case, we dealt only with the determination of the question of the dependency of a claimant for compensation, holding that the finding of fact by the deputy commissioner against the claimant upon that issue should not have been disturbed. The writ of certiorari was limited to that question, (C.C.A.) 54 F.(2d) 212; \n285 \nU.S. 533\n, 52 S.Ct. 406.

Rascoe, 12 F.(2d) 693, and other cases, this court granted a writ of certiorari. \n294 \nU.S. 705\n, 55 S.Ct. 640, 79 L.Ed. --.\n The first action, commenced July 25, is based on an alleged breach by anticipatory repudiation of an insurance policy for $5,000 issued August 7, 1928, by defendant on the life of plaintiff, payable to his wife as beneficiary and providing for monthly payments in case of disability. Plaintiff prays judgment for $33,980.1 The other, commenced November 1, is based on a similar life policy for $2,000 dated April 9, 1925, and payable to his mother. The prayer is for $11,600.2 His declarations may be construed to include demands for $70 per month during claimed expectation of life plus the face amounts of the policies, all reduced to present value. The insured seeks not payment of disability benefits as they mature according to the insurer's promises, nor the damages resulting from its failure regularly to pay installments when due. His claim, as indicated by the evidence offered, is at least for the present value of the monthly payments during his expectation of life and also for the present worth of the face value of the policy.\n The question first to confront us is whether the evidence is sufficient to warrant a finding that the company repudiated the policies.\n There is no controversy as to the facts. Except as above stated, the policies are alike. Each was issued in consideration of specified premiums payable semian \n\n[295 U.S. 632, 635]\n\u00a0\n nually in advance during the life of the insured. They provide: That whenever the insured is so disabled by bodily injury or disease that he is wholly prevented from performing any work, following any occupation, or engaging in any business for remuneration, and the company receives proof that this disability will continue for life, or that it has existed for the three months next preceding the proof, the company will pay monthly $ 10 per thousand of face value, and waive premiums; that, before making any income payment or waiving any premium, the company may demand proof of continuance of total disability (but not oftener than once a year after disability has continued for two full years), and that, upon failure to furnish such proof, no further payments will be made nor premiums waived.\n December 13, 1930, the plaintiff suffered an acute attack of appendicitis for which he submitted to surgery. March 30, 1931, not having regained his health, he claimed monthly payments for permanent and total disability. On the proof he submitted and a physical examination made in its behalf, the company allowed the claim, waived premiums, and paid him $ 70 per month-$50 under one policy and $20 under the other-from January 13. The company caused his condition quite frequently to be observed. Several times between June 13, 1931, and March 1, 1933, it concluded that he was not continuously and totally disabled. On each of these occasions it notified him that no further income payments would be made and that premiums would no longer be waived. But in every instance, upon his insistence that he continued to be disabled and after further investigation and consideration, the company changed its ruling, paid past- due benefits, resumed monthly payments, and waived premiums.\n March 1, 1933, the company wrote him stating it appeared that for some time he had not been continuously disabled within the meaning of the policies, that no fur- \n\n[295 U.S. 632, 636]\n\u00a0\n ther monthly payments would be made, and that the premiums due on and after February 7 became payable according to the terms of the contracts. Then, through his attorney, plaintiff demanded payment of the policies in full 'for the remainder of his natural expectancy, which is thirty-four years and six months from this date which under the terms of said policies will amount to $28,980,' and warned that unless the matter was adjusted within seven days plaintiff would bring suit. March 17, the company wrote the attorney explaining that information obtained as a result of its customary investigation indicated that insured had sufficiently recovered to do some remunerative work, and that, in view of the reports received, it could not consider him totally disabled; and declared that it would adhere to its decision.\n April 13, it notified plaintiff that the $5,000 policy had lapsed and urged him to apply for its reinstatement. Later, it wrote that, application for reinstatement not having been made, the value of the policy had been applied to continue the insurance in force until June 20, 1937. On June 9 it notified him that premium on the $2,000 policy was about to mature. July 8, his attorney wrote the company that, as plaintiff was totally and permanently disabled and had demanded the value of the disability benefits, it was not authorized to apply the value of the policy to purchase continued insurance, and that he did not agree to that application.\n July 12 the company notified plaintiff that it was willing to give further consideration to his claim for disability benefits and asked for a statement from his attending physician as to his condition since the early part of January, 1933. And it stated that one of its physicians would call to make a medical examination. The examination was made July 24. On the next day plaintiff commenced the first of these actions. The company received report of the examination July 28. It stated that from December \n\n[295 U.S. 632, 637]\n\u00a0\n 13, 1930, plaintiff had been prevented by disability from engaging in any occupation, that he will be permanently prevented from strenuous occupation and gave details concerning his condition. The examiner made a supplemental report to the effect that plaintiff was not confined to his bed or house, and was able to do some work, but not hard work.\n Thereupon the company reconsidered plaintiff's claim, and, August 9, concluded that he continued to be totally and permanently disabled within the meaning of the policies. It caused to be tendered to him notices of waiver of premiums and checks to cover all disability payments accruing on both policies to and including July 13, 1933. He rejected the offers on the ground that the company was indebted to him as alleged in the declaration. Tenders of the disability benefits were thereafter regularly made on the thirteenth of each month to and including February 13, 1934, and have been kept good by payments into court. It is stipulated that plaintiff was continuously totally and permanently disabled from the date of the operation until the date of the trial.\n The significance of the correspondence, the gist of which we have given, is to be ascertained having regard to the meaning of the provisions of the policies that are here involved. The insurer's promise to pay monthly benefits was conditioned on two events: The insured's disability as defined, and the specified proof. Its obligation was not an unqualified one to pay or to pay on the mere occurrence of disability, but only after proof of that fact. Similarly its agreement to continue payments once begun was conditioned upon the persistence of insured's disability, and, at the election of the insurer, proof of that fact by physical examination, but after two years not oftener than once a year. These conditions serve to define the insurer's promises but impose no obligation on the insured. By payment of the premiums he acquired the \n\n[295 U.S. 632, 638]\n\u00a0\n options and privileges specified. He did not promise or in any manner bind himself to do or refrain from doing anything. The provision that the company may require proof of continuance of disability conditions the right of the insured to have future installments, but imposes no obligation upon him. He was at liberty, without breach of contract, to refrain from making the claim or to refuse disclosure of his condition or to permit examination.\n Repudiation by one party, to be sufficient in any case to entitle the other to treat the contract as absolutely and finally broken and to recover damages as upon total breach, must at least amount to an unqualified refusal, or declaration of inability, substantially to perform according to the terms of his obligation. Roehm v. Horst, \n178 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 15 S., 20 S.Ct. 780; Smoot's Case, 15 Wall. 36, 49; Dingley v. Oler, \n117 \nU.S. 490, 503\n, 6 S.Ct. 850; Kimel v. Missouri State Life Ins. Co. (C.C.A.) 71 F.(2d) 921, 923. Mere refusal, upon mistake or misunderstanding as to matters of fact or upon an erroneous construction of the disability clause, to pay a monthly benefit when due is sufficient to constitute a breach of that provision, but it does not amount to a renunciation or repudiation of the policy. Daley v. People's Building, etc., Ass'n, 178 Mass. 13, 18, 59 N.E. 452. There is nothing to show that any refusal of the company to pay the monthly disability benefits was not made in good faith. Its position appears at all times to have been that, if plaintiff was disabled as defined in the policy, he was entitled to the monthly benefits and waiver of premiums. The fact that, with additional information and upon further consideration, it gave greater weight to his claims and decided that he was continuously disabled as defined in the policies and so entitled to the specified payments goes to show adherence to, rather than repudiation of, the contracts. The company's efforts to have the policies kept in force were inconsistent with purpose to renounce them. The evidence \n\n[295 U.S. 632, 639]\n\u00a0\n gives no support to the claim that it disregarded or intended to break its promises. We conclude that, as found by the lower courts-rightly declining to follow the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Federal Life Ins. Co. v. Rascoe, supra, 12 F. (2d) 693, 696-the company did not repudiate the policies. In view of that fact, we need not and therefore do not decide whether the doctrine of anticipatory breach is applicable to the class of cases to which this one belongs. Dingley v. Oler, ubi supra.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The record does not disclose how the amount, $33,980, was reached. Plaintiff's expectation of life was taken at 34 1\/2 years or 414 months. Payments of $50 per month would be $20,700. If the face of the policy, $5, 000, be added, the total is $25,700. But it seems that payments of $70 instead of $50 per month were taken. Then the installments without discount would be $70 X 414 or $28,980, plus $5,000 equals $33,980. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] The declaration alleges an expectation of life of 40 years. Installments of $20 per month amount to $9,600. Adding $2,000, the face amount of the policy, produces the amount claimed. \n\n\n\n\n","118":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOONEY v.

Applications to the judges of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit for allowance of an appeal to that court from the judgment of dismissal have severally been denied. In re Mooney, 72 F.(2d) 503.\n Petitioner charges that the state holds him in confinement without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. The grounds of his charge are, in substance, that the sole basis of his conviction was perjured testimony, which was knowingly used by the prosecuting authorities in order to obtain that conviction, and also that these authorities deliberately suppressed evidence which would have impeached and refuted the testimony thus given against him. He alleges that he could not be reasonable diligence have discovered prior to the denial of his motion for a new trial, and his appeal to the Supreme Court of the state, the evidence which was subsequently developed and which proved the testimony against him to have been perjured. Petitioner urges that the 'knowing use' by the statute of perjured testimony to obtain the conviction and the deliberate suppression of evidence to impeach that testimony constituted a denial of due process of law. Petitioner further contends that the state deprives him of his liberty without due process of law by its failure, in the circumstances set forth, to provide any corrective judicial process by which a conviction so obtained may be set aside.\n In support of his serious charges, petitioner submits a chronological history of the trials, appeals, and other judicial proceedings connected with his conviction, and of his applications for executive clemency. He sets forth the evidence which, as he contends, proves the perjury \n\n[294 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n of the witnesses upon whose testimony he was convicted and the knowledge on the part of the prosecuting authorities of that perjury and the suppression by those authorities of impeaching evidence at their command. He also submits what he insists are admissions by the state that the testimony offered against him was perjured and that his conviction was unjustified. In amplification of these statements, he asks leave to incorporate in his petition, by reference, the voluminous details of the various proceedings as they were presented with his petition to the District Court.\n In response to our rule to show cause why leave to file the petition should not be granted, the respondent has made return by the Attorney General of the state. With this return, he submits an appendix of exhibits setting forth the consent filed by the Attorney General with the Supreme Court of the state on July 30, 1917, that the judgment of conviction be reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial, and subsequent opinions of that court upon the cases presented to it, the statements of Governors of the state on applications for executive clemency made on behalf of this petitioner and of one Billings (who had been jointly indicted with petitioner and was separately tried and convicted), and the reports of justices of the Supreme Court of the state, and communications addressed by them, to the Governors of the state in connection with such applications.\n The return does not put in issue any of the facts alleged in the petition. The return is in nature of a demurrer. It submits that the petitioner 'has failed to raise a Federal question and that, consequently, leave to file the petition should be denied.' Reviewing decisions relating to due process, the Attorney General insists that the petitioner's argument is vitiated by the fallacy 'that the acts or omissions of a prosecuting attorney can ever, \n\n[294 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n in and by themselves, amount either to due process of law or to a denial of due process of law.' The Attorney General states that, if the acts or omissions of a prosecuting attorney 'have the effect of withholding from a defendant the notice which must be accorded him under the due process clause, or if they have the effect of preventing a defendant from presenting such evidence as he possesses in defense of the accusation against him, then such acts or omissions of the prosecuting attorney may be regarded as resulting in a denial of due process of law.' And, 'conversely,' the Attorney General contends that 'it is only where an act or omission operates so as to deprive a defendant of notice or so as to deprive him of an opportunity to present such evidence as he has, that it can be said that due process of law has been denied.'\n Without attempting at this time to deal with the question at length, we deem it sufficient for the present purpose to say that we are unable to approve this narrow view of the requirement of due process. That requirement, in safeguarding the liberty of the citizen against deprivation through the action of the state, embodies the fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions. Hebert v. Louisiana, \n272 \nU.S. 312, 316\n, 317 S., 47 S.Ct. 103, 48 A.L.R. 1102. It is a requirement that cannot be deemed to be satisfied by mere notice and hearing if a state has contrived a conviction through the pretense of a trial which in truth is but used as a means of depriving a defendant of liberty through a deliberate deception of court and jury by the presentation of testimony known to be perjured. Such a contrivance by a state to procure the conviction and imprisonment of a defendant is an inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of justice as is the obtaining of a like result by intimidation. And the action of prosecuting officers on behalf of the state, like that of adminis- \n\n[294 U.S. 103, 113]\n\u00a0\n trative officers in the execution of its laws, may constitute state action within the purview of the Fourteenth Amendment. That amendment governs any action of a state, 'whether through its legislature, through its courts, or through its executive or administrative officers.' Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, 20 S.Ct. 687, 689; Rogers v. Alabama, \n192 \nU.S. 226, 231\n, 24 S.Ct. 257; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 233\n, 234 S., 17 S.Ct. 581.\n Reasoning from the premise that the petitioner has failed to show a denial of due process in the circumstances set forth in his petition, the Attorney General urges that the state was not required to afford any corrective judicial process to remedy the alleged wrong. The argument falls with the premise. Frank v. Mangum, \n237 \nU.S. 309, 335\n, 35 S.Ct. 582; Moore v. Dempsey, \n261 \nU.S. 86, 90\n, 91 S., 43 S.Ct. 265.\n We are not satisfied, however, that the state of California has failed to provide such corrective judicial process. The prerogative writ of habeas corpus is available in that state. Constitution of California, art. 1,  5; article 6,  4. No decision of the Supreme Court of California has been brought to our attention holding that the state court is without power to issue this historic remedial process when it appears that one is deprived of his liberty without due process of law in violation of the Constitution of the United States. Upon the state courts, equally with the courts of the Union, rests the obligation to guard and enforce every right secured by that Constitution. Robb v. Connolly, \n111 \nU.S. 624, 637\n, 4 S.Ct. 544. In view of the dominant requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment, we are not at liberty to assume that the state has denied to its court jurisdiction to redress the prohibited wrong upon a proper showing and in an appropriate proceeding for that purpose.\n The decisions of the Supreme Court of California in relation to petitioner's conviction have dealt with the ques- \n\n[294 U.S. 103, 114]\n\u00a0\n tions presented to that court within the limitations of particular appellate procedure. When there was submitted to that court the consent of the Attorney General to the reversal of the judgment against petitioner and to the granting of a new trial, the court pointed out that no motion had been made by the defendant and that his appeal was awaiting hearing. People v. Mooney, 175 Cal. 666, 166 P. 999. When, again in advance of the hearing of his appeal, the defendant made his motion solely upon the ground of the Attorney General's consent, the court held that its jurisdiction on appeal was limited to a determination whether there had been any error of law in the proceedings of the trial court and that the court was confined to the record sent to it by the court below. People v. Mooney, 176 Cal. 105, 167 P. 696. On the appeal, the court thus dealing with the record before it found that the verdict was supported by the testimony presented and that no ground appeared for reversal. People v. Mooney, 177 Cal. 642, 171 P. 690. When, later, the defendant moved to set aside the judgment, and sought a certificate of probable cause on his appeal from an order denying his motion, the court held that the general averments against the fairness of the trial were insufficient, but the court did not place its denial of the application entirely upon that ground. The court concluded that the proceeding by way of motion to set aside the judgment after it had become final and a motion for a new trial had been denied, and the time therefor had expired, was 'in the nature of an application for a writ coram nobis, at common law.' The court thought that such a writ did not lie to correct any error in the judgment of the court nor to contradict or put in issue any fact directly passed upon and affirmed by the judgment itself. The court, adopting the opinion of the court below, concluded that the judgment could not be set aside because it was predicated upon \n\n[294 U.S. 103, 115]\n\u00a0\n perjured testimony or because material evidence was concealed or suppressed, that the fraud in such a case was not such fraud as was 'extrinsic to the record,' and that it was only in cases of extrinsic fraud that the relief sought could be had. It was apparently in relation to such an application that the court said that the injured party was 'without remedy.' People v. Mooney, 178 Cal. 525, 174 P. 325, 326. And it was with respect to that proceeding that the writ of certiorari was denied by this Court. Mooney v. State of California, \n248 \nU.S. 579\n, 39 S.Ct. 21. The subsequent communications from the justices of the Supreme Court in connection with applications for executive clemency were of an advisory character and were not judicial judgments under the requirements of the Constitution of the United States.\n We do not find that petitioner has applied to the state court for a writ of habeas corpus upon the grounds stated in his petition here. That corrective judicial process has not been invoked, and it is not shown to be unavailable. Despite the many proceedings taken on behalf of the petitioner, an application for the prerogative writ now asserted to be peculiarly suited to the circumstances disclosed by his petition has not been made to the state court. Orderly procedure, governed by principles we have repeatedly announced, requires that before this Court is asked to issue a writ of habeas corpus, in the case of a person held under a state commitment, recourse should be had to whatever judicial remedy afforded by the state may still remain open.

Benson, of Washington, D.C., for petitioners.\n The Attorney General and James W. Morris, Asst. Atty. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioners, the trustees of an express trust, contest income taxes for the years 1924 to 1926, inclusive, upon the ground that the trust has been illegally treated as an 'association.' The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals which sustained the ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 74 \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 347]\n\u00a0\n F.(2d) 803. We granted certiorari because of a conflict of decisions as to the distinction between an 'association' and a 'pure trust,' the decisions being described in one of the cases as 'seemingly in a hopeless state of confusion.' Coleman-Gilbert Associates v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue ( C.C.A.) 76 F.(2d) 191, 193. 1\n The facts were stipulated. In the year 1921 petitioners made a declaration of trust of real estate in Los Angeles. They were to be designated in 'their collective capacity' as 'Western Avenue Golf Club.' The trustees were author zed to add to their number and to choose their successors; to purchase, encumber, sell, lease, and operate the 'described or other lands'; to construct and operate golf courses, club houses, etc.; to receive the rents, profits, and income; to make loans and investments; to make regulations; and generally to manage the trust estate as if the trustees were its absolute owners. The trustees were declared to be without power to bind the beneficiaries personally by 'any act, neglect or default,' and the beneficiaries and all persons dealing with the trustees were required to look for payment or indemnity to the trust property. The beneficial interests were to be evidenced solely by transferable certificates for shares which were divided into 2,000 preferred shares of the par value of $100 each, and 2,000 common shares of no par value, and the rights of the respective shareholders in the surplus, profits, and capital assets were defined. 'Share ledgers' showing the names and addresses of shareholders were to be kept.\n The trustees might convene the shareholders in meeting for the purpose of making reports or considering recommendations, but the votes of the shareholders were to be advisory only. The death of a trustee or of a beneficiary was not to end the trust, which was to continue \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 348]\n\u00a0\n for twenty-five years unless sooner terminated by the trustees.\n During the years 1921 and 1922, the trustees sold beneficial interests and paid commissions on the sales. About 42 acres (of the 155 acres described by the declaration of trust) were plotted into lots which were sold during the years 1921 to 1923, most of the sales being on the installment basis. On the remaining property a golf course and club house were constructed, and in 1923 this property with the improvements was conveyed to Western Avenue Golf Club, Inc., a California corporation, in exchange for its stock. Under a lease from the corporation petitioners continued the operation of the golf course until January 12, 1924. After that date petitioners' activities were confined to collections of installments of principal and interest on contracts of purchase, the receipt of interest on bank balances and of fees on assignments by holders of purchase contracts, the execution of conveyances to purchasers, the receipt of dividends from the incorporated club, and the distribution of moneys to the holders of beneficial interests. On December 31, 1923, the total number of outstanding beneficial interests was 3,016 held by 920 persons; by December 31, 1926, the number of interests had been gradually decreased to 2,172, held by 275 persons. The holdings by the trustees ranged approximately from 16 to 29 per cent.\n Petitioners contend that they are trustees 'of property held in trust,' within section 219 of the Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926,2 and are taxable accordingly and not as an 'association.' They urge that, to constitute an association, the applicable test requires 'a quasi corporate organization in which the beneficiaries, whether or not certificate holders, have some voice in the management and some control over the trustees and have an opportunity \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 349]\n\u00a0\n to exercise such control through the right to vote at meetings'; and that, in any event, the activities in which petitioners were engaged, during the tax years under consideration, did not constitute 'a carrying on of business' within the rule applied by this court.\n The government insists that the distinction between associations and the trusts taxed under section 219 is between 'business trusts on the one side' and other trusts 'which are engaged merely in collecting the income and conserving the property against the day when it is to be distributed to the beneficiaries'; that Congress intended that all 'business trusts' should be taxed as associations.\n\n 1. \nThe Revenue Acts of 1924 and 1926 provided:\n'The term 'corporation' includes associations, joint-stock companies, and insuranc companies.' Revenue Act 1924,  2(a)(2); Revenue Act 1926,  2(a) (2).3\n\n A similar definition is found in the earlier Revenue Acts of 1917 ( section 200), 1918 (section 1), and 1921 (section 2(2),4 and also in the later Revenue Acts of 1928 (section 701(a)(2), 1932 (section 1111(a)(2), and 1934 (section 801(a)(2).5\n The Corporation Tax Act of 19096 which imposed an excise tax upon the privilege of doing business in a corporate capacity, embraced associations having a capital stock represented by shares and 'organized under the laws of the United States or of any state or territory.' Flint v. Stone Tracy Co., \n220 \nU.S. 107, 108\n, 144 S., 31 S.Ct. 342, 346, Ann.Cas. 1912B, 1312; Fliot v. Freeman, \n220 \nU.S. 178, 186\n, 31 S.Ct. 360. The Income Tax Act of 1913,7 taxed the net income of 'every corporation, joint-stock company or association, and every insurance company, organized in the United States, no matter how cre- \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 350]\n\u00a0\n ated or organized, not including partnership.' The case of Crocker v. Malley, \n249 \nU.S. 223\n, 39 S.Ct. 270, 271, 2 A.L.R. 1601, arose under the latter act. The Court found that the declaration of trust in that case, relating to mill property, was on its face 'an ordinarily real estate trust of the kind familiar in Massachusetts,' and that the function of the trustees was 'not to manage the mills but simply to collect the rents and income of such property as may be in their hands, with a large discretion in the application of it, but with a recognition that the receipt holders are entitled to it subject to the exercise of the powers confided to the trustees.' The Court thought that, if it were assumed that the words 'no matter how created or organized' applied to 'association,' still it would be 'a wide departure from normal usage' to call the beneficiaries a joint-stock association when they were not partners and had 'no joint action or interest and no control over the fund.' Nor could the trustees 'by themselves' be treated as a joint-stock association within the meaning of the act 'unless all trustees with discretionary powers are such'. \n249 U.S. 223\n, at pages 232-234, 39 S.Ct. 270, 272, 2 A.L.R. 1601\n\n\n The decision in Crocker v. Malley was rendered in March, 1919, and the Treasury Department thereupon assumed that the degree of control exercised by the beneficiaries over the management of the trust was determinative of the question whether the trust constituted an 'association.' See statement of the rulings of the Bureau by the Board of Tax Appeals in Woodrow Lee Trust v. Commissioner, 17 B.T.A. 109, at pages 111, 112. It was in that view that the Regulations under the Revenue Acts of 1918 and 1921, in distinguishing an 'association' from a 'trust,' provided as follows:\n'If, however, the cestuis que trust have a voice in the conduct of the business of the trust, whether through the right periodically to elect trustees or otherwise, the trust \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 351]\n\u00a0\n is an association within the meaning of the statute.' Regulations Nos. 45, 62, Art. 1504.\n\n This ruling continued until our decision in May, 1924, in Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144\n, 44 S.Ct. 462, and furnished the test which the Board of Tax Appeals applied in its determinations for earlier years. \n8\n Accordingly, the Board in the case now before us, holding that under the trust instrument the shareholders 'had no control over the trustees or the management of the business,' determined that the trust was taxable as such, and not as an association, for the years 1921, 1922, and 1923.\n The case of Hecht v. Malley related to the excise taxes imposed upon 'associations' by the Revenue Acts of 1916 (section 407) and 1918 (section 1000(a).9 The provision of the act of 1916 retained the qualifying words of the Corporation Tax Act of 1909-'organized under the laws of the United States, or any State or Territory'-and the Court followed the construction placed upon those words in Eliot v. Freeman, supra. But the act of 1918 omitted this qualification and the excise tax as laid upon corporations applied to 'associations' under the general definition. The Court thus found the terms of the act of 1918 to be in significant contrast to the provisions of the acts of 1909 and 1916. The omission of the qualification showed the intention of Congress 'to extend the tax from one imposed solely upon organizations exercising statutory privileges, as theretofore, to include also organizations exercising the privilege of doing business as associations at the common law.' \n265 U.S. 144\n, at page 155, 44 S.Ct. 462, 466. Shorn of the restriction, the word 'association' appeared to be used in its \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 352]\n\u00a0\n ordinary meaning, and we referred to several definitions found in standard dictionaries, as, e.g., 'a body of persons united without a charter, but upon the methods and forms used by incorporated bodies for the prosecution of some common enterprise'; 'a body of persons organized, for the prosecution of some purpose, without a charter, but having the general form and mode of procedure of a corporation'; 'an organized but unchartered body analogous to but distinguished from a corporation'. \n265 U.S. 144\n, at page 157, 44 S.Ct. 462, 467. We expressed the view that the word 'association,' as used in the excise tax provision of the Revenue Act of 1918, clearly included 'Massachusetts trusts,' of the sort there involved, 'having quasi-corporate organizations under which they are engaged in carrying on business enterprises.' We were careful to say that it was then unnecessary to determine 'what other form of 'associations,' if any,' the act embraced.\n In Hecht Case, the trustees of the Hecht and Haymarket trusts relied strongly upon the decision in Crocker v. Malley as conclusively determining that those trusts could not be held to be associations, unless the trust agreements vested 'the shareholders with such control over the trustees as to constitute them more than strict trusts within the Massachusetts rule.' Reviewing the reasoning of that decision, we pointed out that it was not authority for the broad proposition advanced. We concluded that, when the nature of the trusts was considered, as the petitioners were 'not merely trustees for collecting funds and paying them over,' but were 'associated together in much the same manner as the directors in a corporation for the purpose of carrying on business enterprises,' the trusts were to be deemed associations within the meaning of the act of 1918. This was true 'independently of the large measure of control exercised by the beneficiaries.' And we rejected the view that Congress intended that organizations of that character 'should be exempt from \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 353]\n\u00a0\n the excise tax on the privilege of carrying on their business merely because such a slight measure of control may be vested in the beneficiaries that they might be deemed strict trusts within the rule established by the Massachusetts courts.'\n Following this decision, the Treasury Department amended its regulation so as to provide that the distinction between an association and a trust should no longer depend upon beneficiary control. The new provision read:\n'Operating trusts, whether or not of the Massachusetts type, in which the trustees are not restricted to the mere collection of funds and their payments to the beneficiaries, but are associated together in much the same manner as directors in a corporation for the purpose of carrying on some business enterprise, a e to be deemed associations within the meaning of the Act, regardless of the control exercised by the beneficiaries.' Regulations No. 65, Art. 1504, issued in October, 1924, under the Revenue Act of that year.\n\n This provision was amended in August, 1925, so as to read as follows:\n'If, however, the beneficiaries have positive control over the trust, whether through the right periodically to elect trustees or otherwise, an association exists within the meaning of section 2. Even in the absence of any control by the beneficiaries, where the trustees are not restricted to the mere collection of funds and their payment to the beneficiaries, but are associated together with similar or greater powers than the directors in a corporation for the purpose of carrying on some business enterprise, the trust is an association within the meaning of the statute.' T.D. 3748, IV-2 Cumulative Bulletin 7.\n\n The text of the regulations relating to associations, so far as pertinent here, promulgated under the Revenue Act of 1924, is set forth in the margin. Regulations No. 65, Arts. 1502, \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 354]\n\u00a0\n 1504, as amended. \n10\n These regulations were continued substantially unchanged under the Revenue Acts of 1926 and 1928. No. 69, Arts. 1502, 1504; No. 74, Arts. 1312, 1314. The corresponding regulations under the Act of 1932 were somewhat modified, No. 77, Art. 1314; and these were considerably expanded by the regulations issued under the Revenue Act of 1934, No. 86, Art. 801-2, 801-3.\n\n 2. \nAs the statute merely provided that the term 'corporation' should include 'associations,' without further definition, the Treasury Department was authorized to supply rules for the enforcement of the act within the \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 355]\n\u00a0\n permissible bounds of administrative construction. Nor can this authority be deemed to be so restricted that the regulations, once issued, could not later be clarified or enlarged so as to meet administrative exigencies or conform to judicial decision. Compare Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, \n287 U.S. 299\n, 303-307, 53 S.Ct. 161. We find no ground for the contention that by the enactment of the Revenue Act of 1924 the Department was limited to its previous regulations as to associatio s. And, while the case of Hecht v. Malley was concerned with the special excise tax provision of the Revenue Act of 1918, the ruling of the Court that the degree of the control by beneficiaries was not a decisive test in that relation could by similar reasoning be applied to the general income taxes laid by the revenue acts upon corporations and thus upon associations. These general income taxes covered both those taxes which in their nature were excise taxes on business, and as such could have been laid prior to the Sixteenth Amendment, and those taxes on other income which were permitted by that amendment. Stanton v. Baltic Mining Co., \n240 \nU.S. 103, 107\n, 114 S., 36 S.Ct. 278. We think that the Department did not exceed its powers in rewriting its regulation, in the light of the decision in Hecht v. Malley, so as to provide with respect to the income taxes, in general, to be paid by associations, that the extent or lack of control by the beneficiaries of a trust should not in itself determine whether there was an association within the meaning of the statute. That the revised regulation had congressional approval is persuasively evidenced by the fact that the regulation, as amended in 1925, was continued without substantial alteration until 1933, and meanwhile Congress reenacted without change the general provision as to associations in the Revenue Acts of 1926, 1928, and 1932. See Brewster v. Gage, \n280 \nU.S. 327, 337\n, 50 S.Ct. 115; McCaughn v. Hershey Chocolate Co., \n283 \nU.S. 488, 492\n, 51 S.Ct. 510; \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 356]\n\u00a0\n Murphy Oil Co. v. Burnet, supra; Helvering v. Bliss, \n293 \nU.S. 144, 151\n, 55 S.Ct. 17, 95 A.L.R. 207.\n The question is not one of the power of Congress to impose this tax upon petitioners but is simply one of statutory construction-whether Congress has imposed it. See Burk-Waggoner Oil Association v. Hopkins, \n269 \nU.S. 110, 114\n, 46 S.Ct. 48. The difficulty with the regulations as an exposition was that they themselves required explication; that they left many questions open with respect both to their application to particular enterprises and to their validity as applied. The so-called 'control test' had led to much litigation, and the change in the regulations after the decision in Hecht v. Malley caused increased uncertainty. That situation is put in a strong light by the action of Congress, in order to afford relief to taxpayers, in enacting section 704 of the Revenue Act of 1928 as a 'retroactive' provision applicable, as stated, to trust returns which had been filed for a taxable year prior to 1925 under previous regulations and rulings, and also by giving an option to a trustee, in specified circumstances, in relation to the Revenue Act of 1926 and prior acts. \n11\n While it is impossible in the nature of things to translate the statutory concept of 'association' into a particularity of detail that would fix the status of every sort of enterprise or organization which ingenuity may create, the recurring disputes emphasize the need of a further examination of the congressional intent.\n\n 3. \n'Association' implies associates. It implies the entering into a joint enterprise, and, as the applicable regulation imports, an enterprise for the transaction of business. This is not the characteristic of an ordinary trust-whether created by will, deed, or declaration-by which particular property is conveyed to a trustee or is to be held by the settlor, on specified trusts, for the benefit of \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 357]\n\u00a0\n named or described persons. Such beneficiaries do not ordinarily, and as mere cestuis que trust, plan a common effort or enter into a combination for the conduct of a business enterprise. Undoubtedly the terms of an association may make the taking or acquiring of shares or interests sufficient to constitute participation, and may leave the management, or even control of the enterprise, to designated persons. But the nature and purpose of the co-operative undertaking will differentiate i from an ordinary trust. In what are called 'business trusts' the object is not to hold and conserve particular property, with incidental powers, as in the traditional type of trusts, but to provide a medium for the conduct of a business and sharing its gains. Thus a trust may be created as a convenient method by which persons become associated for dealings in real estate, the development of tracts of land, the construction of improvements, and the purchase, management, and sale of properties; or for dealings in securities or other personal property; or for the production, or manufacture, and sale of commodities; or for commerce, or other sorts of business; where those who become beneficially interested, either by joining in the plan at the outset, or by later participation according to the terms of the arrangement, seek to share the advantages of a union of their interests in the common enterprise.\n The government contends that such an organized community of effort for the doing of business presents the essential features of an association. Petitioners stress the significance of, and the limitations said to be implied in, the provision classifying associations with corporations.\n\n 4. \nThe inclusion of associations with corporations implies resemblance; but it is resemblance and not identity. The resemblance points to features distinguishing associations from partnerships as well as from ordinary trusts. As we have seen, the classification cannot be said to require organization under a statute, or with statutory priv- \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 358]\n\u00a0\n ileges. The term embraces associations as they may exist at common law. Hecht v. Malley, supra. We have already referred to the definitions, quoted in that case, showing the ordinary meaning of the term as applicable to a body of persons united without a charter 'but upon the methods and forms used by incorporated bodies for the prosecution of some common enterprise.' These definitions, while helpful, are not to be pressed so far as to make mere formal procedure a controlling test. The provision itself negatives such a construction. Thus unincorporated jointstock companies have generally been regarded as bearing the closest resemblance to corporations. But, in the Revenue Acts, associations are mentioned separately and are not to be treated as limited to 'jointstock companies,' although belonging to the same group. While the use of corporate forms may furnish persuasive evidence of the existence of an association, the absence of particular forms, or of the usual terminology of corporations, cannot be regarded as decisive. Thus an association may not have 'directors' or 'officers,' but the 'trustees' may function 'in much the same manner as the directors in a corporation' for the purpose of carrying on the enterprise. The regulatory provisions of the trust instrument may take the place of 'by-laws.' And as there may be, under the reasoning in the Hecht Case, an absence of control by beneficiaries such as is commonly exercised by stockholders in a business corporation, it cannot be considered to be essential to the existence of an association that those beneficially interested should hold meetings or elect their representatives. Again, while the faculty of transferring the interests of members without affecting the continuity of the enterprise may be deemed to be characteristic, the test of an association is not to be found in the mere formal evidence of interests or in a particular method of transfer. \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 359]\n\u00a0\n What, then, are the salient features of a trust-when created and maintained as a medium for the carrying on of a business enterprise and sharing its gains-which may be regarded as making it analogous to a corporate organization? A corporation, as an entity, holds the title to the property embarked in the corporate undertaking. Trustees, as a continuing body with provision for succession, may afford a corresponding advantage during the existence of the trust. Corporate organization furnishes the opportunity for a centralized management through representatives of the members of the corporation. The designation of trustees, who are charged with the conduct of an enterprise, who act 'in much the same manner as directors,' may provide a similar scheme, with corresponding effectiveness. Whether the trustees are named in the trust instrument with power to select successors, so as to constitute a self- perpetuating body, or are selected by, or with the advice of, those beneficially interested in the undertaking, centralization of management analogous to that of corporate activities may be achieved. An enterprise carried on by means of a trust may be secure from termination or interruption by the death of owners of beneficial interests and in this respect their interests are distinguished from those of partners and are akin to the interests of members of a corporation. And the trust type of organization facilitates, as does corporate organization, the transfer of beneficial interests without affecting the continuity of the enterprise, and also the introduction of large numbers of participants. The trust method also permits the limitation of the personal liability of participants to the property embarked in the undertaking.\n It is no answer to say that these advantages flow from the very nature of trusts. For the question has arisen because of the use and adaptation of the trust mechanism. \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 360]\n\u00a0\n The suggestion ignores the postulate that we are considering those trusts which have the distinctive feature of being created to enable the participants to carry on a business and divide the gains which accrue from their common undertaking, trusts that thus satisfy the primary conception of association and have the attributes to which we have referred, distinguishing them from partnerships. In such a case, we think that these attributes make the trust sufficiently analogous to corporate organization to justify the conclusion that Congress intended that the income of the enterprise should be taxed in the same manner as that of corporations.\n\n 5. \nApplying these principles to the instant case, we are of the opinion that the trust constituted an association. The trust was created for the development of a tract of land through the construction and operation of golf courses, club houses, etc., and the conduct of incidental businesses, with broad powers for the purchase, operation, and sale of properties. Provision was made for the issue of shares of beneficial interests, with described rights and priorities. There were to be preferred shares of the value of $100 each and common shares of no par value. Thus those who took benecial interests became shareholders in the common undertaking to be conducted for their profit according to the terms of the arrangement. They were not the less associated in that undertaking because the arrangement vested the management and control in the trustees. And the contemplated development of the tract of land held at the outset, even if other properties were not acquired, involved what was essentially a business enterprise. The arrangement provided for centralized control, continuity, and limited liability, and the analogy to corporate organization was carried still further by the provision for the issue of transferable certificates.\n Under the trust, a considerable portion of the property was surveyed and subdivided into lots which were sold \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 361]\n\u00a0\n and, to facilitate the sales, the subdivided property was improved by the construction of streets, sidewalks, and curbs. The fact that these sales were made before the beginning of the tax years here in question, and that the remaining property was conveyed to a corporation in exchange for its stock, did not alter the character of the organization. Its character was determined by the terms of the trust instrument. It was not a liquidating trust; it was still an organization for profit, and the profits were still coming in. The powers conferred on the trustees continued and could be exercised for such activities as the instrument authorize .\n\n 6. \nPetitioners contend that the trust was not taxable as an association, by reason of the retroactive provisions of section 704(a) of the Revenue Act of 1928.12 The contention is plainly unavailing and does not require an extended discussion. Section 704(a) of the act of 1928 provides, in substance, that where a taxpayer filed a return as a trust for a taxable year prior to 1925, the taxpayer shall be taxable as a trust, and not as a corporation, if the taxpayer was considered to be so taxable either (1) under the regulations in force at the time the return was made, or (2) under a departmental ruling then applicable and in force. Prior to the time for filing petitioners' return for the year 1924, the regulations had been amended, following the decision in Hecht v. Malley, supra, so as to provide that operating trusts in which the trustees were not restricted to the mere collection of funds and their payment to beneficiaries, but were associated together in much the same manner as directors in a corporation for the purpose of carrying on a business enterprise, should be deemed to be associations, regardless of the control exercised by the beneficiaries. Treasury Regulations No. 65, Art. 1504, October, 1924. It does not appear that there \n\n[296 U.S. 344, 362]\n\u00a0\n were regulations or rulings in force, at the time of the return for the taxable year 1924, under which the trust in this instance would be taxable as a trust and not as an association.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Helvering v.

The first action (No. 659), begun in December, 1925, was for the taxes of 1920 to 1923, and the second (No. 660), brought in December, 1928, was for the taxes of 1924 to 1926. Judgments for the plaintiff were affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. 76 S.W.(2d) 417, 76 S.W.(2d) 421. In view of the contention that the state court had denied effect to a judgment of the United States District Court decreeing forfeiture of title to the United States, writs of certiorari were granted. \n294 \nU.S. 703\n, 55 S. Ct. 545, 79 L.Ed. --.\n It appeared that in 1921, in connection with a lease of the premises to a distilling company, petitioner and his wife, as owners, had filed the required consent with respect to the priority of the lien of the United States for taxes and penalties (26 U.S.C.  286, 26 USCA  286); that in September, 1923, the land had been seized by the United States Collector of Internal Revenue for forfeiture on account of violations of law in removing distilled spirits without payment of the federal tax (26 U.S.C.  306, 26 USCA  306); that, in January, 1924, the United States brought a libel for forfeiture in the United States District Court, and in September, 1928, obtained a judgment which was affirmed on appeal. Motlow v. United States (C.C.A.) 35 F.(2d) 90. Petitioner contends that the land was in custodia legis, in the federal court, when the first action in the state court was begun, and, by virtue of the judgment in the federal court, title vested in the United States as of the date of the offense upon which the judgment was based. Henderson's Distilled Spirits, 14 Wall. 44; United States v. Stowell, \n133 \nU.S. 1\n, 10 S.Ct. 244.\n But, although the judgment provided for forfeiture to the government, it contained an alternative provision, \n\n[295 U.S. 97, 99]\n\u00a0\n inserted pursuant to a stipulation of the parties, that if the owners paid to the government the sum of $20,000 within thirty days, the property should be delivered to them free of all claims. The provision was explicit that, in that event, 'the judgment of forfeiture above entered shall not be enforcible nor shall it be enforced, but the payment of Twenty Thousand ($20,000.00) Dollars shall be in full satisfaction of the aforesaid judgment and shall operate as a release of the lien of said judgment and any cause of action in favor of the Government as to said property described in said libel.' The judgment also provided that, if the owners desired to perfect an appeal, they might give bond to the government in the sum of $20,000, conditioned as specified in the stipulation, and, on approval of the bond, possession of the property should be immediately delivered to the owners 'forever released of any lien or claim of any kind whatsoever in favor of the United States Government and the aforesaid bond shall stand in lieu of and in place of said property.' The bond was given, and the District Court, in September, 1928, ordered the release of the property accordingly.\n While, under the statute in question, a judgment of forfeiture relates back to the date of the offense as proved, that result follows only from an effective judgment of condemnation. Henderson's Distilled Spirits, supra, 14 Wall. 44, page 57. In this instance, there was no such judgment, and hence title did not vest in the United States. As the title of the owners was not divested, the land remained subject to the claim for local taxes. The release 'from all claims,' for which the judgment provided, manifestly referred to claims of the United States and not to claims of the state. Nor is there merit in the contention that the state court was without jurisdiction to enforce the liens for taxes because the property was in custodia legis. The second suit (No. 660), for the taxes of 1924 to 1926, was not brought until after the property had been released by the federal court in 1928; and, while the first \n\n[295 U.S. 97, 100]\n\u00a0\n suit (No. 659) was begun in 1925, it does not appear that any proceedings beyond the filing of the petition were taken until 1929. There was no interference with the custody of the federal court. Heidritter v. Elizabeth Oil-Cloth Co., \n112 \nU.S. 294, 304\n, 305 S., 5 S.Ct. 135. Compare Shields v.

L. RY. v. WALTERS(1935)\nNo. 183\nArgued: Decided: March 4, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 405, 407]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Fitzgerald Hall, of Nashville, Tenn., for appellant.\n\n\n[294 U.S. 405, 410]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Edwin F. Hunt, of Nashville, Tenn., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit, under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act of Tennessee,1 was brought, on November 21, 1931, in the Chancery Court of Davidson county, part 1, by the Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis Railway against the state highway commissioner and the Attorney General. The purpose of the suit is to secure a determination of the constitutionality of an order entered by the commission and, as so applied, of chapter 132 of the Tennessee Public Acts of 1921, upon which the order rests. \n2\n The statute authorizes the commission whenever a state highway crosses a railroad to require the separation of grades if in its discretion 'the elimination of any such grade crossing is necessary for the protection of persons travelling on any such highway or any such railroad'; and, without conferring upon the commission any discretion as to the proportion of the cost to be borne by the railroad requires the latter to pay in every case, one-half of the total cost of the separation of grades. The order requires the railway to construct an underpass so as to separate grades where a proposed state highway will cross its main line within the limits of the little town of Lexington; and to bear one-half the cost thereof. \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 413]\n\u00a0\n The railway does not question the power of the state to build the proposed highway; nor its power to require the separation of grades; nor the appropriateness of the plan adopted for such separation; nor the reasonableness of the cost, $17,400. It does not deny that if the proposed highway is built safety of travel thereon and on the railroad will be promoted by separation of grades. It concedes that in Tennessee, as elsewhere, the rule has long been settled that, ordinarily, the state may, under its police power, impose upon a railroad the whole cost of eliminating a grade crossing, or such part thereof, as it deems appropriate. \n3\n The claim of unconstitutionality rests wholly upon the special facts here shown. The main contention is that to impose upon the railway, under these circumstances, one-half of the cost is action so arbitrary and unreasonable as to deprive it of property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The bill of complaint sets forth in detail the facts relied upon as showing that the action was arbitrary and unreasonable. The answer justifies the imposition solely as an exercise of the police power. Because many of the alle- \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 414]\n\u00a0\n gations of the bill were denied much evidence was introduced. That contained in the printed record in this Court occupies, with exhibits, 492 pages. The trial court found that, with one exception,4 the evidence fully supported every averment of fact in the bill. It held that the order and the statute as applied, is so far as they require the railway to pay one- half the cost of the underpass, are arbitrary and unreasonable; and that they are void. The decree enjoined the commissioner from attempting to enforce payment by the railway; ordered that the entire cost of the project (except for contributions by the federal government) be borne by the state highway commission; and directed the defendants to pay the costs of the cause. Upon appeal, the Supreme Court of the state reversed that decree, ordered the bill dismissed, and allowed an appeal to this Court. Nashville, C. & St. L. Ry. v. Baker, 167 Tenn. 470, 71 S.W.(2d) 678, 680. Consideration of the jurisdiction thereof was ordered postponed to the hearing on the merits. Nashville, c. & St. L. Ry. Co. v. Webster, 55 S.Ct. 90, 79 L.Ed. --.\n The Supreme Court declined to consider the Special facts relied upon as showing that the order, and the statute as applied, were arbitrary and unreasonable; and did not pass upon the question whether the evidence sustained those findings. It held that the statute was, upon its face, constitutional; that when it was passed the state had, in the exercise of its police power, authority to impose upon railroads one-half of the cost of eliminating existing or future grade crossings; and that the court could not 'any more' consider 'whether the provisions of the act in question have been rendered burdensome or unreasonable by changed economic and transportation conditions,' than it \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 415]\n\u00a0\n 'could consider changed mental attitudes to determine the constitutionality or enforceability of a statute.' A rule to the contrary  settled by the decisions of this Court. A statute valid as to one set of facts may be invalid as to another. \n5\n A statute valid when enacted may become invalid by change in the conditions to which it is applied. \n6\n The police power is subject to the constitutional limitation that it may not be exerted arbitrarily or unreasonably. \n7\n To this limitation, attention was specifically called in cases which have applied most broadly the power to impose upon railroads the cost of separation of grades.

Unless the evidence and the special facts relied upon were of such a nature that they could not conceivably establish that the action of the state in imposing \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 416]\n\u00a0\n upon the railway one-half of the cost of the underpass was arbitrary and unreasonable, the Supreme Court obviously erred in refusing to consider them. The charge of arbitrariness is based primarily upon the revolutionary changes incident to transportation wrought in recent years by the widespread introduction of motor vehicles; the assumption by the federal government of the functions of road builder; the resulting depletion of rail revenues; the change in the character, the construction, and the use of highways; the change in the occasion for elimination of grade crossings, in the purpose of such elimination, and in the chief beneficiaries thereof; and the change in the relative responsibility of the railroads and vehicles moving on the highways as elements of danger and causes of accidents. The facts specifically found, or of which the courts could take judicial notice, are these:\n\n 1. \nThe decree of the trial court recites, as a finding upon the evidence, 'that this underpass is a past of a state-wide and nation-wide plan to foster commerce by motor vehicle on the public highways, the result of which is to afford competition with railroads and that the decision to build this underpass, its location and construction, was not in any proper sense an exercise of the police power, but rather, as set forth in the bill of complaint, pursuant to a general plan of internal improvement fostered by the Congress of the United States in conjunction with the several States to make a nation-wide system of superhighways in the interest of interstate commerce by motor vehicle, much of which is in active competition with the railroads themselves'; 'that in the interest of commerce by motor vehicles on the public highways, this was a proper engineering project, properly conceived, located, designed and constructed'; but 'that this underpass did not involve an exercise of the police power any more than many other features of this project, such as elimination of curves, grades, widening the pavement, et cetera.' \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 417]\n\u00a0\n 2. The state highways of Tennessee (as distinguished from county and city roads and turnpikes) have their origin in the federal aid highway legislation. 8 The aim of that legislation is 'a connected system of roads for the whole Nation'; 'to provide complete and economical highway transport throughout the Nation'; to furnish 'a new means of transportation, no less important to the country as a whole than that offered by the railroads';9 to establish 'lines of motor traffic in interstate commerce.' \n10\n The immediate interest of the federal government is, in part, the national defense as well as the transportation of the mails. \n11\n The relief of the unemployment incident to the business depression has been the main incentive for highway construction since April 4, 1930, the period in which the highway here in question was undertaken and completed. \n12\n\u00a0\n\n To achieve its purposes, the federal government has made large contributions to the cost of the federal aid highway system. In each year, it has made to each state \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 418]\n\u00a0\n grants in money, proportioned according to various factors, to be expended in defraying up to one-half the cost of constructing therein the designated highways. \n13\n In addition, it has, through the War Department, allotted to the several states their pro rata shares of surplus war equipment and supplies valued at more than $224,000,000.14 It has at all times given to the several states the benefit of its economic and physical research; and other aid by its experts and administrators. \n15\n It has since the depression, given to the several states emergency grants to be expended in highway construction for the relief of \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 419]\n\u00a0\n unemployment. \n16\n In the fiscal years ending June 30, 1931, 1932, and 1933, during which this highway was authorized and completed, Tennessee received from the federal government, for the highway system, in cash, $11,063,325; 17 and at the close of that period practically the entire expense of building federal aid roads in the state was being borne by the federal government. \n18\n\u00a0\n\n The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the Federal Bureau of Public Roads, has determined in large measure, not only the location of the federal aid highways in the several states, but also their character and \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 420]\n\u00a0\n their incidents. Early legislation provided that: 'The Secretary of Agriculture and the State highway department of each State shall agree upon the roads to be constructed therein and the character and method of construction.' \n19\n The Act of 1921 required each state to select and submit to the Secretary, for approval as the object of future federal aid expenditures, 'a system of highways not to exceed 7 per centum of the total highway mileage of such State'; the system was to 'be divided into two classes, one of which shall be known as primary or interstate highways , ... and the other which shall connect or correlate therewith and be known as secondary or intercounty highways.' \n20\n Congress transferred to the Secretary the powers and duties in relation to highways and highway transport originally conferred upon the Council of National Defense. \n21\n The War Plans Division of the General Staff and Corps of Engineers of the War Department promptly co-operated with the Bureau of Public Roads 'in a study the purpose of which is the selection of those highways which are important from a military standpoint.' \n22\n\u00a0\n\n Upon the Secretary devolves the duty of prescribing needful rules and regulations, including such recommendations as he might deem necessary for 'insuring the safety of traffic on the highways.' \n23\n Both the federal aid legis- \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 421]\n\u00a0\n lation and the regulations adopted thereunder encourage the elimination of grade crossings. \n24\n The general principles adopted by the Bureau of Roads to be applied where possible treat 'all intersections of a railway and highway at grade' as 'a condition dangerous to traffic on the highway- which should not exist in a well designed and completed system'; treat topographic conditions as having only an 'incidental bearing'; and refuse to treat 'unobstructed view of the railway track from the highway' as constituting a safe crossing. \n25\n The federal government may pay one-half of the total cost of an underpass, even if the state is relieved by contributions of the railroad or others from paying the other half. \n26\n\u00a0\n\n\n 3. \nFederal aid highways are designed so that motor vehicles may move thereon at a speed commonly much greater than that of railroad trains. \n27\n The main purpose of grade separation therefore is now the furtherance of \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 422]\n\u00a0\n uninterrupted, rapid movement by motor vehicles. In this respect grade separation is a desirable engineering feature comparable to removal of grades and curves, to widening the highway, to strengthening and draining it, to shortening distance, to setting up guard rails, and to bridging streams. \n28\n The railroad has ceased to be the prime instrument of danger and the main cause of accidents. 29 \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 423]\n\u00a0\n It is the railroad which now requires protection from dangers incident to motor transportation. Prior to the establishment of the federal aid system, Tennessee highways were built under the direction of the county courts, and paid for out of funds raised locally by taxation or otherwise. \n30\n They served, in the main, local traffic. The long distance traffic was served almost wholly by the railroads and the water lines. Under those conditions the occasion for separation of grades was mainly the danger incident to rail operations; and the promotion of safety was then the main purpose of grade separation. Then, it was reasonable to impose upon the railroad a large part of the cost of eliminating grade crossings; and the imposition was rarely a hardship. For the need for eliminating existing crossings, and the need of new highways free from grade crossings, arose usually from the growth of the community in which the grade separation was made; this growth was mainly the result of the transportation facilities offered through the railroad; the separation of grade crossings was a normal incident of the growth of rail operations; and as the highways were then feeders of rail traffic, the community's growth and every improvement of highway facilities benefited the railroad. The effect upon the railroad of constructing federal aid highways, like that here in question, is entirely different. They are not feeders of rail traffic. They deplete the existing rail traffic and the revenues of the railroads. Separation of grades serves to intensify the motor competition and to further deplete rail traffic. The avoidance thereby made possible \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 424]\n\u00a0\n of traffic interruptions incident to crossing at grade are now of far greater importance to the highway users than it is to the railroad crossed. For the rail operations are few; those of motor vehicles very numerous.\n\n 4. \nLexington is a rural community of 1,823 inhabitants located in a sparsely settled territory. The construction of the new highway with the underpass was not designated to meet local transportation needs. It was undertaken to serve as a link in a nation-wide system of highways. \n31\n State highway No. 20, as formerly routed, passed through Lexington on Clifton street, and crossed the railroad at grade; it was adequate for the existing traffic and that to be expected. The traffic on that highway was, and is, small. The grade crossing has presented no serious interruption to traffic. The trains are infrequent. Only six trains are operated now each way in every twenty-four hours; five of these moving between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., when there is substantially no highway travel. \n32\n The grade crossing on the old route is protected by the most modern electrical device. That the crossing is not dangerous is attested by the fact that during the ten years following January 1, 1921, there were but two minor accidents; and these were settled for $50. That the present facilities are deemed locally both safe and adequate is attested by the fact that neither the city authorities, nor any one else, has suggested elimination of this grade crossing; that the grade crossing is to remain \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 425]\n\u00a0\n unchanged after the new highway is put into use; and that the Clifton street route will continue to be used for the local traffic. \n33\n\u00a0\n\n\n 5. \nThe underpass required is for a new and additional highway over which state highway No. 20 is being rerouted, which will be a part of a federal aid route between Nashville and Memphis, the best route between those two cities; and which will connect at these termini with highways extending into other states. This highway was planned by the state highway department, acting in conjunction with the Bureau of Public Roads of the federal government. It is part of the secondary or intercounty system; but because of the expected traffic, the district engineer of the Bureau of Roads, in recommending its approval, characterized it as a route of primary importance. The underpass was prescribed, not upon consideration of local safety needs, but in conformity to general plans of the federal and state highway engineers, as being a proper engineering feature in the construction of a nation-wide system of highways for high-speed motor vehicle transportation; and because it is the policy of the federal authorities to make the avoidance of grade crossings a condition of a grant in aid of construction. The requirement of the underpass, and the payment by the railway under the 1921 Tennessee act of one-half the cost of separating the grades, are results of the federal aid legislation. Final payment of federal aid on this project was conditioned upon commencement of the construction of this underpass. \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 426]\n\u00a0\n 6. The new highway, paralleling lines of the railway and intended for rapid moving motor vehicles, will, through competition for both freight and passenger traffic, seriously decrease rail traffic and deplete the railway's revenue and net earnings. Practically all vehicles moving upon it will directly or indirectly compete for traffic with the railway. \n34\n Busses will operate over the new highway in regular scheduled movements in the same way as passenger trains. Trucks, some of them 70 feet in length and many weighing with load as much as 50,000 pounds, operated by common carriers, by contract carrier, and by private concerns, will compete for the most profitable classes of freight. The competition besides reducing the volume of traffic will compel reduction of rates.\n How disastrously such competition will affect the railway's traffic and revenues is shown by its own experience since the state commenced, with the aid of the federal government, a system of highways paralleling the lines of the railway. The gross passenger revenue fell from $5,661,011. 08 in 1920 to $2,095,942.29 in 1930; and to $1,139,238 in the first nine months of 1931. The railway carried, in 1920, 4,385,630 revenue passengers; in 1930 only 680,347; and in the first nine months of 1931, only 370,445. The railway's freight traffic experienced a similar decline. Of the less than carload freight, more than two-thirds was diverted from the railroads to motortrucks. In many \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 427]\n\u00a0\n classes of carload traffic similar decreases were experienced by rail carriers. In 1921, the railroads brought into Nashville 5,689 cars of live stock; being 69.79 per cent. of the total. In 1930, they brought in only 641 cars, being 21.24 per cent. of the total. That the decrease in the railway's traffic was due mainly to increased motor competition following the construction of the new highways, appears from the fact that the decrease began while general business was active; and that, even in the years of economic depression, the railway's freight traffic was practically constant in the relatively few regions where its rail lines were not paralleled by hard surfaced highways; and that traffic increased when highways paralleling its lines were temporarily closed for reconstruction. The reduction in traffic and depletion in revenues has been particularly severe during the three years preceding 1933\n\n\n 7. While the railway, the sufferer from the construction of the new highway, is burdened with one-half the cost of the underpass, the owners of trucks and busses and others, who are beneficiaries of its construction, are immune from making any direct contribution toward the cost. It is true that one-half of the cost is by law to be borne by the highway fund of Tennessee (except in so far as it may be covered by the federal aid),35 and that the truck and bus owners and others contribute as taxpayers to that fund. But, while nearly 28 per cent. of the gross revenues of the railway is required annually to pay the state and local taxes and the cost of maintaining the roadway acquired and constructed at its own expense, the state commercial motor carriers, which are supplied by the state with the roadway on which they move, pay in \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 428]\n\u00a0\n state and local taxes not more than 7 per cent. of their gross revenues. The taxes laid upon truck and bus owners are clearly insufficient to pay their fair share even of the cost and maintenance of the highways which serve them. Motor vehicle taxes of all kinds, ad valorem, privilege, license plate, and others will not pay for one-half of the annual expenditure in Tennessee for highways. The balance is being paid in part by general property taxes, in part by borrowing, and in part by the federal government. Of the ad valorem taxes paid by the railway to the state and the political divisions thereof, about 20 per cent. is allocated directly to roads, some of which are no longer feeders to its traffic, but serve as highways for the traffic taken by its competitors. The relative pro rata tax burden laid upon common carriers by motor vehicle is alleged to be one-fourth of that laid upon the railroads. \n36\n\u00a0\n\n Second. The Supreme Court of Tennessee erred in refusing to consider whether the facts relied upon by the railway established as arbitrary and unreasonable the imposition upon it of one-half the cost of the underpass. The promotion of public convenience will not justify requiring of a railroad, any more than of others, the expenditure of money, unless it can be shown that a duty to pro- \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 429]\n\u00a0\n vide the particular convenience rests upon it. Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, \n164 \nU.S. 403\n, 17 S.Ct. 130; Missouri Pacific Ry. Co. v. Nebraska, \n217 \nU.S. 196\n, 30 S.Ct. 461, 18 Ann.Cas. 989; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n238 \nU.S. 340\n, 35 S.Ct. 753; Great Northern Ry. Co. v. Cahill, \n253 \nU.S. 71\n, 40 S.Ct. 457, 10 A.L.R. 1335. These were the authorities relied upon by this Court in Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Ry. Co. v. Holmberg, \n282 \nU.S. 162, 167\n, 51 S.Ct. 56, where it held that to require a railroad to provide, at its own expense, an underpass, not primarily as a safety measure, but for private convenience, was a denial of due process.\n It is true that the police power embraces regulations designed to promote public convenience or the general welfare, and not merely those in the interest of public health, safety, and morals. Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. Illinois ex rel. Drainage Commissioners, \n200 \nU.S. 561, 592\n, 26 S.Ct. 341, 4 Ann.Cas. 1175. And it was stipulated that: 'In the light of modern motor vehicular traffic anything which slows up that traffic is an inconvenience. In other words, eliminating a grade crossing, as in the case at bar, facilitates the speed of motor vehicular traffic, in accordance with public demands.' But when particular individuals are singled out to bear the cost of advancing the public convenience, that imposition must bear some reasonable relation to the evils to be eradicated or the advantages to be secured. Compare Hadacheck v. Sebastian, \n239 \nU.S. 394\n, 36 S.C. 143, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 927; Miller v. Schoene, \n276 \nU.S. 272\n, 48 S.Ct. 246.37 While moneys raised by general taxation may constitutionally be applied to purposes from which the in- \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 430]\n\u00a0\n dividual taxed may receive no benefit, and indeed, suffer serious detriment; St. Louis & Southwestern Ry. Co. v. Nattin, \n277 \nU.S. 157, 159\n, 48 S.Ct. 438; Memphis & Charleston R. Co. v. Pace, \n282 \nU.S. 241, 246\n, 51 S.Ct. 108, 72 A.L.R. 1096; so-called assessments for public improvements laid upon particular property owners are ordinarily constitutional only if based on benefits received by them. Myles Salt Co. v. Board of Com'rs of Iberia & St. Mary Drainage District, \n239 \nU.S. 478\n, 36 S.Ct. 204; Gast Realty & Inv. Co. v. Schneider Granite Co., \n240 \nU.S. 55\n, 36 S.Ct. 400; Kansas City So. R. Co. v. Road Imp. Dist. No. 6, \n256 \nU.S. 658\n, 41 S.Ct. 604.\n It is also true that state action imposing upon a railroad the cost of eliminating a dangerous grade crossing of an existing street may be valid, although it appears that the improvement benefits commercial highway users who make no contribution toward its cost; Chicago, Burlington & Quincy R. Co. v. Nebraska, \n170 \nU.S. 57, 75\n, 18 S.Ct. 513; Missouri Pacific Railway Co. v. Omaha, \n235 \nU.S. 121\n, 35 S.Ct. 82; that a railroad has no constitutional immunity from having to contribute to the cost of safeguarding a crossing with another railway line, merely because the first railroad was built before the crossing was made; Detroit, Fort Wayne & Belle Isle Ry. v. Osborn, \n189 \nU.S. 383\n, 23 S.Ct. 540; Northern Pacific Ry. Co. v. Puget Sound & Willipa Harbor Ry. Co., \n250 \nU.S. 332\n, 39 S.Ct. 474; 38 and that the state may, under some circumstances, impose upon a railroad the cost of the grade separation for a new highway. But in every case in which this Court has sustained the imposition, the new highway was an incident of the growth or development of the municipality in which it was located. Northern Pacific Ry. v. Minnesota ex rel. Duluth, \n208 \nU.S. 583, 592\n, 28 S. Ct. 341; Cincinnati, Indianapolis & Western Ry. Co. v. Connersville, \n218 \nU.S. 336\n, 31 S.Ct. 93, 20 Ann.Cas. 1206; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minne- \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 431]\n\u00a0\n apolis, \n232 \nU.S. 430\n, 34 S.Ct. 400; Erie R. Co. v. Board of Public Utility Commissioners, \n254 \nU.S. 394, 409\n, 41 S.Ct. 169. Compare Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Goldsboro, \n232 \nU.S. 548, 554\n, 34 S.Ct. 364. And in every such case the municipality apparently bore the cost of constructing the new highway for which grade separation was required. \n39\n\u00a0\n\n Here were adduced, as tending to show that it was arbitrary and unreasonable to impose upon the railway one-half the cost of this underpass, not only the revolution wrought by motor vehicle transportation and the creation and purposes of the federal aid highway system; but also the local conditions at Lexington; the character of the place where the underpass was ordered built; the extent of the railroad operations there; the character of the existing highway facilities, and of their use at that point; the location of the proposed highway; the occasion for its construction; the use contemplated; the reason why the underpass was ordered; the depletion of the railway's revenues resulting from the construction of federal aided highways, particularly in recent years; the necessary effect of this new highway upon its rail traffic and revenues; and the burden of taxation already borne by the railway as compared with that of the owners of the motor vehicles who will use the new highway. No case involving like conditions has been found in any of the lower federal courts; nor, excepting the case here under review, has any such been found among the decisions of the highest courts of any state. \n40\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 405, 432]\n\u00a0\n The Supreme Court of Tennessee did not consider whether, in view of the facts relied upon, it was arbitrary and unreasonable to impose upon the railway one-half the cost of the underpass. It assumed that the state action was valid because it found that the action was taken 'to promote the safety of persons traveling the highways at grade crossings as well as to promote the safety of persons traveling the railroads at such crossings by eliminating dangerous grade crossings'; and added: 'Admitting the insistence of complainant that the primary object of highway construction and the object of Federal contribution to highways is to invite and stimulate interstate traffic or travel upon the highways, it does not follow that the State roads are not primarily designed to serve the people of the State.'\n Third. We have no occasion to consider now whether the facts presented by the railway were of such persuasiveness as to have required the state court to hold \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 433]\n\u00a0\n that the statute and order complained of are arbitrary and unreasonable. That determination should, in the first instance, be made by the Supreme Court of the state. Compare Sioux City Bridge Co. v. Dakota County, \n260 \nU.S. 441, 447\n, 43 S.Ct. 190, 28 A.L.R. 979; Chastleton Corp. v. Sinclair, \n264 \nU.S. 543, 548\n, 549 S., 44 S.Ct. 405; Twist v. Prairie Oil & Gas Co., \n274 \nU.S. 684, 692\n, 47 S.Ct. 755; Grant v. A. B. Leach & Co., \n280 \nU.S. 351, 363\n, 50 S.Ct. 107. 41 Moreover, since that court held the facts relied upon to be without legal significance, it did not inquire whether the findings were adequately supported by the evidence introduced in the trial court. The correctness of some of the findings is controverted by the state. Other facts of importance bearing upon the issue may possibly be deducible from the evidence, or be within the judicial knowledge of that court. When the scope of the police power is in question the special knowledge of local conditions possessed by the state tribunals may be of great weight. Compare Welch v. Swasey, \n214 \nU.S. 91, 105\n, 106 S., 29 S.Ct. 567; Laurel Hill Cemetery v. City and County of San Francisco, \n216 \nU.S. 358, 365\n, 30 S.Ct. 301.\n We have also no occasion to consider whether the railway should bear a proportion of the cost of the underpass less than one-half. The propriety of a lesser charge was not, and could not have been, considered by the commission; and it was not considered by either of the lower courts. It was conceded by counsel for the state that the only questions now reviewable are the validity of the statute which compelled the state highway commission to impose upon the railway one-half of the cost; and the \n\n[294 U.S. 405, 434]\n\u00a0\n validity of the order made thereunder. Compare Village of Norwood v. Baker, \n172 U.S. 269\n, 290-294, 19 S.Ct. 187; Schneider Granite Co. v. Gast Realty & Inv. Co., \n245 \nU.S. 288\n, 38 S.Ct. 125; Thomas v. Kansas City Southern R. Co., \n261 \nU.S. 481\n, 43 S.Ct. 440; Road Imp. Dist. No. 1 v. Missouri Pacific Railroad Co., \n274 \nU.S. 188\n, 47 S. Ct. 563; Rowley v. Chicago & Northwestern Ry. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 102, 112\n, 55 S.Ct. 55.\n Nor is it necessary to consider the contentions of the railway that the state action here challenged, taken in conjunction with the burdens of taxation and systems of regulation to which the railroads and their competitors are subject, amounts to a denial of equal protection of the laws; and that it discriminates against, and imposes a burden upon, interstate commerce.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is reversed, and the cause is remanded to it for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE and Mr. Justice CARDOZO are of the opinion that there is nothing in the evidence or special facts relied on by the appellant to sustain a finding of arbitrary action by the state of Tennessee or its official representatives; that on the contrary the separation of grades is conceded to be necessary to give protection to travelers against perils created by the railroad; that a decision correct in result may not properly be reversed because the reasoning of the opinion is inadequate or erroneous; and that upon the facts stated in the record as well as upon any others within the range of judicial notice the appellant has failed to sustain the burden of establishing a violation of its constitutional immunities, and the decree should be affirmed.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Pub.

Pub. Acts Tenn. 1905, c. 173. By Pub. Acts 1925, c. 132, the maximum was increased to 30 miles. By Pub. Acts 1931, c. 82, all restrictions on speed were eliminated. The speed of motor vehicles is now often more than 75 miles. Compare note (1933) 46 Harv. L. Rev. 838.\n Prior to 1931, vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings were ordinarily required to come to a full stop at some point not less than 10 nor more than 50 feet from the railroad tracks. Pub. Acts Tenn. 1917, c. 36. By Pub. Acts 1931, c. 82, vehicles are not required to slow up or stop on approaching railroad grade crossings unless there is a positive signal of the immediate approach of a train or cut of cars, or when the state highway department designates a particular crossing as dangerous. Neither the existing nor the proposed crossing at Lexington has been so designated. Compare Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Goodman, \n275 \nU.S. 66\n, 48 S.Ct. 24, 56 A.L.R. 645; Pokora v. Wabash Railway Co., \n292 \nU.S. 98\n, 54 S.Ct. 580, 91 A.L.R. 1049. \n\n[\nFootnote 28\n] Compare Report of Chief of Bureau of Public Roads (1929) p. 10: 'On all roads and especially the important routes included in the Federal- aid system, solution of the problems raised by the increased traffic is not provided merely by building of higher types of surfaces. A general widening of the surfaces is also required, and in view of the greater speeds now customary and legally permissible, the easing and superelevation of curves, the cutting away of banks which obscure vision, and other improvements in detail which contribute to safety. The elimination of dangerous grade crossings is an expensive but urgently required improvement and on densely travelled roads it is already desirable to separate the grades of intersecting highways.' See, too, Fisher, Connecticut's Regulation of Grade Crossing Elimination, Journal of Land & Public Utility Economics (1931) 367, 385. \n[\nFootnote 29\n] Accidents caused by motor vehicles running into trains amounted in 1928 to 22 per cent. of the total of grade crossing accidents; in 1929 to 24 per cent.; in 1930 to 26.5 per cent.; in 1931, to 28.6 per cent.; in 1932, to 30.6 per cent.; and in 1933, to 31.3 per cent. Interstate Commerce Commission Accident Bulletins, Nos. 97-102, Table 78. Of the fatalities in automobile accidents in the United States during 1934, 3.3 per cent. resulted from collision with railroad trains; of the persons injured, only one-half of 1 per cent. (.5 per cent.) were injured in such collisions. See pamphlet entitled 'Thou Shalt Not Kill,' p. 5, issued by the Travelers' Insurance Co., February, 1935. \n\n[\nFootnote 30\n] Report of the Commissioner, Tenn. Dept. of Highways and Public Works (1926) p. 13. In 1915 there were 19,668 automobiles in Tennessee; in 1930, 368,259. \n\n[\nFootnote 31\n] The old highway No. 20, from Perryville, on the Tennessee river, to Lexington, is a winding gravel road which passes through several towns and crosses the railway eight times at grade. The new route is a comparatively straight, paved road, crossing the river a short distance above Perryville, avoiding some of the towns served by the old road, and crossing the railway only at the Lexington underpass. \n[\nFootnote 32\n] At the beginning of the suit, the railway was operating seven trains every twenty-four hours. \n\n[\nFootnote 33\n] On February 16, 1933, while this suit was still in progress in the trial court, the new route No. 20, between Perryville and Lexington, was opened to traffic, although a part of the highway No. 100, connecting route 20 with Nashville, was not yet paved. A witness for the railroad testified that traffic counts, taken on May 2 and 3, 1933, at the old Clifton street crossing and at the new underpass, which is on the outskirts of the town, indicated that the underpass was then diverting only 20 per cent. of the traffic from the grade crossing. \n\n[\nFootnote 34\n] The report of the District Engineer of the Bureau of Public Roads states: 'When the Nashville to Linden connection is completed and the balance of this route to Jackson paved, it is expected that a large percentage of the traffic now using State Route No. 1, between Nashville and Jackson, will be diverted to this route, and it is confidently expected that several thousand vehicles will be using the route in the near future.' The railway introduced in evidence traffic counts on route 1, showing the weekday foreign traffic amounting to 13 per cent. and 23 per cent. of the total motor vehicle traffic; and truck and bus traffic amounting to 16 per cent. and 19 per cent. of the total. \n\n[\nFootnote 35\n] The acting chief of the Bureau of Public Roads stated, in reply to a letter of the railway's counsel, that he knew of no reason why the federal government would not, upon proper request, pay one-half of the cost of the underpass if it conformed to the Bureau's requirements. \n\n[\nFootnote 36\n] The principal taxes paid by motor vehicle owners in Tennessee are the registration fees and gasoline taxes, the proceeds of which are used mainly for highway purposes. See Reports of State Highway Commissioner ( 1932) pp. 27, 32-33, 241, 285; (1934) pp. 22, 23, 199, 221. Besides these, the state levies a mileage tax upon commercial vehicles. Mileage taxes collected from intrastate operators go into the general state funds; those collected from interstate operators, into the highway fund. In 1932, it was testified, this tax yielded a gross revenue of approximately $100,000; and a net revenue of $40,000 for the general fund, and $18,000 for the highway fund. The ad valorem taxes paid by common carrier motor vehicles are negligible. In 44 of the richest counties, they aggregated in 1928, $1, 371.97; in 1929, $1,714.01; in 1930, $1,185.04. \n\n[\nFootnote 37\n] Early cases establishing the rule that the entire cost of a grade separation may be imposed upon the railroad perhaps reflect the attitude that 'the business of railways is specially dangerous,' Thorpe v. Rutland & Burlington R. Co., 27 Vt. 140, 150, 62 Am.Dec. 625; and that 'crossing highways and running locomotives, were they not authorized by law, would be nuisances.'

Stern, all of New York City, on the brief), for petitioner.\n Mr. Thomas E. Knight, Jr., of Montgomery, Ala., for the State of Alabama. \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 588]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, Clarence Norris, is one of nine negro boys who were indicted in March, 1931, in Jackson county, Ala., for the crime of rape. On being brought to trial in that county, eight were convicted. The Supreme Court of Alabama reversed the conviction of one of these and affirmed that of seven, including Norris. This Court reversed the judgments of conviction upon the ground that the defendants had been denied due process of law in that the trial court had failed in the light of the circumstances disclosed, and of the inability of the defendants at that time to obtain counsel, to make an effective appointment of counsel to aid them in preparing and presenting their defense. Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, 53 S.Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527.\n After the remand, a motion for change of venue was granted and the cases were transferred to Morgan county. Norris was brought to trial in November, 1933. At the outset, a motion was made on his behalf to quash the indictment upon the ground of the exclusion of negroes from juries in Jackson county where the indictment was found. A motion was also made to quash the trial venire in Morgan county upon the ground of the exclusion of negroes from juries in that county. In relation to each county, the charge was of long-continued, systematic, and arbitrary exclusion of qualified negro citizens from service on juries, solely because of their race and color, in violation of the Constitution of the United States. The state joined issue on this charge and after hearing the evidence, which we shall presently review, the trial judge denied both motions, and exception was taken. The trial then proceeded and resulted in the conviction of Norris who was sentenced to death. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the state considered and decided the federal question \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 589]\n\u00a0\n which Norris had raised and affirmed the judgment. 156 So. 556. We granted a writ of certiorari. \n293 \nU.S. 552\n, 55 S.Ct. 345, 79 L.Ed. --.\n First. There is no controversy as to the constitutional principle involved. That principle, long since declared, was not challenged, but was expressly recognized, by the Supreme Court of the state. Summing up precisely the effect of earlier decisions, this Court thus stated the principle in Carter v. Texas, \n177 \nU.S. 442, 447\n, 20 S.Ct. 687, in relation to exclusion from service on grand juries: 'Whenever by any action of a state, whether through its Legislature, through its courts, or through its executive or administrative officers, all persons of the African race are excluded, solely because of their race or color, from serving as grand jurors in the criminal prosecution of a person of the African race, the equal protection of the laws is denied to him, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States. Strauder v. West Virginia, \n100 U.S. 303\n; Neal v. Delalware, \n103 \nU.S. 370, 397\n, 574 S.; Gibson v. Mississippi, \n162 \nU.S. 565\n, 16 S.Ct. 904.' This statement was repeated in the same terms in Rogers v. Alabama, \n192 \nU.S. 226, 231\n, 24 S.Ct. 257, and again in Martin v. Texas, \n200 \nU.S. 316, 319\n, 26 S.Ct. 338. The principle is equally applicable to a similar exclusion of negroes from service on petit juries. Strauder v. West Virginia, supra; Martin v. Texas, supra. And although the state statute defining the qualifications of jurors may be fair on its face, the constitutional provision affords protection against action of the state through its administrative officers in effecting the prohibited discrimination. Neal v. Delaware, supra; Carter v. Texas, supra. Compare Virginia v. Rives, \n100 \nU.S. 313, 322\n, 323 S.; In re Wood, \n140 \nU.S. 278, 285\n, 11 S.Ct. 738; Thomas v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 278, 282\n, 283 S., 29 S.Ct. 393.\n The question is of the application of this established principle to the facts disclosed by the record. That the question is one of fact does not relieve us of the duty to \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 590]\n\u00a0\n determine whether in truth a federal right has been denied. When a federal right has been specially set up and claimed in a state court, it is our province to inquire not merely whether it was denied in express terms but also whether it was denied in substance and effect. If this requires an examination of evidence, that examination must be made. Otherwise, review by this Court would fail of its purpose in safeguarding constitutional rights. Thus, whenever a conclusion of law of a state court as to a federal right and findings of fact are so intermingled that the latter control the former, it is incumbent upon us to analyze the facts in order that the appropriate enforcement of the federal right may be assured.

In 1930, the total population of Jackson county, where the indictment was found, was 36,881, of whom 2,688 were negroes. The male population over twenty- one years of age numbered 8,801, and of these 666 were negroes.\n The qualifications of jurors were thus prescribed by the state statute (Alabama Code 1923,  8603): 'The jury commission shall place on the jury roll and in the jury box the names of all male citizens of the county who are generally reputed to be honest and intelligent men, and are esteemed in the community for their integrity, good character and sound judgment, but no person must be selected who is under twenty-one or over sixty-five years of age, or, who is an habitual drunkard, or who, being afflicted with a permanent disease or physical weakness is unfit to discharge the duties of a juror, or who cannot \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 591]\n\u00a0\n read English, or who has ever been convicted of any offense involving moral turpitude. If a person cannot read English and has all the other qualifications prescribed herein and is a freeholder or householder, his name may be placed on the jury roll and in the jury box.' See Gen. Acts Alabama 1931, No. 47, p. 59,  14.\n Defendant adduced evidence to support the charge of unconstitutional discrimination in the actual administration of the statute in Jackson county. The testimony, as the state court said, tended to show that 'in a long number of years no negro had been called for jury service in that county.' It appeared that no negro had served on any grand or petit jury in that county within the memory of witnesses who had lived there all their lives. Testimony to that effect was given by men whose ages ran from fifty to seventy-six years. Their testimony was uncontradicted. It was supported by the testimony of officials. The clerk of the jury commission and the clerk of the circuit court had never known of a negro serving on a grand jury in Jackson county. The court reporter, who had not missed a session in that county in twenty-four years, and two jury commissioners testified to the same effect. One of the latter, who was a member of the commission which made up the jury roll for the grand jury which found the indictment, testified that he had 'never known of a single instance where any negro sat on any grand or petit jury in the entire history of that county.'\n That testimony in itself made out a prima facie case of the denial of the equal protection which the Constitution guarantees. See Neal v. Delaware, supra. The case thus made was supplemented by direct testimony that specified negroes, thirty or more in number, were qualified for jury service. Among these were negroes who were members of school boards, or trustees, of colored schools, and property owners and householders. It also appeared that \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 592]\n\u00a0\n negroes from that county had been called for jury service in the federal court. Several of those who were thus described as qualified were witnesses. While there was testimony which cast doubt upon the qualifications of some of the negroes who had been named, and there was also general testimony by the editor of a local newspaper who gave his opinion as to the lack of 'sound judgment' of the 'good negroes' in Jackson county, we think that the definite testimony as to the actual qualifications of individual negroes, which was not met by any testimony equally direct, showed that there were negroes in Jackson county qualified for jury service.\n The question arose whether names of negroes were in fact on the jury roll. The books containing the jury roll for Jackson county for the year 1930-31 were produced. They were produced from the custody of a member of the jury commission which, in 1931, had succeeded the commission which had made up the jury roll from which the grand jury in question had been drawn. On the pages of this roll appeared the names of six negroes. They were entered, respectively, at the end of the precinct lists which were alphabetically arranged. The genuineness of these entries was disputed. It appeared that after the jury roll in question had been made up, and after the new jury commission had taken office, one of the new commissioners directed the new clerk to draw lines after the names which had been placed on the roll by the preceding commission. These lines, on the pages under consideration, were red lines, and the clerk of the old commission testified that they were not put in by him. The entries made by the new clerk, for the new jury roll, were below these lines.\n The names of the six negroes were in each instance written immediately above the red lines. An expert of long experience testified that these names were superim- \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 593]\n\u00a0\n posed upon the red lines, that is, that they were written after the lines had been drawn. The expert was not cross-examined and no testimony was introduced to contradict him. \n1\n In denying the motion to quash, the trial judge expressed the view that he would not 'be authorized to presume that somebody had committed a crime' or to presume that the jury board 'had been unfaithful to their duties and allowed the books to be tampered with.' His conclusion was that names of negroes were on the jury roll.\n We think that the evidence did not justify that conclusion. The Supreme Court of the state did not sustain it. That court observed that the charge that the names of negroes were fraudulently placed on the roll did not involve any member of the jury board, and that the charge 'was, by implication at least, laid at the door of the clerk of the board.' The court, reaching its decision irrespective of that question, treated that phase of the matter as 'wholly immaterial' and hence passed it by 'without any expression of opinion thereon.'\n The state court rested its decision upon the ground that even if it were assumed that there was no name of a negro on the jury roll, it was not established that race or color caused the omission. The court pointed out that the statute fixed a high standard of qualifications for jurors ( Green v. State, 73 Ala. 26; State v. Curtis, 210 Ala. 1, 97 So. 291) and that the jury commission was vested with a wide discretion. The court adverted to the fact that more white citizens possessing age qualifications had been omitted from the jury roll than the entire negro population of the county, and regarded the testimony as being to the effect that 'the matter of race, color, politics, religion or fraternal affiliations' had not been discussed by \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 594]\n\u00a0\n the commission and had not entered into their consideration, and that no one had been excluded because of race or color.\n The testimony showed the practice of the jury commission. One of the commissioners who made up the jury roll in question, and the clerk of that commission, testified as to the manner of its preparation. The other two commissioners of that period did not testify. It was shown that the clerk, under the direction of the commissioners, made up a preliminary list which was based on the registration list of voters, the polling list and the tax list, and apparently also upon the telephone directory. The clerk testified that he made up a list of all male citizens between the ages of twenty-one and sixty-five years without regard to their status or qualifications. The commissioner testified that the designation 'col.' was placed after the names of those who were colored. In preparing the final jury roll, the preliminary list was checked off as to qualified jurors with the aid of men whom the commissioners called in for that purpose from the different precincts. And the commissioner testified that in the selections for the jury roll no one was 'automatically or systematically' excluded, or excluded on account of race or color; that he 'did not inquire as to color,' that was not discussed.\n But, in appraising the action of the commissioners, these statements cannot be divorced from other testimony. As we have seen, there was testimony, not overborne or discredited, that there were in fact negroes in the county qualified for jury service. That testimony was direct and specific. After eliminating those persons as to whom there was some evidence of lack of qualifications, a considerable number of others remained. The fact that the testimony as to these persons, fully identified, was not challenged by evidence appropriately direct, cannot be \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 595]\n\u00a0\n brushed aside. There is no ground for an assumption that the names of these negroes were not on the preliminary list. The inference to be drawn from the testimony is that they were on that preliminary list, and were designated on that list as the names of negroes, and that they were not placed on the jury roll. There was thus presented a test of the practice of the commissioners. Something more than mere general asseverations was required. Why were these names excluded from the jury roll? Was it because of the lack of statutory qualifications? Were the qualifications of negroes actually and properly considered?\n The testimony of the commissioner on this crucial question puts the case in a strong light. That testimony leads to the conclusion that these or other negroes were not excluded on account of age, or lack of esteem in the community for integrity and judgment, or because of disease or want of any other qualification. The commissioner's answer to specific inquiry upon this point was that negroes were 'never discussed.' We give in the margin quotations from his testimony. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 587, 596]\n\u00a0\n We are of the opinion that the evidence required a different result from that reached in the state court. We think that the evidence that for a generation or longer no negro had been called for service on any jury in Jackson county, that there were negroes qualified for jury service, that according to the practice of the jury commission their names would normally appear on the preliminary list of male citizens of the requisite age but that no names of negroes were placed on the jury roll, and the testimony with respect to the lack of appropriate consideration of the qualifications of negroes, established the discrimination which the Constitution forbids. The motion to quash the indictment upon that ground should have been granted.\n Third. The evidence on the motion to quash the trial venire. The population of Morgan county, where the trial was had, was larger than that of Jackson county, and the proportion of negroes was much greater. The total population of Morgan county in 1930 was 46,176, and of this number 8, 311 were negroes.\n Within the memory of witnesses, long resident there, no negro had ever served on a jury in that county or had been called for such service. Some of these witnesses were over fifty years of age and had always lived in Mor- \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 597]\n\u00a0\n gan county. Their testimony was not contradicted. A clerk of the circuit court, who had resided in the county for thirty years, and who had been in office for over four years, testified that during his official term approximately 2,500 persons had been called for jury service and that not one of them was a negro; that he did not recall 'ever seeing any single person of the colored race serve on any jury in Morgan County.'\n There was abundant evidence that there were a large number of negroes in the county who were qualified for jury service. Men of intelligence, some of whom were college graduates, testified to long lists (said to contain nearly 200 names) of such qualified negroes, including many business men, owners of real property and householders. When defendant's counsel proposed to call many additional witnesses in order to adduce further proof of qualifications of negroes for jury service, the trial judge limited the testimony, holding that the evidence was cumulative.\n We find no warrant for a conclusion that the names of any of the negroes as to whom this testimony was given, or of any other negroes, were placed on the jury rolls. No such names were identified. The evidence that for many years no negro had been called for jury service itself tended to show the absence of the names of negroes from the jury rolls, and the state made no effort to prove their presence. The trial judge limited the defendant's proof 'to the present year, the present jury roll.' The sheriff of the county, called as a witness for defendants, scanned the jury roll and after 'looking over every single name on that jury roll, from A to Z,' was unable to point out 'any single negro on it.'\n For this long-continued, unvarying, and wholesale exclusion of negroes from jury service we find no justification consistent with the constitutional mandate. We have carefully examined the testimony of the jury commissioners upon which the state court based its decision. One \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 598]\n\u00a0\n of these commissioners testified in person and the other two submitted brief affidavits. By the state act (Gen. Acts Ala. 1931, No. 47, p. 55), in force at the time the jury roll in question was made up, the clerk of the jury board was required to obtain the names of all male citizens of the county over twenty-one and under sixty-five years of age, and their occupation, place of residence, and place of business. Id., p. 58,  11. The qualifications of those who were to be placed on the jury roll were the same as those prescribed by the earlier statute which we have already quoted. Id., p. 59,  14. The member of the jury board, who testified orally, said that a list was made up which included the names of all male citizens of suitable age; that black residents were not excluded from this general list; that in compiling the jury roll he did not consider race or color; that no one was excluded for that reason; and that he had placed on the jury roll the names of persons possessing the qualifications under the statute. The affidavits of the other members of the board contained general statements to the same effect.\n We think that this evidence failed to rebut the strong prima facie case which defendant had made. That showing as to the long-continued exclusion of negroes from jury service, and as to the many negroes qualified for that service, could not be met by mere generalities. If, in the presence of such testimony as defendant adduced, the mere general assertions by officials of their performance of duty were to be accepted as in adequate justification for the complete exclusion of negroes from jury service, the constitutional provision-adopted with special reference to their protection-would be but a vain and illusory requirement. The general attitude of the jury commissioner is shown by the following extract from his testimony: 'I do not know of any negro in Morgan County over twenty-one and under sixty-five who is generally reputed to be honest and intelligent and who is esteemed in the community for his integrity, good char- \n\n[294 U.S. 587, 599]\n\u00a0\n acter and sound judgment, who is not an habitual drunkard, who isn't afflicted with a permanent disease or physical weakness which would render him unfit to discharge the duties of a juror, and who can read English, and who has never been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude.' In the light of the testimony given by defendant's witnesses, we find it impossible to accept such a sweeping characterization of the lack of qualifications of negroes in Morgan county. It is so sweeping, and so contrary to the evidence as to the many qualified negroes, that it destroys the intended effect of the commissioner's testimony.\n In Neal v. Delaware, supra, decided over fifty years ago, this Court observed that it was a 'violent presumption,' in which the state court had there indulged, that the uniform exclusion of negroes from juries, during a period of many years, was solely because, in the judgment of the officers, charged with the selection of grand and petit jurors, fairly exercised, 'the black race in Delaware were utterly disqualified by want of intelligence, experience, or moral integrity, to sit on juries.' Such a presumption at the present time would be no less violent with respect to the exclusion of the negroes of Morgan county. And, upon the proof contained in the record now before us, a conclusion that their continuous and total exclusion from juries was because there were none possessing the requisite qualifications, cannot be sustained.\n We are concerned only with the federal question which we have discussed, and in view of the denial of the federal right suitably asserted, the judgment must be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS did not hear the argument and took no part in the consideration and decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The books containing the jury roll in question were produced on the argument at this bar and were examined by the Court. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 'Q.

UNITED STATES(1935)\nNo. 531\nArgued: January 10, 1935Decided: February 18, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 317, 318]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Otto C. Sommerich and Raymond T. Heilpern, both of New York City, for Nortz.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Angus D. MacLean, Asst. Sol.

He alleged that defendant, by these gold certificates and under the applicable acts of Congress, had certified that there had been deposited in the Treasury of the United States $106,300 in gold coin which would be paid to the claimant, as holder, upon demand; that, at the time of the issue of these certificates, and to and including January 17, 1934, a dollar in gold consisted of 25.8 grains of gold, nine-tenths fine; that claimant was entitled to receive from defendant one ounce of gold for each $20.67 of the gold certificates; that on January 17, 1934, he duly presented the certificates and demanded their redemption by the payment of gold coin to the extent above mentioned; that on that date, and for some time prior and subsequent thereto, an ounce of gold was of the value of at least $33.43, and that claimant was accordingly entitled to receive in redemption 5,104. 22 ounces of gold of the value of $170,634.07; that the demand was refused; that, in view of the penalties imposed under the order of the Secretary of the Treasury, approved by the President, on January 15, 1934, supplementing the order of December 28, 1933, and the laws and regulations under which those orders were issued, which the claimant alleged were unconstitutional as constituting a deprivation of property without due process of law, claimant delivered the gold certificates to defendant under protest and received in exchange currency of the United States in the sum of $106,300 which was not redeemable \n\n[294 U.S. 317, 324]\n\u00a0\n in gold; and that in consequence claimant was damaged in the sum of $64, 334.07, for which, with interest, judgment was demanded.\n Defendant demurred to the petition upon the ground that it did not state a cause of action against the United States.\n The questions certified by the court are as follows:\n'1. Is an owner of gold certificates of the United States, Series of 1928, not holding a Federal license to acquire or hold gold coins or gold certificates, who, on January 17, 1934, had surrendered his certificates to the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States under protest and had received therefor legal tender currency of equivalent face amount, entitled to receive from the United States a further sum inasmuch as the weight of a gold dollar was 25.8 grains, nine-tenths fine, and the market price thereof on January 17, 1934, was in excess of the currency so received?\n\n'2. Is a gold certificate, Series of 1928, under the facts stated in question 1 an express contract of the United States in its corporate or proprietary capacity which will enable its owner and holder to bring suit thereon in the Court of Claims?\n\n'3. Do the provisions of the Emergency Banking Act of March 9, 1933, and the Order of the Secretary of the Treasury dated December 28, 1933, requiring the plaintiff as owner of gold certificates as stated in question 1 to deliver the same to the Treasury of the United States in exchange for currency of an equivalent amount, not redeemable in gold, amount to a taking of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States?'\n\n Defendant's demurrer, which admitted the facts well pleaded in the petition, did not admit allegations which amounted to conclusions of law in relation to the nature of the gold certificates or the legal effect of the legislation \n\n[294 U.S. 317, 325]\n\u00a0\n under which they were issued, held, or to be redeemed. Dillon v. Barnard, 21 Wall. 430, 437; United States v. Ames, \n99 U.S. 35\n, 45; Inter-State Land Co. v. Maxwell Land Grant Co., \n139 \nU.S. 569, 577\n, 578 S., 11 S.Ct. 656; Equitable Life Assurance Society v. Brown, \n213 \nU.S. 25, 43\n, 29 S.Ct. 404.\n Gold certificates were authorized by section 5 of the Act of March 3, 1863 (12 Stat. 709, 711), which provided that the Secretary of the Treasury might receive 'deposits of gold coin and bullion' and issue certificates therefor 'in denominations of not less than twenty dollars each, corresponding with the denominations of the United States notes.' The coin and bullion so deposited were to be retained in the Treasury for the payment of the certificates on demand. It was further provided that 'certificates representing coin in the treasury may be issued in payment of interest on the public debt, which certificates, together with those issued for coin and bullion deposited, shall not at any time exceed twenty per centum beyond the amount of coin and bullion in the treasury.' See Rev. St.  254, 31 U.S.C.  428 (31 USCA  428). Section 12 of the Act of July 12, 1882 (22 Stat. 165), contained a further provision authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury 'to receive deposits of gold coin' and to issue certificates therefor, also in denominations of dollars as stated. The Act of March 14, 1900 (31 Stat. 45 (31 USCA  314)), prescribed that the dollar 'consisting of twenty-five and eight-tenths grains of gold nine- tenths fine, ... shall be the standard unit of value, and all forms of money issued or coined by the United States shall be maintained at a parity of value with this standard, and it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain such parity.' Section 6 of that act also authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to receive deposits of gold coin and to issue gold certificates therefor, and provided that the coin so deposited should be held by the Treasury for the payment of such certificates on demand and should be 'used for no other pur- \n\n[294 U.S. 317, 326]\n\u00a0\n pose.' And the latter clause appears in the amending Acts of March 4, 1907 ( 34 Stat. 1289), and of March 2, 1911 (36 Stat. 965). See 31 U.S.C.  429; 31 USCA  429.\n The Act of December 24, 1919 (41 Stat. 370 (31 USCA  451)), made gold certificates, payable to bearer on demand, 'legal tender in payment of all debts and dues, public and private.' And section 2 of the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933 (48 Stat. 113 (31 USCA  462)), amending the Act of May 12, 1933,  43(b)(1) (48 Stat. 52), provided that 'all coins and currencies of the United States ... heretofore or hereafter coined or issued, shall be legal tender for all debts, public and private, public charges, taxes, duties, and dues.'\n Gold certificates under this legislation were required to be issued in denominations of dollars, and called for the payment of dollars. \n1\n These gold certificates were currency. They were not less so because the specified number of dollars were payable in gold coin, of the coinage of the United States. Being currency, and constituting legal tender, it is entirely inadmissible to regard the gold certificates as warehouse receipts. \n2\n They were not contracts \n\n[294 U.S. 317, 327]\n\u00a0\n for a certain quantity of gold as a commodity. They called for dollars, not bullion.\n We may lay on one side the question whether the issue of currency of this description created an express contract upon which the United States has consented to be sued under the provisions of section 145 of the Judicial Code, 28 U.S.C.  250 (28 USCA  250). Compare Horowitz v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 458, 461\n, 45 S.Ct. 344.3 We may assume that plaintiff's petition permits an alternative view. Plaintiff urges as the gist of his contention that, by the acts of Congress, and the orders thereunder, requiring the delivery of his gold certificates to the Treasury in exchange for currency not redeemable in gold, he has been deprived of his property, and that he is entitled to maintain this action to recover the just compensation secured by him by the Fifth Amendment. But, even in that view, the Court of Claims has no authority to entertain the action, if the claim is at best one for nominal damages. The Court of Claims 'was not instituted to try such a case.' Grant v. United States, 7 Wall. 331, 338; Marion & Rye V. Railway Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 280, 282\n, 46 S.Ct. 253. Accordingly, we inquire whether the case which the plaintiff presents is one which would justify the recovery of actual damages.\n By section 3 of the Emergency Banking Relief Act of March 9, 1933 (48 Stat. 2), amending section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act (39 Stat. 752, 12 USCA  248(n), the Secretary of the Treasury was authorized, whenever in his judgment it was necessary \n\n[294 U.S. 317, 328]\n\u00a0\n 'to protect the currency system of the United States,' to require all persons 'to pay and deliver to the Treasurer of the United States any or all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates' owned by them. Upon such delivery, the Secretary was to pay therefor 'an equivalent amount of any other form of coin or currency coined or issued under the laws of the United States.' Under that statute, orders requiring such delivery, except as otherwise expressly provided, were issued by the Secretary on December 28, 1933, and January 15, 1934. By the latter, gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates were required to be delivered to the Treasurer of the United States on or before January 17, 1934. It was on that date that plaintiff made his demand for gold coin in redemption of his certificates and delivered the certificates under protest. That compulsory delivery, he insists, constituted the 'taking of the contract,' for which he demands compensation.\n Plaintiff explicitly states his concurrence in the government's contention that the Congress has complete authority to regulate the currency system of the country. He does not deny that, in exercising that authority, the Congress had power 'to appropriate unto the Government outstanding gold bullion, gold coin and gold certificates.' Nor does he deny that the Congress had authority 'to compel all residents of this country to deliver unto the Government all gold bullion, gold coins and gold certificates in their possession.' These powers could not be successfully challenged. Legal Tender Cases (Knox v. Lee), 12 Wall. 457; Juilliard v. Greenman, \n110 \nU.S. 421\n, 4 S.Ct. 122; Ling Su Fan v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 302\n, 31 S.Ct. 21, 30 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1176; Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, 55 S.Ct. 407, decided this day. The question plaintiff presents is thus simply one of 'just compensation.'\n The asserted basis of plaintiff's claim for actual damages is that, by the terms of the gold certificates, he was \n\n[294 U.S. 317, 329]\n\u00a0\n entitled, on January 17, 1934, to receive gold coin. It is plain that he cannot claim any better position than that in which he would have been placed had the gold coin then been paid to him. But, in that event, he would have been required, under the applicable legislation and orders, forthwith to deliver the gold coin to the Treasury. Plaintiff does not bring himself within any of the stated exceptions. He did not allege in his petition that he held a federal license to hold gold coin, and the first question submitted to us by the Court of Claims negatives the assumption of such a license. Had plaintiff received gold coin for his certificates, he would not have been able, in view of the legislative inhibition, to export it or deal in it. Moreover, it is sufficient in the instant case to point out that on January 17, 1934, the dollar had not been devalued. Or, as plaintiff puts it, 'at the time of the presentation of the certificates by petitioner, the gold content of the United States dollar had not been deflated,' and the provision of the Act of March 14, 1900, supra, fixing that content at 25.8 grains, nine-tenths fine, as the standard unit of money with which 'all forms of money issued or coined by the United States' were to be maintained at a parity, was 'still in effect.' The currency paid to the plaintiff for his gold certificates was then on a parity with that standard of value. It cannot be said that, in receiving the currency on that basis, he sustained any actual loss.\n To support his claim, plaintiff says that on January 17, 1934, 'an ounce of gold was of the value at least of $33.43.' His petition so alleged, and he contends that the allegation was admitted by the demurrer. But the assertion of that value of gold in relation to gold coin in this country, in view of the applicable legislative requirements, necessarily involved a conclusion of law. Under those requirements, there was not on January 17, 1934, a free market for gold in the United States or any mar- \n\n[294 U.S. 317, 330]\n\u00a0\n ket available to the plaintiff for the gold coin to which he claims to have been entitled. Plaintiff insists that gold had an intrinsic value and was bought and sold in the world markets. But plaintiff had no right to resort to such markets. By reason of the quality of gold coin, 'as a legal tender and as a medium of exchange,' limitations attached to its ownership, and the Congress could prohibit its exportation and regulate its use. Ling Su Fan v. United States, supra.\n The first question submitted by the Court of Claims is answered in the negative. It is unnecessary to answer the second question. And, in the circumstances shown, the third question is academic and also need not be answered.\n Question No. 1 is answered 'No.'\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissent.\n For opinion, see Norman v.

The Court there decided that 'where the money or property of an innocent person has gone into the coffers of the nation by means of a fraud to which its agent was a party, such money or property cannot be held by the United States against the claim of the wronged and injured party.' The Court said that the basis of the liability was 'an implied contract' by which the United States might well become bound in virtue of its corporate character.

Barse, of Washington, D.C., for respondents. \n\n[294 U.S. 227, 228]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy here, like the one in Jennings v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., \n294 \nU.S. 216\n, 55 S.Ct. 394, decided herewith, grows out of an attempt by the owner of negotiable paper to impress a trust upon the assets of an insolvent national bank to which the paper had been forwarded for the purpose of collection.\n The complaint, which is in three counts, is brought before us by a motion to dismiss, which is equivalent to a demurrer.\n According to the first cause of action, plaintiff, a New Jersey corporation, the petitioner in this court, was the owner of a promissory note for $3,000, made by R. G. Brewer, Inc., to the order of the plaintiff, and payable on January 16, 1933, at the office of the First National Bank of Mamaroneck, a corporation organized under the national banking act. This note the plaintiff deposited on January 12, 1933, in a bank in Philadelphia, which forwarded it through other banks to the bank in Mamaroneck for collection from the maker. R. G. Brewer, Inc., the maker, had an account at the First National Bank of Mamaroneck with a credit balance on the books of the bank in excess of the amount owing on the note. On January 14, 1933, it delivered to the bank a check upon that account for $3,015, and received back the note, which was surrendered as paid. On January 16, 1933, the next business day, the Mamaroneck bank, being insolvent, was closed by the Comptroller of the Currency without remitting or accounting for any proceeds of collection. The plaintiff claims the benefit of a trust upon the assets in the hands of the receiver.\n The second cause of action is the same as the first with these additional allegations: The bank in Mamaroneck knew itself to be insolvent on January 14, 1933, when the plaintiff's promissory note was accepted for collection. \n\n[294 U.S. 227, 229]\n\u00a0\n R. G. Brewer, Inc., whose treasurer (R. G. Brewer) was a director and managing officer of the bank, also knew of the insolvency and of the impending liquidation. What was done in the acceptance of the check and the surrender of the note two days before maturity was the product, so it is charged, of a conspiracy to release the Brewer corporation from liability and thus defraud the plaintiff.\n The third cause of action goes upon the theory that the note was not discharged or canceled but is in the possession of the receiver, who should be directed to return it.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a judgment of dismissal as to the first and second causes of action, holding the plaintiff to be a general creditor without title to a preference. As to the third cause of action, the allegations were found sufficient on their face to put the parties to their proofs, and to that extent only the dismissal was reversed. 71 F.(2d) 280. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n293 \nU.S. 546\n, 55 S.Ct. 113, 79 L.Ed. --. The third cause of action is not before us, the receiver having acquiesced in the judgment of the court below. The causes of action to be considered are the first and second.\n What was done by the Mamaroneck bank on January 14, 1933, did not involve in its doing the creation of a special deposit or an augmentation of the assets. What was done had no effect except to diminish liabilities by reducing the indebtedness due to a depositor. Jennings v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co. (Feb. 4, 1935) \n294 \nU.S. 216\n, 55 S.Ct. 394. The petitioner insists that the transaction must be viewed as if Brewer, the depositor, had withdrawn $3,015 in coin or other currency, and had paid it back to the bank to apply upon the note. But that is not what happened. The Bank, aware of its insolvency, might have been unwilling to pay out the coin, even if Brewer had demanded it, when the effect of the payment would have been to prefer one creditor over others. Rev. St.  5242, 12 U.S.C.  91 (12 USCA  91); National Security Bank v. Butler, \n129 \nU.S. 223\n, 9 S.Ct. 281; \n\n[294 U.S. 227, 230]\n\u00a0\n McDonald v. Chemical National Bank, \n174 \nU.S. 610, 618\n, 19 S.Ct. 787; Roberts v. Hill (C.C.) 24 F. 571. Brewer, equally aware of the insolvency might have been unwilling to return the coin if once he held it in his grasp and had the power to retain it. Moreover, the note had not matured, and there was no duty to pay or to collect in advance of its maturity. We indulge in nothing more than guess work when we assume that the transaction would have been carried through at all if bank or depositor had insisted that it receive another form. Cf. Hecker-Jones- Jewell Milling Co. v. Cosmopolitan Trust Co., 242 Mass. 181, 187, 136 N.E. 333, 24 A.L.R. 1148. Form is closely knit to substance when a bank, at the end of its resources, is about to close its doors.\n The argument is made that the agent for collection was guilty of a wrong in accepting payment through the medium of a check upon itself with knowledge at the time that insolvency was imminent. If this be so, the wrong does not avail to charge a trust upon the assets whereby the plaintiff will have a preference over the creditors at large. A cause of action for damages may exist, upon which the plaintiff, making proper proof, will be entitled to a dividend. There may also be a cause of action for the return of the canceled note, or for a dividend upon the value if return is found to be impossible. Liabilities such as these have their origin and measure in the loss suffered by the claimant, the owner of the paper transmitted for collection. They do not correspond to equivalent increments of value in the assets that are left in the hands of the receiver.\n By an amendment of the Negotiable Instruments Law (Consol. Laws of New York, c. 38, article 19-A,  350 to 350-l), New York has adopted the Uniform Bank Collection Code, which has already been considered by this court in a case arising in Indiana. Jennings v. \n\n[294 U.S. 227, 231]\n\u00a0\n United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., supra. Section 350-l of the Code is to the effect that in the event of insolvency a creditor in the situation of the plaintiff shall be entitled to a preference. As applied to a national bank the preference is unlawful. Jennings v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., supra.\n The decree should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","127":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPACIFIC STATES BOX & BASKET CO. v.

Van Winkle, both of Salem, Or., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justic e BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This suit was brought in the federal court for Oregon, in May, 1934, to enjoin enforcement of an order of the Department of Agriculture of that state, dated May 3, 1933, entitled 'Standard Containers for Fruits and Vegetables.' \n1\n The plaintiff, Pacific States Box & Basket Company, is a California corporation which manufactures there fruit and vegetable containers. The defendants are the Director of Agriculture and the Chief of the Division of Plant Industry, of Oregon. The jurisdiction of the District Court was invoked both on the ground of diversity of citizenship and on the ground that the order, and the statutes purporting to authorize it, violate rights of the plaintiff guaranteed by the Federal Constitution. The case was heard upon plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction and defendants' motion to dismiss the bill on the ground that it does not state facts sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to relief. The court denied the injunction and dismissed the bill. Pacific States Box & Basket Co. v. Gehlar, 9 F.Supp. 341.\n Oregon Code of 1930,  18-2902 and section 18-2903, as amended by Oregon Laws 1931, c. 136 (page 183), and 1933, c. 225 (page 306), authorize the Chief of the Division of Plant Industry, after investigation and public hearing and subject to the approval of the Director of Agriculture, to fix and promulgate 'official standards for containers of horticultural products' 'in order to promote, protect, further and develop the horticultural interests' of the state. After a standard \n\n[296 U.S. 176, 179]\n\u00a0\n has been prescribed, these statutes make it unlawful for any one to pack for sale or transport for sale, or sell, the article in a container unless it conforms to the standard. They make any violation of the order a misdemeanor, and charge the Director with the duty of enforcement.\n The order challenged, so far as it prescribes containers for raspberries and strawberries, is:\n'As provided for in sections 18-2902 and 18-2903, Oregon Code 1930, and chapter 136, Oregon Laws, 1931, a public hearing was held in Portland, Oregon, on the date of April 15, 1933, to consider standard containers for fruits and vegetables. Containers for the following fruits and vegetables were considered and recommended:\n\n'Raspberries.\n\n'Crate-24-pint hallocks, ... Size of hallock, 2 5 1\/4 5 1\/4 inches outside measurements, bottom set up 3\/4 inch, inside depth 1 1\/4 inches.\n\n'Strawberries.\n\n'Crate-24-pint hallocks, ... Size of hallocks, 2 1\/2 4 3\/8 4 3\/8 inches outside measurements, bottom set up 3\/4 inch, inside depth 1 3\/4 inches.\n\n'... The abovementioned containers are hereby declared to be standard for the designated fruits and vegetables and this order shall become effective on June 15, 1933. Provided, however, that persons now having on hand new containers or shooks for same not of standard sizes as hereby approved will be allowed an extension of time until January 1, 1934, in order to make use of such material.'\n\n A hallock is a type of rectangular till box with perpendicular sides and a raised bottom. It is usually made of rotary cut veneer, taken directly from spruce logs; but is sometimes made of paper or other material.\n The plaintiff manufactures a type of container other than hallocks. Its type, which is also used for rasp- \n\n[296 U.S. 176, 180]\n\u00a0\n berries and strawberries, is known as tin top or metal rim. It differs from the hallock both in shape and construction. In shape, it is more like a cup; its sides slope outward; and it has not the raised bottom. This cup is made from two thin strips of wood crossing each other to form the bottom of the container and then bent upward to form the sides, reinforced with a narrow metal strip to insure protection of the cup and its contents, as well as to insure uniformity of cubic measure. The plaintiff has for years sold a part of its product of tin top cups to dealers in Oregon, for ultimate use as containers for raspberries and strawberries to be packed there.\n The bill alleges 'that the effect' of the order is to prevent the sale by plaintiff for use in Oregon of 'the metal top variety of containers or cups with the solid bottom;' 'because dealers who formerly purchased such baskets from Plaintiff have been warned by officials ... that they would not be allowed to sell strawberries or raspberries in any container' other than that prescribed; that it has no facilities for manufacturing hallocks; and that, because of the expense of installing the requisite machinery and the cost of transporting the appropriate supplies to its plant, it is impracticable for it to arrange to make hallocks.\n The claim is that, since the order prescribed hallocks as the only permissible type of container, its necessary effect is to exclude containers of the plaintiff's manufacture from use in Oregon, and, therefore, the order violates its rights: (a) Under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (section 1), because the order is arbitrary, capricious, and not reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of any legitimate purpose of the police power; (b) under the equal protection clause of the amendment (section 1), because the order grants a monopoly to manufacturers of hallocks; (c) under the commerce clause (article 1,  8, cl. 3), because the order imposes undue burdens on interstate commerce. The defend- \n\n[296 U.S. 176, 181]\n\u00a0\n ants insist that the order is an appropriate exercise of the police power of the state; does not create a monopoly; and does not burden interstate commerce. We think the defendants are right.\n First. The power of a state to prescribe standard containers in order to facilitate trading, to preserve the condition of the merchandise, to protect buyers from deception, or to prevent unfair competition, is conceded. Such regulation of trade is a part of the inspection laws; was among the earliest exertions of the police power in America; has been presistent; and has been widely applied to merchandise commonly sold in containers. See Turner v. Maryland, \n107 U.S. 38\n, 51-54, 2 S.Ct. 44. Latterly, with the broadening of the field of distribution and the growing use of containers in the retail trade, the scope of the regulation has been much extended.\n Plaintiff does not question the reasonableness of the standard so far as it prescribes the capacity of the box or basket. Its challenge is directed solely to the fixing of the dimensions and the form of the container. But to fix both the dimensions and the form may be deemed necessary in order to assure observance of the prescribed capacity and to effect other purposes of the regulation. It may be that in Oregon, where hallocks have long been in general use,2 buyers at retail are less likely to be deceived by dealers as to the condition and quantity of these berries if they are sold in containers of the prescribed form and dimensions. It is said that there are 34 other styles or shapes of berry basket in use somewhere in the United States. Obviously, a multitude of shapes and sizes of packages tends to confuse the buyer. Furthermore, the character of the container may be an important factor in preserving the condition of raspberries and strawberries, which are not only \n\n[296 U.S. 176, 182]\n\u00a0\n perishable, but tender. A shallow container, like the hallock prescribed, may conceivably better preserve these fruits than the deeper cup which the plaintiff manufactures. A container with perpendicular sides, like the hallock, may conceivably preserve them better than a metal rim cup with outward sloping sides. And, since the containers are to be packed and shipped in crates of 24, the berries may conceivably be better stowed where the fruit basket has the bottom set-up peculiar to the hallock, than if it had the flat bottom of the plaintiff's metal rim cup. Considerations of this nature led the Colonies, the individual states, and Congress to prescribe for many articles not only the capacity, but the size and form of containers. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n Different types of commodities require different types of containers; and as to each commodity there may be reasonable difference of opinion as to the type best adapted to the protection of the public. Whether it was necessary in Oregon to provide a standard container for raspberries and strawberries; and, if so, whether that adopted should have been made mandatory, involve questions of fact and of policy, the determination of which rests in the legislative branch of the state government. The determination may be made, if the Constitution of the state permits, by a subordinate administrative body. With the wisdom of such a regulation we have, of course, no concern. We may inquire only whether it is arbitrary or capricious. That the requirement is not arbitrary or capricious seems clear. That the type of container prescribed by Oregon is an appropriate means for attaining permissible ends cannot be doubted.\n Second. The standard prescribed by the order does not conflict with any established by Congress. The Standard Baskets and Containers Act of May 21, 1928, c. 664, 45 Stat. 685 (15 USCA  257 et seq.), has no relation to the matter here under con- \n\n[296 U.S. 176, 183]\n\u00a0\n sideration. That statute deals solely with hampers, round stave, and splint baskets of capacity not less than one-eighth bushel. The Standard Baskets and Containers Act of August 31, 1916, c. 426, 39 Stat. 673 (15 USCA  251 et seq.), which in section 2 (15 USCA  252) deals with containers for small fruits and vegetables, prescribes merely the capacity of the containers. It fixes the cubic contents for dry half-pint, pint, and quart. It makes no reference to the dimensions or form of the container; and has left to the individual states the adoption of the standards in these respects if deemed necessary. Compare Savage v. Jones, \n225 \nU.S. 501\n, 32 S.Ct. 715; Merchants' Exchange v. Missouri, \n248 \nU.S. 365, 368\n, 39 S.Ct. 114; Mintz v. Baldwin, \n289 \nU.S. 346, 350\n, 351 S., 53 S.Ct. 611\n\n\n Third. The charge that the order is void because it grants a monopoly to manufacturers of hallocks is unfounded. The plaintiff, and all others, are free to engage in the business, which, so far as appears, is not protected by patent or trade-mark and does not rest upon trade secrets. The business is not closely controlled; nor is it peculiar to Oregon. In 1933, at least 25 concerns were engaged in the United States in manufacturing hallocks. Less than one-fourth of them were located in Oregon and Washington. \n4\n Plaintiff asserts that the order excludes it from the Oregon trade since its plant cannot be equipped to manufacture hallocks except at a prohibitive cost; and that the spruce logs, the veneer of which is customarily used in making hallocks, is not obtainable except in the Pacific Northwest. Obviously these allegations afford no support to the charge of monopoly; among other reasons, because the order does not prescribe the material from which hallocks may be made. They are \n\n[296 U.S. 176, 184]\n\u00a0\n in fact made, to some extent, from material other than spruce veneer. Moreover, the grant of a monopoly, if otherwise an appropriate exercise of the police power, is not void as denying equal protection of the law. Compare Slaughter House Cases, 16 Wall. 36; Nebbia v. New York, \n291 \nU.S. 502, 529\n, 54 S.Ct. 505, 89 A.L.R. 1469.\n Fourth. The order does not unduly burden interstate commerce. It is aimed, not at the importation or sale of other type of containers, but at their use in Oregon by packers of raspberries and strawberries, and the later transportation and sale of the packages. The prohibition of other types involved in prescribing the standard is nondiscriminatory. It applies regardless of the origin of the containers. The plaintiff is a manufacturer of containers, not a packer or shipper of berries. It is not prohibited from shipping its tin top containers into Oregon; nor from selling them there. The operation of the order is intrastate, beginning after the interstate movement of the containers has ceased, and after the original package has been broken. To sustain this contention of the plaintiff would be to hold that its containers, because of their origin, are entitled to immunity from the exercise of the state regulatory power. Compare Packer Corporation v. Utah, \n285 \nU.S. 105, 111\n, 112 S., 52 S.Ct. 273, 79 A.L.R. 546.\n Fifth. Plaintiff contends that since the case was heard on motion to dismiss the bill, all allegations therein made must be accepted as true; and, among others, the charge that 'there is no necessity for the particular orders relating to strawberries or raspberries' 'based on considerations of public health, or to prevent fraud or deception, or any other legitimate use of the police power, and the particular container described ... does not of necessity promote, protect, further or develop the horticultural interests of the State'; and that its necessary effect is 'to grant a monopoly to manufacturers of the so-called hal- \n\n[296 U.S. 176, 185]\n\u00a0\n locks.' The order here in question deals with a subject clearly within the scope of the police power. See Turner v. Maryland, \n107 \nU.S. 38\n, 2 S.Ct. 44. When such legislative action 'is called in question, if any state of facts reasonably can be conceived that would sustain it, there is a presumption of the existence of that state of facts, and one who assails the classification must carry the burden of showing by a resort to common knowledge, or other matters which may be judicially noticed, or to other legitimate proof, that the action is arbitrary.' Borden's Farm Products Co ., Inc., v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 194, 209\n, 55 S.Ct. 187, 192. The burden is not sustained by making allegations which are merely the general conclusions of law or fact. See Public Service Commission v. Great Northern Utilities Co., \n289 \nU.S. 130, 136\n, 137 S., 53 S.Ct. 546. Facts relied upon to rebut the presumption of constitutionality must be specifically set forth. See AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440\n, 48 S.Ct. 174; O'Gorman & Young v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co ., \n282 \nU.S. 251\n, 51 S.Ct. 130, 72 A.L.R. 1163; Hegeman Farms Corporation v. Baldwin, \n293 \nU.S. 163\n, 55 S.Ct. 7. A motion to dismiss, like a demurrer, admits only facts well pleaded. Compare St. Louis, Kennett & Southeastern R.R. v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 346, 349\n, 45 S.Ct. 245.\n Sixth. It is urged that this rebuttable presumption of the existence of a state of facts sufficient to justify the exertion of the police power attaches only to acts of Legislature; and that where the regulation is the act of an administrative body, no such presumption exists, so that the burden of proving the justifying facts is upon him who seeks to sustain the validity of the regulation. The contention is without support in authority or reason, and rests upon misconception. Every exertion of the police power, either by the Legislature or by an administrative body, is an exercise of delegated power. Where it is by a statute, the Legislature has acted under power delegated to it through the Constitution. Where the \n\n[296 U.S. 176, 186]\n\u00a0\n regulation is by an order of an administrative body, that body acts under a delegation from the Legislature. The question of law may, of course, always be raised whether the Legislature had power to delegate the authority exercised. Compare Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan, \n293 \nU.S. 388\n, 55 S.Ct. 241, and A.L.A. Schechter Poultry Corporation v. United States, \n295 \nU.S. 495\n, 55 S.Ct. 837, 97 A.L.R. 947. But where the regulation is within the scope of authority legally delegated, the presumption of the existence of facts justifying its specific exercise attaches alike to statutes, to municipal ordinances, and to orders of administrative bodies. Compare AEtna Insurance Co. v. Hyde, \n275 \nU.S. 440, 447\n, 48 S.Ct. 174. Here there is added reason for applying the presumption of validity; for the regulation now challenged was adopted after notice and public hearing as the statute required. It is contended that the order is void because the administrative body made no special findings of fact. But the statute did not require special findings; doubtless because the regulation authorized was general legislation, not an administrative order in the nature of a judgment directed against an individual concern. Compare Wichita Railroad & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n260 \nU.S. 48, 58\n, 59 S., 43 S.Ct. 51; Mahler v. Eby, \n264 \nU.S. 32, 44\n, 44 S.Ct. 283; Southern R. Co. v. Virginia, \n290 \nU.S. 190, 193\n, 194 S., 54 S.Ct. 148.\n Seventh. It is argued that under the Constitution of Oregon, its Legislature was without power to delegate the authority to prescribe standard containers; citing Van Winkle v. Fred Meyer, Inc. (Or.) 49 P.(2d) 1140. This objection (which involves solely a question of state law) was not made below, was not discussed by the lower court, and is not included in the assignment of errors filed in this court. We have no occasion to consider it. See Rule 27(4), 28 U.S.C.A. following section 354; Blair v. Oesterlein Co., \n275 \nU.S. 220, 225\n, 48 S.Ct. 87; Bradley v.

Any violation of any order of the President issued under the provisions of this subsection shall be punishable by fine of not to exceed $1,000, or imprisonment for not to exceed six months, or both.'\n\n On July 14, 1933, the President, by Executive Order No. 6204 (15 USCA  709 note), authorized the Secretary of the Interior to exercise all the powers vested in the President 'for the purpose of en- \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 407]\n\u00a0\n forcing Section 9(c) of said act and said order' of July 11, 1933, 'including full authority to designate and appoint such agents and to set up such boards and agencies as he may see fit, and to promulgate such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary.' \n2\n That order was made under section 10(a) of the National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 200, 15 U.S.C.  710(a), 15 USCA  710(a), authorizing the President 'to prescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes' of title 1 of the National Industrial Recovery Act and providing that 'any violation of any such rule or regulation shall be punishable by fine of not to exceed $500, or imprisonment for not to exceed six months, or both.'\n On July 15, 1933, the Secretary of the Interior issued regulations to carry out the President's orders of July 11 and 14, 1933. These regulations were amended by orders \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 408]\n\u00a0\n of July 25, 1933, and August 21, 1933, prior to the commencement of these suits. Regulation IV provided, in substance, that every producer of petroleum should file a monthly statement under oath, beginning August 15, 1933, with the Division of Investigations of the Department of the Interior giving information with respect to the residence and post office address of the producer, the location of his producing properties and wells, the allowable production as prescribed by state authority, the amount of daily production, all deliveries of petroleum, and declaring that no part of the petroleum or products produced and shipped had been produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted by state authority. Regulation V required every purchaser, shipper (other than a producer), and refiner of petroleum, including processors, similarly to file a monthly statement under oath, giving information as to residence and post office address, the place and date of receipt, the parties from whom and the amount of petroleum received and the amount held in storage, the disposition of the petroleum, particulars as to deliveries, and declaring, to the best of the affiant's information and belief, that none of the petroleum so handled had been produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of that allowed by state authority. Regulation VII provided that all persons embraced within the terms of section 9(c) of the act, 15 USCA  709(a) and the executive orders and regulations issued thereunder, should keep 'available for inspection by the Division of Investigations of the Department of the Interior adequate books and records of all transactions involving the production and transportation of petroleum and the products thereof.'\n On August 19, 1933, the President, by Executive Order No. 6256, stating that his action was taken under title 1 of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved a 'Code of \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 409]\n\u00a0\n Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry.' \n3\n By a further Executive Order of August 28, 1933, the President designated the Secretary of the Interior as Administrator, and the Department of the Interior as the federal agency, to exercise on behalf of the President all the powers vested in him under that act and code. Section 3(f) of title 1 of the National Industrial Recovery Act, 15 USCA  703(f), provides that, when a code of fair competition has been approved or prescribed by the President under that title, 'any violation of any provision thereof in any transaction in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce shall \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 410]\n\u00a0\n be a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof an offender shall be fined not more than $500 for each offense, and each day such violation continues shall be deemed a separate offense.'\n This 'Petroleum Code' (in its original form and as officially printed) provided in section 3 of article III relating to 'Production' for estimates of 'required production of crude oil to balance consumer demand for petroleum products' to be made at intervals by the federal agency. This 'required production' was to be 'equitably allocated' among the several states. These estimates and allocations, when approved by the President, were to be deemed to be 'the net reasonable market demand,' and the allocations were to be recommended 'as the operating schedules for the producing States and for the industry.' By section 4 of article III, the subdivision, with respect to producing properties, of the production allocated to each state, was to be made within the state. The second paragraph of that section further provided:\n'If any subdivision into quotas of production allocated to any State shall be made within a State any production by any person, as person is defined in Article I, Section 3 of this code in excess of any such quota assigned to him, shall be deemed an unfair trade practice and in violation of this code.'\n\n By an Executive Order of September 13, 1933, No. 6284-a, modifying certain provisions of the Petroleum Code, this second paragraph of section 4 of article III was eliminated. It was reinstated by Executive Order of September 25, 1934, No. 6855\n\n\n These suits were brought in October, 1933.\n In No. 135, the Panama Refining Company, as owner of an oil refining plant in Texas, and its coplaintiff, a producer having oil and gas leases in Texas, sued to restrain the defendants, who were federal officials, from enforcing Regulations IV, V, and VII prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior under section 9(c) of the National Industrial \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 411]\n\u00a0\n Recovery Act. Plaintiffs attacked the validity of section 9(c) as an unconstitutional delegation to the President of legislative power and as transcending the authority of the Congress under the commerce clause. The regulations, and the attempts to enforce them by coming upon the properties of the plaintiffs, gauging their tanks, digging up pipe lines, and otherwise, were also assailed under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the Constitution.\n In No. 260, the Amazon Petroleum Corporation and its coplaintiffs, all being oil producers in Texas and owning separate properties, sued to enjoin the Railroad Commission of that state, its members and other state officers, and the other defendants who were federal officials, from enforcing the state and federal restrictions upon the production and disposition of oil. The bill alleged that the legislation of the state and the orders of its commission in curtailing production violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution. As to the federal requirements, the bill not only attacked section 9(c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act, and the regulations of the Secretary of the Interior thereunder, upon substantially the same grounds as those set forth in the bill of the Panama Refining Company, but also challenged the validity of provisions of the Petroleum Code. While a number of these provisions were set out in the bill, the contest on the trial related to the limitation of production through the allocation of quotas pursuant to section 4 of article III of the code.\n As the case involved the constitutional validity of orders of the state commission and an interlocutory injunction was sought, a court of three judges was convened under section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 U.S.C .  380 (28 USCA  380)). That court decided that the cause of action against the federal officials was not one within section 266, but was for the consideration of the District Judge alone. The parties agreed that the causes of action should be severed and that each cause \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 412]\n\u00a0\n should be submitted to the tribunal having jurisdiction of it. Hearing was had both on the applications for interlocutory injunction and upon the merits. The court of three judges, sustaining the state orders, denied injunction, and dismissed the bill as against the state authorities. Amazon Petroleum Corp. v. Railroad Comm. (D.C.) 5 F.Supp. 633, 634, 639.\n In both cases against the federal officials, that of the Panama Refining Company and that of the Amazon Petroleum Corporation, heard by the District Judge, a permanent injunction was granted. 5 F.Supp. 639. In the case of the Amazon Petroleum Corporation, the court specifically enjoined the defendants from enforcing section 4 of article III of the Petroleum Code; both plaintiffs and defendants and the court being unaware of the amendment of September 13, 1933.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decrees against the federal officials and directed that the bills be dismissed. Ryan v. Amazon Petroleum Corp., 71 F.(2d) 1; Ryan v. Panama Refining Co., 71 F.(2d) 8. The cases come here on writs of certiorari granted on October 8, 1934, \n293 \nU.S. 539\n, 55 S.Ct. 102, 79 L.Ed. --; \n293 \nU.S. 539\n, 55 S.Ct. 83, 79 L.Ed. --.\n First. The controversy with respect to the provision of section 4 of article III of the Petroleum Code was initiated and proceeded in the courts below upon a false assumption. That assumption was that this section still contained the paragraph (eliminated by the Executive Order of September 13, 1933) by which production in excess of assigned quotas was made an unfair practice and a violation of the code. Whatever the cause of the failure to give appropriate public notice of the change in the section, with the result that the persons affected, the prosecuting authorities, and the courts, were alike ignorant of the alteration, the fact is that the attack in this respect was upon a provision which did not exist. The government's announcement that, by reason of the elimination of this paragraph, the government 'cannot, and therefore it does not intend to, prosecute petitioners or other producers of oil in Texas, criminally or otherwise, \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 413]\n\u00a0\n for exceeding, at any time prior to September 25, 1934, the quotas of production assigned to them under the laws of Texas,' but that, if 'petitioners, or other producers, produce in excess of such quotas after September 25, 1934, the government intends to prosecute them,' cannot avail to import into the present case the amended provision of that date. \n4\n The case is not one where a subsequent law is applicable to a pending suit and controls its disposition. \n5\n When this suit was brought and when it was heard, there was no cause of action for the injunction sought with respect to the provision of section 4 of article III of the code; as to that, there was no basis for real controversy. See California v. San Pablo & T.R. Co., \n149 \nU.S. 308, 314\n, 13 S.Ct. 876; United States v. Alaska Steamship Co., \n253 \nU.S. 113, 116\n, 40 S.Ct. 448; Barker Painting Co. v. Local No. 734, Brotherhood of Painters, etc., \n281 \nU.S. 462\n, 50 S.Ct. 356. If the government undertakes to enforce the new provision, the petitioners, as well as others, will have an opportunity to present their grievance, which can then be considered, as it should be, in the light of the facts as they will then appear.\n For this reason, we pass to the other questions presented, and we express no opinion as to the interpretation or validity of the provisions of the Petroleum Code.\n Second. Regulations IV, V, and VII, issued by the Secretary of the Interior prior to these suits, have since been amended. But the amended regulations continue sub- \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 414]\n\u00a0\n stantially the earlier requirements and expand them. They present the same constitutional questions, and the cases as to these are not moot. Southern Pacific Company v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 433, 452\n, 31 S. Ct. 288; Southern Pacific Terminal Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 U.S. 498\n, 514-516, 31 S.Ct. 279; McGrain v. Daugherty, \n273 \nU.S. 135, 181\n, 182 S., 47 S.Ct. 319, 50 A.L.R. 1.\n The original regulations of July 15, 1933, as amended July 25, 1933, and August 21, 1933, were issued to enforce the Executive Orders of July 11 and July 14, 1933. The Executive Order of July 11, 1933, was made under section 9(c) of the National Industrial Recovery Act, and the Executive Order of July 14, 1933, under section 10(a) of that act, authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to promulgate regulations, was for the purpose of enforcing section 9(c) and the Executive Order of July 11, 1933. The amended regulations have been issued for the same purpose. The fundamental question as to these regulations thus turns upon the validity of section 9( c) and the executive orders to carry it out.\n Third. The statute provides that any violation of any order of the President issued under section 9(c) shall be punishable by fine of not to exceed $1,000, or imprisonment for not to exceed six months, or both. We think that these penalties would attach to each violation, and in this view the plaintiffs were entitled to invoke the equitable jurisdiction to restrain enforcement, if the statute and the executive orders were found to be invalid. Philadelphia Company v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 620\n, 621 S., 32 S.Ct. 340; Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 U.S. 197\n, 214-216, 44 S. Ct. 15; Hygrade Provision Company v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 499\n, 500 S., 45 S.Ct. 141.\n Fourth. Section 9[c] is assailed upon the ground that it is an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. The section purports to authorize the President to pass a prohibitory law. The subject to which this authority relates is defined. It is the transportation in interstate and \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 415]\n\u00a0\n foreign commerce of petroleum and petroleum products which are produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted by state authority. Assuming for the present purpose, without deciding, that the Congress has power to interdict the transportation of that excess in interstate and foreign commerce, the question whether that transportation shall be prohibited by law is obviously one of legislative policy. Accordingly, we look to the statute to see whether the Congress has declared a policy with respect to that subject; whether the Congress has set up a standard for the President's action; whether the Congress has required any finding by the President in the exercise of the authority to enact the prohibition.\n Section 9(c) is brief and unambiguous. It does not attempt to control the production of petroleum and petroleum products within a state. It does not seek to lay down rules for the guidance of state Legislatures or state officers. It leaves to the states and to their constituted authorities the determination of what production shall be permitted. It does not qualify the President's authority by reference to the basis or extent of the state's limitation of production. Section 9(c) does not state whether or in what circumstances or under what conditions the President is to prohibit the transportation of the amount of petroleum or petroleum products produced in excess of the state's permission. It establishes no creterion to govern the President's course. It does not require any finding by the President as a condition of his action. The Congress in section 9(c) thus declares no policy as to the transportation of the excess production. So far as this section is concerned, it gives to the President an unlimited authority to determine the policy and to lay down the prohibition, or not to lay it down, as he may see fit. And disobedience to his order is made a crime punishable by fine and imprisonment. \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 416]\n\u00a0\n We examine the context to ascertain if it furnishes a declaration of policy or a standard of action, which can be deemed to relate to the subject of section 9(c) and thus to imply what is not there expressed. It is important to note that section 9 (15 USCA  709) is headed 'Oil Regulation'-that is, section 9 is the part of the National Industrial Recovery Act which particularly deals with that subject-matter. But the other provisions of section 9 afford no ground for implying a limitation of the broad grant of authority in section 9(c). Thus section 9(a) authorizes the President to initiate before the Interstate Commerce Commission 'proceedings necessary to prescribe regulations to control the operations of oil pipe lines and to fix reasonable, compensatory rates for the transportation of petroleum and its products by pipe lines,' and the Interstate Commerce Commission is to grant preference 'to the hearings and determination of such cases.' Section 9(b) authorizes the President to institute proceedings 'to divorce from any holding company any pipe-line company controlled by such holding company which pipeline company by unfair practices or by exorbitant rates in the transportation of petroleum or its products tends to create a monopoly.' It will be observed that each of these provisions contains restrictive clauses as to their respective subjects. Neither relates to the subject of section 9(c).\n We turn to the other provisions of title 1 of the act. The first section (15 USCA  701) is a 'declaration of policy.' \n6\n It declares that a national emergency exists which is 'pro- \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 417]\n\u00a0\n ductive of widespread unemployment and disorganization of industry, which burdens interstate and foreign commerce, affects the public welfare, and undermines the standards of living of the American people.' It is declared to be the policy of Congress 'to remove obstructions to the free flow of interstate and foreign commerce which tend to diminish the amount thereof;' 'to provide for the general welfare by promoting the organization of industry for the purpose of cooperative action among trade groups;' 'to induce and maintain united action of labor and management under adequate governmental sanctions and supervision;' 'to eliminate unfair competitive practices, to promote the fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of industries, to avoid undue restriction of production (except as may be temporarily required), to increase the consumption of industrial and agricultural products by increasing purchasing power, to reduce and relieve unemployment, to improve standards of labor, and otherwise to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural resources.'\n This general outline of policy contains nothing as to the circumstances or conditions in which transportation of petroleum or petroleum products should be prohibited-nothing as to the policy of prohibiting or not prohibiting the transportation of production exceeding what the \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 418]\n\u00a0\n states allow. The general policy declared is 'to remove obstructions to the free flow of interstate and foreign commerce.' As to production, the section lays down no policy of limitation. It favors the fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of industries. It speaks, parenthetically, of a possible temporary restriction of production, but of what, or in what circumstances, it gives no suggestion. The section also speaks in general terms of the conservation of natural resources, but it prescribes no policy for the achievement of that end. It is manifest that this broad outline is simply an introduction of the act, leaving the legislative policy as to particular subjects to be declared and defined, if at all, by the subsequent sections.\n It is no answer to insist that deleterious consequences follow the transportation of 'hot oil'-oil exceeding state allowances. The Congress did not prohibit that transportation. The Congress did not undertake to say that the transportation of 'hot oil' was injurious. The Congress did not say that transportation of that oil was 'unfair competition.' The Congress did not declare in what circumstances that transportation should be forbidden, or require the President to make any determination as to any facts or circumstances. Among the numerous and diverse objectives broadly stated, the President was not required to choose. The President was not required to ascertain and proclaim the conditions prevailing in the industry which made the prohibition necessary. The Congress left the matter to the President without standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased. The effort by ingenious and diligent construction to supply a criterion still permits such a breadth of authorized action as essentially to commit to the President the functions of a Legislature rather than those of an executive or administrative \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 419]\n\u00a0\n officer executing a declared legislative policy. We find nothing in section 1 which limits or controls the authority conferred by section 9(c).\n We pass to the other sections of the act. Section 2 (15 USCA  702) relates to administrative agencies which may be constituted. Section 3 (15 USCA  703) provides for the approval by the President of 'codes' for trades or industries. These are to be codes of 'fair competition' and the authority is based upon certain express conditions which require findings by the President. Action under section 9(c) is not made to depend on the formulation of a code under section 3. In fact, the President's action under section 9(c) was taken more than a month before a Petroleum Code was approved. Subdivision (e) of section 3 (15 USCA  703(e) authorizes the President, on his own motion or upon complaint, as stated, in case any article is being imported into the United States 'in substantial quantities or increasing ratio to domestic production of any competitive article,' under such conditions as to endanger the maintenance of a code or agreement under title 1, to cause an immediate investigation by the Tariff Commission. The authority of the President to act, after such investigation, is conditioned upon a finding by him of the existence of the underlying facts, and he may permit entry of the articles concerned upon such conditions and with such limitations as he shall find it necessary to prescribe in order that the entry shall not tend to render the code or agreement ineffective. Section 4 (15 USCA  704) relates to agreements and licenses for the purposes stated. Section 5 (15 USCA  705) refers to the application of the anti-trust laws. Sections 6 and 7 (15 USCA  706, 707) impose limitations upon the application of title 1, bearing upon trade associations and other organizations and upon the relations between employers and employees. Section 8 (15 USCA  708), contains provisions with respect to the application of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933 (7 USCA  601 et seq.). \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 420]\n\u00a0\n None of these provisions can be deemed to prescribe any limitation of the grant of authority in section 9(c).\n Fifth. The question whether such a delegation of legislative power is permitted by the Constitution is not answered by the argument that it should be assumed that the President has acted, and will act, for what he believes to be the public good. The point is not one of motives, but of constitutional authority, for which the best of motives is not a substitute. While the present controversy relates to a delegation to the President, the basic question has a much wider application. If the Congress can make a grant of legislative authority of the sort attempted by section 9(c), we find nothing in the Constitution which restricts the Congress to the selection of the President as grantee. The Congress may vest the power in the officer of its choice or in a board or commission such as it may select or create for the purpose. Nor, with respect to such a delegation, is the question concerned merely with the transportation of oil, or of oil produced in excess of what the state may allow. If legislative power may thus be vested in the President or other grantee as to that excess of production, we see no reason to doubt that it may similarly be vested with respect to the transportation of oil without reference to the state's requirements. That reference simply defines the subject of the prohibition which the President is authorized to enact or not to enact as he pleases. And, if that legislative power may be given to the President or other grantee, it would seem to follow that such power may similarly be conferred with respect to the transportation of other commodities in interstate commerce with or without reference to state action, thus giving to the grantee of the power the determination of what is a wise policy as to that transportation, and authority to permit or prohibit it, as the person or board or commission so chosen may \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 421]\n\u00a0\n think desirable. In that view, there would appear to be no ground for denying a similar prerogative of delegation with respect to other subjects of legislation.\n The Constitution provides that 'All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.' Article 1,  1. And the Congress is empowered 'To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution' its general powers. Article 1,  8, par. 18. The Congress manifestly is not permitted to abdicate or to transfer to others the essential legislative functions with which it is thus vested. Undoubtedly legislation must often be adapted to complex conditions involving a host of details with which the national Legislature cannot deal directly. The Constitution has never been regarded as denying to the Congress the necessary resources of flexibility and practicality, which will enable it to perform its function in laying down policies and establishing standards, while leaving to selected instrumentalities the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the Legislature is to apply. Without capacity to give authorizations of that sort we should have the anomaly of a legislative power which in many circumstances calling for its exertion would be but a futility. But the constant recognition of the necessity and validity of such provisions and the wide range of administrative authority which has been developed by means of them cannot be allowed to obscure the limitations of the authority to delegate, if our constitutional system is to be maintained.\n The Court has had frequent occasion to refer to these limitations and to review the course of congressional action. At the very outset, amid the disturbances due to war in Europe, when the national safety was imperiled \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 422]\n\u00a0\n and our neutrality was disregarded, the Congress passed a series of acts, as a part of which the President was authorized, in stated circumstances, to lay and revoke embargoes, to give permits for the exportation of arms and military stores, to remit and discontinue the restraints and prohibitions imposed by acts suspending commercial intercourse with certain countries, and to permit or interdict the entrance into waters of the United States of armed vessels belonging to foreign nations. \n7\n These early acts were not the subject of judicial decision, and, apart from that, they afford no adequate basis for a conclusion that the Congress assumed that it possessed an unqualified power of delegation. They were inspired by the vexations of American commerce through the hostile enterprises of the belligerent powers,8 they were directed to the effective execution of policies repeatedly declared by the Congress, and they confided to the President, for the purposes and under the conditions stated, an authority which was cognate to the conduct by him of the foreign relations of the government. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 388, 423]\n\u00a0\n The first case relating to an authorization of this description was that of The Aurora v. United States, 7 Cranch, 382, 388. The cargo of that vessel had been condemned as having been imported from Great Britain in violation of the Nonintercourse Act of March 1, 1809 (2 Stat. 528). That act expired on May 1, 1810,10 when Congress passed another \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 424]\n\u00a0\n act (2 Stat. 605, 606) providing that, in case either Great Britain or France before March 3, 1811, 'shall ... so revoke or modify her edicts as that they shall cease to violate the neutral commerce of the United States, which fact the President of the United States shall declare by proclamation, and if the other nation shall not within three months thereafter so revoke or modify her edicts in like manner' (section 4), then, with respect to that nation, as stated, the provisions of the act of 1809, after three months from that proclamation, 'shall ... be revived and have full force and effect.' On November 2, 1810, the President issued his proclamation declaring that France had so revoked or modified her edicts, and it was contended that the provisions of the act of 1809, as to the cargo in question, had thus been revived. The Court said that it could see no sufficient reason why the Legislature should not exercise its discretion in reviving the act of 1809, 'either expressly or conditionally, as their judgment should direct.' The provision of that act declaring 'that it should continue in force to a certain time, and no longer,' could not restrict the power of the Legislature to extend its operation 'without limitation upon the occurrence of any subsequent combination of events.' This was a decision, said the Court in Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 683\n, 12 S.Ct. 495, 501, 'that it was competent for congress to make the revival of an act depend upon the proclamation of the president, showing the ascertainment by him of the fact that the edicts of certain nations had been so revoked or modified that they did not violate the neutral commerce of the United States.'\n In Field v. Clark, supra, the Court applied that ruling to the case of 'the suspension of an act upon a contingency to be ascertained by the president, and made known by his proclamation.' The Court was dealing with section 3 of the Act of October 1, 1890, 26 Stat. 567, 612. \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 425]\n\u00a0\n That section provided that, 'with a view to secure reciprocal trade' with countries producing certain articles, 'whenever, and so often as the President shall be satisfied' that the government of any country producing them imposed 'duties or other exactions upon the agricultural or other products of the United States' which, in view of the free list established by the act, the President 'may deem to be reciprocally unequal and unreasonable, he shall have the power and it shall be his duty,' to suspend the free introduction of those articles by proclamation to that effect, and that during that suspension the duties specified by the section should be levied. The validity of the provision was challenged as a delegation to the President of legislative power. The Court reviewed the early acts to which we have referred, as well as later statutes considered to be analogous. \n11\n While sustaining the provision, the Court emphatically declared that the principle that 'congress cannot delegate legislative power to the president' is 'universally \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 426]\n\u00a0\n recognized as vital to the integrity and maintenance of the system of government ordained by the constitution.' The Court found that the act before it was not inconsistent with that principle; that it did not 'in any real sense, invest the president with the power of legislation.' As 'the suspension was absolutely required when the president ascertained the existence of a particular fact,' it could not be said 'that in ascertaining that fact, and in issuing his proclamation, in obedience to the legislative will, he exercised the function of making laws.' 'He was the mere agent of the law-making department to ascertain and declare the event upon which its expressed will was to take effect.' Id., pages 692, 693 of 143 U.S., 12 S.Ct. 495, 504, 505. The Court referred with approval to the distinction pointed out by the Supreme Court of Ohio in Cincinnati, Wilmington, etc., Railroad v. Clinton County Commissioners, 1 Ohio St. 88, between 'the delegation of power to make the law, which necessarily involves a discretion as to what it shall be, and conferring authority or discretion as to its execution, to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law.'\n Applying that principle, authorizations given by Congress to selected instrumentalities for the purpose of ascertaining the existence of facts to which legislation is directed have constantly been sustained. Moreover the Congress may not only give such authorizations to determine specific facts, but may establish primary standards, devolving upon others the duty to carry out the declared legislative policy; that is, as Chief Justice Marshall expressed it, 'to fill up the details' under the general provisions made by the Legislature. Wayman v. Southard, 10 Wheat. 1, 43. In Buttfield v. Stranahan, \n192 \nU.S. 470, 496\n, 24 S.Ct. 349, 352, the Act of March 2, 1897 (29 Stat. 604, 605,  3 (see 21 USCA  43)), was upheld, which authorized the Secretary of the Treasury, upon the recommendation of a board of experts, to 'establish uniform standards of purity, quality, and fitness \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 427]\n\u00a0\n for consumption of all kinds of teas imported into the United States.' The Court construed the statute as expressing 'the purpose to exclude the lowest grades of tea, whether demonstrably of inferior purity, or unfit for consumption, or presumably so because of their inferior quality.' The Congress, the Court said, thus fixed 'a primary standard' and committed to the Secretary of the Treasury 'the mere executive duty to effectuate the legislative policy declared in the statute.' 'Congress legislated on the subject as far as was reasonably practicable, and from the necessities of the case was compelled to leave to executive officials the duty of bringing about the result pointed out by the statute.' See Red 'C' Oil Co. v. Board of Agriculture of North Carolina, \n222 \nU.S. 380, 394\n, 32 S.Ct. 152.\n Another notable illustration is that of the authority given to the Secretary of War to determine whether bridges and other structures constitute unreasonable obstructions to navigation and to remove such obstructions. Act of March 3, 1899,  18, 30 Stat. 1153, 1154 (33 USCA  502). By that statute the Congress declared 'a general rule and imposed upon the Secretary of War the duty of ascertaining what particular cases came within the rule' as thus laid down. Union Bridge Co. v. United States, \n204 \nU.S. 364, 386\n, 27 S.Ct. 367; Monongahela Bridge Co. v. United States, \n216 \nU.S. 177, 193\n, 30 S.Ct. 356; Philadelphia Co. v. Stimson, \n223 \nU.S. 605, 638\n, 32 S.Ct. 340. Upon this principle rests the authority of the Interstate Commerce Commission, in the execution of the declared policy of the Congress in enforcing reasonable rates, in preventing undue preferences and unjust discriminations, in requiring suitable facilities for transportation in interstate commerce, and in exercising other powers held to have been validly conferred. St. Louis, I.M. & S. Ry. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281, 287\n, 28 S.Ct. 616; Inter-Mountain Rate Cases, \n234 \nU.S. 476, 486\n, 34 S.Ct. 986; Avent v. United States, \n266 \nU.S. 127, 130\n, 45 S.Ct. 34; New York Central Securities Corporation \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 428]\n\u00a0\n v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 25 S., 53 S.Ct. 45. Upon a similar ground the authority given to the President, in appropriate relation to his functions as Commander-in-Chief, by the Trading with the Enemy Act, as amended by the Act of March 28, 1918 (40 Stat. 460,  12 (50 USCA Appendix  12)), with respect to the disposition of enemy property, was sustained. 'The determination,' said the Court, 'of the terms of sales of enemy properties in the light of facts and conditions from time to time arising in the progress of war was not the making of a law; it was the application of the general rule laid down by the act.' United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 \nU.S. 1, 12\n, 47 S.Ct. 1, 5.12\n The provisions of the Radio Act of 1927 (44 Stat. 1162, 1163), providing for assignments of frequencies or wave lengths to various stations, afford another instance. In granting licenses, the Radio Commission is required to act 'as public convenience, interest, or necessity requires.' Section 4. In construing this provision, the Court found that the statute itself declared the policy as to 'equality of radio broadcasting service, both of transmission and of reception,' and that it conferred authority to make allocations and assignments in order to secure, according to stated criteria, an equitable adjustment in the distribution of facilities. \n13\n The standard set up was not so indefinite 'as to confer an unlimited power.' Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Brothers Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 279\n, 285 S., 53 S.Ct. 627, 634.\n So also, from the beginning of the government, the Congress has conferred upon executive officers the power to make regulations-'not for the government of their departments, but for administering the laws which did govern.' United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506, 517\n, 31 S.Ct. 480, 483. Such regulations become, indeed, binding rules of con- \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 429]\n\u00a0\n duct, but they are valid only as subordinate rules and when found to be within the framework of the policy which the Legislature has sufficiently defined. In the case of Grimaud, supra, a regulation made by the Secretary of Agriculture requiring permits for grazing sheep on a forest reserve of lands belonging to the United States was involved. The Court referred to the various acts for the establishment and management of forest reservations and the authorization of rules which would 'insure the objects of such reservations,' that is, 'to regulate their occupancy and use, and to preserve the forests thereon from destruction.' The Court observed that 'it was impracticable for Congress to provide general regulations for these various and varying details of management,' and that, in authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to meet local conditions, Congress 'was merely conferring administrative functions upon an agent, and not delegating to him legislative power.' Id., pages 515, 516 of 220 U. S., 31 S.Ct. 480, 482. The Court quoted with approval the statement of the principle in Field v. Clark, supra, that the Congress cannot delegate legislative power, and upheld the regulation in question as an administrative rule for the appropriate execution of the policy laid down in the statute. See Wayman v. Southard, supra; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Goodrich Transit Co., \n224 \nU.S. 194, 214\n, 215 S., 32 S.Ct. 436; Selective Draft Law Cases, \n245 \nU.S. 366, 389\n, 38 S.Ct. 159, L.R.A. 1918C, 361, Ann.Cas. 1918B, 856; McKinley v. United States, \n249 \nU.S. 397\n, 39 S.Ct. 324.\n The applicable considerations were reviewed in Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S.Ct. 348, 352, where the Court dealt with the so-called 'flexible tariff provision' of the Act of September 21, 1922 (42 Stat. 858, 941, 942,  315 (19 USCA  154-159)), and with the authority which it conferred upon the President. The Court applied the same principle that permitted the Congress to exercise its ratemaking power in interstate commerce, and found that a similar provision was justified for the fixing of customs duties; that is, as the Court said: 'If Congress shall lay down by \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 430]\n\u00a0\n legislative act an intelligible principle to which the person or body authorized to fix such rates is directed to conform, such legislative action is not a forbidden delegation of legislative power. If it is thought wise to vary the customs duties according to changing conditions of production at home and abroad, it may authorize the Chief Executive to carry out this purpose, with the advisory assistance of a Tariff Commission appointed under congressional authority.' The Court sustained the provision upon the authority of Field v. Clark, supra, repeating with approval what was there said, that 'What the President was required to do was merely in execution of the act of Congress.' Id., pages 409-411 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 348, 352.\n Thus, in every case in which the question has been raised, the Court has recognized that there are limits of delegation which there is no constitutional authority to transcend. We think that section 9(c) goes beyond those limits. As to the transportation of oil production in excess of state permission, the Congress has declared no policy, has established no standard, has laid down no rule. There is no requirement, no definition of circumstances and conditions in which the transportation is to be allowed or prohibited.\n If section 9(c) were held valid, it would be idle to pretend that anything would be left of limitations upon the power of the Congress to delegate its lawmaking function. The reasoning of the many decisions we have reviewed would be made vacuous and their distinctions nugatory. Instead of performing its lawmaking function, the Congress could at will and as to such subjects as it chooses transfer that function to the President or other officer or to an administrative body. The question is not of the intrinsic importance of the particular statute before us, but of the constitutional processes of legislation which are an essential part of our system of government. \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 431]\n\u00a0\n Sixth. There is another objection to the validity of the prohibition laid down by the executive order under section 9(c). The executive order contains no finding, no statement of the grounds of the President's action in enacting the prohibition. Both section 9(c) and the executive order are in notable contrast with historic practice (as shown by many statutes and proclamations we have cited in the margin14) by which declarations of policy are made by the Congress and delegations are within the framework of that policy and have relation to facts and conditions to be found and stated by the President in the appropriate exercise of the delegated authority. If it could be said that from the four corners of the statute any possible inference could be drawn of particular circumstances or conditions which were to govern the exercise of the authority conferred, the President could not act validly without having regard to those circumstances and conditions. And findings by him as to the existence of the required basis of his action would be necessary to sustain that action, for otherwise the case would still be one of an unfettered discretion as the qualification of authority would be ineffectual. The point is pertinent in relation to the first section of the National Industrial Recovery Act. We have said that the first section is but a general introduction, that it declares no policy and defines no standard with respect to the transportation which is the subject of section 9(c). But if from the extremely broad description contained in that section and the widely different matters to which the section refers, it were possible to derive a statement of prerequisites to the President's action under section 9(c), it would still be necessary for the President to comply with those conditions and to show that compliance as the ground of his prohibition. To hold \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 432]\n\u00a0\n that he is free to select as he chooses from the many and various objects generally described in the first section, and then to act without making any finding with respect to any object that he does select, and the circumstances properly related to that object, would be in effect to make the conditions inoperative and to invest him with an uncontrolled legislative power.\n We are not dealing with action which, appropriately belonging to the executive province, is not the subject of judicial review or with the presumptions attaching to executive action. \n15\n To repeat, we are concerned with the question of the delegation of legislative power. If the citizen is to be punished for the crime of violating a legislative order of an executive officer, or of a board or commission, due process of law requires that it shall appear that the order is within the authority of the officer, board, or commission, and, if that authority depends on determinations of fact, those determinations must be shown. As the Court said in Wichita Railroad & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n260 \nU.S. 48, 59\n, 43 S.Ct. 51, 55: 'In creating such an administrative agency, the Legislature, to prevent its being a pure delegation of legislative power, must enjoin upon it a certain course of procedure and certain rules of decision in the performance of its function. It is a wholesome and necessary principle that such an agency must pursue the procedure and rules enjoined, and show a substantial compliance therewith to give validity to its action. When, therefore, such an administrative agency is required as a condition precedent to an order, to make a finding of facts, the validity of the order must rest upon the needed finding. If it is lacking, the order is ineffective. \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 433]\n\u00a0\n It is pressed on us that the lack of an express finding may be supplied by implication and by reference to the averments of the petition invoking the action of the Commission. We cannot agree to this.' Referring to the ruling in the Wichita Case, the Court said in Mahler v. Eby, \n264 \nU.S. 32, 44\n, 44 S.Ct. 283, 288: 'We held that the order in that case, made after a hearing and ordering a reduction, was void for lack of the express finding in the order. We put this conclusion, not only on the language of the statute, but also on general principles of constitutional government.' We cannot regard the President as immune from the application of these constitutional principles. When the President is invested with legislative authority as the delegate of Congress in carrying out a declared policy, he necessarily acts under the constitutional restriction applicable to such a delegation.\n We see no escape from the conclusion that the Executive Orders of July 11, 1933, and July 14, 1933, Nos. 6199, 6204 (15 USCA  709 note), and the regulations issued by the Secretary of the Interior thereunder, are without constitutional authority.\n The decrees of the Circuit Court of Appeals are reversed, and the causes are remanded to the District Court, with direction to modify its decrees in conformity with this opinion so as to grant permanent injunctions, restraining the defendants from enforcing those orders and regulations.\n It is so ordered.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n With all that is said in the opinion of the court as to the Code of Fair Competition adopted by the President August 16, 1933, for the Governance of the Petroleum Industry, I am fully in accord. No question is before us at this time as to the power of Congress to regulate production. No question is here as to its competence to clothe the President with a delegated power whereby a code of fair competition may become invested with the force of \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 434]\n\u00a0\n law. The petitioners were never in jeopardy by force of such a code or of regulations made thereunder. They were not in jeopardy because there was neither statute nor regulation subjecting them to pains or penalties if they set the code at naught. One must deplore the administrative methods that brought about uncertainty for a time as to the terms of executive orders intended to be law. Even so, the petitioners do not stand in need of an injunction to restrain the enforcement of a non-existent mandate.\n I am unable to assent to the conclusion that section 9(c) of the National Recovery Act, 15 USCA  709(c), a section delegating to the President a very different power from any that is involved in the regulation of production or in the promulgation of a code, is to be nullified upon the ground that his discretion is too broad or for any other reason. My point of difference with the majority of the court is narrow. I concede that to uphold the delegation there is need to discover in the terms of the act a standard reasonably clear whereby discretion must be governed. I deny that such a standard is lacking in respect of the prohibitions permitted by this section when the act with all its reasonable implications is considered as a whole. What the standard is becomes the pivotal inquiry.\n As to the nature of the act which the President is authorized to perform there is no need for implication. That at least is definite beyond the possibility of challenge. He may prohibit the transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum and the products thereof produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted by any state law or valid regulation or order prescribed thereunder. He is not left to roam at will among all the possible subjects of interstate transportation, picking and choosing as he pleases. I am far from asserting now that delegation would be \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 435]\n\u00a0\n valid if accompanied by all that latitude of choice. In the laying of his interdict he is to confine himself to a particular commodity, and to that commodity when produced or withdrawn from storage in contravention of the policy and statutes of the states. He has choice, though within limits, as to the occasion, but none whatever as to the means. The means have been prescribed by Congress. There has been no grant to the Executive of any roving commission to inquire into evils and then, upon discovering them, do anything he pleases. His act being thus defined, what else must he ascertain in order to regulate his discretion and bring the power into play? The answer is not given if we look to section 9(c) only, but it comes to us by implication from a view of other sections where the standards are defined. The prevailing opinion concedes that a standard will be as effective if imported into section 9(c) by reasonable implication as if put there in so many words. If we look to the whole structure of the statute, the test is plainly this, that the President is to forbid the transportation of the oil when he believes, in the light of the conditions of the industry as disclosed from time to time, that the prohibition will tend to effectuate the declared policies of the act-not merely his own conception of its policies, undirected by any extrinsic guide, but the policies announced by section 1 (15 USCA  701) in the forefront of the statute as an index to the meaning of everything that follows. \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[293 U.S. 388, 436]\n\u00a0\n Oil produced or transported in excess of a statutory quota is known in the industry as 'hot oil,' and the record is replete with evidence as to the effect of such production and transportation upon the economic situation and upon national recovery. A declared policy of Congress in the adoption of the act is 'to eliminate unfair competitive practices.' Beyond question an unfair competitive practice exists when 'hot oil' is transported in interstate commerce with the result that lawabiding dealers must compete with lawbreakers. Here is one of the standards set up in the act to guide the President's discretion. Another declared policy of Congress is 'to conserve natural resources.' Beyond question the disregard of statutory quotas is wasting the oil fields in Texas and other states and putting in jeopardy of exhaustion one of the treasures of the nation. All this is developed in the record and in the arguments of counsel for the government with a wealth of illustration. Here is a second standard. Another declared policy of Congress is to 'promote the fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of industries,' and 'except as may be temporarily required' to 'avoid undue restriction of production.' Beyond question prevailing conditions in the oil industry have brought about the need for temporary restriction in order to promote in the long run the fullest productive capacity of business in all its many \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 437]\n\u00a0\n branches, for the effect of present practices is to diminish that capacity by demoralizing prices and thus increasing unemployment. The ascertainment of these facts at any time or place was a task too intricate and special to be performed by Congress itself through a general enactment in advance of the event. All that Congress could safely do was to declare the act to be done and the policies to be promoted, leaving to the delegate of its power the ascertainment of the shifting facts that would determine the relation between the doing of the act and the attainment of the stated ends. That is what it did. It said to the President, in substance: You are to consider whether the transportation of oil in excess of the statutory quotas is offensive to one or more of the policies enumerated in section 1, whether the effect of such conduct is to promote unfair competition or to waste the natural resources or to demoralize prices or to increase unemployment or to reduce the purchasing power of the workers of the nation. If these standards or some of them have been flouted with the result of a substantial obstruction to industrial recovery, you may then by a prohibitory order eradicate the mischief.\n I am not unmindful of the argument that the President has the privilege of choice between one standard and another, acting or failing to act according to an estimate of values that is individual and personal. To describe his conduct thus is to ignore the essence of his function. What he does is to inquire into the industrial facts as they exist from time to time. Cf. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 U.S. 394\n, at page 409, 48 S.Ct. 348; Locke's Appeal, 72 Pa. 491, 498, 13 Am.Rep. 716, quoted with approval in Field v. Clark, \n143 U.S. 649\n, at page 694, 12 S.Ct. 495. These being ascertained, he is not to prefer one standard to another in any subjective attitude of mind, in any personal or willful way. He is to study the facts objectively, the violation of a standard \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 438]\n\u00a0\n impelling him to action or inaction according to its observed effect upon industrial recovery-the ultimate end, as appears by the very heading of the title, to which all the other ends are tributary and mediate. Nor is there any essential conflict among the standards inter se, at all events when they are viewed in relation to section 9 (c) and the power there conferred. In its immediacy, the exclusion of oil from the channels of transportation is a restriction of interstate commerce, not a removal of obstructions. This is self-evident, and, of course, was understood by Congress when the discretionary power of exclusion was given to its delegate. But what is restriction in its immediacy may in its ultimate and larger consequences be expansion and development. Congress was aware that for the recovery of national well-being there might be need of temporary restriction upon production in one industry or another. It said so in section 1. When it clothed the President with power to impose such a restriction-to prohibit the flow of oil illegally produced-it laid upon him a mandate to inquire and determine whether the conditions in that particular industry were such at any given time as to make restriction helpful to the declared objectives of the act and to the ultimate attainment of industrial recovery. If such a situation does not present an instance of lawful delegation in a typical and classic form (Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649\n, 12 S.Ct. 495; United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506\n, 31 S.Ct. 480; Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S.Ct. 348), categories long established will have to be formulated anew.\n In what has been written, I have stated, but without developing the argument, that by reasonable implication the power conferred upon the President by section 9(c) is to be read as if coupled with the words that he shall exercise the power whenever satisfied that by doing so he will effectuate the policy of the statute as theretofore declared. Two canons of interpretation, each familiar to our law, \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 439]\n\u00a0\n leave no escape from that conclusion. One is that the meaning of a statute is to be looked for, not in any single section, but in all the parts together and in their relation to the end in view. Cherokee Intermarriage Cases (Red Bird v. U.S.), \n203 \nU.S. 76, 89\n, 27 S.Ct. 29; McKee v. United States, \n164 \nU.S. 287\n, 17 S.Ct. 92; Talbott v. Board of Com'rs of Silver Bow County, \n139 \nU.S. 438, 443\n, 444 S., 11 S.Ct. 594. The other is that, when a statute is reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, by one of which it is unconstitutional and by the other valid, the court prefers the meaning that preserves to the meaning that destroys. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co., \n213 \nU.S. 366, 407\n, 29 S.Ct. 527; Knights Templars' & Masons' Life Indemnity Co. v. Jarman, \n187 \nU.S. 197, 205\n, 23 S.Ct. 108. Plainly, section 1, with its declaration of the will of Congress, is the chart that has been furnished to the President to enable him to shape his course among the reefs and shallows of this act. If there could be doubt as to this when section 1 (15 USCA  701) is viewed alone, the doubt would be dispelled by the reiteration of the policy in the sections that come later. In section 2 (15 USCA  702). which relates to administrative agencies, in section 3 (15 USCA  703), which relates to codes of fair competition, in section 4 (15 USCA  704), which relates to agreements and licenses, in section 6 (15 USCA  706), which prescribes limitations upon the application of the statute, and in section 10 (15 USCA  710), which permits the adoption of rules and regulations, authority is conferred upon the President to do one or more acts as the delegate of Congress when he is satisfied that thereby he will aid 'in effectuating the policy of this title' or in carrying out its provisions. True section 9 (15 USCA  709), the one relating to petroleum, does not by express words of reference embody the same standard, yet nothing different can have been meant. What, indeed, is the alternative? Either the statute means that the President is to adhere to the declared policy of Congress, or it means that he is to exercise a merely arbitrary will. The one construction invigorates the act; the other saps its life. A choice between them is not hard. \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 440]\n\u00a0\n I am persuaded that a reference, express or implied, to the policy of Congress as declared in section 1, is a sufficient definition of a standard to make the statute valid. Discretion is not unconfined and vagrant. It is canalized within banks that keep it from overflowing. Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649\n, 12 S.Ct. 495, United States v. Grimaud, \n220 \nU.S. 506\n, 31 S.Ct. 480, and Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 394\n, 48 S.Ct. 348, state the applicable principle. Under these decisions the separation of powers between the Executive and Congress is not a doctrinaire concept to be made use of with pedantic rigor. There must be sensible approximation, there must be elasticity of adjustment, in response to the practical necessities of government, which cannot foresee to-day the developments of tomorrow in their nearly infinite variety. The Interstate Commerce Commission, probing the economic situation of the railroads of the country, consolidating them into systems, shaping in numberless ways their capacities and duties, and even making or unmaking the prosperity of great communities (Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 627\n, 53 S.Ct. 768 ), is a conspicuous illustration. See, e.g., 41 Stat. 479-482, c. 91,  405, 406, 407, 408, 42 Stat. 27, c. 20, 49 U.S.C.  3, 4, 5 (49 USCA  3- 5). Cf. Inter-Mountain Rate Case (U.S. v. Atchison, T. & S.F.R. Co.), \n234 \nU.S. 476\n, 34 S.Ct. 986; N.Y. Central Securities Co. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 25 S., 53 S.Ct. 45; Sharfman, The Interstate Commerce Commission, vol. 2, pp. 357, 365. There could surely be no question as to the validity of an act whereby carriers would be prohibited from transporting oil produced in contravention of a statute if in the judgment of the Commission the practice was demoralizing the market and bringing disorder and insecurity into the national economy. What may be delegated to a commission may be delegated to the President. 'Congress may feel itself unable conveniently to determine exactly when its exercise of the legislative power should become effective, because dependent on future conditions, and it may leave \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 441]\n\u00a0\n the determination of such time to the decision of an executive.' Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, supra, at page 407 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 348, 351. Only recently (1932) the whole subject was discussed with much enlightenment in the Report by the Committee on Ministers' Powers to the Lord Chancellor of Great Britain. See, especially, pages 23, 51. In the complex life of to-day, the business of government could not go on without the delegation, in greater or less degree, of the power to adapt the rule to the swiftly moving facts.\n A striking illustration of this need is found in the very industry affected by this section, the production of petroleum and its transportation between the states. At the passage of the National Recovery Act (48 Stat. 195) no one could be certain how many of the states would adopt valid quota laws, or how generally the laws would be observed when adopted, or to what extent illegal practices would affect honest competitors or the stability of prices or the conservation of natural resources or the return of industrial prosperity. Much would depend upon conditions as they shaped themselves thereafter. Violations of the state laws might turn out to be so infrequent that the honest competitor would suffer little, if any, damage. The demand for oil might be so reduced that there would be no serious risk of waste, depleting or imperiling the resources of the nation. Apart from these possibilities, the business might become stabilized through voluntary co-operation or the adoption of a code or otherwise. Congress not unnaturally was unwilling to attach to the state laws a sanction so extreme as the cutting off of the privilege of interstate commerce unless the need for such action had unmistakably developed. What was left to the President was to ascertain the conditions prevailing in the industry, and prohibit or fail to prohibit according to the effect of those conditions upon the phases of the national policy relevant thereto. \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 442]\n\u00a0\n From a host of precedents available, both legislative and judicial, I cite a few as illustrations. By an act approved June 4, 1794, during the administration of Washington (1 Stat. 372; Field v. Clark, \n143 \nU.S. 649, 683\n, 12 S.Ct. 495) Congress authorized the President, when Congress was not in session, and for a prescribed period 'whenever, in his opinion, the public safety shall so require, to lay an embargo on all ships and vessels in the ports or the United States, or upon the ships and vessels of the United States, or the ships and vessels of any foreign nation, under such regulations as the circumstances of the case may require, and to continue or revoke the same, whenever he shall think proper.' By an act of 1799, February 9 (1 Stat. 613, 615,  4), suspending commercial intercourse with France and its dependencies, 'it shall be lawful for the President of the United States, if he shall deem it expedient and consistent with the interest of the United States, by his order, to remit, and discontinue, for the time being, the restraints and prohibitions aforesaid; ... and also to revoke such order (i.e., ree stablish the restraints), whenever, in his opinion, the interest of the United States shall require.' By an act of October 1, 1890 (26 Stat. 567, 612), sustained in Field v. Clark, supra, the President was authorized to suspend by proclamation the free introduction into this country of enumerated articles when satisfied that a country producing them imposes duties or other exactions upon the agricultural or other products of the United States which he may deem to be reciprocally unequal or unreasonable. By an act of September 21, 1922 (42 Stat. 858, 941, 945 (19 USCA  154- 159, 182 et seq.)), sustained in Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, supra, the President was empowered to increase or decrease tariff duties so as to equalize the differences between the costs of production at home and abroad, and empowered, by the same means, to give redress for other acts of discrimination or unfairness 'when he finds that the public interest will be \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 443]\n\u00a0\n served thereby.' 19 USCA  182. Delegation was not confined to an inquiry into the necessity or occasion for the change. It included the magnitude of the change, the delegate thus defining the act to be performed. By an act of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 11, 35), amended in 1905 (33 Stat. 628), regulating the forest reservations of the nation, the purpose of the reservations was declared to be 'to improve and protect the forest within the reservation,' and to secure 'favorable conditions of water flows, and to furnish a continuous supply of timber for the use and necessities of citizens of the United States.' Without further guide or standard, the Secretary of Agriculture was empowered to 'make such rules and regulations and establish such service as will insure the objects of such reservations, namely, to regulate their occupancy and use and to preserve the forests thereon from destruction.' The validity of these provisions was upheld in United States v. Grimaud, supra, as against the claim by one who violated the rules that there had been an unlawful delegation. Many other precedents are cited in the margin. \n2\n They teach one lesson and a clear one.\n There is no fear that the nation will drift from its ancient moorings as the result of the narrow delegation of power permitted by this section. What can be done under cover of that permission is closely and clearly circumscribed both as to subject-matter and occasion. The statute was framed in the shadow of a national disaster. A host of unforeseen contingencies would have to be faced from day to day, and faced with a fullness of under \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 444]\n\u00a0\n standing unattainable by any one except the man upon the scene. The President was chosen to meet the instant need.\n A subsidiary question remains as to the form of the executive order, which is copied in the margin. \n3\n The question is a subsidiary one, for, unless the statute is invalid, another order with fuller findings or recitals may correct the informalities of this one, if informalities there are. But the order to my thinking is valid as it stands. The President was not required either by the Constitution or by any statute to state the reasons that had induced him to exercise the granted power. It is enough that the grant of power had been made and that pursuant to that grant he had signified the will to act. The will to act being declared, the law presumes that the declaration was preceded by due inquiry and that it was rooted in sufficient grounds. Such, for a hundred years and more, has been the doctrine of this court. The act of February 28, 1795 (1 Stat. 424), authorized the President 'whenever the United States shall be invaded, or be in imminent danger of invasion from any foreign nation or Indian tribe,' to call forth such number of the militia of the states as he shall deem necessary and to issue his \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 445]\n\u00a0\n orders to the appropriate officers for that purpose. Cf. Const. art. 1,  8, cl. 15. When war threatened in the summer of 1812, President Madison, acting under the authority of that statute, directed Major General Dearborn to requisition from New York, Massachusetts, and Connecticut certain numbers of the states' militia. American State Papers, Military Affairs, vol. 1, pp. 322-325. No finding of 'imminent danger of invasion' was made by the President in any express way, nor was such a finding made by the Secretary of War or any other official. The form of the requisitions to Massachusetts and Connecticut appears in the state papers of the government (American State Papers, supra); the form of those to New York was almost certainly the same. Replevin was brought by a New York militia man who refused to obey the orders, and whose property had been taken in payment of a fine imposed by a court martial. The defendant, a deputy marshal, defended on the ground that the orders were valid, and the plaintiff demurred because there was no allegation that the President had adjudged that there was imminent danger of an invasion. The case came to this court. Martin v. Mott, 12 Wheat. 19, 32. In an opinion by Story, J., the court upheld the seizure. 'The argument is (he wrote) that the power confided to the president is a limited power, and can be exercised only in the cases pointed out in the statute, and therefore, it is necessary to aver the facts which bring the exercise within the purview of the statute. In short, the same principles are sought t be applied to the delegation and exercise of this power intrusted to the executive of the nation for great political purposes, as might be applied to the humblest officer in the government, acting upon the most narrow and special authority. It is the opinion of the court, that this objection cannot be maintained. When the president exercises an authority confided to him by law, the presumption is, that it is exercised in pursuance \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 446]\n\u00a0\n of law. Every public officer is presumed to act in obedience to his duty, until the contrary is shown; and, a fortiori, this presumption ought to be favor ably applied to the chief magistrate of the Union. It is not necessary to aver, that the act which he might rightfully do, was so done.' A like presumption has been applied in other cases and in a great variety of circumstances. Philadelphia & Trenton R. Co. v. Stimpson, 14 Pet. 448, 458; Rankin v. Hoyt, 4 How. 327, 335; Carpenter v. Rannels, 19 Wall. 138, 146; Confiscation Cases ( U.S. v. Clarke), 20 Wall. 92, 109; Knox County v. Ninth National Bank, \n147 \nU.S. 91, 97\n, 13 S.Ct. 267; United States v. Chemical Foundation, \n272 \nU.S. 1, 14\n, 15 S., 47 S.Ct. 1. This does not mean that the individual is helpless in the face of usurpation. A court will not revise the discretion of the Executive, sitting in judgment on his order as if it were the verdict of a jury. Martin v. Mott, supra. On the other hand, we have said that his order may not stand if it is an act of mere oppression, an arbitrary fiat that overleaps the bounds of judgment. Sterling v. Constantin, \n287 \nU.S. 378, 399\n, 400 S., 401, 53 S.Ct. 190. The complainants and others in their position may show, if they can, that in no conceivable aspect was there anything in the conditions of the oil industry in July, 1933, to establish a connection between the prohibitory order and the declared policies of the Congress. This is merely to say that the standard must be such as to have at least a possible relation to the act to be performed under the delegated power. One can hardly suppose that a prohibitory order would survive a test in court if the Executive were to assert a relation between the transportation of petroleum and the maintenance of the gold standard or the preservation of peace in Europe or the Orient. On the other hand, there can be no challenge of such a mandate unless the possibility of a rational nexus is lacking alto- \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 447]\n\u00a0\n gether. Here, in the case at hand, the relation between the order and the standard is manifest upon the face of the transaction from facts so notorious as to be within the range of our judicial notice. There is significance in the fact that it is not challenged even now.\n The President, when acting in the exercise of a delegated power, is not a quasi judicial officer, whose rulings are subject to review upon certiorari or appeal (Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 265\n, 44 S.Ct. 317; cf. Givens v. Zerbst, \n255 \nU.S. 11, 20\n, 41 S.Ct. 227), or an administrative agency supervised in the same way. Officers and bodies such as those may be required by reviewing courts to express their decision in formal and explicit findings to the end that review may be intelligent. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n, 51 S.Ct. 119; Beaumont, Sour Lake & Western R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74, 86\n, 51 S.Ct. 1; United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n293 \nU.S. 454\n, 55 S.Ct. 268, Jan. 7, 1935. Cf. Public Service Commission of Wisconsin v. Wisconsin Telephone Co ., \n289 \nU.S. 67\n, 53 S.Ct. 514. Such is not the position or duty of the President. He is the Chief Executive of the nation, exercising a power committed to him by Congress, and subject, in respect of the formal qualities of his acts, to the restrictions, if any, accompanying the grant, but not to any others. One will not find such restrictions either in the statute itself or in the Constitution back of it. The Constitution of the United States is not a code of civil practice.\n The prevailing opinion cites Wichita Railroad & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Kansas, \n260 \nU.S. 48\n, 43 S.Ct. 51, and Mahler v. Eby, \n264 \nU.S. 32, 44\n, 44 S.Ct. 283. One dealt with a delegation to a public utilities commission of the power to reduce existing rates if they were found to be unreasonable; the other a delegation to the Secretary of Labor of the power to deport aliens found after notice and a hearing to be undesirable residents. In each it was a \n\n[293 U.S. 388, 448]\n\u00a0\n specific requirement of the statute that the basic fact conditioning action by the administrative agency be stated in a finding and stated there expressly. If legislative power is delegated subject to a condition, it is a requirement of constitutional government that the condition be fulfilled. In default of such fulfillment, there is in truth no delegation, and hence no official action, but only the vain show of it. The analogy is remote between power so conditioned and that in controversy here.\n Discretionary action does not become subject to review because the discretion is legislative rather than executive. If the reasons for the prohibition now in controversy had been stated in the order, the jurisdiction of the courts would have been no greater and no less. Investigation resulting in an order directed against a particular person after notice and a hearing is not to be confused with investigation preliminary and incidental to the formulation of a rule. An embargo under the act of 1794 would have been more than a nullity though there had been a failure to recite that what was done was essential to the public safety or to enumerate the reasons leading to that conclusion. If findings are necessary as a preamble to general regulations, the requirement must be looked for elsewhere than in the Constitution of the nation.\n There are other questions as to the validity of section 9(c), 15 USCA  709(c), in matters unrelated to the delegation of power to the President, and also questions as to the regulations adopted in behalf of the President by the Secretary of the Interior. They are not considered in the prevailing opinion. However, they have been well reviewed and disposed of in the opinion of Sibley, J., writing for the court below. It is unnecessary at this time to dwell upon them further.\n The decree in each case should be affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The full text of the Executive Order of July 11, 1933, is as follows:\n'Executive Order\n\n'Prohibition of Transportation in Interstate and Foreign Commerce of Petroleum and the Products Thereof Unlawfully Produced or Withdrawn from Storage.\n\n'By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Act of Congress entitled 'An Act To encourage national industrial recovery, to foster fair competition, and to provide for the construction of certain useful public works, and for other purposes,' approved June 16, 1933 (Public No. 67, 73d Congress), the transportation in interstate and foreign commerce of petroleum and the products thereof produced or withdrawn from storage in excess of the amount permitted to be produced or withdrawn from storage by any State law or valid regulation or order prescribed thereunder, by any board, commission, officer, or other duly authorized agency of a State, is hereby prohibited.\n\n'Franklin D.

A national emergency productive of widespread unemployment and disorganization of industry, which burdens interstate and foreign commerce, affects the public welfare, and undermines the standards of living of the American people, is hereby declared to exist. It is hereby declared to be the policy of Congress to remove obstructions to the free flow of interstate and foreign commerce which tend to diminish the amount thereof; and to provide for the general welfare by promoting the organization of industry for the purpose of cooperative action among trade groups, to induce and maintain united action of labor and management under adequate governmental sanctions and supervision, to eliminate unfair competitive practices, to promote the fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of industries, to avoid undue restriction of production (except as may be temporarily required), to increase the consumption of industrial and agricultural products by increasing purchasing power, to reduce and relieve unemployment, to improve standards of labor, and otherwise to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural resources.' \n\n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] Acts of June 4, 1794, 1 Stat. 372; March 3, 1795, 1 Stat. 444; June 13, 1798, 1 Stat. 565, 566; February 9, 1799, 1 Stat. 613, 615; February 27, 1800, 2 Stat. 7, 9, 10; March 3, 1805, 2 Stat. 339, 341, 342; February 28, 1806, 2 Stat. 351, 352; April 22, 1808, 2 Stat. 490. \n[\nFootnote 8\n] Marshall's Life of Washington, vol. 2, p. 319 et seq. \n[\nFootnote 9\n] Thus, prior to the Act of June 4, 1794 (1 Stat. 372), the Congress had laid embargoes, for limited periods, upon vessels in ports of the United States bound to foreign ports. Resolutions of March 26, 1794, and April 18, 1794, 1 Stat. 400, 401. Fearing that the national safety might be endangered, the President, by the Act of June 4, 1794, was authorized to lay an embargo, with appropriate regulations, whenever he found that 'the public safety shall so require' (section 1), the authority not to be exercised while the Congress was in session and the embargo to be limited in any case to 15 days after the commencement of the next session. The Act of March 3, 1795 (1 Stat. 444), authorizing the President to permit the exportation of arms, etc., was 'in cases connected with the security of the commercial interest of the United States, and for public purposes only.' By the Act of June 13, 1798 (1 Stat. 565), commercial intercourse was suspended between the United States and France and its dependencies. The act was to continue only until the end of the next session of Congress, and it was provided (section 5) that if, before the next session, the government of France 'shall clearly disavow, and shall be found to refrain from the aggressions, depredations and hostilities' against the vessels and other property of citizens of the United States, and shall acknowledge the neutrality of the United States, 'it shall be lawful for the President,' 'being well ascertained of the premises,' to remit and discontinue the prohibitions and restraints imposed by the act and to make proclamation accordingly. (continued on p. 423) \n The Act of February 9, 1799 (1 Stat. 613), further suspended commercial intercourse between the United States and France and its dependencies until March 3, 1800, and gave a similar authority (section 4) to the President to remit and discontinue the restraints and prohibitions of the act, 'if he shall deem it expedient and consistent with the interest of the United States,' either with respect to the French Republic or to any place belonging to that republic, 'with which a commercial intercourse may safely be renewed,' and to revoke such order if he found that the interest of the United States so required. The suspension of commercial intercourse was renewed by the Act of February 27, 1800 (2 Stat. 7) until March 3, 1801, with a similar provision as to the authority of the President. The Act of March 3, 1805 (2 Stat. 339), related to persons committing treason, felony, etc., within the jurisdiction of the United States and taking refuge in foreign armed vessels, and the authority to the President to permit or prevent the entry of such vessels into the waters of the United States (section 4) was 'in order to prevent insults to the authority of the laws, whereby the peace of the United States with foreign nations may be endangered.'

STATE HIGHWAY COMMISSION OF(1935)\nNo. 412\nArgued: March 13, 1935Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. G. J. Neuner, of Kansas City, Mo., and Chester J. Gerkin, of New York City, for appellant. \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 614]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Otho W. Lomax, of Topeka, Kan., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The Kansas highway commission, administrative agency of the state, without any proceeding in condemnation, ordered the appellant company to make specified changes in its transmission lines. It refused. By an original proceeding in the Supreme Court, the commis- \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 615]\n\u00a0\n sion obtained a peremptory writ of mandamus directing compliance. The company insists that to enforce the commission's order would deprive it of property without due process of law, contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.\n Judgment went for the commission upon the pleadings; there is no dispute concerning the facts; the validity of the statute said to authorize the order is challenged.\n Appellant, a Delaware corporation with power to construct and maintain conduits for transporting natural gas, obtained authority to do business in Kansas, May 21, 1930, and during that year purchased from the owners rights of way for pipes, auxiliary telephone lines, etc. Thereafter these were constructed; the gas passes in both interstate and intrastate commerce.\n The commission, created under chapter 225, Acts of 1929, is charged with the duty to lay out, open, relocate, alter, redesignate, and re- establish highways throughout the state. Section 16 of that statute (Supp. Rev. Stats. 1931, also 1933, 68-415)-copied in the margin1-undertakes to \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 616]\n\u00a0\n grant power to require removal of abutments, wires, and pipe lines and other fixtures now upon state highways from the present locations thereon to other designated parts of the right of way. Unless imposed by this section, there are no statutory obligations upon pipe line companies with respect to the construction, maintenance, or operation of their lines, whether located upon public highways or private lands.\n After the pipes were in operation-1933-the commission adopted plans for new highways across the company's right of way at six widely separated places. Permission of the owners of the fee to use the necessary land was obtained; but appellant declined to permit the use of its right of way.\n Plans for the new highways called for material changes in the pipe and telephone lines at the crossings-removals, lowerings, casements- estimated to cost above $5,000. All parties admit that the commission could not make these with reasonable safety; appellant was willing to do the work if promised repayment of the necessary expense. Purporting to act under section 16 (December 1, 1933), the commission ordered it to proceed without compensation. That the proposed changes would be proper for new highways as planned is admitted; also that the estimated cost \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 617]\n\u00a0\n is reasonable. But appellant denied the existence of power to impose this expense upon it; and for that reason refused to comply with the order until the commission should agree to refund the outlay.\n In its opinion supporting the peremptory mandamus, the court below declared:\n'The pipe line company's lines are all located on its own rights of way, procured from landowners, and none of the lines is located on, along, or across any previously existing highway. ...\n\n'The highway commission has acquired rights of way for the highway improvements from landowners, but has not obtained consent of the pipe line company to cross or occupy its rights of way. The highway improvements necessitate certain changes in the pipe line company's lines. In some instances it is necessary the pipe line be lowered and encased. In other instances it is necessary the pipe line be encased. In other instances it is necessary the pipe line and telephone line be removed to the outer edge of right of way newly acquired by the highway commission for the purpose of widening existing highways. None of the changes will require the pipe line company to acquire any new or additional right of way. ...\n\n'The pipe line company contends that, because its rights of way were acquired and its structures were installed before the present highway rights of way had been obtained and the present improvements had been initiated, it is entitled to compensation for all necessary expenditures incurred in making an adjustment of its private use to the later public use of the same rights of way. ...\n\n'What the highway commission seeks to do is to execute the police power of the state to make public travel on the highways safe. Reasonable regulations to that end may be enforced without compensation to co-users of the highway whose structures make public travel \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 618]\n\u00a0\n unsafe; and, because the public use is paramount and public safety is the desideratum, it makes no difference whether the highway was established before or after the privately owned structures were established. ...\n\n'There is no contention that exercise of the state's police power over the subject may not be committed to the state highway commission, and this was in fact done by chapter 225, Laws 1929. ...\n\n'Section 16 of the statute provides in effect that whenever a pipe line is constructed along, upon, or across any highway, its location is subject to control by the highway commission. ... With route fixed, right of way procured, plans adopted, and the highway commission engaged in executing them, the new and widened highways are, for all purposes of the act, established and existing highways, upon which the pipe line company maintains its pipe lines, and location of the pipe lines is subject to regulation by the highway commission. ... The statute does not authorize, and the orders of the highway commission do not involve, a taking of private property without due process of law.'\n\n If carried into effect, the challenged order of the commission would result in taking private property for public use.

See Lewis, Eminent Domain, (3d Ed.)  223. \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 619]\n\u00a0\n A claim that action is being taken under the police power of the state cannot justify disregard of constitutional inhibitions. Schlesinger v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 230, 240\n, 46 S.Ct. 260, 43 A.L.R. 1224; Georgia Power Co. v. Decatur, \n281 \nU.S. 505, 508\n, 50 S.Ct. 369; Southern Railway Co. v. Virginia, supra, page 196 of 290 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 148.\n While the court below held that the commission exercised police power to make public travel safe, and to accomplish that end might require alteration of the lines without compensation, it repudiated the suggestion that the same reasoning would support an order to remove other lawful structures; e.g., compressor stations. 'Transmission lines of all kinds' it said, 'are on the same footing, and are on the same footing with railroads with respect to grade crossings.' Erie R. Co. v. Board of Pub. Util. Commissioners, \n254 \nU.S. 394\n, 41 S.Ct. 169 was cited and relied upon.\n We cannot accept the view that under the Federal Constitution appellant's transmission lines are upon the same footing as railroads. The opinion below declared there was adequate distinction between the two to justify different classification and treatment under the act of 1929. And counsel for appellee very properly say: 'A railroad grade crossing presents an entirely different problem for public regulation than does a pipeline buried beneath the highway. ... The twenty-four inch high pressure natural gas transmission line of appellant when buried beneath the surface of such highways certainly is not a constant hazard to vehicular traffic.'\n The record fails to disclose that appellant's lines were the cause of serious danger to the public. Whatever of this, if any, would follow extensions of the highways across them, is not comparable to the hazard incident to the operation of railroad trains. Like any other lawful structure, these lines may have presented obstacles to construction of the proposed highways; but this might have been overcome by condemnation proceedings. \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 620]\n\u00a0\n We are advised by counsel for the commission that appellant's Delaware charter 'contains no specific reference to any right to intersect or occupy any public highway, public land or waters.' Also that in Kansas, 'beyond the provisions of the statute, R.S. 1933 Supp. 68-415 (section 16, c. 225, Acts of 1929), the validity of which is challenged in this case, there are absolutely no statutory obligations or regulations imposed upon pipeline companies with respect to the manner of the construction, maintenance or operation of their lines, whether located upon, along or across public highways or private lands.'\n Where the circumstances sufficed to show that the public would be subjected to serious danger from moving trains and supported the inference that the railroad company obtained permission to occupy the soil subject to reasonable legislation to prevent such danger, this Court has upheld orders, based upon the state's police power, to change tracks, eliminate grade crossings, etc.\n'The company must be deemed to have laid its tracks within the corporate limits of the city subject to the condition-not, it is true, expressed, but necessarily implied-that new streets of the city might be opened and extended from time to time across its tracks, as the public convenience required, and under such restrictions as might be prescribed by statute. ... The plaintiff in error took its charter subject to the power of the state to provide for the safety of the public, in so far as the safety of the lives and persons of the people were involved in the operation of the railroad. The company laid its tracks subject to the condition, necessarily implied, that their use could be so regulated by competent authority as to insure the pbulic safety.' Chicago, B. & Q. Ry. Co. v. Chicago, \n166 \nU.S. 226, 250\n, 252 S., 17 S.Ct. 581, 590.\n\n'The railway company accepted its franchise from the state, subject necessarily to the condition that it would conform at its own expense to any regulations, not arbi- \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 621]\n\u00a0\n trary in their character, as to the opening or use of streets, which had for their object the safety of the public, or the promotion of the public convenience, and which might, from time to time, be established by the municipality, when proceeding under legislative authority, within whose limits the company's business was conducted.'

Minneapolis, \n232 \nU.S. 430, 440\n, 34 S.Ct. 400.\n\n Erie Railroad Co. v. Board of Public Util. Commissioners, supra, opinion by Mr. Justice Holmes, goes upon the theory that it could be reasonably said that public safety required the changes, and that the order of the commission 'should be regarded as stating a condition that must be complied with if the company continues to use' the soil. Also 'the authority of the railroads to project their moving masses across thoroughfares must be taken to be subject to the implied limitation that it may be cut down whenever and so far as the safety of the public requires.'\n Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, \n260 \nU.S. 393, 413\n, 415 S., 416, 43 S.Ct. 158, 159, 28 A.L.R. 1321, Mr. Justice Holmes again writing, elucidates the doctrine of the Erie's Case.\n'As long recognized some values are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power. But obviously the implied limitation must have its limits or the contract and due process clauses are gone. One fact for consideration in determining such limits is the extent of the diminution. When it reaches a certain magnitude, in most if not in all cases there must be an exercise of eminent domain and compensation to sustain the act.'\n\n Accordingly, the court refused to sustain a Pennsylvania statute as an exercise of the police power which forbade the mining of anthracite coal under streets in such a way as to cause the subsidence of any structure used as a human habitation. 'The rights of the public in a street \n\n[294 U.S. 613, 622]\n\u00a0\n purchased or laid out by eminent domain are those that it has paid for. If in any case its representatives have been so short sighted as to acquire only surface rights without the right of support we see no more authority for supplying the latter without compensation than there was for taking the right of way in the first place and refusing to pay for it because the public wanted it very much. ... We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for the change.'\n The rule in respect of railroad crossings applies when there is substantial risk of injury to the public from the operation of trains and ground to imply the company's consent to take such measures as may be necessary to prevent the hazard. This Court has not sanctioned extension of the rule to wholly dissimilar circumstances; it does not apply to structures which are unattended by serious danger to the public.\n The police power of a state, while not susceptible of definition with circumstantial precision, must be exercised within a limited ambit and is subordinate to constitutional limitations. It springs from the obligation of the state to protect its citizens and provide for the safety and good order of society. Under it there is no unrestricted authority to accomplish whatever the public may presently desire. It is the governmental power of self-protection and permits reasonable regulation of rights and property in particulars essential to the preservation of the community from injury. New York & N.E. Ry.

It reversed the District Court, which had held the patent invalid for anticipation and want of invention. 4 F.Supp. 462. The several claims involved relate to a method of producing a single photographic film by printing upon it a picture record and a sound record from separately exposed and developed negatives. The positive film thus produced is useful and extensively used in reproducing sound and picture records in the exhibition of 'talking moving pictures.' \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 466]\n\u00a0\n The respondent, who was the plaintiff below, is a patent holding company, and acquired the patent by assignment. The petitioner, who was the defendant below, is a producer of motion pictures, and the defense of the present suit has been conducted on its behalf by the Electrical Research Products, Inc., a subsidiary of the Western Electric Company.\n In order that the precise nature of the claims may be understood, it will be necessary first to describe briefly the procedure and the mechanisms employed in recording and reproducing talking motion pictures, although neither is embraced in the claims of the patent. Several methods have been devised for recording sound and reproducing it in connection with the exhibition of motion pictures. A familiar one is the disc system, by which the sound vibrations are mechanically recorded upon and reproduced from discs by a stylus, which receives the sound vibrations for recording and transmits them from the disc to a loud-speaker in reproducing the sound.\n Another method, important here, is the photographic film system, in which the sound vibrations are recorded upon a photographic record. In the typical procedure, used by the petitioner, the sound waves to be recorded are received by a microphone so devised as to produce variable electric currents whose variations correspond to the variations in the sound waves received. The electric currents thus produced are amplified and transmitted to two metal threads, arranged side by side so as to form a narrow slit about 1\/1000 of an inch in width, called a light valve. The current produces vibration of the metal threads with consequent variation of the light passing through the valve exactly corresponding to the sound vibrations to be recorded. In recording sound, a moving sensitized photographic film is exposed to a beam of light passed through the vibrating light valve which is activated by the electric currents varying according to the sound vibrations. The \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 467]\n\u00a0\n exposed film is then developed, and the 'sound record' thus produced is printed from it upon a positive film, where it appears as a series of short parallel lines of varying light density, corresponding to the sound vibrations, which have controlled in turn the variation in the electric current passing to the light valve and the corresponding variations of light passing through it to the sensitized film.\n In reproducing the recorded sound the procedure is reversed. The positive sound film is passed before a light slit, from which the light passes through the sound record film to a photo-electric cell, which is devised to produce a variable electric current corresponding to the light variations caused by the moving record film. The electric current thus produced is amplified and passed to a loud-speaker, where it is translated into sound vibrations.\n Successful operation of the talking motion picture involves synchronization of the sound and picture records. The difficulties of synchronization are obvious where the recorded picture and sounds are separately reproduced by independent mechanisms. Success has been achieved, and convenience in use of the two records secured, by uniting them upon a single positive film and passing it at the requisite uniform speed through a single apparatus designed to reproduce both the sound and the picture. A familiar method of securing the two records on a single film is by photographing simultaneously the picture record and the sound record side by side upon the same strip of film and then printing from the developed negative a single positive film. This method was disclosed in the Haines British patent, No. 18,057, of 1906; in the Ries patent, United States No. 1,473,976, of 1923, applied for in 1913; in the French patent to MacCarty, No. 448,757, of 1912; and in the Walker patent, United States No. 1,186, 717, of 1916. Another method is by mechanically uniting the two positive records, as by cementing them together, after they \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 468]\n\u00a0\n have been separately printed from negatives separately exposed and developed. This was disclosed by the Bullis patent, United States No. 1, 335,651, of March 30, 1920, applied for in 1915. A third method, which is that claimed by the patent in suit, is by printing the two records on a single positive film from separately exposed and developed negatives.\n In petitioner's practice separate photographic films, moving at uniform speed, are separately exposed, so as to record a scene and the accompanying sounds, and are then separately developed. The two records are then printed, side by side, on a single positive film, used for reproducing the picture and the sound. In the typical reproducing apparatus the film passes successively through the picture projector and the mechanism for sound reproduction. Accordingly, synchronization is accomplished by arranging the two records on the positive film in such relative positions that the two records will simultaneously reach the two mechanisms for reproducing them, so that the reproduced sound will accompany the reproduced scene of the picture as it did when they were recorded.\n The specifications of the patent state broadly that it is of great advantage to arrange the sound record sequences and the picture record sequences on a single film. They then describe the technical difficulties in developing the negative when the sound and picture records are photographed on a single film. They point out that the picture record is made under changing light conditions, which may result in over or under exposures, which will require correction and a treatment in the development of the negative different from that suitable to the sound sequence, which is recorded under different light conditions. It is said that it is practically impossible to secure the variations in treatment required for developing the two types of record where the two sequences, picture and sound, are \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 469]\n\u00a0\n photographed upon the same film strip. The specifications then describe the invention as follows:\n'According to the present invention the difficulty is overcome by either employing entirely separate films for the simultaneous photographing of the sound and picture negatives, or films which are connected during the photographing, but which are separated from one another before the developing, then separately developing the negatives if and in the manner required to remedy the difficulties, and then printing both sequences-picture and sound-on the different portions of the same positive film.'\n\n Respondent relies on claims 5 to 9, inclusive, and claim 11 of the patent, of which it is agreed claim 5 is typical. It reads as follows:\n'A process for producing a combined sound and picture positive film, for talking moving pictures, comprising photographing a sequence of pictures on one length of film, and simultaneously photographing on another length of film a corresponding sequence of sounds accompanying the action, separately developing the two negatives in a manner appropriate for each, and printing the sound and picture negatives respectively upon different longitudinally extending portions of the same sensitized film, to form the sound sequences at one side of and along the picture sequence.'\n\n It will be observed that the claimed method or process is for combining sound and picture records on a single film and comprises three steps: First, the simultaneous photographing of a picture record and a record of the accompanying sound, each on a separate negative; second, the separate development of the two negatives in a manner appropriate to each; and, third, the printing either simultaneously or successively, from the two negatives of the sound record and the picture record side by side on a single positive film. \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 470]\n\u00a0\n It is important to indicate the more significant features of the sound reproduction procedure and mechanisms which are not embraced in the claims. The patent does not claim either a method or a device for recording or for reproducing sound, or a method of synchronizing the two records, or the use of a single film in the reproduction of combined sound and picture records, or any method or device for printing the positive record from the two separate negatives.\n While the claims speak of a process or method for producing a combined sound and picture positive film, it is obvious that the process described and claimed has no necessary connection with sound reproduction. The positive film bearing the combined sound and picture records is a product of the photographic art. The method claimed for producing it relates exclusively to that art. It is neither a method of sound recording or sound reproduction. It claims only a process every step in which is an application of the art of photography; simultaneous exposure of the negatives, their separate development, and printing from them a single positive film. The process is as applicable to any other form of photographic record as to a photographic sound record. It is as effective in the production of the one as the other. Its importance to the sound picture industry arises only from the fact that the single film bearing the two records, for which no patent is claimed, is of great utility in that industry.\n An examination of the prior art can leave no doubt that the method, as thus described and clearly restricted by the patent, lacks novelty and invention. The only step in respondent's method for which any advance could be claimed over earlier methods, is the process of uniting two records on a single positive film by printing them from separate negatives. The Bullis patent, already mentioned, and the Craig patent, United States No. 1,289,337, of 1918, had shown the simultaneous exposure and separate devel- \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 471]\n\u00a0\n opment of sound and picture films, the advantages of which, as well as the advantages of the double record on a single film, were well known. The claim to invention is thus narrowed to the single contention that the patentees secured the benefit of these well-known advantages by resort to the added step of uniting the two separate photographic records, sound and picture, by printing them on a single film.\n The practice of printing separate photographs from separately developed negatives upon a single positive film has long been known to photographers. Standard photographic dictionaries, published here and abroad between 1894 and 1912, describe the procedure for 'combination printing' of a single positive picture from separately developed negatives. 1 The procedure is shown to have been followed in the laboratories of the Eastman Kodak Company for many years prior to April, 1921, the date claimed for the present patent, and before that date the company had made special materials for use in combination printing.\n The practice was also well known in the motion picture industry. In 1908 the American Mutoscope & Biograph Company made and released in the United States a motion picture, The Music Master. This picture was prepared by separately photographing two scenes. From the separately developed negatives a positive was printed, showing the two pictures on the same strip of film, from \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 472]\n\u00a0\n which the motion picture was reproduced. The British Downing patent, No. 6, 727, of 1913, discloses methods and apparatus for producing motion pictures, accompanied by printed words used by the actors, the two records being printed on a single positive film from separately exposed and developed negatives. The Messter patent, United States No. 1,286,383, of 1918, and the British patent, No. 21,467, issued to Rossi in 1909, each discloses a method of printing two separately exposed picture records on a single film. The Craig patent, already mentioned, calls for separate exposure and development of sound and picture negatives, simultaneously recorded, and their printing on opposite sides of a single film. The Greensfelder patent, United States No. 1,254,684, of 1918, discloses a method for printing, from separately exposed and developed negatives, a sound record and a picture record on the same side of a single positive film. The function of the sound record differed radically from that contemplated by respondent's patent, but this is immaterial so far as its printing is concerned, in which the Greensfelder patent does not substantially differ from that in suit. While these patents did not specifically mention the separate development of the negatives of the two records, it appears that they were photographed separately upon separate negatives, and the record shows that at their dates the state of the art was such as to require separate development of the two negatives. The practice and advantage of separate development are also shown to be well known. This and other evidence in the record abundantly supports the finding of the trial court that as early as 1908 it was common practice in the motion picture industry to print, on standard positive film, composite pictures from separately developed negatives.\n The simultaneous photographing of sound and picture records was not novel, separate development of the negatives was well known, the advantage of uniting the two records, sound and picture, on a single film, was well \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 473]\n\u00a0\n known, and the method of uniting two photographic picture records by printing them from the separate negatives was well known.\n This use of an old method to produce an old result was not invention. See Electric Cable Joint Co. v. Edison Company, \n292 \nU.S. 69, 80\n, 54 S.Ct. 586, and cases cited. Even if it be assumed that the Greensfelder patent did not anticipate that of respondent, because the sound record there mentioned was designed directly to operate musical instruments, rather than a loud-speaker, all that was novel in the claimed method was its application in the production of a combined sound and picture record, instead of a combination of two picture records. To claim the merit of invention, the patented process must itself possess novelty. The application of an old process to a new and closely analogous subject- matter, plainly indicated by the prior art as an appropriate subject of the process, is not invention. Brown v. Piper, \n91 U.S. 37\n, 41; see Pennsylvania Railroad Co. v. Locomotive Truck Co., \n110 \nU.S. 490, 494\n, 4 S.Ct. 220; Dreyfus v. Searle, \n124 \nU.S. 60, 64\n, 8 S.Ct. 390; Concrete Appliances Co. v. Gomery, \n269 \nU.S. 177, 184\n, 185 S., 46 S.Ct. 42. However wide the differences between the procedures and results of sound reproduction from film on the one hand and picture reproduction on the other, the method of producing photographic sound and picture records and uniting them on the positive film are identical, for both sound and picture records, from the time of exposure of the negatives until the single film is completed. With knowledge of the well-understood advantages of the union of the two records on a single film, it required no more than the expected skill of the art of photography to use an old method of printing photographically the two negatives upon a single positive.\n Against this conclusion respondents throw the weight of voluminous evidence, showing the practical utility and widespread use of the patented process, which prevailed with the court below as sufficient to establish invention. \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 474]\n\u00a0\n It is said that, however simple and obvious the method may appear to be now that it is in successful use, no one before the patentees had used it for producing the union of a sound and a picture record. Respondents also allege that the positive film produced by its method is more useful than any it had been possible to produce by other methods, and that it has found all but universal acceptance. These considerations, it is urged, should turn the scale in favor of invention.\n Laying aside the objection that it is only when invention is in doubt that advance in the art may be thrown in the scale, DeForest Radio Company v. General Electric Company, \n283 \nU.S. 664, 685\n, 51 S.Ct. 563; Smith v. Goodyear Dental Vulcanite Co., \n93 \nU.S. 486, 495\n, 496 S., we think the evidence of utility and prompt acceptance of the patented method, in the circumstances of this case, adds little weight to the claim of invention. The greater utility of respondent's film over those effecting the union of the two records by other methods does not establish the novelty of the method. Evidence of great utility of a method or device, it is true, may in some circumstances be accepted as evidence of invention. Where the method or device satisfies an old and recognized want, invention is to be inferred, rather than the exercise of mechanical skill. For mere skill of the art would normally have been called into action by the generally known want. See Webster Loom Co. v. Higgins, \n105 U.S. 580\n, 591; Krementz v. S. Cottle Co., \n148 \nU.S. 556, 560\n, 13 S.Ct. 719; Hobbs v. Beach, \n180 \nU.S. 383, 392\n, 21 S.Ct. 409; Carnegie Steel Co. v. Cambria Iron Co., \n185 \nU.S. 403, 429\n, 430 S., 22 S.Ct. 698; Expanded Metal Co. v. Bradford, \n214 \nU.S. 366, 381\n, 29 S.Ct. 652\n\n\n But the state of the motion picture art, as it is disclosed by the present record, indicates that there was no generally recognized demand for any type of film record, for the reproduction of sound to accompany motion pictures, until after the present patent was applied for. See Hollister v. Benedict & Burnham Mfg. Co., \n113 \nU.S. 59, 73\n, 5 S.Ct. 717. \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 475]\n\u00a0\n Compare McClain v. Ortmayer, \n141 \nU.S. 419, 428\n, 12 S.Ct. 76; Grant v. Walker, \n148 \nU.S. 547, 556\n, 13 S.Ct. 699.\n Before 1926, motion pictures were silent, and there was no convincing evidence that the public would prefer the sound picture. In that year Warner Bros. exhibited sound pictures produced by the disc system, provided by the Western Electric Company. At that time the company had for some years been experimenting with both film and disc systems for recording sound, and it had electrically recorded disc phonographic records which were in commercial use. The addition of sound on disc to motion pictures involved merely the attachment of the phonographic type of turntable to the ordinary motion picture projector, without any extensive modification of the projector or the film printing machines then in use, as was later necessary in order to employ the film method. Moreover, as has already been indicated, skillfully devised mechanisms were required for successfully recording and reproducing sound by the film method, a problem distinct from any method of uniting the sound and picture records upon a single film.\n Until these appliances were perfected, there could be no pressing and generally recognized demand for the sound film. It was not until after the public interest in sound pictures was disclosed, in the summer of 1926, that the mechanism for recording and reproducing sound by the film method was carried to a state of perfection which would warrant its production in commercial form. The light valve was produced in commercial form in December, 1926, and the first installations were in 1927. A rival system, of the Fox Case Company, for recording and reproducing sound by film, was not brought to completion until after 1926. Other problems engaging the attention of experimenters in this field were the necessary improvement of the photoelectric cell, the devising of suitable emulsion for sound negatives, of apparatus for \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 476]\n\u00a0\n 'mixing' the sound to be recorded, and the mechanical perfection of the apparatus for reproducing sound from film. See Altoona Publix Theatres, Inc., et al. v. American Tri-Ergon Corporation and Tri-Ergon Holding A.G., \n294 \nU.S. 477\n, 55 S.Ct. 455, decided this day.\n Thus there is no basis shown by this record for the contention that advance in this phase of the motion picture industry was awaiting the development of the combined sound and picture record upon a single positive film. On the contrary, the inference seems plain that the advance awaited the public acceptance of the sound motion picture; that, when the public demand became manifest, it was still necessary to develop suitable mechanisms, not embraced in the patent, for the reproduction of sound from film. There had long been, ready at hand, knowledge in the photographic art which would enable one skilled in the art to produce the film suitable for use in the new apparatus. Indeed, at some time before 1924, Wente, engaged in research on sound film apparatus for the Western Electric Company, without any knowledge of the work of the patentees of the present patent, had prepared the combined sound and picture positive film by printing it from separate negatives, separately exposed and developed.\n The bare fact that several inventors, in the early stages of sound reproduction, working independently, of whose knowledge and skill in the photographic art we know little or nothing, failed to resort to a method, well known to that art, for printing a combination film for which there was then no generally recognized need, does not give rise to the inference of invention.\n The court below also rested its decision on the ground that the petitioner is estopped to deny the validity of the patent by the application of Wente, April 8, 1924, who was in the employ of the Western Electric Company, for a patent for an improvement in recording and printing the sound record film, which contained claims broad enough \n\n[294 U.S. 464, 477]\n\u00a0\n to include the method claimed by respondent. These claims were rejected by the Patent Office as reading on the British patent 178,442 of the present patentees, and the Greensfelder patent, already mentioned. However inconsistent this early attempt to procure a patent may be with petitioner's present contention of its invalidity for want of invention, this Court has long recognized that such inconsistency affords no basis for an estoppel, nor precludes the court from relieving the alleged infringer and the public from the asserted monopoly when there is no invention.

Lee, \n151 \nU.S. 282, 285\n, 14 S.Ct. 331.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Wilson's Cyclopaedic Photography, published by Edward L.

STATE OF ALABAMA(1935)\nNo. 554\nArgued: Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n Mr. Walter H. Pollak, of New York City (Messrs. Osmond K. Fraenkel and Carl S. Stern, both of New York City, on the brief), for petitioner. \n\n[294 U.S. 600, 601]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Thomas E. Knight, Jr., of Montgomery, Ala., for the State of alabama.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner, Haywood Patterson, was indicted with Clarence Norris (the petitioner in Norris v. State of Alabama, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n, 55 S.Ct. 579) and seven other negro boys in Jackson county, Ala., for the crime of rape. Judgment of conviction was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. That judgment, and like judgments in the case of Norris and others, were reversed by this Court. Powell v. Alabama, \n287 \nU.S. 45\n, 53 S. Ct. 55, 84 A.L.R. 527.\n After the remand, all of the cases were transferred for trial to Morgan county. Patterson was the first of those retried. The jury found a verdict against him which the trial judge set aside as against the weight of evidence. He was then brought to trial for a third time before another judge, in November, 1933, and was again convicted. The judgment was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the state. 159 So. 567. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n293 \nU.S. 554\n, 55 S.Ct. 347, 79 L.Ed. --.\n At the beginning of the last trial, as on the previous trial, a motion was made on Patterson's behalf to quash the indictment upon the ground of the exclusion of negroes from juries in Jackson county where the indictment was found. Defendant also moved to quash the trial venire in Morgan county because of the exclusion of negroes from jury service in that county. In each of these motions, defendant contended that there was a long-continued, systematic, and arbitrary exclusion of qualified negroes from jury service, solely by reason of their race or color, in violation of the Federal Constitution (amendment 14,  1). These motions were the same as those which were made on the trial of Norris, which immediately followed this third trial of Patterson. It was stipulated in the case of \n\n[294 U.S. 600, 602]\n\u00a0\n Norris, and the trial court there ruled, that the papers filed and the testimony adduced upon the similar motions on the trial of Patterson should be treated as applicable, and the motions in the case of Norris were thus heard upon evidence which had been submitted on the trial of Patterson. The opinions of the trial judge denying these motions were the same in both cases.\n In this aspect, the federal question now sought to be presented on behalf of Patterson is precisely the same as that which we have considered and decided in Norris' Case, \n294 \nU.S. 587\n, 55 S.Ct. 579. But the state, by its Attorney General, contends that this Court has no jurisdiction in the instant case, in the view that the decision of the state court rested entirely upon a question of state appellate procedure and that no federal question is involved. Counsel for defendant opposes that view, and it becomes necessary for us to examine the record in order to determine whether the judgment of the state court is based upon a nonfederal ground adequate to sustain it. Ward v. Board of Com'rs of Love County, \n253 \nU.S. 17, 22\n, 40 S.Ct. 419; Davis, Director General, v. Wechsler, \n263 \nU.S. 22, 24\n, 25 S., 44 S.Ct. 13; Broad River Power Co. v. South Carolina, \n281 \nU.S. 537, 540\n, 50 S.Ct. 401; Abie State Bank v. Bryan, \n282 \nU.S. 765, 773\n, 51 S.Ct. 252; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 282\n, 52 S.Ct. 556\n\n\n The question arises from the action of the Supreme Court of the state in striking defendant's bill of exceptions, which contained the evidence taken by the trial court on the motions to quash, upon the ground that the bill had not been presented in time. So holding, the Supreme Court of the state disregarded all questions reviewable alone by bill of exceptions, and finding no error in the record as thus considered, affirmed the judgment. The court did not discuss the federal question.\n Under the Code of Alabama, a bill of exceptions must be presented 'within ninety days from the day on which the judgment is entered,' or 'within ninety days after the granting or refusing of a motion for a new trial.' \n\n[294 U.S. 600, 603]\n\u00a0\n Ala. Code,  6433. Another section of the Code provides that 'after the lapse of thirty days from the date on which a judgment or decree was rendered, the court shall lose all power over it, as completely as if the end of the term had been on that day, unless a motion to set aside the judgment or decree, or grant a new trial has been filed and called to the attention of the court, and an order entered continuing it for hearing to a future day.' Ala. Code,  6670.\n The jury found its verdict against Patterson on December 1, 1933, and the court then adjudged him guilty as charged. On December 6, 1933, he was sentenced to death. The bill of exceptions was presented on March 5, 1934.\n Upon the return of the verdict on December 1st, defendant's counsel requested an extension beyond thirty days within which to file a motion for a new trial, stating that a transcript of the testimony would be needed in order to prepare a proper motion. The application was denied, the trial judge stating in effect that defendant's counsel had thirty days within which to make a motion for a new trial, and that, after a motion so made, he might apply to the trial judge for 'additional thirty day periods' in order to file an amended motion based upon the transcript. The motion for a new trial was filed on December 29, 1933, and it appears that a copy of the motion papers was received by the Attorney General without objection. On request of defendant's counsel, the motion was continued by the trial judge until February 24, 1934. The Attorney General then moved to strike the motion upon the ground that it had been filed after the expiration of the term of court, at which defendant was tried, and hence that the court was without jurisdiction. It appeared that the term had expired on December 23, 1933. The trial judge granted the motion to strike and the Supreme Court of the State sustained the ruling. \n\n[294 U.S. 600, 604]\n\u00a0\n The state court pointed out that the ruling was in accord with Morris v. Corona Coal Co. (1926) 215 Ala. 47, 109 So. 278, in which the question had been directly presented. \n1\n The court said that the governing statutes, including section 6670, above quoted, were codified from the Act of 1915, pp. 707, 708,  1 and 3 (Code 1923,  6667, 6670); that, previously, all motions for new trials were required to be made within the terms; that, as to cases at law, terms were not abolished; that the statute making judgments final after thirty days was restrictive of the rule which had theretofore obtained by which the judgments were deemed to be within the breast of the court until the end of the term; and that the effect of the decision in the Morris Case was to hold that the statute had not abrogated 'the established rule that all judgments become final with the end of the term' and did not extend the thirty day period beyond that time. The court cited several cases to show that the ruling was 'in keeping with former decisions through a long period of years.'\n But the striking of the motion for a new trial did not dispose of the bill of exceptions. It would still have been in time if it had been presented within ninety days from the day of the judgment. It was in time if that day was December 6, 1933, when defendant was sentenced, but it was too late if judgment was entered on December 1, 1933. The Supreme Court of the state took the latter view. The court held that the time for presenting bills of exceptions 'runs from the date of the judgment of guilty, not from the date of sentence.' The court cited the case of Lewis v. State (1915) 194 Ala. 1, 69 So. 913, where that rule had been laid down. And in view of this long-established rule in Alabama as to the day from which \n\n[294 U.S. 600, 605]\n\u00a0\n the time should be reckoned, the state court was undoubtedly at liberty, without violating any federal right, to hold that the bill of exceptions had not been presented within the designated period of ninety days.\n There remains, however, a further question. For it does not appear that the failure to file a bill of exceptions in time is sufficient in itself to deprive the state appellate court of jurisdiction. On the contrary, the statute of Alabama expressly denies to the court the authority, on its own motion, to strike a bill of exceptions because not filed in time, and provides for that action only upon motion of a party to the record or his attorney. The statute in terms allows parties to waive the objection. We quote its provisions: 'The appellate court may strike a bill of exceptions from the record or file because not presented or signed within the time required by law, but shall not do so ex mero motu, but only on motion of a party to the record of his attorney; the object and effect of this statute being to allow parties to waive or consent for the time of signing bills of exceptions.' Ala. Code,  6434. The state court cited its former decisions which construed the 'waiver or consent,' to which the provision referred, to be 'such as is indicated by a failure to move to strike upon submission of the cause on appeal,' and held that when such a motion is made, it is the duty of the court to grant it. Baker v. Central of Georgia Railway Co., 165 Ala. 466, 51 So. 796; Ex parte Hill, 205 Ala. 631, 89 So. 58; Ettore v. State, 214 Ala. 99, 106 So. 508; Beatty v. McMillan, 226 Ala. 405, 147 So. 180.\n While we must have proper regard to this ruling of the state court in relation to its appellate procedure, we cannot ignore the exceptional features of the present case. An important question under the Federal Constitution was involved, and, from that standpoint, the case did not stand alone. As the opinion of the state court observes, there was 'being considered along with this cause, the ap- \n\n[294 U.S. 600, 606]\n\u00a0\n peal of Clarence Norris v. State of Alabama (Ala. Sup.) 156 So. 556, from a conviction under the same indictment.' 156 So. 567, 568. The validity of the common indictment had been challenged by a motion on behalf of both defendants because of the unconstitutional discrimination. It is true that the Patterson Case was brought up on a separate appeal, and on a separate record, but it appeared from the record before the court in the Norris Case that the evidence upon the motions to quash was the same evidence ( introduced by stipulation) as that which had been taken in the Patterson Case. The bills of exceptions had been presented in both cases on the same day, March 5, 1934. When the Attorney General, on February 24, 1934, had moved to strike the motion for a new trial, he had expressly referred to the judgment as having been rendered on December 6, 1933, a statement not obviously inaccurate, because there was an entry of a formal judgment of sentence on that day, and, coming from the Attorney General, the statement may have misled defendant's counsel. If that statement had been correct, the bill of exceptions would have been timely. The Attorney General did not make his motion until May 25, 1934. We are not advised that previous state decisions had dealt with a situation having such unusual incidents.\n The decisions in the two cases were announced on the same day. The state court decided the constitutional question against Norris, and it was manifestly with that conclusion in mind that the court approached the decision in the case of Patterson and struck his bill of exceptions. We are not satisfied that the court would have dealt with the case in the same way if it had determined the constitutional question as we have determined it. We are not convinced that the court, in the presence of such a determination of constitutional right, confronting the anomalous and grave situation which would be created by a reversal of the judgment against Norris, and an affirmance of the judgment of death in the companion case of Patter- \n\n[294 U.S. 600, 607]\n\u00a0\n son, who had asserted the same right, and having regard to the relation of the two cases and the other circumstances disclosed by the record, would have considered itself powerless to entertain the bill of exceptions or otherwise to provide appropriate relief. It is always hazardous to apply a judicial ruling, especially in a matter of procedure, to a serious situation which was not in contemplation when the ruling was made. At least the state court should have an opportunity to examine its powers in the light of the situation which has now developed. We should not foreclose that opportunity.\n We have frequently held that in the exercise of our appellate jurisdiction we have power not only to correct error in the judgment under review but to make such disposition on the case as justice requires. And in determining what justice does require, the Court is bound to consider any change, either in fact or in law, which has supervened since the judgment was entered. We may recognize such a change, which may affect the result, by setting aside the judgment and remanding the case so that the state court may be free to act. We have said that to do this is not to review, in any proper sense of the term, the decision of the state court upon a nonfederal question, but only to deal appropriately with a matter arising since its judgment and having a bearing upon the right disposition of the case.

Ed. --, directed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, to resolve questions of public importance growing out of the conflicting claims of the federal District Court and of the insurance commis- \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 191]\n\u00a0\n sioner of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, to jurisdiction over the liquidation of the business and affairs of appellant, an insolvent Pennsylvania insurance corporation.\n The case was heard in the state Supreme Court upon an agreed statement of facts, deemed 'necessary to a determination of the question involved in the appeal,' which was filed in the state trial court. It purports to outline the substance of proceedings had in that court and in the federal District Court. The question is stated to be whether the state court, 'in view of the prior pendency of the suit ... in the Federal court, had jurisdiction to enter the decree from which this appeal is taken.' The records of the pleadings and proceedings in those courts are not included in the record and are not before us.\n Appellant was organized under the Insurance Company Law of May 17, 1921, P.L. 682. On September 14, 1933, appellant's officers and directors appeared at a hearing before the insurance commissioner at which the president of the company was ordered to return to it assets which he had improperly withdrawn from the company, with consequent serious impairment of its financial condition. On October 14, 1933, a further hearing was held before the Attorney General of the state, at which it appeared that the company was in an unsafe and unsound condition.\n On November 17, 1933, a shareholder of the insurance company filed his bill of complaint against the company in the District Court for Eastern Pennsylvania. At this time negotiations, conducted by the commissioner with the stockholders of the company, for its rehabilitation were pending. The complaint alleged that the stockholder was a resident of West Virginia; that the requisite jurisdictional amount was involved; that officers of the company had misappropriated and wasted its assets; that \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 192]\n\u00a0\n the company was involvent and in a financially unsafe and unsound condition. The bill prayed the appointment of receivers, the liquidation of its property and business, and the usual injunction. Upon the filing of the bill, subpoena was issued and was served on the corporation on November 22, 1933\n\n\n On December 8, 1933, while the suit in the District Court was pending, the Attorney General of the state, acting pursuant to section 502, art. 5, of the Insurance Department Act of May 17, 1921, P.L. 789 (40 PS Pa.  202 ), filed a suggestion with the court of common pleas of Dauphin county, alleging that the company was in a financially unsound condition; that the conduct of its business would be detrimental and hazardous to its policy- holders, creditors, and the public; that certain officers of the company had made illegal investments of the funds of the company and had appropriated to their own use other assets of the company. He prayed for an order that the defendant show cause why the business of the company should not be closed, its charter vacated, and its assets taken into possession of the insurance commissioner for liquidation under his direction, and for an injunction. On the same day the court of common pleas granted the order to show cause and enjoined the company from transacting any business and from disposing of its property until further order of the court. The order to show cause was served upon the company on December 11, 1933.\n On December 14, 1933, the company filed an answer in the suit pending before the federal District Court, substantially admitting the alleged withdrawal of assets and illegal investment, and denying the other allegations of the complaint, and alleging the pendency of the proceedings in the court of common pleas.\n On the same day the court of common pleas entered a further order restraining the company and its officers or agents from transacting any business and from dis- \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 193]\n\u00a0\n posing of its property and restraining all persons other than the insurance commissioner and his agents from taking possession of it. On the following day the federal District Court entered an order which recited the pendency of the proceedings in the court of common pleas and restrained the company and its officers or agents from permitting any one to receive or take possession of its property and enjoining all persons from interfering with it in any way. On that day both the last-mentioned restraining order of the court of common pleas and that of the federal District Court were served on the company.\n After further proceedings, the court of common pleas entered its final decree, March 14, 1934, that the company be dissolved, and directing the acting insurance commissioner to take possession of and to liquidate the business and property of the casualty company in accordance with the provisions of the state Insurance Department Act. No final hearing has been held and no receiver has been appointed in the suit pending in the District Court, but, because of the restraining order of that court, the company has refused to comply with the demand of the commissioner for the surrender of its property in conformity with the decree of the state court.\n On appeal from the court of common pleas, the state Supreme Court treated the case as one involving only a conflict of jurisdiction between the state court and the federal court. It viewed the comprehensive statutory scheme of the commonwealth for liquidating insurance companies by the insurance commissioner as binding on the company and its shareholder. It therefore thought that there could be no controversy between them which would be a proper subject of suit in the federal courts and that this was sufficient to preclude the exercise of jurisdiction of the federal court. It accordingly affirmed the decree. 316 Pa. 1, 173 A. 637. \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 194]\n\u00a0\n The state court and the federal court have thus reached an impasse; each asserts the right to exercise its jurisdiction with respect to substantially the same subject-matter, the liquidation of the business, and assets of the insolvent corporation; each asserts its authority to enjoin interference, by the state officer on the one hand, and by any person except the state officer on the other; and each is unable to perform its function without acquiring possession and control of the property. In the state of the record before us, we confine our review to the single question of this conflict of jurisdiction considered and decided by the state court.\n Section 502, art. 5, of the Insurance Department Act, authorizes the commissioner to liquidate an insurance company when its condition is such that further transaction of its business will be hazardous; such liquidation is permitted only on an order or decree of the court of common pleas, granted on application of the Attorney General of the state. Upon such application, the court is authorized by section 505, art. 5 (40 PS Pa .  205) to enjoin the company from transacting any business and from disposing of its property, and after a hearing to direct the insurance commissioner to take possession of the property and to liquidate it pursuant to the statute. By sections 506, 507, art. 5 (40 PS Pa.  206, 207), the order of the court vests the commissioner with the title to the property and supersedes the authority of any receiver appointed by any other state court.\n It is plain that the state court, in the absence of the suit pending in the District Court, would have acquired jurisdiction to proceed with the cause and to grant the relief sought. But the question now presented is whether its authority to proceed is affected by the pendency of the suit in the District Court, which the state Supreme Court, on the record before it, treated as exercising a conflicting jurisdiction. The federal question, reviewable on appeal, is whether the state court has given proper effect to the \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 195]\n\u00a0\n proceedings and the order of the federal court. Buck v. Colbath, 3 Wall. 334, 340; Crescent City Live-Stock Co. v. Butchers' Union Slaughter House, etc., Co., \n120 \nU.S. 141, 142\n, 7 S.Ct. 472; Moran v. Sturges, \n154 \nU.S. 256, 267\n, 14 S.Ct. 1019; Central National Bank v. Stevens, \n169 \nU.S. 432, 456\n, 18 S.Ct. 403; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Elevated R.

Adelbert College, \n208 \nU.S. 38, 44\n, 54 S., 28 S.Ct. 182.\n Where the judgment sought is strictly in personam, for the recovery of money or for an injunction compelling or restraining action by the defendant, both a state court and a federal court having concurrent jurisdiction may proceed with the litigation, at least until judgment is obtained in one court which may be set up as res adjudicata in the other. See Buck v. Colbath, supra, page 342 of 3 Wall.; Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 U.S. 226\n, and cases cited at pages 230, 231, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A.L.R. 1077. But, if the two suits are in rem or quasi in rem, requiring that the court or its officer have possession or control of the property which is the subject of the suit in order to proceed with the cause and to grant the relief sought, the jurisdiction of one court must of necessity yield to that of the other. To avoid unseemly and disastrous conflicts in the administration of our dual judicial system, see Peck v. Jenness, 7 How. 612, 625; Taylor v. Carryl, 20 How. 583, 595; Freeman v. Howe, 24 How. 450, 459; Buck v. Colbath, supra, page 341 of 3 Wall.; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Elevated R. Co., supra, page 61 of 177 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 564, and to protect the judicial processes of the court first assuming jurisdiction, Wabash R. Co. v. Adelbert College, supra, page 54 of 208 U.S., 28 S.Ct. 182; Palmer v. Texas, \n212 \nU.S. 118, 129\n, 130 S., 29 S.Ct. 230, the principle, applicable to both federal and state courts, is established that the court first assuming jurisdiction over the property may maintain and exercise that jurisdiction to the exclusion of the other. This is the settled rule with respect to suits in equity for the control by receivership of the assets of an insolvent corporation. Leadville Coal \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 196]\n\u00a0\n Co. v. McCreery, \n141 \nU.S. 475, 477\n, 12 S.Ct. 28; Porter v. Sabin, \n149 \nU.S. 473, 480\n, 13 S.Ct. 1008; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Elevated R. Co., supra; Wabash R. Co. v. Adelbert College, supra; Palmer v. Texas, supra; Lion Bonding & Surety Co. v. Karatz, \n262 \nU.S. 77, 88\n, 89 S., 43 S.Ct. 480; Harkin v. Brundage, \n276 \nU.S. 36\n, 48 S.Ct. 268.\n Where the assertion of jurisdiction by the two courts is nearly simultaneous, it becomes important, as in the present case, to determine the precise time when the jurisdiction attaches. If the two suits do not have substantially the same purpose, and thus the jurisdiction of the two courts may not be said to be strictly concurrent, and if neither court can act effectively without acquiring possession and control of the property pendente lite, the time of acquiring actual possession may perhaps be the decisive factor. Compare Moran v. Sturges, supra, page 284 of 154 U.S., 14 S.Ct. 1019; Harkin v. Brundage, supra, page 43 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 268. But, when the two suits have substantially the same purpose and the jurisdiction of the courts is concurrent, that one whose jurisdiction and process are first invoked by the filing of the bill is treated as in constructive possession of the property and as authorized to proceed with the cause. Harkin v. Brundage, supra, pages 43-45 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 268. Jurisdiction thus attaches upon the filing of the bill of complaint in court, at least where process subsequently issues in due course. Palmer v. Texas, supra, page 129 of 212 U.S., 29 S.Ct. 230; Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Lake Street Elevated R. Co., supra, page 60 of 177 U.S., 20 S.Ct. 564. Compare George T. Smith Middlings Puritier Co. v. McGroarty, \n136 \nU.S. 237, 240\n, 10 S.Ct. 1017. The confusion and uncertainty are thus avoided which might otherwise result from the attempt to resolve the troublesome question of what constitutes actual possession and to determine priority of service of process in the two suits.\n In the present case there are outstanding injunctions by both courts restraining any interference with the property in the hands of the insolvent corporation, and neither the insurance commissioner nor the District Court has \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 197]\n\u00a0\n taken possession. The suits relate to substantially the same subject- matter. Each sought relief by injunction against creditors, marshaling and conservation of the corporate assets, and their liquidation and distribution among the creditors and shareholders. The jurisdiction invoked by the two suits was concurrent, see Harkin v. Brundage, supra, page 45 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 268, and, since the bill was filed in the District Court before the application of the Attorney General to the state court, the jurisdiction of the District Court first attached; it has asserted this jurisdiction by its injunction order. Hence it alone can rightfully assert control over the property and proceed with litigation which affects that control, Palmer v. Texas, supra, pages 129, 130 of 212 U.S., 29 S.Ct. 230; Wabash R. Co. v. Adelbert College, supra, page 54 of 208 U.S., 28 S.Ct. 182, and it alone can determine how far it will permit any other court to interfere, People's Bank v. Calhoun, \n102 U.S. 256\n, 262; see Riggs v. Johnson County, 6 Wall. 166. Its authority as a federal court to entertain the suit is not restricted by the procedure established by local statutes for the liquidation of insurance companies. The jurisdiction conferred on the District Courts by the Constitution and laws of the United States cannot be affected by state legislation. See No. 394, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Williams et al., \n294 \nU.S. 176\n, 55 S.Ct. 380, decided this day.\n Although the District Court has thus acquired jurisdiction, the end sought by the litigation in the state court is the liquidation of a domestic insurance company by a state officer. In the absence of a showing that the interests of creditors and shareholders would not be adequately protected by this procedure, the case was a proper one for the District Court, in the exercise of judicial discretion, to relinquish the jurisdiction in favor of the administration by the state officer. See No. 394, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Williams et al., supra.\n The authority of the insurance commissioner to proceed with the liquidation under state law, it is true, rests on the decree of the state court entered after the District \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 198]\n\u00a0\n Court had acquired jurisdiction. But, even though the jurisdiction of the District Court had attached, the state court was not without power to designate the insurance commissioner as the vehicle of the state authority to control the property whenever that could lawfully be done. While it is often said that, of two courts having concurrent jurisdiction in rem, one first taking possession acquires exclusive jurisdiction, see Peck v. Jennes, supra, pages 624, 625 of 7 How.; Wabash R. Co. v. Adelbert College, supra, page 54 of 208 U.S., 28 S.Ct. 182; Harkin v. Brundage, supra, page 43 of 276 U.S., 48 S.Ct. 268, it is exclusive only so far as its exercise is necessary for the appropriate control and disposition of the property. The jurisdiction does not extend beyond the purpose for which it is allowed, to enable the court to exercise it appropriately and to avoid unseemly conflicts. See Leadville Coal Co. v. McCreery, supra, page 477 of 141 U.S., 12 S.Ct. 28. The other court does not thereby lose its power to make orders which do not conflict with the authority of the court having jurisdiction over the control and disposition of the property. Yonley v. Lavender, 21 Wall. 276; Heidritter v. Elizabeth Oil-Cloth Co., \n112 \nU.S. 294, 304\n, 5 S.Ct. 135; Byers v. McAuley, \n149 \nU.S. 608\n, 13 S.Ct. 906. If it has appointed a receiver, it may and should give him directions for the surrender of the property to the court having prior jurisdiction, or it may make suitable orders permitting him to take possession and proceed with the liquidation when the court having jurisdiction over the property relinquishes it. See Harkin v. Brundage, supra, page 57 of 276 U.S., 48 S. Ct. 268. The confirmation by the court of common pleas of the right of the insurance commissioner to liquidate the company did not infringe the authority of the District Court to make appropriate disposition of the property. But it did confer on the commissioner the requisite authority to ask the District Court to relinquish its jurisdiction in favor of the state administration.\n Since the District Court had first acquired jurisdiction to liquidate the property of the insurance company, and \n\n[294 U.S. 189, 199]\n\u00a0\n had authority to proceed with the cause for that purpose, the Supreme Court of the commonwealth erred in affirming so much of the decree of the court of common pleas as directed the insurance commissioner to take possession of the business and property of the company, and so far as it affirmed the order of that court which enjoined the company from surrendering its books, records, and assets to any person other than the commissioner, and enjoined others from taking possession of them. The decree must accordingly be reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion, but without prejudice to an application by the commissioner to the District Court for an order relinquishing its jurisdiction over the property of the company and vacating its injunction against surrender of it to the commissioner for liquidation under the Insurance Department Law of the State.

This bond was issued pursuant to the Act of September 24, 1917,  1 et seq. (40 Stat. 288), as amended, and Treasury Department circular No. 121 dated September 28, 1918. The bond \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 347]\n\u00a0\n provided: 'The principal and interest hereof are payable in United States gold coin of the present standard of value.'\n Plaintiff alleged in his petition that at the time the bond was issued, and when he acquired it, 'a dollar in gold consisted of 25.8 grains of gold .9 fine'; that the bond was called for redemption on April 15, 1934, and, on May 24, 1934, was presented for payment; that plaintiff demanded its redemption 'by the payment of 10,000 gold dollars each containing 25.8 grains of gold .9 fine'; that defendant refused to comply with that demand; and that plaintiff then demanded '258,000 grains of gold . 9 fine, or gold of equivalent value of any fineness, or 16,931.25 gold dollars each containing 15 5\/21 grains of gold .9 fine, or 16,931.25 dollars in legal tender currency'; that defendant refused to redeem the bond 'except by the payment of 10,000 dollars in legal tender currency'; that these refusals were based on the Joint Resolution of the Congress of June 5, 1933, 48 Stat. 113 (31 USCA  462, 463), but that this enactment was unconstitutional, as it operated to deprive plaintiff of his property without due process of law; and that, by this action of defendant, he was damaged 'in the sum of $16,931.25, the value of defendant's obligation,' for which, with interest, plaintiff demanded judgment.\n Defendant demurred upon the ground that the petition did not state a cause of action against the United States.\n The Court of Claims has certified the following questions:\n'1. Is the claimant, being the holder and owner of a Fourth Liberty Loan 4 1\/4 bond of the United States, of the principal amount of $10,000, issued in 1918, which was payable on and after April 15, 1934, and which bond contained a clause that the principal is 'payable in United States gold coin of the present standard of value', entitled to receive from the United States an amount in legal tender currency in excess of the face amount of the bond? \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 348]\n\u00a0\n\n'2. Is the United States, as obligor in a Fourth Liberty Loan 4 1\/4% gold bond, Series of 1933-1938, as stated in Question One liable to respond in damages in a suit in the Court of Claims on such bond as an express contract, by reason of the change in or impossibility of performance in accordance with the tenor thereof, due to the provisions of Public Resolution No. 10, 73rd Congress, abrogating the gold clause in all obligations?'\n\n\n First. The Import of the Obligation. The bond in suit differs from an obligation of private parties, or of states or municipalities, whose contracts are necessarily made in subjection to the dominant power of the Congress. Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, 55 S.Ct. 407, decided this day. The bond now before us is an obligation of the United States. The terms of the bond are explicit. They were not only expressed in the bond itself, but they were definitely prescribed by the Congress. The Act of September 24, 1917, both in its original and amended form, authorized the moneys to be borrowed, and the bonds to be issued, 'on the credit of the United States,' in order to meet expenditures needed 'for the national security and defense and other public purposes authorized by law.' Section 1, 40 Stat. 288, as amended by Act April 4, 1918,  1, 40 Stat. 503, 31 USCA  752. The circular of the Treasury Department of September 28, 1918, to which the bond refers 'for a statement of the further rights of the holders of bonds of said series,' also provided that the principal and interest 'are payable in United States gold coin of the present standard of value.'\n This obligation must be fairly construed. The 'present standard of value' stood in contradistinction to a lower standard of value. The promise obviously was intended to afford protection against loss. That protection was sought to be secured by setting up a standard or measure of the government's obligation. We think that the reasonable import of the promise is that it was intended \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 349]\n\u00a0\n to assure one who lent his money to the government and took its bond that he would not suffer loss through depreciation in the medium of payment.\n The government states in its brief that the total unmatured interest- bearing obligations of the United States outstanding on May 31, 1933 ( which it is understood contained a 'gold clause' substantially the same as that of the bond in suit), amounted to about twenty-one billions of dollars. From statements at the bar, it appears that this amount has been reduced to approximately twelve billions at the present time, and that during the intervening period the public debt of the United States has risen some seven billions (making a total of approximately twenty-eight billions five hundred millions) by the issue of some sixteen billions five hundred millions of dollars 'of non-gold-clause obligations.'\n Second. The Binding Quality of the Obligation. The question is necessarily presented whether the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, 48 Stat. 113 (31 USCA  462, 463), is a valid enactment so far as it applies to the obligations of the United States. The resolution declared that provisions requiring 'payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency' were 'against public policy,' and provided that 'every obligation, heretofore or hereafter incurred, whether or not any such provision is contained therein,' shall be discharged 'upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.' This enactment was expressly extended to obligations of the United States and provisions for payment in gold, 'contained in any law authorizing obligations to be issued by or under authority of the United States,' were repealed. \n1\n Section 1(a), 31 USCA  463(a). \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 350]\n\u00a0\n There is no question as to the power of the Congress to regulate the value of money: that is, to establish a monetary system and thus to determine the currency of the country. The question is whether the Congress can use that power so as to invalidate the terms of the obligations which the government has theretofore issued in the exercise of the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In attempted justification of the Joint Resolution in relation to the outstanding bonds of the United States, the government argues that 'earlier Congresses could not validly restrict the 73rd Congress from exercising its constitutional powers to regulate the value of money, borrow money, or regulate foreign and interstate commerce'; and, from this premise, the government seems to deduce the proposition that when, with adequate authority, the government borrows money and pledges the credit of the United States, it is free to ignore that pledge and alter the terms of its obligations in case a later Congress finds their fulfillment inconvenient. The government's contention thus raises a question of far greater importance than the particular claim of the plaintiff. On that reasoning, if the terms of the government's bond as to the standard of payment can be repudiated, it inevitably follows that the obligation as to the amount to be paid may also be repudiated. The contention necessarily imports that the Congress can disregard the obligations of the government at its discretion, and that, when the government borrows money, the credit of the United States is an illusory pledge.\n We do not so read the Constitution. There is a clear distinction between the power of the Congress to control or interdict the contracts of private parties when they interfere with the exercise of its constitutional authority \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 351]\n\u00a0\n and the power of the Congress to alter or repudiate the substance of its own engagements when it has borrowed money under the authority which the Constitution confers. In authorizing the Congress to borrow money, the Constitution empowers the Congress to fix the amount to be borrowed and the terms of payment. By virtue of the power to borrow money 'on the credit of the United States,' the Congress is authorized to pledge that credit as an assurance of payment as stipulated, as the highest assurance the government can give, its plighted faith. To say that the Congress may withdraw or ignore that pledge is to assume that the Constitution contemplates a vain promise; a pledge having no other sanction than the pleasure and convenience of the pledgor. This Court has given no sanction to such a conception of the obligations of our government.\n The binding quality of the obligations of the government was considered in the Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 \nU.S. 700, 718\n, 719 S.. The question before the Court in those cases was whether certain action was warranted by a reservation to the Congress of the right to amend the charter of a railroad company. While the particular action was sustained under this right of amendment, the Court took occasion to state emphatically the obligatory character of the contracts of the United States. The Court said: 'The United States are as much bound by their contracts as are individuals. If they repudiate their obligations, it is as much repudiation, with all the wrong and reproach that term implies, as it would be if the repudiator had been a State or a municipality or a citizen.' \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 330, 352]\n\u00a0\n When the United States, with constitutional authority, makes contracts, it has rights and incurs responsibilities similar to those of individuals who are parties to such instruments. There is no difference, said the Court in United States v. Bank of the Metropolis, 15 Pet. 377, 392, except that the United States cannot be sued without its consent. See, also, The Floyd Acceptances, 7 Wall. 666, 675; Cooke v. United States, \n91 U.S. 389\n, 396. In Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571, 580\n, 54 S.Ct. 840, 844, with respect to an attempted abrogation by the Act of March 20, 1933,  17, 48 Stat. 8, 11 (38 USCA  717), of certain outstanding war risk insurance policies, which were contracts of the United States, the Court quoted with approval the statement in the Sinking Fund Cases, supra, and said: 'Punctilious fulfillment of contractual obligations is essential to the maintenance of the credit of public as well as private debtors. No doubt there was in March, 1933, great need of economy. In the administration of all government business economy had become urgent because of lessened revenues and the heavy obligations to be issued in the hope of relieving widespread distress. Congress was free to reduce gratuities deemed excessive. But Congress was without power to reduce expenditures by abrogating contractual obligations of the United States. To abrogate contracts, in the attempt to lessen government expenditure, would \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 353]\n\u00a0\n be not the practice of economy, but an act of repudiation.'\n The argument in favor of the Joint Resolution, as applied to government bonds, is in substance that the government cannot by contract restrict the exercise of a sovereign power. But the right to make binding obligations is a competence attaching to sovereignty. \n3\n In the United States, sovereignty resides in the people who act through the organs established by the Constitution. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419, 471; Penhallow v. Doane's Administrators, 3 Dall. 54, 93; McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 404, 405; Yick Wo v. Hopkins, \n118 \nU.S. 356, 370\n, 6 S.Ct. 1064. The Congress as the instrumentality of sovereignty is endowed with certain powers to be exerted on behalf of the people in the manner and with the effect the Constitution ordains. The Congress cannot invoke the sovereign power of the people to override their will as thus declared. The powers conferred upon the Congress are harmonious. The Constitution gives to the Congress the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States, an unqualified power, a power vital to the government, upon which in an extremity its very life may depend. The binding quality of the promise of the United States is of the essence of the credit which is so pledged. Having this power to authorize the issue of definite obligations for the payment of money borrowed, the Congress has not been vested with authority to alter or destroy those obli- \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 354]\n\u00a0\n gations. The fact that the United States may not be sued without its consent is a matter of procedure which does not affect the legal and binding character of its contracts. While the Congress is under no duty to provide remedies through the courts, the contractual obligation still exists, and, despite infirmities of procedure, remains binding upon the conscience of the sovereign. Lynch v. United States, supra, pages 580, 582, of \n292 U.S. 54\n S.Ct. 840.\n The Fourteenth Amendment, in its fourth section, explicitly declares: 'The validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law , ... shall not be questioned.' While this provision was undoubtedly inspired by the desire to put beyond question the obligations of the government issued during the Civil War, its language indicates a broader connotation. We regard it as confirmatory of a fundamental principle which applies as well to the government bonds in question, and to others duly authorized by the Congress, as to those issued before the amendment was adopted. Nor can we perceive any reason for not considering the expression 'the validity of the public debt' as embracing whatever concerns the integrity of the public obligations.\n We conclude that the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, in so far as it attempted to override the obligation created by the bond in suit, went beyond the congressional power.\n Third. The Question of Damages. In this view of the binding quality of the government's obligations, we come to the question as to the plaintiff's right to recover damages. That is a distinct question. Because the government is not at liberty to alter or repudiate its obligations, it does not follow that the claim advanced by the plaintiff should be sustained. The action is for breach of contract. As a remedy for breach, plaintiff can recover no more than the loss he has suffered and of which he may rightfully complain. He is not entitled to be en- \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 355]\n\u00a0\n riched. Plaintiff seeks judgment for $16,931.25, in present legal tender currency, on his bond for $10,000. The question is whether he has shown damage to that extent, or any actual damage, as the Court of Claims has no authority to entertain an action for nominal damages. Grant v. United States, 7 Wall. 331, 338; Marion & Rye V. Railway Co. v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 280, 282\n, 46 S.Ct. 253; Nortz v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 317\n, 55 S.Ct. 428, decided this day.\n Plaintiff computes his claim for $16,931.25 by taking the weight of the gold dollar as fixed by the President's proclamation of January 31, 1934 (No. 2072, 31 USCA  821 note), under the Act of May 12, 1933,  43(b)( 2), 48 Stat. 52, 53, as amended by the Act of January 30, 1934,  12, 48 Stat. 342, (31 USCA  821), that is, at 15 5\/21 grains nine-tenths fine, as compared with the weight fixed by the Act of March 14, 1900,  1, 31 Stat. 46 (31 USCA  314), or 25.8 grains nine-tenths fine. But the change in the weight of the gold dollar did not necessarily cause loss to the plaintiff of the amount claimed. The question of actual loss cannot fairly be determined without considering the economic situation at the time the government offered to pay him the $10,000, the face of his bond, in legal tender currency. The case is not the same as if gold coin had remained in circulation. That was the situation at the time of the decisions under the legal tender acts of 1862 and 1863. Bronson v. Rodes, 7 Wall. 229, 251; Trebilcock v. Wilson, 12 Wall. 687, 695; Thompson v. Butler, \n95 \nU.S. 694, 696\n, 697 S.. Before the change in the weight of the gold dollar in 1934, gold coin had been withdrawn from circulation. \n4\n The Congress had authorized the prohibition of the exportation of gold coin and the placing of restrictions upon transactions in foreign exchange. Acts of March 9, 1933, \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 356]\n\u00a0\n 48 Stat. 1 (Emergency Banking Relief Act,  2, amending Trading with the Enemy Act,  5(b), 12 USCA  95a); January 30, 1934, 48 Stat. 337 (Gold Reserve Act of 1934,  12, 31 USCA  824). Such dealings could be had only for limited purposes and under license. Executive Orders of April 20, 1933 ( No. 6111), August 28, 1933 (No. 6260), and January 15, 1934 (No. 6560), 12 USCA  95 note; Regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, January 30 and 31, 1934. That action the Congress was entitled to take by virtue of its authority to deal with gold coin as a medium of exchange. And the restraint thus imposed upon holders of gold coin was incident to the limitations which inhered in their ownership of that coin and gave them no right of action. Ling Su Fan v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 302, 310\n, 311 S., 31 S.Ct. 21, 23, 30 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1176. The Court said in that case: 'Conceding the title of the owner of such coins, yet there is attached to such ownership those limitations which public policy may require by reason of their quality as a legal tender and as a medium of exchange. These limitations are due to the fact that public law gives to such coinage a value which does not attach as a mere consequence of intrinsic value. Their quality as a legal tender is an attribute of law aside from their bullion value. They bear, therefore, the impress of sovereign power which fixes value and authorizes their use in exchange . ... However unwise a law may be, aimed at the exportation of such coins, in the face of the axioms against obstructing the free flow of commerce, there can be no serious doubt but that the power to coin money includes the power to prevent its outflow from the country of its origin.' The same reasoning is applicable to the imposition of restraints upon transactions in foreign exchange. We cannot say, in view of the conditions that existed, that the Congress having this power exercised it arbitrarily or capriciously. And the holder of an obligation, or bond, of the United States, payable in gold coin of the former standard, so far as the restraint upon the right to export gold coin or to engage in transactions in foreign exchange is concerned, was in no better case than the holder of gold coin itself. \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 357]\n\u00a0\n In considering what damages, if any, the plaintiff has sustained by the alleged breach of his bond, it is hence inadmissible to assume that he was entitled to obtain gold coin for recourse to foreign markets or for dealings in foreign exchange or for other purposes contrary to the control over gold coin which the Congress had the power to exert, and had exerted, in its monetary regulation. Plaintiff's damages could not be assessed without regard to the internal economy of the country at the time the alleged breach occurred. The discontinuance of gold payments and the establishment of legal tender currency on a standard unit of value with which 'all forms of money' of the United States were to be 'maintained at a parity' had a controlling influence upon the domestic economy. It was adjusted to the new basis. A free domestic market for gold was nonexistent.\n Plaintiff demands the 'equivalent' in currency of the gold coin promised. But 'equivalent' cannot mean more than the amount of money which the promised gold coin would be worth to the bondholder for the purposes for which it could legally be used. That equivalence or worth could not properly be ascertained save in the light of the domestic and restricted market which the Congress had lawfully established. In the domestic transactions to which the plaintiff was limited, in the absence of special license, determination of the value of the gold coin would necessarily have regard to its use as legal tender and as a medium of exchange under a single monetary system with an established parity of all currency and coins. And, in view of the control of export and foreign exchange, and the restricted domestic use, the question of value, in relation to transactions legally available to the plaintiff, would require a consideration of the purchasing power of the dollars which the plaintiff could have received. Plaintiff has not shown, or attempted to show, that in relation to buying power he has sustained any loss whatever. On \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 358]\n\u00a0\n the contrary, in view of the adjustment of the internal economy to the single measure of value as established by the legislation of the Congress, and the universal availability and use throughout the country of the legal tender currency in meeting all engagements, the payment to the plaintiff of the amount which he demands would appear to constitute, not a recoupment of loss in any proper sense, but an unjustified enrichment.\n Plaintiff seeks to make his case solely upon the theory that by reason of the change in the weight of the dollar he is entitled to $1.69 in the present currency for every dollar promised by the bond, regardless of any actual loss he has suffered with respect to any transaction in which his dollars may be used. We think that position is untenable.\n In the view that the facts alleged by the petition fail to show a cause of action for actual damages, the first question submitted by the Court of Claims is answered in the negative. It is not necessary to answer the second question.\n Question No. 1 is answered 'No.'\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (concurring).\n I agree that the answer to the first question is 'No,' but I think our opinion should be confined to answering that question, and that it should essay an answer to no other.\n I do not doubt that the gold clause in the government bonds, like that in the private contracts just considered, calls for the payment of value in money, measured by a stated number of gold dollars of the standard defined in the clause, Feist v. Socie te Intercommunale Belge d'Electricite , (1934) A.C. 161, 170-173; Serbian and Brazilian Bond Cases, P.C.I.J., series A., Nos. 20, 21, pp. 32-34, 109-119. In the absence of any further exertion of governmental power, that obligation plainly could not be \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 359]\n\u00a0\n satisfied by payment of the same number of dollars, either specie or paper, measured by a gold dollar of lesser weight, regardless of their purchasing power or the state of our internal economy at the due date.\n I do not understand the government to contend that it is any the less bound by the obligation than a private individual would be, or that it is free to disregard it except in the exercise of the constitutional power 'to coin money' and 'regulate the value thereof.' In any case, there is before us no question of default apart from the regulation by Congress of the use of gold as currency.\n While the government's refusal to make the stipulated payment is a measure taken in the exercise of that power, this does not disguise the fact that its action is to that extent a repudiation of its undertaking. As much as I deplore this refusal to fulfill the solemn promise of bonds of the United States, I cannot escape the conclusion, announced for the Court, that in the situation now presented, the government, through the exercise of its sovereign power to regulate the value of money, has rendered itself immune from liability for its action. To that extent it has relieved itself of the obligation of its domestic bonds, precisely as it has relieved the obligors of private bonds in Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, 55 S.Ct. 407, decided this day.\n In this posture of the case it is unnecessary, and I think undesirable, for the Court to undertake to say that the obligation of the gold clause in government bonds is greater than in the bonds of private individuals, or that in some situation not described, and in some manner and in some measure undefined, it has imposed restrictions upon the future exercise of the power to regulate the currency. I am not persuaded that we should needlessly intimate any opinion which implies that the obligation may so operate, for example, as to interpose a serious obstacle to the adoption of measures for stabilization of \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 360]\n\u00a0\n the dollar, should Congress think it wise to accomplish that purpose by resumption of gold payments, in dollars of the present or any other gold content less than that specified in the gold clause, and by the re- establishment of a free market for gold and its free exportation.\n There is no occasion now to resolve doubts, which I entertain, with respect to these questions. At present they are academic. Concededly they may be transferred wholly to the realm of speculation by the exercise of the undoubted power of the government to withdraw the privilege of suit upon its gold clause obligations. We have just held that the Court of Claims was without power to entertain the suit in Nortz v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 317\n, 55 S.Ct. 428, because, regardless of the nature of the obligation of the gold certificates, there was no damage. Here it is declared that there is no damage because Congress, by the exercise of its power to regulate the currency, has made it impossible for the plaintiff to enjoy the benefits of gold payments promised by the government. It would seem that this would suffice to dispose of the present case, without attempting to prejudge the rights of other bondholders and of the government under other conditions which may never occur. It will not benefit this plaintiff, to whom we deny any remedy, to be assured that he has an inviolable right to performance of the gold clause.\n Moreover, if the gold clause be viewed as a gold value contract, as it is in Norman v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., supra, it is to be noted that the government has not prohibited the free use by the bondholder of the paper money equivalent of the gold clause obligation; it is the prohibition, by the Joint Resolution of Congress, of payment of the increased number of depreciated dollars required to make up the full equivalent, which alone bars recovery. \n\n[294 U.S. 330, 361]\n\u00a0\n In that case it would seem to be implicit in our decision that the prohibition, at least in the present situation, is itself a constitutional exercise of the power to regulate the value of money.\n I therefore do not join in so much of the opinion as may be taken to suggest that the exercise of the sovereign power to borrow money on credit, which does not override the sovereign immunity from suit, may nevertheless preclude or impede the exercise of another sovereign power, to regulate the value of money; or to suggest that, although there is and can be no present cause of action upon the repudiated gold clause, its obligation is nevertheless, in some manner and to some extent not stated, superior to the power to regulate the currency which we now hold to be superior to the obligation of the bonds.\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND and Mr. Justice BUTLER, dissent. For opinion, see Norman v. Baltimore & O.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 240\n, 55 S.Ct. 407, at page 419. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] And subdivision (b) of section 1 of the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, provided: 'As used in this resolution, the term 'obligation' means an obligation (including every obligation of and to the United States, excepting currency) payable in money of the United States; and the term 'coin or currency' means coin or currency of the United States, including Federal Reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks and national banking associations.' 31 USCA  463(b). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Mr. Justice Strong, who had written the opinion of the majority of the Court in the Legal Tender Cases (Knox v.

And, with respect to the sanctity of the contracts of the government, he quoted, with approval, the opinion of Mr. Hamilton in his communication to the Senate of January 20, 1795 (citing 3 Hamilton's Works, 518, 519), that 'when a government enters into a contract with an individual, it deposes, as to the matter of the contract, its constitutional authority, and exchanges the character of legislator for that of a moral agent, with the same rights and obligations as an individual. Its promises may be justly considered as excepted out of its power to legislate, unless in aid of them.

Jacobs, of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n In this suit for injunction to restrain an alleged infringement of a patent, and for an accounting, the Circuit Court of Appeals, on November 10, 1934, vacated an interlocutory decree for injunction and directed the District Court to dismiss the bill. On February 4, 1935, this Court granted a writ of certiorari. \n294 \nU.S. 700\n, 55 S.Ct. 507, 79 L.Ed. --. Upon the argument at this bar, respondent suggested that there had been a change in conditions since the decision of the Court of Appeals and the case was continued to permit counsel to submit briefs upon the questions thus raised. Briefs have been submitted accordingly.\n It appears that after the decree of the Court of Appeals, and on January 17, 1935, the superior court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, in a suit brought by petitioner (its name having been changed to the H. W. Peters Corporation), appointed a receiver 'of the estate, property, moneys, debts and effects of every kind and nature' belonging to petitioner. Later, on February 25, 1935, after the writ of certiorari had been granted, the state court authorized the receiver 'to sell at public sale all right, title and interest that the receiver may have' in the present suit, which was described as 'pending in the United States Supreme Court entitled 'Peters Patent Corporation v. Bates & Klinke, Inc.,' being No. 601 of the October Term, 1934.' The sale was made accordingly and was confirmed by the state court on February 27, 1935. From the petition to confirm the sale it appears that the receiver stipulated that 'he was not selling any right or title in and to any patents belonging to the plaintiff corporation.' \n\n[295 U.S. 392, 394]\n\u00a0\n Harriet E.

RAYTHEON MFG. CO.(1935)\nNo. 127\nArgued: December 11, 1935Decided: December 23, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. John W. Davis, of New York City, and Richard Wait and John L. Hall, both of Boston, Mass., for petitioner.\n Mr. Edward F. McClennen, of Boston, Mass., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question is whether in the circumstances here exhibited the validity of a release pleaded by a defendant as a bar to a cause of action at law is triable in equity.\n Plaintiff, respondent in this court, is a Massachusetts corporation, once known as 'Raytheon Manufacturing Company,' now known as 'Raytheon, Inc.' It sues for the \n\n[296 U.S. 459, 460]\n\u00a0\n benefit of Raytheon Manufacturing Company, a Delaware corporation, which by agreement is to receive the fruits of a recovery. The cause of action is under the anti-trust laws for treble the damages suffered by the plaintiff through a combination and monopoly in restraint of trade and commerce. 15 U.S.C.  1, 2, 14, 15 (15 U.S.C.A.  1, 2, 14, 15). The defendant, petitioner in this court, pleads as one of its defenses that after the cause of action had arisen the plaintiff without duress and for a valuable consideration signed and delivered to the defendant a general release under seal.\n At this point there is need to recur to the allegations of the complaint. From them it appears that the defendant's monopoly became complete by the early part of 1928. The plaintiff's business had then been destroyed to its damage in excess of $3,000,000. 'Wholly because of this destruction and of the illegal duress' imposed by the monopoly, the plaintiff and the Delaware corporation were compelled to seek and accept a license from the defendant and to execute a release. The complaint does not state whether the document was sealed. 'The illegal duress aforesaid by the defendant rendered said release void, and the plaintiff has never executed a valid release of said claim.' Moreover, there was an agreement upon 'the execution of the void release' that its effect in stated contingencies was to be subject to exceptions. The release was not to be pleaded as a bar if there was 'pecuniary recognition' by the defendant of the rights of other claimants. Such 'pecuniary recognition' there has been to the extent of $1,600,000, with the result that plaintiff may recover within that limit, even if not beyond. All t is appears from the complaint with many amplifying statements unimportant here and now.\n The issues being thus defined, the defendant moved upon the pleadings to transfer the case to equity for a preliminary hearing upon the validity of the release. \n\n[296 U.S. 459, 461]\n\u00a0\n This motion was granted against the plaintiff's opposition. Thereafter plaintiff moved to vacate or supersede the transfer, disclaiming 'any right or remedy in this case, because of duress, to be relieved from such operation as said release would have at law had there been no duress.'* This motion was denied. Thereafter plaintiff moved for a final decree dismissing it from equity, and reiterated its disclaimer of any right or remedy not belonging to it at law. This motion also was denied. At the same time a decree was entered at the instance of the defendant adjudging that the release as set forth in the defendant's answer was 'valid and binding,' and sending the case back to law for further proceedings. From the decree and the supporting orders there was an appeal by the plaintiff to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, where the decree and orders were reversed. 76 F.(2d) 943. The opinion covers a wide range. It considers the distinction between fraud in the 'factum' and fraud in the 'inducement' as affecting the power of a court of law to nullify a release not otherwise illegal, and the distinction for the same purpose between sealed and unsealed instruments. It suggests, without deciding, that the presence or absence of a seal, whatever significance may have attached thereto of old, has now ceased to be important. In the end it holds, \n\n[296 U.S. 459, 462]\n\u00a0\n however, that the release signed by the plaintiff was so connected with the unlawful combination and monopoly as to be inoperative at law, irrespective of the possibility of avoiding it in equity. A writ of certiorari issued to resolve a claim of conflict with decisions of this court.\n The answer with its plea in bar will be searched in vain for the suggestion of an equitable defense. A release under seal is a good defense at law, unless its effect is overcome by new matter in avoidance. This will happen, for illustration, when it is so much a part of an illegal transaction as to be void in its inception. If it is subject to that taint, a court of law is competent to put it out of the way. We assume that a like competence exists in other circumstances. True there are times when a release, unassailable at law, is voidable in equity, and in equity only. If the plaintiff were demanding relief upon that basis, the equitable issue would have to be disposed of at the beginning. American Mills Co. v. American Surety Co., \n260 \nU.S. 360, 363\n, 43 S.Ct. 149; Liberty Oil Co. v. Condon National Bank, \n260 \nU.S. 235, 242\n, 43 S.Ct. 118; Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n293 \nU.S. 379, 383\n, 55 S.Ct. 310; Adamos v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n293 \nU.S. 386\n, 55 S.Ct. 315. With the parties so arrayed, the situation would be the same as if a bill in equity had been filed to set aside the release, the suitor thus removing a bar to a recovery. Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., supra, \n293 U.S. 379\n, page 382, 55 S.Ct. 310. But the plaintiff disc aims any title to relief upon that basis. It insists that the release is void at law on one or other of two grounds, either because not sealed by the maker, or because tainted with the same illegality as the illegal combination. It concedes here, as it did in the District Court, that if unable to prevail at law, it is unable to prevail anywhere. Before the days of equitable defenses no one would have insisted that a suitor who refused to file a bill in chancery could be sent there against his will. The only penalty for refusing to go would be the loss of any remedy peculiar to a court of equity. There is no other penalty now \n\n[296 U.S. 459, 463]\n\u00a0\n after the reforms of the Judicial Code. The defendant, setting up a legal defense, the bar of a release, would have us force upon the plaintiff an equitable replication which the plaintiff disavows. Accepting the disavowal, a court of equity must decline at this stage to adjudicate the validity of the release or its effect upon the parties, leaving that issue along with others to adjudication at law.\n In thus delimiting the issues we delimit at the same time the scope of our decision. We do not attempt to say whether the release will collapse upon the showing of an illegal combination or will retain an independent life. That is matter for the trial at law, where the bond between monopoly and surrender can be shown with certainty and fulness. Till then it will be best to put aside as premature not a little that is said in the opinion of the court below. Enough for present purposes that there are issues triable at law, and none triable in equity. We leave our ruling there.\n The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is accordingly affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] For greater certainty, we add the next succeeding paragraph: 'Following this disclaimer, the issue, as to duress, for trial is whether the purported release which was obtained by the defendant from the plaintiff was originally obtained in fact by the duress of a power obtained by the defendant by unlawfully restraining interstate trade and substantially lessening competition therein by contract, combination or conspiracy or otherwise or by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize interstate trade in violation of Code of Laws of the United States, Title 15, Chapter 1, sections 1, 2 and 14, or any of them, and if so whether a court of law, not equity, of the United States will adjudge originally valid a release so obtained, notwithstanding such duress.' \n\n\n\n\n","138":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD v.

From a decree granting the relief sought, an appeal was perfected to the Court of Appeals. Before hearing in that tribunal, the petitioners applied for a writ of certiorari, representing that no serious or difficult questions of fact were involved, and urging the importance of an early and final decision of the controversy. In the exercise of power conferred by statute,2 we issued the writ. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The act establishes a compulsory retirement and pension system for all carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  1 et seq.). There is provision for the creation of a fund to be deposited in the United States Treasury (sections 5, 8 (45 USCA  205, 208)) and administered by a Board denominated an independent agency in the executive branch of the government (section 9 (45 USCA  209)). The retirement fund for payment of these pensions and for the expenses of administration of the system will arise from compulsory contributions from present and future employees and the carriers. The sums payable by the employees are to be percentages of their current compensation, and those by each carrier double the total payable by its employees. The Board is to determine from \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 345]\n\u00a0\n time to time what percentage is required to provide the necessary funds, but, until that body otherwise determines, the employee contribution is to be 2 per cent. of compensation (section 5 (45 USCA  205)). Out of this fund annuities are to be paid to beneficiaries.\n The classes of persons eligible for such annuities are (1) employees of any carrier on the date of passage of the act; (2) those who subsequently become employees of any carrier; (3) those who within one year prior to the date of enactment were in the service of any carrier. Section 1(b) of the act, 45 USCA  201(b).\n To every person in any of the three categories an annuity becomes payable (a) when he reaches the age of 65 years, whether then in carrier service or not (section 3 (45 USCA  203)); if still in such service he and his employer may agree that he shall remain for successive periods of one year until he attains 70, at which time he must retire (section 4 (45 USCA  204)); (b) at the option of the employee, at any time between the ages of 51 and 65, if he has served a total of 30 years in the employ of one or more carriers, whether continuously or not (section 3, and section 1(f) of the act, 45 USCA  201(f), 203). The compulsory retirement provision is not applicable to those in official positions until five years after the effective date of the act (section 4).\n The annuity is payable monthly (section 1(d) of the act, 45 USCA  201(d). The amount is ascertained by multiplying the number of years of service, not exceeding 30, before as well as subsequent to the date the Act was adopted, whether for a single carrier or a number of carriers, and whether continuous or not, by graduated percentages of the employee's average monthly compensation (excluding all over $300). If one who has completed 30 years of service elects to retire before attaining the age of 65 years, the annuity is reduced by one-fifteenth for each year he lacks of that age, unless the retirement is due to physical or mental disability ( section 3).\n Upon the death of an employee, before or after retirement, his estate is to be repaid all that he has contributed \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 346]\n\u00a0\n to the fund, with 3 per cent. interest compounded annually, less any annuity payments received by him (section 3).\n The Supreme Court of the District of Columbia declared the establishment of such a system within the competence of Congress, but though several inseparable features of the act transcended the legislative power to regulate interstate commerce, and required a holding that the law is unconstitutional in its entirety. Our duty, like that of the court below, is fairly to construe the powers of Congress, and to ascertain whether or not the enactment falls within them, uninfluenced by predilection for or against the policy disclosed in the legislation. The fact that the compulsory scheme is novel is, of course, no evidence of unconstitutionality. Even should we consider the act unwise and prejudicial to both public and private interest, if it be fairly within delegated power, our obligation is to sustain it. On the other hand, though we should think the measure embodies a valuable social plan and be in entire sympathy with its purpose and intended results, if the provisions go beyond the boundaries of constitutional power we must so declare.\n The admitted fact that many railroads have voluntarily adopted pension plans does not aid materially in determining the authority of Congress to compel conformance to the one embodied in the Railroad Retirement Act, nor does the establishment of compulsory retirement plans in European countries, to which petitioners refer, for in many of these railroads are operated under government ownership, and none has a constitutional system comparable to ours.\n The federal government is one of enumerated powers; those not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states or to the people. The Constitution is not a statute, but the supreme law of the land to which all \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 347]\n\u00a0\n statutes must conform, and the powers conferred upon the federal government are to be reasonably and fairly construed, with a view to effectuating their purposes. But recognition of this principle cannot justify attempted exercise of a power clearly beyond the true purpose of the grant. All agree that the pertinent provision of the Constitution is article 1,  8, cl. 3, which confers power on the Congress 'to regulate Commerce ... among the several States; ...' and that this power must be exercised in subjection to the guarantee of due process of law found in the Fifth Amendment. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioners assert that the questioned act, fairly considered, is a proper and necessary regulation of interstate commerce; its various provisions have reasonable relation to the main and controlling purposes of the enactment, the promotion of efficiency, economy, and safety; consequently it falls within the power conferred by the commerce clause and does not offend the principle of due process. The respondents insist that numerous features of the act contravene the due process guaranty, and further that the requirement of pensions for employees of railroads is not a regulation of interstate commerce within the meaning of the Constitution. These conflicting views open two fields of inquiry which to some extent overlap. \n5\n If we assume that under the power to \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 348]\n\u00a0\n regulate commerce between the states Congress may require the carriage to make some provision for retiring and pensioning their employees, then the contention that various provisions of the act are arbitrary and unreasonable and bear no proper relation to that end must be considered. If any are found which deprive the railroads of their property without due process, we must determine whether the remainder may nevertheless stand. Broadly, the record presents the question whether a statutory requirement that retired employees shall be paid pensions is regulation of commerce between the states within article 1,  8.\n\n 1. \nWe first consider the provisions affecting former employees. The act makes eligible for pensions all who were in carrier service within one year prior to its passage, irrespective of any future re-employment. About 146,000 persons fall within this class, which, as found below, includes those who have been discharged for cause, who have been retired, who have resigned to take other gainful employment, who have been discharged because their positions were abolished, who were temporarily employed, or who left the service for other reasons. These persons were not in carrier service at the date of the act, and it is certain thousands of them never again will be. The petitioners say the provision was inserted to assure those on furlough, or temporarily relieved from duty subject to call, the benefit of past years of service, in the event of re-employment, and to prevent the carriers from escaping their just obligations by omitting to recall these persons to service. And it is said that to attempt nicely to adjust the provisions of the act to furloughed men \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 349]\n\u00a0\n would involve difficulties of interpretation and inequalities of operation which the blanket provision avoids. We cannot accept this view. It is arbitrary in the last degree to place upon the carriers the burden of gratuities to thousands who have been unfaithful and for that cause have been separated from the service, or who have elected to pursue some other calling, or who have retired from the business, or have been for other reasons lawfully dismissed. And the claim that such largess will promote efficiency or safety in the future operation of the railroads is without support in reason or common sense.\n In addition to the 146,000 who left the service during the year preceding the passage of the act, over 1,000,000 persons have been, but are not now, in the employ of the carriers. The statute provides that, if any of them is re-employed at any time, for any period, however brief, and in any capacity, his prior service with any carrier shall be reckoned in computing the annuity payable upon his attaining 65 years of age. Such a person may have been out of railroad work for years; his employment may have been terminated for cause; he may have elected to enter some other industry and may have devoted the best years of his life to it; yet if, perchance, some carrier in a distant part of the country should accept him for work of any description, even temporarily, the act throws the burden of his pension on all the railroads, including, it may be, the very one which for just cause dismissed him. Plainly this requirement alters contractual rights; plainly it imposes for the future a burden never contemplated by either party when the earlier relation existed or when it was terminated. The statute would take from the railroads' future earnings amounts to be paid for services fully compensated when rendered in accordance with contract, with no thought on the part of either employer or employee that further sums must be provided by the carrier. The \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 350]\n\u00a0\n provision is not only retroactive in that it resurrects for new burdens transactions long since past and closed; but as to some of the railroad companies it constitutes a naked appropriation of private property upon the basis of transactions with which the owners of the property were never connected. Thus the act denies due process of law by taking the property of one and bestowing it upon another. This onerous financial burden cannot be justified upon the plea that it is in the interest of economy, or will promote efficiency or safety. The petitioners say that one who is taken back into service will no doubt render more loyal service since he will know he is to receive a bonus for earlier work. But he will not attribute this benefaction to his employer. The argument comes merely to the contentment and satisfaction theory discussed elsewhere. The petitioners also argue that, if the provision in question threatens an unreasonable burden, the carriers have in their own control the means of avoidance, since no carrier need employ any person who has heretofore been in the railroad business. The position is untenable for several reasons. A carrier may wish to employ one having experience, who has been in another's service. Must it forego the opportunity because to choose the servant will impose a financial obligation arising out of an earlier employment with some other railroad? Would that promote efficiency and safety? The testimony shows that 22 per cent. of all railway employees have had prior service on some railroad. Must a carrier at its peril exercise, through dozens of employment agencies scattered over a vast territory, an unheard of degree of care to exclude all former railroad workers at the risk of incurring the penalty of paying a pension for work long since performed for some other employer? So to hold would be highly unreasonable and arbitrary.\n\n 2. \nSeveral features of the act, touching those now or hereafter in railroad employment, are especially challenged by the respondents. \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 351]\n\u00a0\n No specified length of service is required for eligibility to pension, though the amount of the annuity is proportionately reduced if the total term of employment be less than 30 years. One may take a position with a carrier at 20, remain until he is 30, resign after gaining valuable skill and aptitude for his work, enter a more lucrative profession, and, though never thereafter in carrier employ, at 65 receive a pension calculated on his 10 years of service. Or after 10 years he may be discharged for peculation, and still be entitled to the gratuity. Or he may be relieved of duty for gross negligence, entailing loss of life or property, and yet collect his pension at 65. May these results be fairly denominated the indicia of reasonable regulating of commerce? May they be cited in favor of this pension system as an aid to economy, efficiency, or safety? We cannot so hold. The petitioners' explanation of this feature of the act is that no 'real assurance' of 'oldage security' is possible 'when pension rights may be lost at any time by loss of employment'; that such a provision is reasonable 'because it improves the morale of the employees while they are in the service.' Assurance of security it truly gives, but, quite as truly, if 'morale' is intended to connote efficiency, loyalty, and continuity of service, the surest way to destroy it in any privately owned business is to substitute legislative largess for private bounty and thus transfer the drive for pensions to the halls of Congress and transmute loyalty to employer into gratitude to the Legislature.\n The act assumes that, in fairness, both employer and employee should contribute in fixed proportions to a liberal pension. But we find that, in contradiction of this recognized principle, thousands of those in the service at the date of the act will at once become entitled to annuities, though they will have contributed nothing to the fund. The burden thus cast on the carriers is found to be for the first year of administration over $9,000,000, \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 352]\n\u00a0\n and, until the termination of payments to these annuitants, not less than $ 78,000,000. All that has been said of the irrelevance of the requirement of payments based upon services heretofore terminated to any consideration of efficiency or safety applies here with equal force. The petitioners say that the retention of these men will be injurious and costly to the service. This view assumes they will be retained for years and are incompetent to do what they are now doing. Evidence is lacking to support either supposition. Next it is said 'that they will receive from the fund more than they will have contributed is not significant for all retired employees receive more than they contribute.' This attempted but futile justification is significant of the fault in the feature sought to be supported.\n One who has served a total of 30 years is entitled to retire on pension at his election, at whatever his then attained age. Thus many who are experienced and reliable may at their own election deprive a carrier of their services, enter another gainful occupation, cease to contribute to the fund, and go upon the pension roll years before the fixed retirement age of 65. The finding is that there are not less than 100,000 in the service of the carriers between 51 and 65 years of age who have had 30 or more years of service. The option is not extended to them to retire on pension in order to improve transportation, for the choice is the employee's to be exercised solely on grounds personal to himself; and the provisions cannot promote economy, for the retiring workers' place will be filled by another who will receive the same wage. The court below properly found that 'it is to the interest of the service of plaintiffs and is to the interest of the public that those of such employees who are competent and efficient be retained in carrier service for the benefit of their skill and experience.' The petitioners say 'clearly the provision in question is not arbitrary and unreason \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 353]\n\u00a0\n able so as to be unlawful'; but in support of this statement they adduce only the following considerations: As the pension is reduced one-fifteenth for each year the annuitant lacks of 65 at the date of retirement, his separation, it is said, will impose no greater burden on the fund than if he had waited until 65; the reduction in the amount payable will discourage early retirement, and so tend to counteract the loss of skilled workers; and, finally, 'the justification for this provision is that employees who have completed thirty years of service may find it necessary, and it may be in the interest of the industry, for them to retire before age 65.' We search in vain for any assertion that the feature under discussion will promote economy, efficiency, or safety, and the absence of any such claim is not surprising. The best that can be said, it seems, is that the burden incident to the privilege of early retirement will not be as heavy as others imposed by the statute.\n On June 27, 1934, when the act was approved, there were 1,164,707 people in carrier employ. The act, by conferring a statutory right to a pension, based in part on past service, gave the work theretofore performed by these persons a new quality. Although completed and compensated in full in conformity with the agreement of the parties, that work, done over a period of 30 years past, is to be the basis for further compulsory payment. While, as petitioners point out, the bounties are payable only in the future, any continuance of the relation, however brief, subsequent to the passage of the act, matures a right which reaches back to the date of original employment. And to the amount payable in virtue of all these prior years' service the employees contribute nothing. It is no answer to say that from the effective date of the law they will have to contribute from their wages half as much as do their employers. The future accrues its own annuities. The finding, accepted by the petitioners as veracious, is that the annuities payable for service performed prior to June \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 354]\n\u00a0\n 27, 1934, would in the year 1935 amount to $68,749,000, and would increase yearly until 1953, in which year the portion of the aggregate pension payments attributable to work antedating the passage of the act would be $ 137,435,000. These figures apply only to pensions to those now employed and exclude payments to those who left the service during the year prior to the adoption of the act, and to those former employees who may hereafter be re-employed.\n This clearly arbitrary imposition of liability to pay again for services long since rendered and fully compensated is not permissible legislation. The court below held the provision deprived the railroads of their property without due process, and we agree with that conclusion. Here again the petitioners insist that the requirement is appropriate, because, they say, it does not demand additional pay for past services, but expenditure 'for a present and future benefit through improvement of the personnel of the carriers.' But the argument ends with mere statement. Moreover, if it were correct in its assumption, which we shall presently show it is not, nevertheless there can be no constitutional justification for arbitrarily imposing millions of dollars of additional liabilities upon the carriers in respect of transactions long closed on a basis of cost with reference to which their rates were made and their fiscal affairs adjusted.\n The act defines as an employee entitled to its benefits an official or representative of an employee organization who during or following employment by a carrier acts for such an organization in behalf of employees. Such an one may retire and receive a pension provided in future he pays an amount equal to the sum of the contributions of an employee and of an employer. The petitioners say the burden thus imposed is not great; but the provision exhibits the same arbitrary and unreasonable features \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 355]\n\u00a0\n as those heretofore discussed, and seems irrelevant to any enhancement of safety or efficiency in transportation.\n\n 3. \nCertain general features of the system violate the Fifth Amendment. Under the statutory plan the draft upon the pension fund will be at a given rate, while the contributions of individual carriers to build up the fund will be at a disparate rate. This results from the underlying theory of the act, which is that all the railroads shall be treated as a single employer. The report of the Senate subcommittee announced:6\n'It is agreed that all railroads which have been subjected to the jurisdiction of Congress are to be treated together as one employer. All persons in the service of the railroads are to be regarded as employees of the one employer. ... The old age pension or annuity is to be based upon the wages and the length of service upon all railroads, with specified maximum limits.'\n\n The petitioners themselves showed at the trial that the probable age of entry into service of typical carriers differs materially; for one it is 28.4, for another 32.4, for a third 29.3, and for a fourth 34.2. Naturally the age of a pensioner at date of employment will affect the resultant burden upon the contributors to the fund. The statute requires that all employees of age 70 must retire immediately. It is found that 56 of the respondents have no employees in that class. Nevertheless they must contribute toward the pensions of such employees of other respondents nearly $4,000,000 the first year and nearly $33,000,000 in the total. The petitioners admit that these are the facts, but attempt to avoid their force by the assertion that 'the cost differentials which are involved are negligible as compared with the total cost.' This can only mean that, in view of the enormous total cost to all \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 356]\n\u00a0\n the railroads, the group thus discriminated against should not complain of the disregard of their ownership of their own assets, because in comparison with gross cost the additional payments due to the inequality mentioned are small.\n The evidence shows that some respondents are solvent and others not, a situation which often may recur. The petitioners concede that the plan is intended to furnish assurance of payment of pensions to employees of all the carriers, with the result that solvent railroads must furnish the money necessary to meet the demands of the system upon insolvent carriers, since the very purpose of the act is that the pension fund itself shall be kept solvent and able to answer all the obligations placed upon it.\n In recent years many carriers subject to the Interstate Commerce Act have gone out of existence. The petitioners admit that the employees of these defunct carriers are treated upon exactly the same basis as the servants of existing carriers. In other words, past service for a carrier no longer existing is to be added to any service hereafter rendered to an operating carrier, in computing a pension the whole burden of payment of which falls on those carriers still functioning. And all the future employees of any railroad which discontinues operation must be paid their pensions by the surviving roads. Again the answer of the petitioners is that the amount will be negligible. The fact that millions of dollars are involved in other features of the act will not serve to obscure this violation of due process.\n All the carriers must make good the contributions of all employees, for section 3 (45 USCA  203) directs that upon the death of an employee the Board shall pay him from the fund what he has contributed to it with 3 per cent. interest compounded annually, less any payments he has received. The railroads are not only liable for their own contributions, but are, in a measure, made insurers of those of \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 357]\n\u00a0\n the employees. This appears to be an unnecessarily harsh and arbitrary imposition, if the plan is to be what on its face it imports, a joint adventure with mutuality of obligation and benefit.\n This court has repeatedly had occasion to say that the railroads, though their property be dedicated to the public use, remain the private property of their owners, and that their assets may not be taken without just compensation. \n7\n The carriers have not ceased to be privately operated and privately owned, however much subject to regulation in the interest of interstate commerce. There is no warrant for taking the property or money of one and transferring it to another without compensation, whether the object of the transfer be to build up the equipment of the transferee or to pension its employees.\n The petitioners insist that, since the adoption of the Transportation Act 1920 (41 Stat. 456), and as the logical consequence of decisions of this court, we must recognize that Congress may deal with railroad transportation as a whole and regulate the carriers generally and in classes, with an eye to improvement and development of railway service as a whole; that the interstate carriers use common facilities, make through rates, and interact amongst themselves in various ways, with the result that, where any link in the chain lacks efficiency, the system as a whole is affected. The argument is that, since the railroads and the public have a common interest in the efficient performance of the whole transportation chain, it is proper and necessary to require all carriers to contribute to the cost of a plan designed to serve this end. It is said that the pooling principle is desirable because there are many small carriers whose employees are too few to justify maintenance of a separate retirement plan for each. And, finally, the \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 358]\n\u00a0\n claim is that, in fixing carrier contributions, any attempt to give consideration to difference in age, classification, and service periods of employees would involve grave administrative difficulties and unduly increase the cost of administration. With these considerations in view, the petitioners urge that our decisions sanction the exercise of the power involved in the pooling feature of the statute. They rely upon the New England Divisions Case, \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S.Ct. 270. That case, however, dealt purely with rates; and, while the policy of awarding a larger share of the division of a joint rate to the weaker carrier, in consideration of its need for revenue, was approved, the approval was definitely conditioned upon the circumstance that the share or division of the joint rate awarded to the stronger carrier was not so low as to require it to serve for an unreasonable rate. Thus the principle that Congress has no power to confiscate the property of one carrier for the benefit of another was fully recognized.\n Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 33 A.L.R. 472, approved the provision of the Transportation Act 1920 (49 USCA  15a), which required the carriers to contribute one-half of their excess earnings to a revolving fund to be used by the Interstate Commerce Commission for making loans to carriers to meet capital expenditures and to refund maturing obligations, or to purchase equipment and facilities which might be leased to carriers. This case is relied upon as sustaining the principle underlying the Pension Act, but we think improperly. The provision was sustained upon the ground that it must be so administered as to leave to each carrier a reasonable return upon its property devoted to transportation, and the holding is clear that, if this principle were not observed in administration, the act would invade constitutional rights.\n Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186\n, 31 S.Ct. 164, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 7, which the petitioners cite, is even wider of the mark. There this court upheld the Carmack Amendment (49 USCA  20), \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 359]\n\u00a0\n which made the initial carrier liable to the consignor for loss of goods contracted to be delivered over connecting lines. The legislation merely attached certain consequences to a given form of contract. It was recognized that initial carriers in fact enter into contracts for delivery of goods beyond their own lines and make through or joint rates over independent lines. This being so, it was held a proper exercise of the power of regulation to require one so contracting to be liable in the first instance to the shipper. So to regulate a recognized form of contract is not offensive to the Fifth Amendment.\n It is claimed that several other decisions confirm the legality of the pooling principle, when reasonably applied. For this position petitioners cite Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642; Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104\n, 31 S.Ct. 186, 32 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487, and Thornton v. Duffy, \n254 \nU.S. 361\n, 41 S.Ct. 137. In the first of these the Washington Workmen's Compensation Act, which required employers in extra-hazardous employment to pay into a state fund certain premiums based upon the percentage of estimated pay roll of the workmen employed, was under attack. For the purpose of payments into the fund accounts were to be kept with each industry in accordance with a statutory classification, and it was definitely provided that no class should be liable for the depletion of the accident fund by reason of accidents happening in any other class. The act therefore clearly recognized the difference in drain or burden on the fund arising from different industries and sought to equate the burden in accordance with the risk. The challenge of the employers was that the statute failed of equitable apportionment as between the constituted classes. But no proof was furnished to that effect, and this court assumed that the classification was made in an effort at fairness and equity as between classes. The Railroad Retirement Act, on the contrary, makes no classification, but, as above said, \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 360]\n\u00a0\n treats all the carriers as a single employer, irrespective of their several conditions.\n In the second case this court upheld a statute which required state banks to contribute a uniform percentage of their deposits to a state guaranty fund established for the purpose of making good losses to the depositors of banks which might become insolvent. The act was sustained upon the principle that an ulterior public advantage may justify the taking of a comparatively insignificant amount of private property for what in its immediate purpose is a private use. It was further said that there may be cases other than those of taxation in which the share of each party in the benefit of a scheme of mutual protection is sufficient compensation for the correlative burden which it is compelled to assume. These considerations clearly distinguish that case from the one now under discussion.\n In the case last cited it was asserted that the Workmen's Compensation Act of Ohio unfairly discriminated because it allowed employers in certain cases to pay directly to workmen or their dependents the compensation provided by law, in lieu of contributing to the state fund established to secure such payments. This court held that the classification did not amount to a denial of due process.\n We conclude that the provisions of the act which disregard the private and separate ownership of the several respondents, treat them all as a single employer, and pool all their assets, regardless of their individual obligations and the varying conditions found in their respective enterprises, cannot be justified as consistent with due process.\n The act is said to be unconstitutional because unreasonably and unconscionably burdensome and oppressive upon the respondents, and we are referred to a finding of the court below to which petitioners do not assign error. \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 361]\n\u00a0\n The facts as found are: Based upon present pay rolls, the carriers' contributions for the first year will aggregate not less than $60,000,000; at the rates fixed in the act, total employee and carrier contributions will, on the basis of present pay rolls, be approximately $90,000,000 per year; unless the amount of the contributions is increased by the Board, the drain on the fund for payment of pensions will result in a deficit of over $11,000,000 by the year 1942. To keep the fund in operation, it will be necessary for the Board to increase the percentages of contributions named in the act. The petitioners' actuary testified that in the tenth year of operation the payments from the fund will be upwards of $137,000, 000. The railroads' total contribution to pensions on account of prior service of employees in service at the date of the act may amount to $2, 943,966,000. We are not prepared to hold that, if the law were in other respects within the legislative competence, the enormous cost involved in its administration would invalidate it; but the recited facts at least emphasize the burdensome and perhaps destructive effect of the contraventions of the due process of law clause which we find exist. Moreover, they exhibit the inconsistency of the petitioners' position that the law is necessary because in times of depression the voluntary systems of the carriers are threatened by loss of revenue. It is difficult to perceive how the vast increase in pension expense entailed by the statute will, without provision of additional revenue, relieve the difficulty experienced by some railroads in meeting the demands of the plans now in force.\n\n 4. \nWhat has been said sufficiently indicates our agreement with the holding of the trial court respecting the disregard of due process exhibited by a number of the provisions of the act. We also concur in that court's views concerning the inseverability of certain of them. The statute contains a section broadly declaring the intent that invalid provisions shall not operate to destroy \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 362]\n\u00a0\n the law as a whole. \n8\n Such a declaration provides a rule which may aid in determining the legislative intent, but is not an inexorable command. Dorchy v. Kansas, \n264 \nU.S. 286\n, 44 S.Ct. 323. It has the effect of reversing the presumption which would otherwise be indulged, of an intent that, unless the act operates as an entirety, it shall be wholly ineffective. Williams v. Standard Oil Co., \n278 \nU.S. 235, 242\n, 49 S.Ct. 115, 60 A.L.R. 596; Utah Power & Light Co. v. Pfost, \n286 \nU.S. 165, 184\n, 52 S.Ct. 548. But, notwithstanding the presumption in favor of divisibility which arises from the legislative declaration, we cannot rewrite a statute and give it an effect altogether different from that sought by the measure viewed as a whole. Compare Hill v. Wallace, \n259 \nU.S. 44, 70\n, 42 S.Ct. 453. In this view we are confirmed by the petitioners' argument that, as to some of the features we hold unenforceable, it is 'unthinkable' and 'impossible' that the Congress would have created the compulsory pension system without them. They so affect the dominant aim of the whole statute as to carry it down with them.\n\n 5. \nIt results from what has now been said that the act is invalid because several of its inseparable provisions contravene the due process of law clause of the Fifth Amendment. We are of opinion that it is also bad for another reason which goes to the heart of the law, even if it could survive the loss of the unconstitutional features which we have discussed. The act is not in purpose or effect a regulation of interstate commerce within the meaning of the Constitution.\n Several purposes are expressed in section 2(a), of the act (45 USCA  202(a), amongst them: To provide 'adequately for the satisfactory retirement of aged employees'; 'to make possible greater \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 363]\n\u00a0\n employment opportunity and more rapid advancement'; to provide by the administration and construction of the act 'the greatest practicable amount of relief from unemployment and the greatest possible use of resources available for said purpose and for the payment of annuities for the relief of superannuated employees.' The respondents assert and the petitioners admit that though these may in and of themselves be laudable objects, they have no reasonable relation to the business of interstate transportation. The clause, however, states a further purpose, the promotion of 'efficiency and safety in interstate transportation,' and the respondents concede that an act, the provisions of which show that it actually is directed to the attainment of such a purpose, falls within the regulatory power conferred upon the Congress; but they contend that here the provisions of the statute emphasize the necessary conclusion that the plan is conceived solely for the promotion of the stated purposes other than efficient and safe operation of the railroads. The petitioners' view is that this is the true and only purpose of the enactment, and the other objects stated are collateral to it and may be disregarded if the law is found apt for the promotion of this legitimate purpose.\n From what has already been said with respect to sundry features of the statutory scheme, it must be evident that petitioners' view is that safety and efficiency are promoted by two claimed results of the plan; the abolition of excessive superannuation, and the improvement of morale.\n The parties are at odds respecting the existing superannuation of railway employees. Petitioners say it is much greater than that found in the heavy industries. Respondents assert it is less, and the court below so found. The finding is challenged as being contrary to the evidence. We may, for present purposes, assume that 'superannuation' as petitioners use the term, i.e., the \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 364]\n\u00a0\n attainment of 65 years, is as great or greater in the railroad industry than in comparable employments. It does not follow, as contended, that the man of that age is inefficient or incompetent. The facts indicate a contrary conclusion. Petitioners say the seniority rules and the laying off of younger men first in reducing forces, necessarily tend to keep an undue proportion of older men in the service. They say this tendency has long been marked in the railroad industry and has been most noticeable in recent years of depression when forces have been greatly reduced. But what are the uncontradicted facts as to efficiency and safety of operation? Incontrovertible statistics obtained from the records of the Interstate Commerce Commission show a steady increase in safety of operation, during this period of alleged increasing superannuation. \n 9\n\u00a0\n\n[]\n Total Frt.

We think it not unfair to say that the claim for promotion of safety is virtually abandoned.\n How stands the case for efficiency? Here again the record without contradiction demonstrates that in step with the alleged progressive superannuation on the railroads their operations have increased in efficiency. 11 The trial court found, and its finding is not assigned as error: 'Railroads were, when the Act was enacted, and are now, operated efficiently and safely and more efficiently and much more safely than at any time in history.'\n Lastly, the petitioners suggest that diminution of superannuation promotes economy, because younger and lower paid men will replace the retired older men. But the argument is based upon inadvertent disregard of the wage structure of the carriers, especially in the train and engine service, whereby contract compensation is based not on age but upon the nature of the duties performed. The replacement of one by another who is to do the same work will therefore beget no saving in wages.\n When to these considerations is added that, as heretofore said, the act disregards fitness to work, pensions the worker who retires at his opinion before any suggested superannuation, irrespective of skill or ability, pensions those who are presently compelled by the law to retire, irrespective of their fitness to labor, and grants annuities to those who are discharged for dishonesty or gross care lessness, \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 367]\n\u00a0\n it becomes perfectly clear that, though the plan may bring about the social benefits mentioned in section 2(a), of the act, 45 USCA  202(a), it has and can have no relation to the promotion of efficiency, economy, or safety by separating the unfit from the industry. If these ends demand the elimination of aged employees, their retirement from the service would suffice to accomplish the object. For these purposes the prescription of a pension for those dropped from service is wholly irrelevant. The petitioners, conscious of the truth of this statement, endeavor to avoid its force by the argument that social and humanitarian considerations demand the support of the retired employee. They assert that it would be unthinkable to retire a man without pension, and add that attempted separation of retirement and pensions is unreal in any practical sense, since it would be impossible to require carriers to cast old workers aside without means of support. The supposed impossibility arises from a failure to distinguish constitutional power from social desirability. The relation of retirement to safety and efficiency is distinct from the relation of a pension to the same ends, and the two relationships are not to be confused.\n In final analysis, the petitioners' sole reliance is the thesis that efficiency depends upon morale, and morale in turn upon assurance of security for the worker's old age. Thus pensions are sought to be related to efficiency of transportation, and brought within the commerce power. In supporting the act the petitioners constantly recur to such phrases as 'old age security,' 'assurance of old age security,' 'improvement of employee morale and efficiency through providing definite assurance of old age security,' 'assurance of old age support,' 'mind at ease,' and 'fear of old age dependency.' These expressions are frequently connected with assertions that the removal of the fear of old age dependency will tend to create a better morale throughout the ranks of employees. \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 368]\n\u00a0\n The theory is that one who has an assurance against future dependency will do his work more cheerfully, and therefore more efficiently. The question at once presents itself whether the fostering of a contented mind on the part of an employee by legislation of this type is in any just sense a regulation of interstate transportation. If that question be answered in the affirmative, obviously there is no limit to the field of so-called regulation. The catalogue of means and actions which might be imposed upon an employer in any business, tending to the satisfaction and comfort of his employees, seems endless. Provision for free medical attendance and nursing, for clothing, for food, for housing, for the education of children, and a hundred other matters, might with equal propriety be proposed as tending to relieve the employee of mental strain and worry. Can it fairly be said that the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce extends to the prescription of any or all of these things? Is it not apparent that they are really and essentially related solely to the social welfare of the worker, and therefore remote from any regulation of commerce as such? We think the answer is plain. These matters obviously lie outside the orbit of congressional power. The answer of the petitioners is that not all such means of promoting contentment have such a close relation to interstate commerce as pensions. This is in truth no answer, for we must deal with the principle involved and not the means adopted. If contentment of the employee were an object for the attainment of which the regulatory power could be exerted, the courts could not question the wisdom of methods adopted for its advancement.\n No support for a plan which pensions those who have retired from the service of the railroads can be drawn from the decisions of this court sustaining measures touching the relations of employer and employee in the carrier field in the interest of a more efficient system of transpor- \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 369]\n\u00a0\n tation. The Safety Appliance Acts (45 USCA  1 et seq.), the Employers' Liability Acts (45 USCA  51 et seq.), hours of service laws, and others of analogous character, cited in support of this act, have a direct and intimate connection with the actual operation of the railroads. No less inapposite are the statutes which deal with exchange of facilities, joint facilities, joint rates, etc. For these have an obvious and direct bearing on the obligations of public service incident to the calling of the railroads. The railway labor act was upheld by this court upon the express ground that to facilitate the amicable settlement of disputes which threatened the service of the necessary agencies of interstate transportation tended to prevent interruptions of service and was therefore within the delegated power of regulation. It was pointed out that the act did not interfere with the normal right of the carrier to select its employees or discharge them. Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548, 570\n, 571 S., 50 S.Ct. 427. The legislation considered in Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332\n, 37 S.Ct. 298, L.R.A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024, was drafted to meet a particular exigency, and its validity depended upon circumstances so unusual that this court's decision respecting it cannot be considered a precedent here.\n Stress is laid upon the supposed analogy between workmen's compensation laws and the challenged statute. It is said that while Congress has not adopted a compulsory and exclusive system of workmen's compensation applicable to interstate carriers, no one doubts the power so to do; and the Retirement Act cannot in principle be distinguished. The contention overlooks fundamental differences. Every carrier owes to its employees certain duties the disregard of which render it liable at common law in an action sounding in tort. Each state has developed or adopted, as part of its jurisprudence, rules as to the employer's liability in particular circumstances. These are not the same in all the states. In the absence of a rule applicable to all engaged in interstate transpor- \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 370]\n\u00a0\n tation, the right of recovery for injury or death of an employee may vary depending upon the applicable state law. That Congress may, under the commerce power, prescribe an uniform rule of liability and a remedy uniformly available to all those so engaged is not open to doubt. The considerations upon which we have sustained compulsory workmen's compensation laws passed by the states in the sphere where their jurisdiction is exclusive apply with equal force in any sphere wherein Congress has been granted paramount authority. Such authority it may assert whenever its exercise is appropriate to the purpose of the grant. A case in point is the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act ( 33 USCA  901 et seq.) passed pursuant to the delegation of admiralty jurisdiction to the United States. Modern industry, and this is particularly true of railroads, involves instrumentalities, tasks, and dangers unknown when the doctrines of the common law as to negligence were developing. The resultant injuries to employees, impossible of prevention by the utmost care, may well demand new and different redress from that afforded in the past. In dealing with the situation it is permissible to substitute a new remedy for the common-law right of action; to deprive the employer of common-law defenses and substitute a fixed and reasonable compensation commuted the degree of injury; to replace uncertainty and protracted litigation with certainty and celerity of payment; to eliminate waste; and to make the rule of compensation uniform throughout the field of interstate transportation, in contrast with inconsistent local systems. By the very certainty that compensation must be paid for every injury such legislation promotes and encourages precaution on the part of the employer against accident and tends to make transportation safer and more efficient. The power to prescribe an uniform rule for the transportation industry through- \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 371]\n\u00a0\n out the country justifies the modification of commonlaw rules by the Safety Appliance Acts and the Employers' Liability Acts applicable to interstate carriers, and would serve to sustain compensation acts of a broader scope, like those in force in many states. The collateral fact that such a law may produce contentment among employees, an object which as a separate and independent matter is wholly beyond the power of Congress, would not, of course, render the legislation unconstitutional. It is beside the point that compensation would have to be paid despite the fact that the carrier has performed its contract with its employee and has paid the agreed wages. Liability in tort is imposed without regard to such considerations; and in view of the risks of modern industry the substituted liability for compensation likewise disregards them. Workmen's compensation laws deal with existing rights and liabilities by readjusting old benefits and burdens incident to the relation of employer and employee. Before their adoption the employer was bound to provide a fund to answer the lawful claims of his employees; the change is merely in the required disbursement of that fund in consequence of the recognition that the industry should compensate for injuries occurring with or without fault. The act with which we are concerned seeks to attach to the relation of employer and employee a new incident, without reference to any existing obligation or legal liability, solely in the interest of the employee, with no regard to the conduct of the business, or its safety or efficiency, but purely for social ends.\n The petitioners, in support of their argument as to morale, rely upon the voluntary systems adopted in past years by almost all the carriers, and now in operation. The argument runs that these voluntary plans were adopted in the industry for two principal reasons; the creation of loyalty, and the encouragement of continuity \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 372]\n\u00a0\n in service. The petitioners quote from a statement by the National Industrial Conference Board the following: 'More specifically, the efficiency of the individual workers is stimulated by the feeling of security and hopefulness that results when the individual is relieved of the fear of destitution and dependency in old age and by the sentiment of loyalty and good will fostered by the pension plan, which thus operates as a spur to the ambition of the worker and incites him to more intensive and sustained effort. Similarly the efficiency of the organization as a whole is increased by the improvement of industrial relations, the development of a cooperative spirit, and the promotion of constancy and continuity of employment.'\n They assert that the Railroad Retirement Act, 'although it embodies the first compulsory retirement and pension plan enacted in this country, is but the development of voluntary plans which have been in use in this country, particularly among the railroads, for more than a third of a century.' The argument is self-contradictory. If, as is conceded, the purpose of the voluntary establishment of pensions is to create loyalty to the employer who establishes them, and continuity in his service, it seems axiomatic that the removal of the voluntary character of the pension and the imposition of it in such form as Congress may determine, upon all employers, and irrespective of length of service, or of service for the same employer, will eliminate all sense of loyalty or gratitude to the employer, and remove every incentive to continuance in the service of a single carrier. In fact the petitioners so admit, for they say in their brief: 'That the benefits which respondents expected to derive from their voluntary pension plans (said to be (1) greater continuity of service and ( 2) improved employee loyalty) differ from those emphasized in the Retirement Act does not affect the Act's validity, so long as it is calculated in other ways to promote efficiency and safety.' \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 373]\n\u00a0\n We are left to surmise what these 'other ways' may be unless they are the contentment and assurance of security so much stressed in the argument. The petitioners, in effect, say: The carriers with certain objects and purposes have adopted voluntary systems; this proves that pensions are germane to the railroad business; Congress may legislate on any subject germane to interstate transportation; therefore Congress may for any reason or with any motive impose any type of pension plan. The contention comes very near to this; that whatever some carriers choose to do voluntarily in the management of their business at once invests Congress with the power to compel all carriers to do. The fallacy is obvious. The meaning of the Commerce and Due Process Clauses of the Constitution is not so easily enlarged by the voluntary acts of individuals or corporations.\n Counsel for the petitioners admit that 'it may well be' voluntary plans are intended to promote efficiency and safety by 'inducing loyalty and continuity,' and 'it could also be true that these means were ignored in the Retirement Act.' They add: 'Congress has deliberately chosen the means of providing old age security for all railroad employees, measured by years of service, but not dependent upon continuity of service with any particular carrier, as is required under the existing railway pension systems. If it were true, as claimed, that the Act will not encourage continuity of service and will remove the incentives for employee loyalty to employer, it has other virtues, as has been indicated; for example, it provides greater assurance to employees of old age security than has been the case under the carriers' pension plans, and is likely to be productive of efficiency through improvement of employee morale.'\n Certainly the argument is inconsistent with any thought that a plan imposed by statute, requiring the \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 374]\n\u00a0\n payment of a pension, will promote the same loyalty and continuity of service which were the ends and objects of the voluntary plans. It is going far to say, as petitioners do, that Congress chose the more progressive method 'already tried in the laboratory of industrial experience,' which they claim has been approved and recommended by those qualified to speak. In support of the assertion, however, they cite general works dealing with voluntary pension plans, and not with any such compulsory system as that with which we are concerned. We think it cannot be denied, and, indeed, is in effect admitted, that the sole reliance of the petitioners is upon the theory that contentment and assurance of security are the major purposes of the act. We cannot agree that these ends if dictated by statute, and not voluntarily extended by the employer, encourage loyalty and continuity of service. We feel bound to hold that a pension plan thus imposed is in no proper sense a regulation of the activity of interstate transportation. It is an attempt for social ends to impose by sheer fiat noncontractual incidents upon the relation of employer and employee, not as a rule or regulation of commerce and transportation between the states, but as a means of assuring a particular class of employees against old age dependency. This is neither a necessary nor an appropriate rule or regulation affecting the due fulfillment of the railroads' duty to serve the public in interstate transportation.\n The judgment of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia is affirmed.\n\n The CHIEF JUSTICE (dissenting).\n I am unable to concur in the decision of this case. The gravest aspect of the decision is that it does not rest simply upon a condemnation of particular features of the Railroad Retirement Act (45 USCA  201-214), but denies to Congress the power to pass any compulsory pension act for railroad \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 375]\n\u00a0\n employees. If the opinion were limited to the particular provisions of the act, which the majority find to be objectionable and not severable, the Congress would be free to overcome the objections by a new statute. Classes of persons held to be improperly brought within the range of the act could be eliminated. Criticisms of the basis of payments, of the conditions prescribed for the receipt of benefits, and of the requirements of contributions, could be met. Even in place of a unitary retirement system another sort of plan could be worked out. What was thus found to be inconsistent with the requirements of due process could be excised and other provisions substituted. But after discussing these matters, the majority finally raise a barrier against all legislative action of this nature by declaring that the subject-matter itself lies beyond the reach of the congressional authority to regulate interstate commerce. In that view, no matter how suitably limited a pension act for railroad employees might be with respect to the persons to be benefited, or how appropriate the measure of retirement allowances, or how sound actuarily the plan, or how well-adjusted the burden, still under this decision Congress would not be at liberty to enact such a measure. That is a conclusion of such serious and far-reaching importance that it overshadows all other questions raised by the act. Indeed, it makes their discussion superfluous. The final objection goes, as the opinion states, 'to the heart of the law, even if it could survive the loss of the unconstitutional features' which the opinion perceives. I think that the conclusion thus reached is a departure from sound principles, and places an unwarranted limitation upon the Commerce Clause of the Constitution.\n First. In defining the power vested in Congress to regulate interstate commerce, we invariably refer to the classic statement of Chief Justice Marshall. It is the power 'to prescribe the rule by which commerce is to be governed.' \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 376]\n\u00a0\n The power 'is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations, other than are prescribed in the constitution.' Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196. It is a power to enact 'all appropriate legislation for the protection or advancement' of interstate commerce. The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 564. 'To regulate,' we said in the Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co. (Second Employers' Liability Cases), \n223 \nU.S. 1, 47\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 174, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, 'in the sense intended, is to foster, protect, control, and restrain, with appropriate regard for the welfare of those who are immediately concerned and of the public at large.' And the exercise of the power, thus broadly defined, has had the widest range in dealing with railroads, which are engaged as common carriers in interstate transportation. As their service is vital to the nation, nothing which has a real or substantial relation to the suitable maintenance of that service, or to the discharge of the responsibilities which inhere in it, can be regarded as beyond the power of regulation. Houston, E. & W.T.R. Co. v. U. S. (The Shreveport Case), \n234 \nU.S. 342, 351\n, 34 S.Ct. 833; Dayton-Goose Creek Railway Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456, 478\n, 44 S. Ct. 169, 33 A.L.R. 472; State of Colorado v. United States, \n271 \nU.S. 153, 163\n, 164 S., 46 S.Ct. 452; New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 12, 24\n, 25 S., 53 S.Ct. 45.\n It was inevitable that, with the development of the transportation system of the country, requiring a vast number of employees, there should have been a growing appreciation of the importance of conditions of employment. It could not be denied that the sovereign power to govern interstate carriers extends to the regulation of their relations with their employees who likewise are engaged in interstate commerce. The scope of this sort of regulation has been extensive. There has been not only the paramount consideration of safety, but also the recognition of the fact that fair treatment in other respects aids in conserving the peace and good order which are essential to the maintenance of the service without disastrous interruptions, and in promoting the efficiency which inevi- \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 377]\n\u00a0\n tably suffers from a failure to meet the reasonable demands of justice. An absolute duty to furnish safety appliances has been imposed, restrictions of hours of continuous service have been prescribed, standards of a day's work have been established for work and wages, the liability of carriers for injuries to employees has been regulated by the abrogation of the fellow-servant rule and the limitation of defenses as to contributory negligence and assumption of risk, and provisions have been enacted to facilitate the amicable settlement of disputes and to protect employees in their freedom to organize for the purpose of safeguarding their interests. St. Louis, Iron Mountain & S.R. Co. v. Taylor, \n210 \nU.S. 281\n, 28 S.Ct. 616; Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n221 \nU.S. 612\n, 31 S.Ct. 621; Wilson v. New, \n243 \nU.S. 332\n, 37 S.Ct. 298, L.R.A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024; Texas & New Orleans R. Co. v. Brotherhood of Railway & S. S. Clerks, \n281 \nU.S. 548\n, 50 S.Ct. 427\n\n\n The argument that a pension measure, however sound and reasonable as such, is per se outside the pale of the regulation of interstate carriers, because such a plan could not possibly have a reasonable relation to the ends which Congress is entitled to serve, is largely answered by the practice of the carriers themselves. Following precedents long established in Europe, certain railroad companies in the United States set up voluntary pension systems many years ago. It appears that the first of these was established in 1884, another was adopted in 1900. By 1910, formal pension plans covered 50 per cent. of all railroad employees, and, by 1927, over 82 per cent. In establishing these plans the carriers were not contemplating the payment of a largess unrelated to legitimate transportation ends. Their witnesses say the carriers aimed at loyalty and continuity of service. However limited their motives, they acted upon business principles. Pension plans were not deemed to be essentially foreign to the proper conduct of their enterprises. But if retirement or pension plans are not per se unrelated to the government \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 378]\n\u00a0\n of transportation operations, Congress could consider such plans, examine their utility, and reach its own conclusions. If the subject-matter was open to consideration, Congress was not limited to the particular motives which inspired the plans of the carriers.\n The government stresses the importance of facilitating the retirement of superannuated employees. The argument points to the conclusions of expert students as given in the testimony below, and to the reports of investigating committees and boards of leading business organizations. 'Employees' Retirement Annuities,' Chamber of Commerce of the United States, 1932, pp. 7, 8; 'Elements of Industrial Pension Plans,' National Industrial Conference Board, 1931, pp. 8, 10. Mr. Eastman, the Federal Coordinator of Transportation, in his affidavit on the hearing below, expressed the view that there was excessive superannuation among railroad employees. He says: 'This excessive superannuation is detrimental to railroad service in several ways. Men who have grown old in the service decline in efficiency. The carrier pays in wages an amount out of proportion to the service rendered. These conditions exist upon the railroads at the present time. There is now a large body of superannuated employees in the railroad service who, for the good of the service, ought to be retired. Pension systems, of one sort or another, have been in existence in the railroad industry for as long as 50 years. The need for them was recognized by the more progressive carriers at an early date. In late years, particularly, with the voluntary systems in danger, the matter of retirement and pensions has been a crucial issue in railroad employment. Withdrawal or extensive curtailment of existing pensions in the railroad industry would impair the morale of railroad employees and play havoc with railroad labor relations. It would, in addition, increase the existing excessive superannuation among railroad employees and block the employment and promotion of younger men.' \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 379]\n\u00a0\n The carriers deny that there is excessive superannuation. They assert that the removal of older employees has no reasonable relation to either safety or efficiency. The opinion of the Court enters this field of controversy, reviews statistics as to the increase of safety and efficiency in operation during the period of the alleged increasing superannuation, and supports the finding that railroads are now operated more efficiently and safely than at any time in history. But that gratifying fact does not establish that further improvement is not needed or obtainable, or that a sound pension plan would not be of considerable benefit to the carriers' operations. At best, the question as to the extent of superannuation, and its effect, is a debatable one, and hence one upon which Congress was entitled to form a legislative judgment. As we said in Radice v. New York, \n264 \nU.S. 292, 294\n, 44 S.Ct. 325, 326: 'Where the constitutional validity of a statute depends upon the existence of facts, courts must be cautious about reaching a conclusion respecting them contrary to that reached by the Legislature; and if the question of what the facts establish be a fairly debatable one, it is not permissible for the judge to set up his opinion in respect of it against the opinion of the lawmaker.' See Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 272\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 87 A.L.R. 721.\n Laying that question on one side, I think that it is clear that the morale of railroad employees has an important bearing upon the efficiency of the transportation service, and that a reasonable pension plan by its assurance of security is an appropriate means to that end. Nor should such a plan be removed from the reach of constitutional power by classing it with a variety of conceivable benefits which have no such close and substantial relation to the terms and conditions of employment. The appropriate relation of the exercise of constitutional power to the legitimate objects of that power is always a subject of judicial scrutiny. With approximately 82 per cent. of \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 380]\n\u00a0\n railroad employees, 90 per cent. of those employed in cable, telephone, and telegraph companies, and about one-half of those in the service of electric railways, light, heat, and power companies under formal pension plans,1 with the extensive recognition by national, state and local governments of the benefit of retirement and pension systems for public employees in the interest of both efficiency and economy,2 it is evident that there is a widespread conviction that the assurance of security through a pension plan for retired employees is closely and substantially related to the proper conduct of business enterprises.\n But with respect to the carriers' plans, we are told that as they were framed in the desire to promote loyalty and continuity of service in the employment of particular carriers, the accruing advantages were due to the fact that the plans were of a voluntary character. In short, that the reaction of the employees would be simply one of gratitude for an act of grace. I find no adequate basis for a conclusion that the advantages of a pension plan can be only such as the carriers contemplated or that the benefit which may accrue to the service from a sense of security on the part of employees should be disregarded. In that aspect, it would be the fact that protection was assured, and not the motive in supplying it, which would produce the desired result. That benefit would not be lost because the sense of security was fostered by a pension plan enforced as an act of justice. Indeed, voluntary plans may have the defect of being voluntary, of being subject to curtailment or withdrawal at will. And the danger of such curtailment or abandonment, with the consequent frustration of the hopes of a vast number of railroad workers and its effect upon labor relations in this enterprise of \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 381]\n\u00a0\n outstanding national importance, might well be considered as an additional reason for the adoption of a compulsory plan. Wilson v. New, supra, \n243 U.S. 332\n, pages 347, 348, 37 S.Ct. 298, L.R.A. 1917E, 938, Ann. Cas. 1918A, 1024. There was also testimony (by Mr. Eastman) that 'the experience with the voluntary pension systems has been unsatisfactory,' that 'the depression brought clearly to light their many weaknesses and uncertainties.'\n The argument in relation to voluntary plans discloses the fundamental contention on the question of constitutional authority. In substance, it is that the relation of the carriers and their employees is the subject of contract; that the contract prescribes the work and the compensation; and that a compulsory pension plan is an attempt for social ends to impose upon the relation noncontractual incidents in order to insure to employees protection in their old age. And this is said to lie outside the power of Congress in the government of interstate commerce. Congress may, indeed, it seems to be assumed, compel the elimination of aged employees. A retirement act for that purpose might be passed. But not a pension act. The government's power is conceived to be limited to a requirement that the railroads dismiss their superannuated employees, throwing them out helpless, without any reasonable provision for their protection.\n The argument pays insufficient attention to the responsibilities which inhere in the carriers' enterprise. Those responsibilities, growing out of their relation to their employees, cannot be regarded as confined to the contractual engagement. The range of existing federal regulation of interstate carriers affords many illustrations of the imposition upon the employer-employee relation of noncontractual incidents for social ends. A close analogy to the provision of a pension plan is suggested by the familiar examples of compensation acts. The power of Congress to pass a compensation act to govern interstate carriers and their employees engaged in interstate \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 382]\n\u00a0\n commerce does not seem to be questioned. The carriers might thus be compelled to provide appropriate compensation for injuries or death of employees, although caused without fault on the carriers' part. A thorough examination of the question of constitutional authority to adopt such a compulsory measure was made some years ago by a commission constituted under a Joint Resolution of Congress, of which Senator Sutherland (now Mr. Justice Sutherland) was chairman. \n3\n 36 Stat. 884. Its elaborate and unanimous report, transmitted to Congress by President Taft with his complete approval, considered the constitutional question in all aspects, upheld the congressional power, and proposed its exercise. Sen. Doc. No. 338, 62d Cong.2d Sess. Among the principles announced was that: 'If the proposed legislation effectuates any constitutional power, it is not rendered unconstitutional because to a greater or less extent it may accomplish or tend to accomplish some other result which, as a separate and independent matter, would be wholly beyond the power of Congress to deal with.' Id., p. 26. The legislation was deemed to be a regulation of interstate commerce because, among other specified things, of its effect on the state of mind of the employee. On this point the commission said: 'By insuring to every employee engaged in interstate commerce definite compensation in case of his injury, and to his widow and children, or other dependents, in case of his death, irrespective of fault, the mind of the employee will, to a great extent, be relieved from anxiety for the future and he will be able to render better and more efficient, and consequently safer, service.' Id., p. 28. The commission explicitly pointed out that the legislation which it recommended was not based \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 383]\n\u00a0\n on any wrong or neglect of the carrier, 'but upon the fact of injury resulting from accident in the course of the employment,' that is, that accidents should be regarded 'as risks of the industry.' Id., p. 15. The circumstance that such a compensation measure has not been enacted by Congress is readily attributable to questions of policy rather than to any doubt of constitutional power.\n The effort to dispose of the analogy serves only to make it the more impressive. Compensation acts are said to be a response to the demands which inhere in the development of industry, requiring new measures for the protection of employees. But pension measures are a similar response. If Congress may supply a uniform rule in the one case, why not in the other? If affording certainty of protection is deemed to be an aid to efficiency, why should that consideration be ruled out with respect to retirement allowances and be admitted to support compensation allowances for accidents which happen in the absence of fault? Compensation acts do not simply readjust old burdens and benefits. They add new ones, outside and beyond former burdens and benefits, and thus in truth add a new incident to the relation of employer and employee.\n When we go to the heart of the subject, we find that compensation and pension measures for employees rest upon similar basic considerations. In the case of compensation acts, the carrier has performed its contract with the employee, has paid the agreed wages, has done its best to protect the employee from injury, is guilty of no neglect, but yet is made liable for compensation for injury or for death which ends the possibility of future service, because in the development of modern enterprises, in which accidents are inevitable, it has come to be recognized that the industry itself should bear its attendant risks. New York Central R. Co. v. White, \n243 \nU.S. 188\n, 37 S.Ct. 247, L.R.A. 1917D, 1, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 629; Mountain Timber Company v. Washington, \n243 \nU.S. 219\n, 37 S.Ct. 260, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642. An \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 384]\n\u00a0\n attempted distinction as to pension measures for employees retired by reason of age, because old age is not in itself a consequency of employment, is but superficial. The common judgment takes note of the fact that the retirement of workers by reason of incapacity due to advancing years is an incident of employment and that a fair consideration of their plight justifies retirement allowances as a feature of the service to which they have long been devoted. This is recognized as especially fitting in the case of large industrial enterprises, and of municipal undertakings such as police and fire protection, where there are stable conditions of employment in which workers normally continue so long as they are able to give service and should be retired when efficiency is impaired by age. What sound distinction, from a constitutional standpoint, is there between compelling reasonable compensation for those injured without any fault of the employer, and requiring a fair allowance for those who practically give their lives to the service and are incapacitated by the wear and tear of time, the attrition of the years? I perceive no constitutional ground upon which the one can be upheld and the other condemned.\n The fundamental consideration which supports this type of legislation is that industry should take care of its human wastage, whether that is due to accident or age. That view cannot be dismissed as arbitrary or capricious. It is a reasoned conviction based upon abundant experience. The expression of that conviction in law is regulation. When expressed in the government of interstate carriers, with respect to their employees likewise engaged in interstate commerce, it is a regulation of that commerce. As such, so far as the subject-matter is concerned, the commerce clause should be held applicable.\n Second. With this opinion as to the validity of a pension measure if it is reasonably conceived, we are brought to the question of due process- whether the particular pro- \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 385]\n\u00a0\n visions of the retirement act now before us violate the requirement of due process which, under the Fifth Amendment, limits the exercise of the commerce power.\n The most serious of the objections, sustained by the Court on this score, relates to the establishment of a unitary or pooling system for all railroads. It is said that in this respect the plan disregards the private and separate ownership of the respective carriers, treating them as a single employer, and illustrations are given to show that unequal burdens are thus imposed.\n The objection encounters previous decisions of this Court. We have sustained a unitary or group system under state compensation acts against the argument under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Mountain Timber Company v. Washington, supra. The Washington compensation act established a state fund for the compensation of workmen injured in hazardous employment, and the fund was maintained by compulsory contributions from employers in such industries. While classes of industries were established, each class was made liable for the accidents occurring in that class. The Court described the law as so operating that 'the enforced contributions of the employer are to be made whether injuries have befallen his own employees or not; so that, however prudently one may manage his business, even to the point of immunity to his employees from accidental injury or death, he nevertheless is required to make periodical contributions to a fund for making compensation to the injured employees of his perhaps negligent competitors.' Id., \n243 U.S. 219\n, pages 236, 237, 37 S.Ct. 260, 264, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642. The statute was sustained in the view that its provisions did not rest upon the wrong or neglect of employers, but upon the responsibility which was deemed to attach to those who conducted such industries. The Court concluded 'that the state acted within its power in declaring that no employer should conduct such an industry without making \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 386]\n\u00a0\n stated and fairly apportioned contributions adequate to maintain a public fund for indemnifying injured employees and the dependents of those killed, irrespective of the particular plant in which the accident might happen to occur.' Id., \n243 U.S. 219\n, page 244, 37 S.Ct. 260, 267, Ann. Cas. 1917D, 642. We followed the reasoning which had led to the upholding of state laws imposing assessments on state banks generally in order to create a guaranty fund to make good the losses of deposits in insolvent banks. Noble State Bank v. Haskell, \n219 \nU.S. 104\n, 31 S.Ct. 186, 32 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1062, Ann. Cas. 1912A, 487. See Abie State Bank v. Weaver, \n282 \nU.S. 765\n, 51 S.Ct. 252.\n But, aside from these analogies, this Court has directly sustained the grouping of railroads for the purpose of regulation in enforcing a common policy deemed to be essential to an adequate national system of transportation, even though it resulted in taking earnings of a strong road to help a weak one. This was the effect of the recapture clause of Transportation Act, 1920 (49 USCA  15a), which required carriers to contribute their earnings in excess of a certain amount in order to provide a fund to be used by the Interstate Commerce Commission in making loans to other carriers. Dayton-Goose Creek Railway Co. v. United States, \n263 \nU.S. 456\n, 44 S.Ct. 169, 33 A.L.R. 472. A distinction is sought to be made because the carriers, which were required to contribute, were permitted to retain a reasonable return upon their property. But what the strong roads were compelled to contribute were their own earnings resulting from just and reasonable rates-earnings which they were as clearly entitled to retain for their own benefit as the moneys which in the present instance are to be devoted to retirement allowances. The fact that the recapture provisions failed of their purpose and have been abandoned does not disturb the decision as to constitutional power. The principle that was applied had been made clear in the New England Divisions Case (Akron, C. & Y.R. Co. v. U.S.) \n261 \nU.S. 184\n, 43 S.Ct. 270. Transportation Act, 1920, had introduced into the federal legislation a new railroad policy. To attain its purpose, 'new rights \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 387]\n\u00a0\n new obligations, new machinery, were created.' 'To preserve for the nation substantially the whole transportation system was deemed important.' 'The existence of the varying needs of the several lines and of their widely varying earning power was fully realized.' To attain the object 'two new devices were adopted: The group system of rate making and the division of joint rates in the public interest. Through the former, weak roads were to be helped by recapture from prosperous competitors of surplus revenues. Through the latter, the weak were to be helped by preventing needed revenue from passing to prosperous connections. Thus, by marshaling the revenues, partly through capital account, it was planned to distribute augmented earnings, largely in proportion to the carrier's needs.' Id., 261 U.S. pages 189-191, 43 S.Ct. 270, 273.\n This object of adequately maintaining the whole transportation system may be served in more than these two ways. The underlying principle is that Congress has the power to treat the transportation system of the country as a unit for the purpose of regulation in the public interest, so long as particular railroad properties are not subjected to confiscation. In the light of that principle, and of applications which have been held valid, I am unable to see that the establishment of a unitary system of retirement allowances for employees is beyond constitutional authority. Congress was entitled to weigh the advantages of such a system, as against inequalities which it would inevitably produce, and reach a conclusion as to the policy best suited to the needs of the country. See Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Riverside Mills, \n219 \nU.S. 186, 203\n, 31 S.Ct. 164, 31 L.R.A.(N.S.) 7; Railroad Commission v. Southern Pacific Company, \n264 U.S. 331\n ,343, 344, 44 S.Ct. 376.\n Third. Questions are raised as to the classes of persons to be benefited. In considering these objections we should have regard to the explicit provision of the act as to severability. It states that if 'any provision,' 'or the \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 388]\n\u00a0\n application thereof to any person or circumstances,' is held invalid, 'the remainder of the Act or application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected.' This, of course, does not permit us to rewrite the statute but it does allow the excision of invalid provisions, or inclusions, which can be severed without destroying its structure.\n\n\n (1)\n The court below held the act to be invalid in the view that its provisions were extended to persons not engaged in interstate commerce. In the special findings, classes of persons were listed, numbering 211,107, which were thought to fall within that description. It is manifest that the list was prepared under a misapprehension of the extent of the authority of Congress with respect to employees of interstate carriers and of the application of the decision in the first Employers' Liability Cases ( Howard v. Illinois Cent. R. Co.), \n207 \nU.S. 463\n, 28 S.Ct. 141. Large numbers of employees were thus deemed to be improperly included whose work, while not immediately connected with the movement of traffic, did have such relation to the activities of the carriers in interstate commerce as to bring them within the range of congressional power. Thus the list embraced general officers and their staffs who were not in the operating departments connected with transportation, employees who dealt with the receipt and disbursement of moneys, some 86,493 employees in the maintenance-of-equipment departments, who were engaged in the reconstruction or major repair of equipment, withdrawn for that purpose from service, such as locomotives, cars, platform trucks, frogs, switches, etc., as distinguished from light or running repairs, and 36,996 employees whose duties lay in auditing, accounting, and bookkeeping. It should be observed that the decisions under the Second Employers' Liability Act of 1908 (45 USCA  51 et seq.), with respect to the necessity of the employee being engaged at the time of his injury in interstate transportation or in work so closely related to transportation as to \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 389]\n\u00a0\n be a part of it, are based upon the limitations of that statute and do not define the scope of constitutional authority as to employees of interstate carriers. Illinois Central Railroad Company v. Behrens, \n233 \nU.S. 473, 477\n, 34 S.Ct. 646, Ann. Cas. 1914C, 163; Chicago & Northwestern Railway Co. v. Bolle, \n284 \nU.S. 74, 78\n, 52 S.Ct. 59.\n Interstate carriers cannot conduct their interstate operations without general officers and their staffs, without departments for major repairs and those for administering finances and keeping accounts. General management is as important to the interstate commerce of the carriers as is the immediate supervision of traffic, and the proper maintenance of equipment and the handling of moneys and the keeping of books are as necessary as the loading and moving of cars. In the administration of the act there would be ample opportunity to make all necessary distinctions between employees engaged in interstate commerce and any others who might be found to be otherwise exclusively employed, so as to exclude the latter from its benefits without impairing the general operation of the act.\n\n\n (2)\n A more serious objection relates to the eligibility for allowances of all those who were in the service within one year prior to the enactment, although they may never be reemployed. Such persons may have been discharged for cause; in any event, for one reason or another, they had left the service and may not return.\n I agree with the conclusion that the requirement that the carriers shall pay retiring allowances to such persons is arbitrary and beyond the power of Congress. But I think it clear that the provision for their benefit is within the clause as to severability. That application of the act may be condemned and such persons may be excluded from benefits without destroying the measure as a whole.\n Fourth. Other questions relate to the details of the pension plan- principally with respect to the basis of the retirement allowances and the method of their computation. \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 390]\n\u00a0\n With the excision of those whose employment was terminated before the act was passed, the plan would cover those in carrier service at that time and those subsequently employed. Retirement is compulsory at the age of 65, but the service may be extended by agreement for successive periods of one year each until the age of 70. An employee may retire upon completing 30 years of service, but in such case provision is made for reducing the annuity by one-fifteenth for each year below the age of 65. Annuities are calculated by applying graduated percentages of the employee's average monthly compensation (excluding all over $300) to the number of years of his service, not exceeding 30. The maximum annuity thus payable would be $ 1,440, and to receive that amount, it would be necessary for the employee to have been in service 30 years and to have attained the age of 65, and to have been paid an average monthly compensation of $300. Contributions to the pension fund are to be made by employees of a certain percentage of their compensation and the contribution of each carrier is to be twice that of its employees.\n An examination of pension plans in operation reveals a variety of possible methods, and Congress was entitled to make its choice. As a basis for the allowance, Congress could select either age or length of service or both, In the selection of any age, or any period of service, anomalies would inevitably occur in particular applications. Extreme illustrations can always be given of the application of regulations which require the drawing of a line with respect to age, time, distances, weights, sizes, etc. To deny the right to select such criteria, or to make scientific precision a criterion of constitutional authority, would be to make impossible the practical exercise of power. Compare Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 388\n, 389 S., 52 S.Ct. 581; Stanley v. Public Utilities Commission of Maine, \n295 \nU.S. 76\n, 55 S.Ct. 628, 79 L.Ed. --, decided April 15, 1935. Whatever may be said of the capacity of many men after they have attained 65 years, the fixing \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 391]\n\u00a0\n of that age or a period of 30 years' service, or a combination of both, for general application, cannot be regarded as an arbitrary choice for railroad employees.\n The principal criticism is the bringing into the reckoning of past periods of service-antedating the passage of the act. The objection is strongly put with respect to those who were in the employment of the carriers when the act was passed, and it is even more earnestly urged as to those who had left the service and later are reemployed. It is said that the reckoning of their prior periods of employment compels payment for services fully completed and paid for before the enactment. But it seems to be assumed that Congress could compel the dismissal of aged employees, and if it has that power and also has power to establish a pension system, I can find no ground for erecting a constitutional limitation which would make it impossible to provide for employees who were thus severed from the service. The question simply is: What is a fair basis for computing a retirement allowance? Is the plan adopted by Congress destitute of rational support?\n Congress could have provided for a retirement allowance in a flat sum, or could have based it upon the amount of compensation which the employee was receiving at the time of retirement, or upon the amount he had received for the preceding year or his average compensation of a longer time. Selecting a period not to exceed 30 years, or the period of service prior to age 65, merely gives a measure for the computation of the retirement allowance. It is in no proper sense a payment for the prior service, any more than would be the fixing of the allowance at a flat figure or on the basis of the last compensation received. The result in dollars and cents might not vary to any great extent whatever method of calculation was chosen.\n The power committed to Congress to govern interstate commerce does not require that its government should be wise, much less that it should be perfect. The power \n\n[295 U.S. 330, 392]\n\u00a0\n implies a broad discretion and thus permits a wide range even of mistakes. Expert discussion of pension plans reveals different views of the manner in which they should be set up and a close study of advisable methods is in progress. It is not our province to enter that field, and I am not persuaded that Congress in entering it for the purpose of regulating interstate carriers, has transcended the limits of the authority which the Constitution confers.\n I think the decree should be reversed.\n I am authorized to state that Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act June 27, 1934, c. 868, 48 Stat. 1283 (45 USCA  201-214). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] U.S.C. tit. 28,  347(a), 28 USCA  347(a). \n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n293 \nU.S. 552\n, 55 S.Ct. 240, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] See Gibbons v.

Westmoreland Coal Co., 73 F.(2d) 1004, affirming (D.C.) 8 F.Supp. 963, on opinion below.\n The question presented is whether the issue by petitioner of its shares of stock to the stockholders of two other corporations in exchange for the assets of those corporations, pursuant to a plan for their consolidation, involved a 'transfer' taxed by section 800, Schedule (A)(3), title 8 of the Revenue Act of 1926, 44 Stat. 9, 99, 101 (see 26 USCA  900, 902(b), 921(b)(1). The Court of Claims held that it did, and denied recovery of the tax, which petitioner had paid under protest. 10 F.Supp. 130.\n Section 800, Schedule (A)(2) of the 1926 Act (see 26 USCA  900, 902( a), imposes a stamp tax at a specified rate on the original issue of shares of corporate stock. By section 800, Schedule (A)(3), a like tax is laid 'on all sales, or agreements to sell, or memoranda of sales or deliveries of, or transfers of legal title to shares or certificates of stock or ... of interest in property ... in any corporation, or to rights to subscribe for or to receive such shares or certificates, whether made upon or shown by the books of the corporation ... or by any paper or agreement or memorandum or other evidence of transfer of sale.' Section 800 imposes liability for the tax upon the transferor, the transferee and the corporation whose stock is transferred.\n Petitioner was organized under the laws of New Jersey as a step in carrying out a plan and agreement for the consolidation of three other corporations. Two of the corporations conveyed their property to petitioner in return for a specified number of its shares of capital stock, issued not to the two corporations, but directly to their stockholders in proportion to their holdings. The government and the taxpayer are not in accord as to the precise interpretation to be placed upon the contracts which resulted in the consolidation, but accepting the \n\n[296 U.S. 60, 62]\n\u00a0\n taxpayer's contention for purposes of decision, we assume that it was agreed by all concerned that the shares of petitioner were to be issued directly to the stockholders of the two corporations without further intervention by the latter.\n Liability for the tax levied on the original issue of stock is conceded but it is denied that the transaction involved any taxable transfer within the purview of Schedule (A)(3). It is said that the petitioner was subject to the tax imposed by this schedule only if there was a transfer of the right to receive the stock to be issued by petitioner for the assets of the two corporations; that as neither of them was entitled, under the agreement, to receive the certificates for the newly issued shares, which were to be issued directly to their stockholders, neither corporation can be said to have transferred rights to receive stock. We think the statute is not to be read so narrowly.\n The stock transfer tax is a revenue measure exclusively. Its language discloses the general purpose to tax every transaction whereby the right to be or become a shareholder of a corporation or to receive any certificate of any interest in its property is surrendered by one and vested in another. See Provost v. United States, \n269 \nU.S. 443, 458\n, 459 S., 46 S.Ct. 152. While the statute speaks of transfers, it does not require that the transfer shall be directly from the hand of the transferor to that of the transferee. It is enough if the right or interest transferred is, by any form of procedure, relinquished by one and vested in another. Even the ownership of a share of stock, transfer of which is admittedly taxed, is not transferred directly from one to another as is title to a chattel or to real estate. Transfer of title to the shares is effected by a form of novation by which the right of the shareholder is surrendered to the corporation in return for its recognition of a new shareholder designated by the transferor \n\n[296 U.S. 60, 63]\n\u00a0\n and the issue to him of a new certificate of stock. It is relinquishment of the ownership for the benefit of another, and the resultant acquisition of it by him which calls the statute into operation.\n The subject of the tax is not alone the transfer of ownership in shares of stock. It embraces transfers of rights to subscribe for or receive shares or certificates whether made upon the books of the corporation 'or by any paper, agreement, or memorandum or other evidence of transfer. ...' In the present case the generating source of the right to receive the newly issued shares of petitioner was the conveyance to it of the property of each of the corporations to be consolidated. The new shares could not lawfully be issued to any other than the grantor corporation without its authority, and that authority could not be exercised for the benefit of third persons other than its own assenting stockholders. The consolidation agreement thus imposed the duty on petitioner to issue the new shares upon receipt of the property, and at the same time made disposition to the stockholders of the two corporations of the correlative right to receive the stock.\n We think that this effective disposition of the right to receive the stock involved a taxable transfer quite as much as if the several legal relationships of the parties had been established at different times and by separate documents. It is not doubted that there would have been a taxable transfer if each corporation had conveyed its property to petitioner in exchange for its shares of stock to be issued as the grantor might direct, and had later ordered the certificates to be issued to its stockholders. The reach of a taxing act whose purpose is as obvious as the present is not to be restricted by technical refinements. But we do not discern even a technical difference of any significance between such a transaction and that now before us, where the same duty to issue the stock is created \n\n[296 U.S. 60, 64]\n\u00a0\n and the same shift of the beneficiaries of it is effected simultaneously in a single document. No convincing reason is suggested why the act should be thought to tax the one and not the other.\n The statute is thus not restricted in its application to rights to demand delivery of the stock such as the agreement vested in the stockholders of the two corporations. It embraces the more general one, inseparable from the transaction by which the obligation to issue the stock was created and which inhered in the two corporations by operation of law. Income is not any the less taxable income of the taxpayer because by his command it is paid directly to another in performance of the taxpayer's obligation to that other. See Douglas v. Willcuts, \n296 \nU.S. 1\n, 56 S.Ct. 59, decided this day; Old Colony Trust Co. v. Commissioner, \n279 \nU.S. 716\n, 49 S.Ct. 499; United States v. Boston & Maine R.R., \n279 \nU.S. 732\n, 49 S.Ct. 505. Here the power to command the disposition of the shares included the right to receive them and the exercise of the power which transferred the right is subject to the tax.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","140":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nREALTY ACCEPTANCE CORPORATION v.

Levin, of New York City, for respondent Eugene F. O'Connor, Jr.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The controversy is one as to the compensation of a referee in bankruptcy upon a composition with the creditors.\n Realty Associates Securities Corporation was adjudged a bankrupt, July 10, 1933, upon the filing of a voluntary petition. At the same time the proceeding was sent to a referee in bankruptcy. The chief claims ($12, 631,949.67) were on bonds issued under indentures between the bankrupt and a trust company as trustee. The other claims were only $208,133.90, of which amount one for $207,583.95 is contested and undetermined. On February 16, 1934, the bankrupt made an offer to the creditors of terms of composition pursuant to the statute (Bankruptcy Act, 30 Stat. 549, c. 541 ,  12, as amended, 11 U.S.C.  30 (11 USCA  30)), which offer was accepted by the requisite majority. The District Judge found the composition to be for the best interests of the creditors (Bankruptcy Act ,  12d, 11 USCA  30(d) and confirmed it. By its terms, all creditors were to receive cash for 15 per cent. of the amount of their claims as filed and allowed. Holders of bonds (after crediting the cash) were to extend and otherwise modify the obligation for the remaining 82 per cent. Creditors not bond-holders, an almost negligible number, were to receive \n\n[295 U.S. 295, 297]\n\u00a0\n bonds in the treasury of the company reduced and modified in the same way. The time for the payment of the principal was postponed until October 1, 1943; the rate of interest was lowered from 6 per cent. to 5; the interest accruing semiannually before October, 1943, was to be payable only out of earnings, but the liability was to be cumulative, and upon maturity of the principal was to be discharged in full; the creditors were to be represented on the board of directors; and there were to be restrictions on investments and on the creation of new debts. The composition did not call for the cancellation or surrender of bonds then outstanding. There was, however, to be attached to each of them a rider, described as a 'notation of reduction and modification,' which was to be evidence of the foregoing changes. Cash in the requisite amount was deposited with the clerk of the court, and other instruments, so far as necessary, were signed and filed.\n In the meantime a question had arisen as to the compensation payable to the referee. 'Referees shall receive as full compensation for their services ... one-half of 1 per centum on the amount to be paid to creditors upon the confirmation of a composition.' Bankruptcy Act,  40a, as amended, 11 U.S.C.  68 (11 USCA  68(a).1 The creditors took the position that the percentage was to be computed upon the cash, and nothing else. The cash payments being \n\n[295 U.S. 295, 298]\n\u00a0\n $2,091,129.04, the compensation on that basis would be $10,455.65. The referee maintained that he was entitled to a percentage not only on the cash, but also on the face amount of the principal payable upon the bonds nearly ten years thereafter. Figuring the total cash and bonds at $13,008, 038.31, he arrived at a fee of $65,040.19. The District Judge followed an intermediate course. 6 F.Supp. 549. Testimony was received that the bonds were then selling in the market, after public notice of the composition, at 37 per cent. of par, and that their market value would be 22 per cent. when the principal had been reduced by a credit of 15 per cent. in cash. The District Judge estimated the bonds as equivalent to cash to the extent of 22 per cent. of the par value of the principal. The total fees thus figured were $24,064.87. An order was made accordingly.\n The creditors took no appeal, acquiescing in the award, though some believed it to be too large. The referee, however, did appeal. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit sustained the position of the referee, one judge dissenting. 74 F.(2d) 61. The decision was that in figuring the commissions the bonds were to be reckoned as a payment of the full amount of the principal payable thereunder. On the petition of the bankrupt and a creditor a writ of certiorari issued from this court. \n294 \nU.S. 701\n, 55 S.Ct. 508, 79 L.Ed. --.\n We think it an unreasonable view of the meaning of the statute ( Bankruptcy Act,  40, as amended, 11 U.S.C.  68 (11 USCA  68)) that would treat the bonds of the bankrupt in the situation here developed as equivalent to cash.\n In determining the effect of any particular composition, a 'payment' or an 'amount paid' must have a sensible construction, which may vary in one case and another according to the facts. Here, at the date of the bankruptcy, creditors were the owners of the bonds of the bankrupt, its promises, nonnegotiable in form, for the payment of money, to the extent of nearly $13,000,000. At the date of the composition and afterwards, they held the same bonds, scaled down in amount as to principal \n\n[295 U.S. 295, 299]\n\u00a0\n and interest, and with some of the terms varied, but still the same bonds with the promises to pay not fulfilled, nor even accelerated, but on the contrary deferred. Common sense revolts at the suggestion that creditors have been paid for this purpose or for any other when all that has happened is that they have been left in possession of the old promises of the debtor, reduced in amount and extended as to time.\n Referees in bankruptcy are public officers (11 U.S.C.  61, 64 (11 USCA  61, 64)), and officers of a court. Like public officers generally, they must show clear warrant of law before compensation will be owing to them for the performance of their public duties. United States v. Garlinger, \n169 \nU.S. 316, 321\n, 18 S.Ct. 364; People ex rel. Rand v. Craig, 231 N.Y. 216, 221, 131 N.E. 894. Extravagant costs of administration in the winding up of estates in bankruptcy have been denounced as crying evils. Strengthening Procedure in the Bankruptcy System, Sen. Doc. No. 65, 72d Congress, 1st Sess. (1932), p. 53; also H.R. Rep. 65, 55th Congress, 2d Sess. (1898), p. 44. In response to those complaints, Congress has attempted in the enactment of the present statute to fix a limit for expenses growing out of the services of referees and receivers. Bankruptcy Act  40, 48(d, e), as amended, 11 U.S.C.  68, 76, 11 USCA  68, 76(d, e). The pay for referees is no longer involved in uncertainty as to the applicable percentage. By mischance there is still uncertainty at times as to the principal amount to which the rate of to be applied. In cases of composition the principal is 'the amount to be paid to creditors upon the confirmation,' and before we can compute what is due we must know what payment is. The ascertainment of that fact, like the ascertainment of facts generally in the discharge of the judicial function, is a process that must be flexible and broad enough to keep all the circumstances in view. In weighing their significance a court will not forget that Congress meant to hit the evil of extravagance, and that the meaning of its words, if doubtful, must be adapted \n\n[295 U.S. 295, 300]\n\u00a0\n to its aim. If this is kept in mind, certain inferences will follow. One of them will be that a promise is not payment unless it would naturally be so regarded in the common speech of men, and that the extent of the payment, whether partial or complete, must be subject to a kindred test.\n Viewing this case from that angle of vision, we hold that the referee had fulll compensation in the award of commissions that was made by the District Judge. Whether he was entitled to as much, we do not now determine, the creditors and the bankrupt, who were at liberty to oppose, having preferred to acquiesce. For present purposes, it is enough that he was not entitled to more. The bonds had a value in the market that would have made it possible for a creditor to convert them into money at 22 per cent. of par. If present values were to be estimated, this was the present value of the promise of the debtor as of the date of composition. To find anything in addition would be to capitalize a hope.\n The facts of the case before us define the scope of our decision. We are not required to adjudge the effect to be given to the acceptance of bonds or notes when made in different circumstances or with other possibilities of benefit. For like reasons, there can be no profit in stating or analyzing the holdings in other federal courts. In re H. Batterman Co. (C.C.A.) 231 F. 699; In re Mills Tea & Butter Co. (D.C.) 235 F. 815; American Surety Co. v. Freed (C.C.A.) 224 F. 333; In re J. B. White & Co. (D.C.) 225 F. 796; Kinkead v. J. Bacon & Sons (C.C.A.) 230 F. 362; In re Columbia Cotton Oil & Provision Corporation (C.C.A.) 210 F. 824. They grew out of situations very different from this one, and are not consistent with one another. No principle of general application can be extracted from them.\n The respondent referee invokes the analogy of General Order 48(4), adopted April 24, 1933 (\n288 U.S. 636\n, 637 (11 USCA following section 53)), which fixes the commissions of referees in proceed- \n\n[295 U.S. 295, 301]\n\u00a0\n ings under section 74 of the Bankruptcy Act. Section 74 (11 U.S.C.  202 ( see 11 USCA 202)) and the rules applicable thereto have relation to proceedings for the relief of a debtor not a bankrupt who seeks a composition or an extension of his debts. The present proceeding under section 12 of the act, as amended (11 U.S.C.  30 (11 USCA  30)) is for a composition by a bankrupt. The general order was passed in the exercise of the rule making power, and was directed to proceedings of a particular class. The jurisdiction that we now exercise is part of the judicial function, and is directed to proceedings of a different class. The one does not control the other. Meek v. Centre County Banking Co., \n268 \nU.S. 426, 434\n, 45 S.Ct. 560; George M. West Co. v.

The fee owner of the spur, a receiver, a lessee, and trustees under mortgages are dissatisfied with the award of damages. The question is whether property interests have been taken without \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 275]\n\u00a0\n compensation in violation of the restraints of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n The length of the demolished structure was about 900 feet. At the east it was connected with the elevated station at Forty-Second street and Third avenue. At the west it had a terminal on Park avenue opposite the Grand Central Station. For a number of years traffic upon the spur had been dwindling, especially so since the completion of the subways, receipts being less than the cost of operation. Traffic became so light that the spur ceased to contribute value to the business of the railroad, either as an independent unit or as a feeder to the system. With these developments a movement to take the structure from the highway acquired rapid headway. Travelers on Forty-Second street, afoot or in vehicles, were impatient of obstructions that had ceased to be useful. Lot owners, contiguous to the railway and nearby, looked forward with eagerness to the removal of an unsightly edifice in the expectation of enhancing the value of their lots. The city too had an interest in the growth of taxable values as well as in the promotion of the safety of the streets. In 1919, the Legislature of New York came to the relief of city, lot owners, and travelers through the adoption of a statute. By chapter 611 of the Laws of 1919, the Public Service Commission was empowered to determine whether the spur and its appurtenances were 'necessary and convenient for the public service, or whether, even if necessary and convenient, such tracks, structure, station and appurtenances' constituted 'an impediment or obstruction to the public use of the street.' Upon the certificate of the commission as to the existence of either of these conditions, the city might condemn 'the rights, easements and franchises of the said Manhattan Railway Company' through appropriate proceedings. See, also, Laws 1923, c. 635. \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 276]\n\u00a0\n At the end of a full hearing the Public Service Commission found and certified that the spur was no longer a public convenience and necessity, and also that it was an impediment and obstruction to the public use of the street. No appeal to the courts was taken by the company. Thereupon, the city of New York by its Board of Estimate and Apportionment resolved that condemnation proceedings should be begun. The resolution, adopted November 23, 1923, called for the condemnation of the structure of the spur and of all easements and franchises appurtenant thereto, title to vest in the city on December 7 of that year. The resolution was followed by a suit under the applicable statute for the determination of the damages to be paid to the owners of the property condemned. The trial court made an award in the sum of $975,438, with interest, stating the component items in an opinion. Matter of City of New York, 126 Misc. 879, 216 N.Y.S. 2. Cross-appeals followed to the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, the city and abutting lot owners insisting that the award was too high, and the spur owner and its allies insisting that the damages were too low and that property had been taken without due process of law. United States Constitution, Fourteenth Amendment. Three items were in controversy: (1) The value of the franchise; (2) the value of the structure; and (3) the value of certain rights or privileges characterized as private easements. As to item (1), the ruling of the Appellate Division was that the franchise was without value, and had become a source of loss instead of gain; as to item (2), the ruling was that the structure was without value beyond what it would be worth as scrap when taken down; and as to item (3), the ruling was that the private easements must be paid for at not less than their value as judicially determined at the time of their acquisition, but that the evidence did not justify a finding that their value was any greater.

The cause was remitted to the trial court, which heard additional evidence and made a new decree. As a result of that decree the value of the private easements was fixed at $539,117.41; the scrap value of the structure was fixed at $ 235; the value of the franchise nothing. Matter of East Forty-Second St. in City of New York, 143 Misc. 129, 257 N.Y.S. 37. There were cross- appeals to the Appellate Division, which affirmed without opinion (Matter of East Forty-Second Street Elevated R.R. Structures, 238 App.Div. 832, 262 N.Y.S. 973), and then to the Court of Appeals, where there was an affirmance by a divided court. In re East 42nd St. Elevated R.R. Structures in City of New York, 265 N.Y. 170, 192 N.E. 188. This court granted a writ of certiorari at the instance of the receiver of the railway company and those allied with him in interest. Roberts v. New York City, \n293 \nU.S. 554\n, 55 S.Ct. 347, 79 L.Ed. --.\n A statute of New York in force at the taking of the spur directs the court to 'ascertain and estimate the compensation which ought justly to be made by the city of New York to the respective owners of the real property to be acquired.' Greater New York Charter,  1001, as amended by Laws 1915, c. 606. Cf. Laws 1923, c. 635. Such a system of condemnation is at least fair upon its face. 'If there has been any wrong done it is due not to the statute, but to the courts having made a mistake as to evidence or at most as to the measure of damages.' McGovern v. City of New York, \n229 \nU.S. 363, 370\n, 33 S.Ct. 876, 46 L.R.A.(N.S.) 391. Not every such mistake amounts to a denial of constitutional immunities, though the outcome is to give the owner less than he ought to have. In condemnation proceedings as in lawsuits generally the Fourteenth Amendment is not a guaranty that a trial shall be devoid of error. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n294 \nU.S. 63, 70\n, 55 S.Ct. 316. To bring about a taking without due process of law by force of such a judgment, the error must be gross and obvious, coming close to the boundary of arbitrary action. The test has been differently phased by different judges and in different contexts. At times we find the statement that the \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 278]\n\u00a0\n Constitution is not infringed unless there has been 'absolute disregard' of the right of the owner to be paid for what is taken.

Enough for present purposes that when the hearing has been full and candid, there must ordinarily be a showing of something more far-reaching than one of dubious mistake in the appraisal of the evidence. Due process is a growth too sturdy to succumb to the infection of the least ingredient of error. 'It takes more than a possible misconstruction by a court to make a case under the 14th Amendment.' Seattle, Renton & So. R. Co. v. State of Washington ex rel. Linhoff, \n231 \nU.S. 568, 570\n, 34 S.Ct. 185.\n In the setting of this background we approach the consideration of the rulings that are here assigned as error.\n\n 1. \nFirst in importance is the appraisal of the private easements.\n The franchise to maintain an elevated railway 'with an interest in the street in perpetuity' (People v. O'Brien, 111 N.Y. 1, 38, 18 N.E. 692, 697, 2 L.R.A. 255, 7 Am.St.Rep. 684) dates from September 7, 1875. After the building of the road controversies developed between the company and abutting \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 279]\n\u00a0\n owners. Out of them grew what came to be known as the elevated railroad lawsuits, 'one of the most important and interesting chapters in the history of litigation' in New York. Powers v. Manhattan Railway Co., 120 N. Y. 178, 183, 24 N.E. 295. The foundation stone was laid by the Court of Appeals in Story v. New York Elevated Railroad Co., 90 N.Y. 122, 43 Am.Rep. 146, decided in 1882. The doctrine was there announced that appurtenant to lots abutting on a highway are certain private easements-easements of light and air and access-which may not be destroyed or impaired through the construction under legislative sanction of an elevated railroad without payment to the lot owners of the damage to their land and buildings. Many later cases enforced the same doctrine and indeed enlarged its scope, applying it to lots where the fee of the highway was vested in the city. Lahr v. Metropolitan Elevated R. Co., 104 N.Y. 268, 10 N.E. 528; Kane v. New York Elevated R. Co., 125 N.Y. 164, 26 N.E. 278, 11 L.R.A. 640. Cf. Muhlker v. N.Y. & H.R. Co., \n197 \nU.S. 544\n, 25 S.Ct. 522; Sauer v. State of New York, \n206 \nU.S. 536\n, 27 S.Ct. 686. In submission to these holdings the Manhattan Railway Company extinguished the damage claims of lot owners along many miles of track. It did this by purchase or condemnation or proceedings equivalent thereto, the amout to be paid being determined sometimes by a court, sometimes by agreement. Generally the extinguishment took the form of grants of the easements to the extent that they were affected by the then existing structure, the abutting owners being the grantors and the Manhattan the grantee. Irrespective of the form, the substance of the transaction was that 'the railroad merely exhausted the right of the abutting owners to complain because the railroad was in the street and so trespassing on their property.' Per Pound, C.J., in the present case, In re East 42nd St. Elevated R. R. Structures, 265 N.Y. 170, as page 180, 192 N.E. 188, 190. What was conveyed was the right to persist in a course of conduct that otherwise would have been a wrong. \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 280]\n\u00a0\n Even then the process of condemnation or its equivalent did not so obliterate the easements as to leave abutters helpless in the face of new encroachments. If the user was substantially aggravated, as, for example, by an added tier of tracks, there was another right to be extinguished. Knoth v. Manhattan R. Co., 187 N.Y. 243, 79 N.E. 1015; American Bank-Note Co. v. New York Elevated R. Co., 129 N.Y. 252, 266, 29 N.E. 302. The company was under a continuing duty to rid its presence in the highway of the character of a trespass as against the title of abutters.\n Whether these rights or interests, though easements in the ownership of the abutters, retained the same quality after release or conveyance to the railway, we do not now determine. They are spoken of in many cases as if their quality in the new ownership continued what it was before. See, e. g., People ex rel. Manhattan R. Co. v. Barker, 165 N.Y. 305, 59 N.E. 137, 151; People ex rel. Manhattan R. Co. v. Woodbury, 203 N.Y. 231, 96 N.E. 420. This may have been merely for convenience with the thought that the description was at least sufficiently accurate to serve the case at hand. Elsewhere the same interests are spoken of as 'quasi-easements' (American Bank-Note Co. v. New York Elevated R. Co., supra, 129 N.Y. 252, at page 272, 29 N.E. 302) or by some other and equivalent term. Matter of City of New York (Manhattan R. Co.), 126 Misc. 879, 901, 216 N.Y.S. 2; 229 App.Div. 617, 625, 243 N.Y.S. 665; Stevens v. New York Elevated R. Co., 130 N.Y. 95, 101, 28 N.E. 667. After acquisition by the railway, they are not susceptible of separation from the ownership of the franchise. Kernochan v. New York Elevated R. Co., 128 N.Y. 559, 29 N.E. 65; Drucker v. Manhattan R. Co., 213 N.Y. 543, 108 N.E. 74; Heard v. City of Brooklyn, 60 N.Y. 242.* They are not easements in gross assignable to strangers generally. In re East 42nd St. Elevated R. R. Structures, \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 281]\n\u00a0\n 265 N.Y. 170, at page 181, 192 N.E. 188. They may be factors to be considered in determining the value of the franchise while the road is in operation, for they are effective as a release from liability for past or future damages. This is very far from saying that they contribute elements of value when operation has been proved to be impossible except at a continuing loss. Still less does it connote a value equivalent to the estimated present cost of condemning them anew.\n We have said that there will be no attempt in this court to classify the rights acquired by the company as easements or as something else. For present purposes we accept the ruling of the state court that, irrespective of their precise nature, they had a value to be paid for upon the termination of the franchise and the removal of the structure by force of eminent domain. If all this be assumed, the petitioners fall short by a long interval of making out a definance of constitutional restraints. Their argument, it seems, is this: Property that is to be condemned must be paid for in accordance with the value at the time of the taking; these easements, when acquired about half a century ago, had a value then judicially deter mined of about half a million dollars; owing to changes in the neighborhood the same easements, if acquired in 1923, would have cost $3,600,000; an award has been made for the first amount only; the difference between the first amount and the second is an increment of value condemned without requital.\n The argument misconceives the action of the courts below. The courts have not held that an increment of value in the easements or in anything else may be condemned without requital. What they have held is merely this, that there is no basis in the evidence for assigning any determinate value to the ownership of the easements in excess of the value belonging to them when they were acquired by the company. Even if there was error here \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 282]\n\u00a0\n in the interpretation of the record, it was not so gross or obvious as to justify a holding that the restraints of the Constitution were forgotten or ignored. But in truth there was no error, or none to the prejudice of the owners of the property condemned. Much could be said in support of the position that the value of the so-called easements was nothing more than nominal. If so, the petitioners have been overpaid by more than half a million dollars. We do not go into that question now, for the city and the abutters are not petitioners in this court, and must acquiesce in the award as made. Problems open in the state court and there considered in the opinions (see especially the dissenting opinion in Re East 42nd St. Elevated R. R. Structures, 265 N.Y. 170, at page 183, 192 N.E. 188, 191) are beyond our jurisdiction here. Enough for present purposes that the award is not too low, though perhaps it is too high. Excess is not an error of which the owner may complain.\n Too low it certainly is not. 'The question is, What has the owner lost? Not, What has the taker gained?' Boston Chamber of Commerce v. City of Boston, \n217 \nU.S. 189, 195\n, 30 S.Ct. 459, 460; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co., \n229 \nU.S. 53\n, 33 S.Ct. 667. If we assume these easements to be property, what were they worth to the railway in 1923? The petitioners do not urge that it was practicable to find a buyer who would pay for the easements in connection with the franchise and with a view to continuing the operation of the road. The spur had proved to be a failure, a mere impediment to public travel. Substantial prices are not paid for the privilege of conducting a business at a loss. The petitioners do urge, however, that aubtters would have been willing to pay for an abandonment of the road, and that such abandonment would have been equivalent to the surrender of the easements or to a deed of reconveyance. Voluntary abandonment was permissible (New York Railroad Law (Consol. Laws, c. 49)  237; also Laws 1917, c. 788) until the franchise with its appurtenances was taken over by the city. \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 283]\n\u00a0\n From this the conclusion is drawn that the easements are worth what the abutters would have paid for them. Implicit in such an argument are assumptions that would be worthy of scrutiny if the need for scrutiny were here. The inquiry would then be whether easements or quasi easements inseparable from a franchise must be paid for as property at the peril of infringing the Fourteenth Amendment when their value for sale presupposes the abandonment of the franchise to which they are appurtenant. To carry the amendment to that point approaches, though it may not touch, the acceptance of the nuisance value which Hough, J., on one occasion excluded from the reckoning with words of trenchant emphasis. Consolidated Gas Co. v. City of New York (C.C.) 157 F. 849, 874, For the time being and provisionally we put aside these doubts, resolving in favor of the company whatever problems they suggest. Granting that the value of the easements is whatever abutters would have paid for a surrender of the franchise, how much would this have been?\n A sale to abutters was impracticable unless all or nearly all united. One owner could gain nothing from a reconveyance of the easements appurtenant to his lot without a like reconveyance to others along the line of the invading structure. The spur would have to come down altogether or not at all. The notion is almost fantastic that there would have been union among the owners upon a price of $3,600,000 or any comparable figure. Even if the value of their lots were to be enhanced to that extent, they would be no better off at the outcome of the bargain than they already were without it, and would be risking a huge outlay. They would be doing this, though they denied that the easements were the kind of property for which they could be forced to pay a dollar if the case were brought into a court. In such circumstances union among the abutters was a shadowy and distant chance. City of New \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 284]\n\u00a0\n York v. Sage, \n239 \nU.S. 57, 61\n, 36 S.Ct. 25; Olson v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 246, 256\n, 54 S.Ct. 704. 'What the owner is entitled to is the value of the property taken, and that means what it fairly may be believed that a purchaser in fair market conditions would have given for it in fact,-not what a tribunal at a later date may think a purchaser would have been wise to give, nor a proportion of the advance due to its union with other lots.' City of New York v. Sage, supra, 239 U. S. at page 61, 36 S.Ct. 25, 26. Discordant voices among the group would surely have been raised in protest if an attempt had been made by amicable treaty to get rid of the spur at the value put upon it by the railway. Perhaps the abutters would have paid something. But how much would it have been? The courts below have found in the evidence no basis for the belief that the price would have exceeded the value of the easements as judicially ascertained at the time of acquisition. Matter of City of New York, 229 App.Div. 617, at page 629, 243 N.Y.S. 665; In re East 42nd St. Elevated R.R. Structures, 265 N.Y. 170, at page 181, 192 N.E. 188. We cannot say that this was error. Still less can we say that some other and higher figure was established with such persuasive power that the Constitution of the United States has been flouted in the refusal to accept it.\n\n 2. \nObjections are made by the petitioners to the valuations of the structure, the franchise, and the public easements in the highway.\n The structure was appraised as junk, the city having undertaken to bear the cost of removal. Such an appraisal might be too low were it not for the award for the private easements. To realize the value of those easements, an abandonment of the spur was necessary. 'The railroads could not release their rights to the abutting owners and continue to operate their railroads in the street.' In re East 42nd St. Elevated R.R. Structures, 265 N.Y. 170, at page 181, 192 N.E. 188, 191. The structure in the circumstances had no value except as scrap.\n The franchise was without value for reasons already stated, or so the triers of the facts might hold without \n\n[295 U.S. 264, 285]\n\u00a0\n departing from the restraints of the Constitution of the nation.\n With the value of the franchise gone, the public easements in the street, as distinguished from the private ones, had a worth that was merely nominal, at least for any showing to the contrary in the pages of this record.\n Other objections have been considered without inducing a conviction that the petitioners have been the victims of any arbitrary rulings.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n The CHIEF JUSTICE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Many decisions are collected in 40 Yale Law Journal 779, 1074, 1309. \n\n\n\n\n","144":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCHOENAMSGRUBER v.

Each filed a libel in admiralty in the district court for Northern California against respondents claiming damages on account of personal injuries alleged to have been inflicted upon the child while she was a passenger on the Oakland. The libels assert that the wrongful act constituted a breach of respondents' contract to carry the child safely from Hamburg, Germany, to San Francisco. The answers, in addition to denying material allegations of the libels, alleged that the contract contained the following provision: 'Complaints based on failure to fulfill the terms of this contract, claims for damages, etc., on the part of the passenger must be filed with the representative (agent) of the Hamburg- American Line at the port of destination immediately after the arrival of the ship. In the event that an agreement cannot be reached, both parties agree to refer the matter to the German Consul at the port of destination whose decision will be acceptable to both parties, subject to the laws applicable thereto.' \n\n[294 U.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n Respondents applied to the court for arbitration under the United States Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.  1-15 (9 USCA  1-15). Opposing the application, petitioners maintained that the child was carried as a passenger not in pursuance of the contract alleged in the answers but upon one that contained no provision for arbitration. After hearing and upon consideration of the evidence, the court ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration, stayed trial of the action pending the filing of the award, and retained jurisdiction to make orders and enter decrees contemplated by the act or otherwise permitted or required by law. 9 U.S.C.  8 (9 USCA  8). Petitioners appealed; the Circuit Court of Appeals held the orders to be interlocutory and nonappealable and dismissed the appeals. The Oakland, 70 F. (2d) 234.\n Claiming that decision to be in conflict with Krauss Bros. Lumber Co. v. Louis Bossert & Sons (C.C.A. 2) 62 F.(2d) 1004, and that the orders are final, petitioners applied for, and this court granted, writs of certiorari. Later, but before argument of these cases, we announced decisions in Enelow v. New York Life Insurance Co., \n293 \nU.S. 379\n, 55 S.Ct. 310, and Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corp. v. Westchester Service Corp., \n293 \nU.S. 449\n, 55 S.Ct. 313, which definitely show that the orders are not final and therefore not appealable under section 128, Judicial Code, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  225 (28 USCA  225).1\n Abandoning their claims that the orders are final, petitioners by supplemental brief argue that they are appealable under section 129, as amended, 28 U.S.C.  227 (28 USCA  227). They rely on the Shanferoke Case. That decision was based on the Enelow \n\n[294 U.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n Case. Each of these was an action at law in which the defendant by answer sought equitable relief. In each the order held appealable stayed proceedings on the law side and operated as an injunction, within the meaning of that section, against proceedings in another court. The cases now before us are in admiralty. The orders appealed from merely stay action in the court pending arbitration and filing of the award. As shown by the Enelow Case, they are not interlocutory injunctions within the meaning of section 129. And plainly, so far as concerns appealability, they are not to be distinguished from an order postponing trial of an action at law to await the report of an auditor.\n Save as therein otherwise specified, section 129 extends only to suits in equity. Its provisions relating to injunctions and receivers were put in present form by the Act of February 13, 1925, 43 Stat. 937 (28 USCA  227). Before that act, appealability was expressly confined to suits 'in equity.' 2 Its legislative history shows the omission of the phrase was not intended to remove that limitation. \n3\n While courts of admiralty have capacity to apply equitable principles in order the better to attain justice, they do not have general equitable jurisdiction4 and, except in limitation of lia- \n\n[294 U.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n bility proceedings,5 they do not issue injunctions. \n6\n The Act of April 3, 1926, 44 Stat. 233 (28 USCA  227), added to section 129 a provision granting appeal 'from an interlocutory decree in admiralty determining the rights and liabilities of the parties.' This specification, taken in connection with the other parts of the section, indicates that Congress did not intend to make appealable any other interlocutory decrees in admiralty. Moreover, there is nothing to indicate that Congress intended to allow repeated appeals in the class of cases to which these belong. That would be contrary to its long-established policy. \n7\n The orders under consideration may be reviewed on appeal from the final decrees. Section 128, Judicial Code. Petitioners' contention that they are interlocutory injunctions under section 129 is without merit. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n294 \nU.S. 734\n, 55 S.Ct. 635, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] And see General Elec.

COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA(1935)\n\nArgued: October 14, 1935Decided: November 11, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 113, 114]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Robert Jones, of Philadelphia, Pa., for appellant.\n Mr. Manuel Kraus, of Pittsburgh, Pa., for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, a trust company organized under the laws of Pennsylvania, challenges a statute of the state as construed and applied in the assessment of a tax for the year 1930, denominated a tax on shares. From a settlement made against the company by the Department of Revenue an appeal was taken to the court of common pleas of Dauphin county which, after trial without a jury, entered judgment in favor of the commonwealth. 1 The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania affirmed the judgment. \n2\n The appellant's contention is that the act as so construed and applied by the Department and the courts discriminates against United States government bonds, bonds of federal instrumentalities, and national bank stocks included in the appellant's assets. The appellee replies that the tax is upon the shares of stock as such, and not upon the assets which represent their value; that, in fact, no tax whatever, much less a discriminatory tax, has been levied upon exempt assets of the company.\n Prior to the year 1907, Pennsylvania trust companies were liable for what is known as a capital stock tax, levied upon the corporation. In the administration of \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 115]\n\u00a0\n that form of exaction certain securities, such as United States bonds and national bank shares, are eliminated from tax by deduction of their value from the value of the total assets of the corporations which own them. The deduction of exempt securities is made to avoid double taxation; the theory being that the shares issued by a corporation and its capital stock are identical so that taxation of the one is taxation of the other. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n On June 13, 1907, the General Assembly adopted an act prescribing another method of taxation in the case of trust companies. Its pertinent provisions are copied in the margin. \n4\n This statute in terms lays a tax upon shares rather than upon corporate assets. The value of each share is to be ascertained by adding the value of capital stock paid in, surplus, and undivided profits, and dividing the total by the number of outstanding shares. Thus the exaction is measured by the value of the company's net assets. This involves the exclusion of corporate liabilities from the measure of value to which the rate is to be applied. \n5\n By sucessive amendments it was di- \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 116]\n\u00a0\n rected that the value of each share of stock should be ascertained by adding together so much of the amount of capital stock paid in, surplus, and undivided profits as is not invested in the shares of stock of corporations liable to pay to the commonwealth a capital stock tax or tax on shares, or relieved from the payment of capital stock tax or tax on shares, and dividing the sum by the number of outstanding shares. \n6\n These amendments were combined with the original act, in a single statute of April 25, 1929.7\n Obviously, the theory of the amendments was that as trust companies, so long as they had been liable for capital stock tax, had been exempted from payment of tax reckoned upon assets which had already paid a tax or were exempt from tax, that is, the stock of corporations of Pennsylvania which had paid a capital stock tax or whose shares had been taxed or had been exempted from tax, it was proper, in levying a tax upon the shares of trust companies reckoned upon the net assets of those companies, to exempt from such net assets so much thereof as represented shares of corporations which had already paid a tax or, under the policy of the commonwealth had been exempted.\n The impost, as laid by the act of 1907, was a true tax on shares, and not a tax upon the assets of trust companies. Such an exaction is not a tax upon United States securities owned by the corporation whose shares are taxed or upon securities exempt from taxation because issued by instrumentalities of the federal government. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n[296 U.S. 113, 117]\n\u00a0\n It will be observed that by the amendments to the act of 1907 the measure of the tax is not in any sense the value of the shares as such, but a value reflected by so much of the net assets as is not represented by shares of Pennsylvania corporations already taxed or exempt from tax. In the administration of the act as amended, the procedure which has been followed and approved9 is first to deduct the liabilities from the total assets, thus arriving at the net assets. The theory has been the exempt shares owned by the trust company must be shown to have been actually purchased out of capital stock or surplus in order to obtain a deduction of their full value from the gross assets. If the company is unable to demonstrate that they were purchased in that manner, then a proportional method of deduction is adopted. This is to apply to the taxed value of all such exempt securities a fraction the numerator of which is the net assets and the denominator the gross assets. The result of applying this fraction to the taxed value of exempt shares is said to give the proportion of those exempt shares attributable to capital, surplus, and undivided profits, and the quotient is accordingly deducted from the value of the net assets to obtain the measure of the tax on all the shares, and this, divided by the number of outstanding shares, gives the measure of the tax for each share. In the instant case, the trust company held amongst its assets shares of Pennsylvania corporations, exempt from tax, of the value of $135,787. It also held shares of the Philadelphia National Bank of the value of $20,202. These were found by the Department of Revenue to have been taxed at a total taxable value of $71,373. Applying the fractional formula mentioned, it was found that $8,886 of their taxable value should be attributed to capital, surplus, and undivided profits, and deducted from the \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 118]\n\u00a0\n amount of the net assets. As the net assets had been ascertained to be $ 467,714, the deduction brought this figure down to $458,028, to which the rate of tax or 5 mills was applied.\n It should be stated that under the act the corporation is required to make a report as the basis for the calculation of the tax, and, upon that report, the Department of Revenue settles the tax which is assessed against the corporation. The trust company, and not the stockholders, is liable in the first instance for the tax. Though given the right to pay the tax from its funds or to collect the amount from its stockholders, neither the company nor the commonwealth is given any lien upon the stock for the amount of the tax. As the obligation to pay the commonwealth is that of the company, its interest and its right to contest are beyond question.\n In specifications of objection filed with its appeal from the tax settlement in the court of common pleas, the trust company insisted that all exempt shares (including the shares of the Philadelphia National Bank) should be deducted from the gross assets in full. This would exempt their full value rather than a proportion of their taxed value as ascertained by the use of the proportional method above described. The further objection was made that the method of settlement adopted resulted in discrimination against exempt securities issued by the United States or other federal instrumentalities, and that these should have been deducted at their full value from the gross assets before any computation of the tax. The common pleas court overruled these objections (without discussing the treatment of the national bank shares), saying, with respect to United States bonds and like exempt securities, that as the tax was a tax upon shares, and not upon the assets of the trust company, those securities had not in fact been taxed. In affirming the judgment, the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania said that as \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 119]\n\u00a0\n the specifications of objections had not covered the point as to national bank shares, and the court below had not discussed that matter, it was not open in the appellate court. As respects United States bonds, and other federal securities, it concurred in the view of the lower court.\n First. The appellant insists that as merely a portion of the net assets of the corporation is taken as the basis or measure of the tax it cannot be upon the shares as shares. The appellee relies upon the statement of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania that the levy is upon the shares and no upon assets. The appellant asks us to find to the contrary. We give great weight to the characterization of a tax, or the interpretation of a state law, emanating from the highest court of the state, but where a federal question is involved we are not bound by the label attached to the tax or the character ascribed to the law. We must determine for ourselves the true nature of the tax by ascertaining its operation and effect. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n It is clear that the tax is not measured by each shareholder's aliquot proportion of all the assets of the company. If amongst those assets are found shares of stock of Pennsylvania corporations which, or whose shares, have been declared exempt by the state, this exemption is effected in the instant case by taking them wholly or partially out of the net assets which are the base for the tax. The appellant says this demonstrates that the tax is one upon assets. If the appellant is right, the exaction operates as a discrimination against government securities and other assets exempt under federal law. Missouri v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313\n, 50 S.Ct. 326. If the tax is one truly upon that independent property evidenced by the ownership of a share of corporate stock, its collection does not discriminate against United State securities. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n[296 U.S. 113, 120]\n\u00a0\n We think that the issue of discrimination is not to be resolved by a choice between the two contentions as to the nature of the tax. The point is that the state has chosen a portion only of the net assets of the corporation as a measure of the tax, whether the exaction be from the company or its shareholders. The state has exempted certain assets on the theory that to measure the tax in part by their value would in effect be to tax them twice. If to measure the shareholder's tax by inclusion of these taxed or exempted securities found amongst the company's assets would be to tax the shareholder in virtue of the company's ownership of those securities, if seems clear that to refuse to exempt United States securities from the measure of the tax is to lay a tax reckoned upon their value. To put it otherwise, if to exclude securities already taxed or exempted from tax pursuant to the policy of the commonwealth avoids double taxation, to include United States securities in the measure of the tax seems inevitably to increase the burden of the tax by reason of their ownership. If the burden of the tax be lifted in respect of some securities (as it is by confession from those issued by certain Pennsylvania corporations) it must necessarily fall on the remaining securities owned by the company. If the tax is lifted from the shares of certain trust companies because those companies own only stocks already taxed or relieved from taxation by the state, and shares in other trust companies are taxed amongst whose assets there are United States bonds or other securities entitled to exemption because issued by federal instrumentalities which are figured in the base of the tax, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that the law discriminates in favor of the former and against the latter solely by reason of ownership of such federal securities.\n Second. It is indisputable that the shares of stock of the Philadelphia National Bank owned by the appellant \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 121]\n\u00a0\n were included in the base or measure of the tax. It is undenied that these shares had been taxed to the trust company, as permitted by R.S.  5219, as amended (12 USCA  548), and in accordance with the applicable statutes of Pennsylvania;12 and it must be conceded that having once been taxed to their owner, the trust company, they may not again be made the base or measure of a tax to that company's stockholders. Bank of California v. Richardson, \n248 \nU.S. 476\n, 39 S.Ct. 165. The trial court seems to have excluded them upon the theory that they were not within the intent of the taxing statute, which the court thought meant to exempt only shares of Pennsylvania corporations which had been taxed or relieved from tax by local law. This view the trial court appears to have abandoned in a later case,13 where it was held that stock of a federal reserve bank was within the meaning of the Pennsylvania act and entitled to exemption. This later decision was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n We are told that the matter is not open here for the reason that it was not raised on appeal to the Dauphin county court, was not discussed by that court, and consequently the Supreme Court refused to consider it. Whether the point was in fact raised in the court below is itself a federal question, and we are bound to examine the record to resolve it. \n15\n It appears that in the specifications of objection filed in Dauphin county court complaint was made that, whereas there should have been a flat deduction of all shares of corporations theretofore taxed or exempted from tax, shares of the Philadelphia \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 122]\n\u00a0\n National Bank were included in shares granted only a proportional deduction. It further appears that in accordance with Pennsylvania practice, after the trial of the cause to the court without a jury, the appellant submitted requests for conclusions of law. Amongst these were requests 10 and 16, which referred specifically to the Philadelphia National Bank stock, and severally requested the court to find (a) that these shares having been once taxed under another act, to the trust company as owner, could not be taxed a second time, and (b) that the failure to deduct the full value of the shares from the net assets of the trust company operated to discriminate and impose a tax upon the shares of stock in violation of R.S.  5219; they having once been taxed under another statute. The court answered both these requests in writing, 'Refused.' The refusal of the requests was made the subject of exceptions which quoted the requests and the answers of the court verbatim. The exceptions were overruled by the court and errors were assigned to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to the overruling of the exceptions applicable to the refusal of the requests in question, which were again quoted verbatim, with the answer of the court to the request and the overruling of the corresponding exception. In addition to these assignments of error, the appellant in the statement of questions involved, required by the rules of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to be made a part of the brief on appeal, amongst others set forth the following question: 'Are assets consisting of national bank shares to be eliminated from consideration in determining the taxable value to which the rate of tax is to be applied by deducting their actual value from the value of the net assets? Answer of the court below No.'\n We think that notwithstanding the Dauphin county court, in its opinion, failed to discuss this matter, as the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania points out, the question was sharply presented to that court and decided by it, and \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 123]\n\u00a0\n that the rights of the appellant were specifically preserved and pressed at every stage of the proceeding. We find, therefore, that the question is here for decision. It might well be disposed of by reference to what has already been said with respect to bonds of the United States and like securities. The discrimination here disclosed is, however, more obvious than in the case of the other securities mentioned. The commonwealth of Pennsylvania elected to exempt certain shares of stock of its own corporations because they had already been taxed. It exempted them because to include them in the base would be in effect to tax them a second time. The shares of the Philadelphia National Bank had also been taxed pursuant to R.S.  5219, and if they were to be treated on an equal footing with shares of domestic corporations the state was bound to afford them a similar exemption from a second exaction.\n Third. The appellant argues that if, as declared by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the tax is one upon shares as such, it cannot be laid or collected by the commonwealth in respect of 166 shares of stock of the appellant which by confession are owned by individuals citizens and residents of states other than Pennsylvania, for the reason that such shares have no taxable situs in Pennsylvania. In view of the grounds of our decision, we find it unnecessary to pass upon this contention.\n The judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO (dissenting).\n I think the judgment under review is right in so far as it permits the inclusion of government bonds as factors of value in the assessment of the tax, and wrong only in so far as it violates a provision of section 5219 of the United States Revised Statutes, as amended (12 USCA  548) by the inclusion of shares in the Philadelphia National Bank. \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 124]\n\u00a0\n The tax in controversy is not laid upon the capital of the trust company. It is laid upon the shares; payment being made in the first instance by the corporation as the agent of the shareholders with a remedy over for moneys so advanced. Home Savings Bank v. Des Moines, \n205 \nU.S. 503, 518\n, 27 S.Ct. 571; Commonwealth v. Merchants' & Manufacturers' National Bank, 168 Pa. 309, 31 A. 1065, affirmed \n167 \nU.S. 461\n, 17 S.Ct. 829; Commonwealth v. Mortgage Trust Co., 227 Pa. 163, 76 A. 5; Commonwealth v. Union Trust Co. of Pittsburgh, 237 Pa. 353, 85 A. 461; Northern Trust Co. v. McCoach (D.C.) 215 F. 991; cf. First National Bank v. Commonwealth of Kentucky, 9 Wall. 353, 362; Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, \n166 \nU.S. 440, 444\n, 445 S., 17 S.Ct. 629. The tax being laid upon the shares, and not upon the capital, the Constitution does not make it necessary in the assessment of the tax to reduce the value of the shares to the extent that bonds of the national government are included in the capital. This is settled law. Van Allen v. Assessors, 3 Wall. 573; Cleveland Trust Co. v. Lander, \n184 \nU.S. 111\n, 22 S.Ct. 394; Des Moines Bank v. Fairweather, \n263 \nU.S. 103, 112\n, 44 S.Ct. 23; Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379, 390\n, 51 S.Ct. 170, 71 A.L.R. 1226\n\n\n The argument for the appellant is that the tax might have been lawful if the shares had been valued without any deductions growing out of the nature of the capital, but that the moment a deduction was allowed in respect of any class, there was an unlawful discrimination against government securities unless the deduction was enlarged and made applicable to them. The attack is thus confined to amendments of the act which were placed upon the statute books in three years (1923, 1927, 1929), for there was no deduction of any kind under the act as first adopted in 1907. These amendments provide that the assessment shall be reduced by deducting therefrom (1) such part of the assets of the trust company as is invested in shares of other corporations taxed by the com- \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 125]\n\u00a0\n monwealth of Pennsylvania upon capital or shares (1923, July 11, P.L. 1071, 1072, re-enacted by 1927, May 7, P.L. 853, 855, 1929, April 25, P.L. 673, 675 (72 PS Pa.  2001)), and (2) such part as is invested in the shares of other corporations relieved by the commonwealth from a capital tax or a tax on shares (1927, May 7, P.L. 853, 855, 1929, April 25, P.L. 673, 675 ( 72 PS Pa.  2001)). The purpose of the first deduction is to avoid double taxation or something akin thereto. Cf. Commonwealth v. Fall Brook Coal Co ., 156 Pa. 488, 495, 26 A. 1071; Commonwealth v. Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co., 162 Pa. 603, 609, 29 A. 664. The purpose of the second is to promote the policy of the commonwealth whereby particular kinds of business (i.e., the business of manufacturing corporations, laundering corporations, and corporations for the processing and curing of meats) are relieved from the payment of taxes imposed on other corporations to the extent that the business so favored is carried on in Pennsylvania. \n16\n Dupuy v. Johns, 261 Pa. 40, 46, 104 A. 565. \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 126]\n\u00a0\n At the time of the assessment, the appellant was the owner of shares in corporations that paid a tax upon their capital to the commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Purdon's Pennsylvania Statutes, title 72,  1871. These shares will be described for convenience as investments in class No. 1. Except for certain shares in the Philadelphia National Bank, which will be separately considered, the assets did not include an interest in corporations that paid a tax upon their shares as distinguished from one upon their capital. The appellant was also the owner, or so it will be assumed, of shares of stock in manufacturing corporations that were relieved from any tax. These shares will be described for convenience as investments in class No. 2. The holding now is that the deduction of the shares of either of these classes is an act of discrimination forbidden by the national Constitution, unless investments in obligations issued by the national government are accorded the same favor.\n I read the cases otherwise. The statute was not passed as an act of 'unfriendly discrimination' (Adams v. Nashville, \n95 U.S. 19\n, 22 Am.Rep. 430; Mercantile Nat. Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138, 161\n, 7 S. Ct. 826; Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, supra, \n166 U.S. 440\n, at page 461, 17 S.Ct. 629) against the national securities, nor was it passed in aid of classes of investments with which the national securities are in substantial competition. In the absence of one or other of these motives or results the prejudice, if \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 127]\n\u00a0\n any, is too remote to be forbidden. There is no room in the solution of problems of this order for doctrinaire definitions, heedless of practical results. Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, \n269 \nU.S. 514, 523\n, 524 S., 46 S.Ct. 172. 'In a broad sense, the taxing power of either government, even when exercised in a manner admittedly necessary and proper, unavoidably has some effect upon the other.' Metcalf & Eddy v. Mitchell, supra, \n269 U.S. 514\n, at page 523, 46 S.Ct. 172, 174. A sterile formalism whould quickly lead to an impasse, the activities of the states checked because of an indirect effect upon the agencies of the federal government, and the federal activities checked for fear of a like effect upon the agencies of the states. One must view the subject in a large way if government is to go on at all. Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, supra, \n282 U.S. 379\n, at page 390, 51 S.Ct. 170, 71 A.L.R. 1226, and cases there cited; Pacific Co. v. Johnson, \n285 \nU.S. 480, 489\n, 52 S.Ct. 424; Trinityfarm Co. v. Grosjean, \n291 \nU.S. 466\n, 54 S.Ct. 469; Willcuts v. Bunn, \n282 \nU.S. 216, 225\n, 226 S., 51 S. Ct. 125, 71 A.L.R. 1260; Helvering v. Powers, \n293 \nU.S. 214, 225\n, 55 S.Ct. 171.\n'Unfriendly discrimination' might be inferred if securities of every kind were excluded from the reckoning with the single exception of the obligations of the national government. That would be an extreme case, the conclusion hardly doubtful. Even though hostility were not so pointed as in the case supposed, there might still be an invidious distinction if securities in substantial competition with evidences of indebtedness issued by the national government had been given a preferred position. Nothing of the kind appears. 'For reasons of public policy, and not as an unfriendly discrimination' (Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, supra, \n166 U.S. 440\n, at page 461, 17 S.Ct. 629, 637), the value of a share in a trust company is to be ascertained by excluding from the assets the shares in other corporations that are liable to the state for a tax upon their capital. Let it be assumed, for illustration, that a trust company is the owner of shares of stock in a department shore doing business in Philadelphia. Under the statutes of Pennsylvania a bus- \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 128]\n\u00a0\n iness of that kind pays a tax upon its capital. A trust company does not. If it did, a hardship akin to that of double taxation would result if its interest in the department store were made use of to magnify its burden. But the process of taxation does not end at that point. By the plan of the statute the assessor passes over the trust company and lays the tax upon the shareholders. The same considerations of fair dealing and equality are then applicable to them. So at least the Legislature of Pennsylvania might not unreasonably believe. Never before has it been held that out of deference or favor toward the securities of government a state is disabled from framing its system of taxation along lines of equity and justice. Hepburn v. School Directors, 23 Wall. 480, 485.\n\n What is true of investments in class No. 1 is true also of investments in class No. 2. 'For reasons of public policy, and not as an unfriendly discrimination' (Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, supra), corporations organized for laundering, for the processing and curing of meats, and for manufacturing within the state, have been relieved by Pennsylvania from liability for a tax upon their capital. The motive dictating that exemption is the desire to induce capital to come or stay within the state when employed in forms of enterprise believed to be important for the good of the community. Dupuy v. Johns, supra; Commonwealth v. Barnes Bros. Co., 5 Dauphin Co. Rep. (Pa.) 75, 77; cf. New York State v. Roberts, \n171 \nU.S. 658, 665\n, 666 S., 19 S.Ct. 58. In promotion of the same policy the shares of corporations thus relieved from liability for a tax are excluded from the reckoning when shareholders in trust companies are taxed upon the value of their holdings. The reckoning does not exclude the bonds or notes or other evidence of indebtedness of corporations of any kind, foreign or domestic. It does not exclude the shares of any corporation not engaged in the enumerated forms of business, except in so far as such other corporations have al- \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 129]\n\u00a0\n ready paid a tax upon their capital or shares. It does not exclude the shares of manufacturing corporations, except to the extent of the capital employed in Pennsylvania. The deduction is limited in range and beneficent in aim.\n The situation, then, is this: Vast classes of securities, bonds and notes of every kind, as well as shares of stock in many and varied enterprises, are in the same position for the purpose of the tax in suit as government bonds and notes. The few investments that occupy a different position are not comparable in kind or in attractiveness to the obligations of the government, and do not substantially compete with them. To hold that there was discrimination here in any forbidden sense is to hold that bonds and notes of the United States must be deducted from the value of the shares if there is a deduction of any form of investment, no matter how minute in amount or alien in quality. Assume, for illustration, an exemption of the shares of corporations engaged in the manufacture of books or in the sale of works of art, an exemption accorded in furtherance of a policy to foster art and letters. If the prevailing opinion stands, the policy in such a case must be abandoned or the federal bonds included. Assume again that laundering corporations only had been relieved by Pennsylvania from liability for a tax upon their capital. Laundering corporations, as we have seen, were actually relieved, but manufacturing corporations also. The prevailing opinion, if it stands, would bring us to a holding that laundering corporations could not be favored without hostility and peril to the Treasury at Washington. This is to lose sight of the essence of discriminatory statutes and to stick in the bark of a hard and narrow verbalism.\n From such incongruities and excesses the avenue of escape is clear. It is to be found in the acceptance of the test put forward in this opinion. The discrimination, as \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 130]\n\u00a0\n has been said, must be so marked as to justify the inference that it was unfriendly in design or at the very least it must favor forms of investment that are in substantial competition with government securities. A helpful analogy is found in the taxation of national banks. By R.S.  5219, as amended, 12 U.S.C.  548 (12 USCA  548), the several states may tax the shares of national banks, but 'the tax imposed shall not be at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of such State coming into competition with the business of national banks.' There are many cases in this court expounding that enactment. Hepburn v. School Directors, supra, was a case where a statute of a state had given exemption from taxation to 'all mortgages, judgments, recognizances, and moneys owing upon articles of agreement for the sale of real estate.' The court assumed that the exempt investments might be ranked as moneyed capital. The tax upon the bank shares was none the less upheld. The exemption was partial only. 'It was evidently intended to prevent a double burden by the taxation both of property and debts secured upon it.' Id., 23 Wall. 480, at page 485. There was no token of a hostile purpose. 'It could not have been the intention of Congress to exempt bank shares from taxation because some moneyed capital was exempt.' Id. Adams v. Nashville, \n95 U.S. 19\n, at page 22, 22 Am.Rep. 430, was a case where a municipal ordinance gave exemption from taxation to the municipal bonds. Again the ruling was that this exemption of particular property did not affect the validity of the tax upon the shares. 'The plain intention of that statute (R.S.  5219) was to protect the corporations formed under its authority from unfriendly discrimination by the States in the exercise of their taxing power.' 'It was not intended to cut off the power to exempt particular kinds of property, if the legislature chose to do so.' Id. Mercantile Nat. Bank v. New York, \n121 \nU.S. 138\n, 7 S.Ct. 826, was a case where exemption had been given \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 131]\n\u00a0\n to bonds of municipal corporations, and also to deposits in savings banks. Again the protest of discrimination was unavailing to defeat the tax. After quoting from Hepburn v. School Directors and Adams v. Nashville, the court went on to say (\n121 U.S. 138\n, at page 161, 7 S.Ct. 826, 838): 'The only limitation, upon deliberate reflection, we now think it necessary to add, is that these exemptions should be founded upon just reason, and not operate as an unfriendly discrimination against investments in national bank shares.' The same note is sounded in Aberdeen Bank v. Chehalis County, supra. Even though the investments subjected to a lighter tax are to be classed as moneyed capital, this is unavailing without more to condemn the classification as unlawful. Unless the favored moneyed capital is in substantial competition with the business of national banks, the preference is innocent in aim and harmless in result. At least, the harm, if any, is too remote and dubious to vitiate the tax. First National Bank v. Hartford, \n273 \nU.S. 548, 552\n, 47 S.Ct. 462, 59 A.L.R. 1; Minnesota v. First National Bank, \n273 \nU.S. 561, 568\n, 47 S.Ct. 468; First National Bank v. Anderson, \n269 \nU.S. 341, 348\n, 46 S.Ct. 135; First National Bank v. Louisiana Tax Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 60, 65\n, 66 S., 53 S.Ct. 511, 87 A.L.R. 840; cf. Hibernia Savings Society v. San Francisco, \n200 \nU.S. 310, 314\n, 315 S., 26 S.Ct. 265, 4 Ann.Cas. 934. The conclusion is even clearer where the investment may not properly be classified as moneyed capital at all. \n17\n\u00a0\n\n Two cases, National Life Insurance Co. v. United States, \n277 \nU.S. 508\n, 48 S.Ct. 591, and Missouri ex rel. Missouri Insurance Co. v. Gehner, \n281 \nU.S. 313\n, 50 S.Ct. 326, much relied upon by the appellant, are far beside the mark.\n The first of these cases brought up a controversy as to a tax laid by Congress on the income of a life insurance company. The company was to be allowed (1) a deduc- \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 132]\n\u00a0\n tion for tax exempt securities, and (2) an amount equal to 4 per cent. of its mean reserve fund, diminished, however, by the amount of the first allowance, the interest on government securities exempt under the federal law. The court held that the effect of the second allowance was to cancel the exemption conceded by the first.\n The second of the two cases was one where in the view of a majority of the court a tax had been laid directly on the capital assets of the taxpayer and so on the government bonds included in the assets. It was not a case like this where the shares and not the capital were subjected to the burden.\n I am unable for these reasons to discover an unlawful discrimination, though the tax be assessed in accordance with the statute.\n Assuming such a discrimination, I do not understand that any mandate is laid by this court upon the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania as to the choice between two methods of avoiding or correcting it.\n The Acts of 1923, 1927, and 1929, prescribing the deductions, were amendatory statutes, separable, even though invalid, from the acts thereby amended. Eberle v. Michigan, \n232 \nU.S. 700, 705\n, 34 S.Ct. 464; Davis v. Wallace, \n257 \nU.S. 478, 484\n, 485 S., 42 S.Ct. 164; Truax v. Corrigan, \n257 \nU.S. 312, 342\n, 42 S.Ct. 124, 27 A.L.R. 375.\n If the state maintains the deductions prescribed by the amendments, it must remove the discrimination now held to be unlawful, even at the price of enlarging the deductions. Iowa-Des Moines Bank v. Bennett, \n284 \nU.S. 239, 247\n, 52 S.Ct. 133. On the other hand, it may cancel the deductions altogether, annulling the amendatory acts in so far as they prescribe a new method of valuation and going back in that respect to the law previously in force. In that event the tax to be paid by the appellant will be increased instead of lessend. The choice between these curative measures must be made by the state court. \n\n[296 U.S. 113, 133]\n\u00a0\n For reasons stated in Bank of California v.

GREEN(1935)\nNo. 434\nArgued: Decided: February 4, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 165, 166]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Raymon Schwartz, of Sumter, S.C., George P. Barse, of Washington, D.C., and R. O. Purdy, of Sumter, S.C., for petitioner.\n Mr. Samuel Want, of Darlington, S.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n March 17, 1927, Moses Green of Sumter county S.C., died testate. He left three sons, a daughter, and a deceased son's three minor children. His will was established in probate court; the executor qualified and entered upon his duties. The residuary estate contained 20 shares of stock of the City National Bank of Sumter which were distributed by the executor and transferred on the books of the bank: four shares to each of testator's children and four to the three minors. The executor was discharged. The bank continued for several years thereafter to carry on as a going concern. Then it closed because of insolvency and was put in the hands of a receiver, the petitioner. The Comptroller made an assessment of $ 100 a share. No payment having been made on account of the \n\n[294 U.S. 165, 167]\n\u00a0\n four shares in the names of the minors, an administratrix de bonis non with the will annexed was appointed. She refused to pay the assessment. The undivided interest in real estate received by the distributees under the testator's will is worth more than $2,000, the par value of the 20 shares, and the minors' interest is worth more than $400.\n Claiming under title 12, U.S.C.  64 and 66 (12 USCA  64, 66), petitioner brought this suit in the common pleas court of Sumter county against the administratrix, the sons and daughter, the minors, and their guardian. He made no demand and asserted no claim against the executor. The complaint prayed judgment against the administratrix for $400 with interest and that the property taken under the will and held by the other defendants be subjected to the claim. The trial court, following Rutledge v. Stackley, 162 S.C. 170, 160 S.E. 429, 78 A.L.R. 427, held the minors not personally liable because legally incapable of assuming the obligation; that if living the testator would be, and therefore his estate is, liable and that petitioner is entitled to judgment against the administratrix; that the property taken by the minors under the will should be subjected to the payment of the debt and, if not sufficient, the property distributed to and held by the testator's sons and daughter. It gave judgment for petitioner in accordance with these rulings. The administrator and minors appealed. The Supreme Court reversed. 173 S.C. 235, 175 S.E. 639, 641. It held the will did not direct distribution of bank stock to the minors but the executor allotted it to them in what he considered an orderly and authorized division of the estate; that, as they could not assume the obligation, their property is not liable; and that, as the transfer to them was not directed by the will and the executor had no power to bind the estate, it was not liable. In support of its conclusion the court suggested that during administration there existed \n\n[294 U.S. 165, 168]\n\u00a0\n against testator's estate no claim in favor of the bank's creditors; that all debts of the estate were paid; and that the executor was discharged without objection. And it said: 'We can see no reason why a claim which did not exist during the orderly administration of the estate should now be brought up years after the estate closed. ... It does not seem that either the act of Congress or the state statute imposing liability on stockholders in banks is sufficient to cover the very peculiar facts existing in this case.'\n Respondent maintains that no federal question is involved. To the extent the opinion implies that liability of stockholders of national banks is a creature of or depends upon a statute of South Carolina the assumption is so plainly without foundation as to suggest that it must have been inadvertently made. The court's ruling that the estate is not liable for the assessment necessarily depends upon its construction of 12 USCA section 66. The judgment is reviewable here under section 237(b), Judicial Code, 28 USCA  344(b).\n For the want of capacity the minors are not subject to the assessment. The shares, though in form transferred to their names on the books of the bank, actually continued to be and still are a part of the testator's estate. Early v. Richardson, \n280 \nU.S. 496, 499\n, 50 S.Ct. 176, 69 A.L.R. 658. Cf. McNair v. Darragh (C.C.A.) 31 F.(2d) 906. And the estate continued to be liable as a stockholder under 12 USCA  66. The liability was not by the Congress intended to be limited to property actually in the hands of the personal representative when the bank became insolvent or when the comptroller's assessment was made. Section 64 imposes liability upon the stockholder while living. Section 66 lays the same burden upon his estate. The purpose of the latter is to make the estate liable for the comptroller's assessment made after the stockholder's death just as it is liable for decedent's indebtedness arising before he died. Zimmerman v. Carpenter (C.C.) 84 F. 747, 751. Cf. Matteson v. Dent, 176 U.S. \n\n[294 U.S. 165, 169]\n\u00a0\n 521, 20 S.Ct. 419. The obligation continues unimpaired until valid assignment of the shares by final distribution of the estate if not by an earlier transfer. Forrest v. Jack, \n294 \nU.S. 158\n, 55 S.Ct. 370, decided this day. Our attention has not been called to any South Carolina statute purporing to, and the state supreme Court did not hold that any law of the state does, bar the enforcement of the assessment on the ground it was not made before the discharge of the executor. The decree of the court by which he was discharged, while having the effect of vacating the office, did not operate to extinguish the estate and so the administratrix de bonis non with the will annexed became the personal representative of the testator and is liable as the testator would be if he were living and owned the stock. As suggested in Forrest v. Jack, supra, the enforcement of liability imposed by section 66 may not be thwarted or impeded by state law. The state court failed to enforce that liability. It should have held that petitioner is entitled to judgment against the administratrix for the indebtedness owing by the estate on account of the four shares standing in the names of the minors and that the judgment be enforced against property owned by testator when he died and now held by his children and grandchildren.

OF DENTAL EXAMINERS(1935)\nNo. 538\nArgued: March 7, 1935Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. F. S. Senn, of Portland, Or., and H. R. Colwell, of East Falls Church, Va., for appellant.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case presents the question of the validity of a statute of the state of Oregon, enacted in 1933, relating \n\n[294 U.S. 608, 609]\n\u00a0\n to the conduct of dentists. Oregon Laws 1933, c. 166, p. 208. Previous legislation had provided for the revocation of licenses for unprofessional conduct, which, as then defined, included advertising of an untruthful and misleading nature. The Act of 1933 amended the definition so as to provide the following additional grounds for revocation: 'advertising professional superiority or the performance of professional services in a superior manner; advertising prices for professional service; advertising by means of large display, glaring light signs, or containing as a part thereof the representation of a tooth, teeth, bridge work or any portion of the human head; employing or making use of advertising solicitors of free publicity press agents; or advertising any free dental work, or free examination; or advertising to guarantee any dental service, or to perform any dental operation painlessly.' Laws 1933, p. 210,  2.\n Plaintiff, a dentist practicing in Portland, Or., brought this suit in the state court against the members of the State Board of Dental Examiners to enjoin the enforcement of the statute, alleging that it was repugnant to the due process and equal protection clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and impaired the obligation of contracts in violation of section 10, cl. 1, art. 1 of the Constitution of the United States. The circuit court, overruling this contention, sustained a demurrer to the complaint and, upon the refusal of plaintiff to plead further, the suit was dismissed. On appeal, the Supreme Court of the state took the same view of the federal question and affirmed the judgment. 34 P.( 2d) 311. The case comes here on appeal.\n Plaintiff alleged in his complaint that he was licensed in 1918; that he had continuously advertised his practice in newspapers and periodicals, and by means of signs of the sort described in the amended statute, and that he had employed advertising solicitors; that in his advertise- \n\n[294 U.S. 608, 610]\n\u00a0\n ments he had represented that he had a high degree of efficiency and was able to perform his professional services in a superior manner; that he had stated the prices he would charge, had offered examinations of prospective patients without charge, and had also represented that he guaranteed all his dental work and that his dental operations were performed plainlessly. He further alleged that the statements in his advertisements were truthful and were made in good faith; that by these methods he had developed a large and lucrative practice; that through long training and experience he had acquired ability superior to that of the great majority of practicing dentists; that he had been able to standardize office operations, to purchase supplies in large quantities and at relatively low prices, and thus to establish a uniform schedule of charges for the majority of operations; also, that he had made contracts for display signs and for advertisements in newspapers, and had entered into other engagements, of which he would be unable to take advantage if the legislation in question were sustained, and, in that event, his business would be destroyed or materially impaired.\n Plaintiff is not entitled to complain of interference with the contracts he describes, if the regulation of his conduct as a dentist is not an unreasonable exercise of the protective power of the state. His contracts were necessarily subject to that authority. Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co., \n240 \nU.S. 342, 363\n, 36 S.Ct. 370, L.R.A. 1917A, 421, Ann. Cas. 1917B, 455; Union Dry Goods Co. v.

Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 276\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 87 A. L.R. 721. Nor has plaintiff any ground for objection because the particular regulation is limited to dentists and is not extended to other professional classes. The state was not bound to deal alike with all these classes, or to strike at all evils at the same time or in the same way. It could deal with the different professions according to the needs of the public in relation to each. \n\n[294 U.S. 608, 611]\n\u00a0\n We find no basis for the charge of an unconstitutional discrimination.

Ct. 320.\n The question is whether the challenged restrictions amount to an arbitrary interference with liberty and property and thus violate the requirement of due process of law. That the state may regulate the practice of dentistry, prescribing the qualifications that are reasonably necessary, and to that end may require licenses and establish supervision by an administrative board, is not open to dispute. Douglas v. Noble, \n261 \nU.S. 165\n, 43 S.Ct. 303; Graves v. State of Minnesota, \n272 \nU.S. 425, 427\n, 47 S.Ct. 122. The state may thus afford protection against ignorance, incapacity and imposition. Dent v. West Virginia, \n129 \nU.S. 114, 122\n, 9 S.Ct. 231; Graves v. State of Minnesota, supra. We have held that the state may deny to corporations the right to practice, insisting upon the personal obligations of individuals ( State Board of Dental Examiners v. Miller, 90 Colo. 193, 8 P. (2d) 699; Miller v. State Board of Dental Examiners, \n287 \nU.S. 563\n, 53 S.Ct. 6), and that it may prohibit advertising that tends to mislead the public in this respect. Dr. Bloom Dentist, Inc., v. Cruise, 259 N.Y. 358, 363, 182 N.E. 16; Id., \n288 \nU.S. 588\n, 53 S.Ct. 320.\n Recognizing state power as to such matters, appellant insists that the statute in question goes too far because it prohibits advertising of the described character, although it may be truthful. He contends that the superiority he advertises exists in fact, that by his methods he is able to offer low prices and to render a beneficial public service contributing to the comfort and happiness of a large number of persons.\n The state court defined the policy of the statute. The court said that while, in itself, there was nothing harmful in merely advertising prices for dental work or in displaying glaring signs illustrating teeth and bridge work, it could not be doubted that practitioners who were not \n\n[294 U.S. 608, 612]\n\u00a0\n willing to abide by the ethics of their profession often resorted to such advertising methods 'to lure the credulous and ignorant members of the public to their offices for the purpose of fleecing them.' The legislature was aiming at 'bait advertising.' 'Inducing patronage,' said the court, 'by representations of 'painless dentistry,' 'professional superiority,' 'free examinations,' and 'guaranteed' dental work' was, as a general rule, 'the practice of the charlatan and the quack to entice the public.'\n We do not doubt the authority of the state to estimate the baleful effects of such methods and to put a stop to them. The legislature was not dealing with traders in commodities, but with the vital interest of public health, and with a profession treating bodily ills and demanding different standards of conduct from those which are traditional in the competition of the market place. The community is concerned with the maintenance of professional standards which will insure not only competency in individual practitioners, but protection against those who would prey upon a public peculiarly susceptible to imposition through alluring promises of physical relief. And the community is concerned in providing safeguards not only against deception, but against practices which would tend to demoralize the profession by forcing its members into an unseemly rivalry which would enlarge the opportunities of the least scrupulous. What is generally called the 'ethics' of the profession is but the consensus of expert opinion as to the necessity of such standards.\n It is no answer to say, as regards appellant's claim of right to advertise his 'professional superiority' or his 'performance of professional services in a superior manner,' that he is telling the truth. In framing its policy the legislature was not bound to provide for determinations of the relative proficiency of particular practitioners. \n\n[294 U.S. 608, 613]\n\u00a0\n The legislature was entitled to consider the general effects of the practices which it described, and if these effects were injurious in facilitating unwarranted and misleading claims, to counteract them by a general rule even though in particular instances there might be no actual deception or misstatement.

Braden \n295 U.S. 422\n (1935) ]\n\n\n[295 U.S. 422, 426]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. John W. Bricker, of Columbus, Ohio, and E. G. Schuessler, of Cincinnati, Ohio, for appellees. \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 427]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n January 1, 1932-tax listing day-section 5328-1, the Ohio General Code 1 provided that all investments and other intangible property of persons residing within the state should be subject to taxation. Section 5323 so defined 'investment' as to include incorporeal rights of a pecuniary nature from which income is or may be derived, including equitable interests in land and rents and royalties divided into shares evidenced by transferable certificates. Section 5638 imposed upon productive investments a tax amounting to 5 per centum of their income yield; and section 5389 defined 'income yield' so as to include the aggregate income paid by the trustee to the holder, etc. Pertinent portions of sections 5388 and 5389 are in the margin. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 422, 428]\n\u00a0\n Appellant owned transferable certificates showing that he was beneficiary under seven separate declarations of trust, and entitled to stated portions of rents derived from specified parcels and land-some within Ohio, some without. On account of these beneficial interests he received $2,231.29 during 1931. The lands are adequately described in the margin. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n The tax officers of Hamilton county, where appellant resided, threatened to assess these beneficial interests, and then to collect a tax of 5 per centum of the income there- \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 429]\n\u00a0\n from. To prevent this, he instituted suit in the Common Pleas Court. The petition asked that section 5323, General Code, he declared unconstitutional and that appellees be restrained from taking the threatened action. The trial court granted relief as prayed; the Court of Appeals (48 Ohio App. 255, 193 N.E. 80) reversed, and its action was approved by the Supreme Court.\n With commendable frankness, counsel admit that under the Fourteenth Amendment the state has 'no power to tax land or interests in land situate beyond its borders; nor has it power to tax land or interests in land situate within the State in any other manner than by uniform rule according to value.' Consequently, they say, 'if the property of appellant, which the appellees seek to tax in this case, is land or interest in land situate within or without the State, their action is unconstitutional and should be permanently enjoined.'\n The validity of the tax under the federal Constitution is challenged. Accordingly, we must ascertain for ourselves upon that it was laid. Our concern in with realities, not nomenclature. Moffitt v. Kelly, \n218 \nU.S. 400, 404\n, 405 S., 31 S.Ct. 79, 30 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1179; Macallen Co. v. Massachusetts, \n279 \nU.S. 620, 625\n, 626 S., 49 S.Ct. 432, 65 A.L.R. 866; Educational Films Corporation v. Ward, \n282 \nU.S. 379, 387\n, 51 S.Ct. 170, 71 A.L.R. 1226; Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 280\n, 52 S. S,.ct. 556. If the thing here sought to be subjected to taxation is really an interest in land, then by concession the proposed tax is not permissible. The suggestion that the record discloses no federal question is without merit.\n Three of the parcels of land lie outside Ohio; four within; they were severally conveyed to trustees. The declaration of trust relative to the Clark-Randolph Building Site, Chicago, is typical of those in respect of land beyond Ohio; the one covering East Sixth street property, Cleveland, is typical of those where the land lies in Ohio, except Lincoln Inn Court, Cincinnati. Each parcel has been assessed for customary taxes in the name of legal owner or lessee according to local law, without \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 430]\n\u00a0\n deduction or diminution because of any interest claimed by appellant and others similarly situated.\n The trust certificates severally declare: That Max Senior has purchased and paid for and is the owner of an undivided 340\/1275 interest in the Lincoln Inn Court property; that he is registered on the books of the trustee as the owner of 5\/3250 of the equitable ownership and beneficial interest in the Clark Randolph Building Site, Chicago; that he is the owner of 6\/1050 of the equitable ownership and beneficial interest in the East Sixth street property, Cleveland. In each declaration the trustee undertakes to hold and manage the property for the use and benefit of all certificate owners; to collect and distribute among them the rents; and in case of sale to make pro rata distribution of the proceeds. While certificates and declarations vary in some details, they represent beneficial interests which, for present purposes, are not substantially unlike. Each trustee holds only one piece of land and is free from control by the beneficiaries. They are not joined with it in management. See Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144, 147\n, 44 S.Ct. 462.\n The state maintains that appellant's interest is 'a species of intangible personal property consisting of a bundle of equitable choses in action because the provisions of the agreements and declarations of trust of record herein have indelibly and unequivocally stamped that character upon it by giving it all the qualities thereof for purposes of the management and control of the trusts. At the time the trusts were created, the interests of all the beneficiaries consisted merely of a congeries of rights etc., and such was the interest acquired by appellant when he became a party thereto. ... The rights of the beneficiary consist merely of claims against the various trustees to the pro rata distribution of income, during the continuance of the trusts, and to the pro rata distribution of \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 431]\n\u00a0\n the proceeds of a sale of the trust estates upon their termination.'\n Appellant submits that ownership of the trust certificate is evidence of his interest in the land, legal title to which the trustee holds. This view was definitely accepted by the Attorney General of Ohio in written opinions Nos. 3640 and 3869 (Opinions 1926, pp. 375, 528) wherein he cites pertinent declarations by the courts of Ohio and of other states. See, also, 2 Cincinnati Law Rev. 255.\n The theory entertained by the Supreme Court concerning the nature of appellant's interests is not entirely clear. The following excerpts are from the headnotes of its opinion which in Ohio constitute the law of the case:\n'Land trust certificates in the following trusts (the seven described above), are mere evidences of existing rights to participate in the net rentals of the real estate being administered by the respective trusts.\n\n'Ascribing to such certificates all possible virtue, the holder thereof is at best the owner of equitable interests in real estate divided into shares evidenced by transferable certificates. Section 5323, General Code (114 Ohio Laws, p. 715), does not provide for a tax against the equitable interests in land, but does provide a tax against the income derived from such equitable interests.'\n\n Apparently no opinion of any court definitely accepts the theory now advanced by appellees, but some writers do give it approval because of supposed consonance with general legal principles. The conflicting views are elaborated in articles by Professor Scott and Dean Stone in 17 Columbia Law Review (1917) at pp. 269 and 467.\n Maguire v. Trefry, \n253 \nU.S. 12\n, 40 S.Ct. 417, much relief upon by appellees, does not support their position. There the Massachusetts statute undertook to tax incomes; the securities (personalty) from which the income arose were \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 432]\n\u00a0\n held in trust at Philadelphia; income from securities taxable directly to the trustee was not within the statute. The opinion accepted and followed the doctrine of Blackstone v. Miller, \n188 \nU.S. 189\n, 23 S.Ct. 277, and Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54\n, 38 S.Ct. 40, L.R.A. 1918C, 124. Those cases were disapproved by Farmers' Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A.L.R. 1000. They are not in harmony with Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83\n, 50 S.Ct. 59, 67 A.L.R. 386, and views now accepted here in respect of double taxation. See Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 72 A.L.R. 1303; Beidler v. South Carolina Tax Commission, \n282 \nU.S. 1\n, 51 S.Ct. 54; First National Bank v. Maine, \n284 \nU.S. 312\n, 52 S.Ct. 714, 77 A.L.R. 1401\n\n\n In Brown v. Fletcher, \n235 \nU.S. 589, 599\n, 35 S.Ct. 154, 157, we had occasion to consider the claim that a beneficial interest in a trust state amounts to a chose in action and is not an interest in the res, subject of the trust. Through Mr. Justice Lamar we there said:\n'If the trust estate consisted of land, it would not be claimed that a deed conveying seven-tenths interest therein was a chose in action within the meaning of section 24 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  41). If the funds had been invested in tangible personal property, there is, as pointed out in the Bushnell Case (Bushnell v. Kennedy, 9 Wall. 387, 393), nothing in Section 24 to prevent the holder, by virtue of a bill of sale, from suing for the 'recovery of the specific thing, or damages for its wrongful caption or detention.' And if the funds had been converted into cash, it was still so far property-in fact instead of in action-that the owner, so long as the money retained its earmarks, could recover it or the property into which it can be traced, from those having notice of the trust. In either case, and whatever its form, trust property was held by the trustee, not in opposition to the cestui que trust, so as to give him a chose in action, but in possession for his benefit, in accordance with the terms of the testator's will. ... \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 433]\n\u00a0\n 'The beneficiary here had an interest in and to the property that was more than a bare right and much more than a chose in action. For he had an admitted and recognized fixed right to the present enjoyment of the estate, with a right to the corpus itself when he reached the age of fifty-five. His estate in the property thus in the possession of the trustee, for his benefit, though defeasible, was alienable to the same extent as though in his own possession and passed by deed. Ham v. Van Orden, 84 N.Y. (257), 270; Stringer v. Young, Trustee, 191 N.Y. 157, 83 N.E. 690; Lawrence v. Bayard, 7 Paige (N.Y.) 70; Woodward v. Woodward, 16 N.J.Eq. (83), 84. The instrument by virtue of which that alienation was evidenced-whether called a deed, a bill of sale, or an assignment-was not a chose in action payable to the assignee, but an evidence of the assignee's right, title, and estate in and to property.'\n\n The doctrine of Brown v. Fletcher is adequately supported by courts and writers. Narragansett Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Burnham, 51 R.I. 371, 154 A. 909; Bates v. Decree of Judge of Probate, 131 Me. 176, 160 A. 22; Bogert, Handbook of the Law of Trusts, 430; 3 Pomeroy Equity Jurisprudence, 4th Ed., 1928,  975, p. 2117; 17 Columbia Law Review, 269, 289. We find no reason for departing from it.\n The challenged judgment must be reversed.\nREVERSED.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the judgment should be affirmed.\n Tax laws are neither contracts nor penal laws. The obligation to pay taxes arises from the unilateral action of government in the exercise of the most plenary of sovereign powers, that to raise revenue to defray the expenses of government and to distribute the burden among those who must bear it. See State of Alabama v. United States, 282 \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 434]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 502, 507, 51 S.Ct. 225. To that obligation are subject all rights of persons and property which enjoy the protection of the sovereign and are within the reach of its power.\n For centuries no principle of law has won more ready or universal acceptance. Even now that it is doubted, the doubt is rested on no more substantial foundation than want of 'jurisdiction' to tax, and the assertion that the Fourteenth Amendment is endowed with a newly discovered efficacy to forbid 'double taxation' when the sovereignty imposing the tax is that of two or more states. See Farmer's Loan & Trust Co. v. Minnesota, \n280 \nU.S. 204, 210\n, 50 S.Ct. 98, 65 A.L.R. 1000; Safe Deposit & Trust Co. v. Virginia, \n280 \nU.S. 83, 92\n, 50 S.Ct. 59, 67 A. L.R. 386; Baldwin v. Missouri, \n281 \nU.S. 586, 593\n, 50 S.Ct. 436, 72 A.L.R. 1303; compare Burnet v. Brooks, \n288 U.S. 378\n, 400 et seq., 53 S.Ct. 457, 86 A.L.R. 747. But as no opinion of this court has undertaken to define the taxation which is thus forbidden because it is double, or to declare that different legal rights founded upon the same economic interest may never, under any circumstances, be compelled to contribute to the cost of government of two states whose protection they respectively enjoy, it would seem still to be open to inquiry whether the particular tax now imposed infringes any constitutional principle capable of statement and definition.\n When we speak of the jurisdiction to tax land or a chattel as being exclusively in the state where it is located, we mean no more than that, in the ordinary case of ownership of tangible property, the legal interests of ownership enjoy the benefit and protection of the laws of that state alone, and that it alone can effectively reach the interests protected for the purpose of subjecting them to the payment of the tax. Other states are said to be without jurisdiction, and so without constitutional power to tax, if they afford no protection to the ownership of the property and cannot lay hold of any interest in the property in order to compel payment of the tax. See Union Refrigerator Tran- \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 435]\n\u00a0\n sit Co. v. Kentucky, \n199 \nU.S. 194, 195\n, 202 S., 26 S.Ct. 36, 4 Ann.Cas. 493; Frick v. Pennsylvania, \n268 \nU.S. 473, 497\n, 45 S.Ct. 603, 42 A.L.R. 316.\n But when new and different legal interests, however named, are created with respect to land or a chattel, of such a character that they do enjoy the benefits of the laws of another state and are brought within the reach of its taxing power, I know of no articulate principle of law or of the Fourteenth Amendment which would deny to the state the right to tax them. No one would doubt the constitutional power of a state to tax its residents on their shares of stock in a foreign corporation whose only property is real estate or chattels located elsewhere, Darnell v. Indiana, \n226 \nU.S. 390\n, 33 S.Ct. 120; Hawley v. City of Malden, \n232 \nU.S. 1\n, 34 S.Ct. 201, Ann. Cas. 1916C, 842; compare Corry v. Baltimore, \n196 \nU.S. 466\n, 25 S.Ct. 297; Kidd v. Alabama, \n188 \nU.S. 730\n, 23 S.Ct. 401; Cream of Wheat Co. v. County of Grand Forks, \n253 \nU.S. 325, 329\n, 40 S.Ct. 558, or to tax a valuable contract for the purchase of land or chattels located in another state, see Citizen's National Bank v. Durr, \n257 \nU.S. 99, 108\n, 42 S.Ct. 15; compare Gish v. Shaver, 140 Ky. 647, 650, 131 S.W. 515; Golden v. Munsinger, 91 Kan. 820, 823, 139 P. 379; City of Marquette v. Michigan Iron & Land Co., 132 Mich. 130, 92 N.W. 934, or to tax a mortgage of real estate located without the state even though the land affords the only source of payment, see Kirtland v. Hotchkiss, \n100 U.S. 491\n; compare Savings & Loan Society v. Multnomah County, \n169 \nU.S. 421\n, 18 S.Ct. 392; Bristol v. Washington County, \n177 \nU.S. 133\n, 20 S. Ct. 585. Each of these legal interests, it is true, finds its only economic source in the value of the land, and the rights which are elsewhere subjected to the tax can be brought to their ultimate economic fruition only through some means of control of the land itself. But the means of control may be subjected to taxation in the state of its owner, whether it be a share of stock or a contract or a mortgage. There is no want of jurisdiction to tax these interests where they are owned, in the sense that the state \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 436]\n\u00a0\n lacks power to appropriate them to the payment of the tax. No court has condemned such action as capricious, arbitrary, or oppressive. The Fourteenth Amendment does not forbid it, for it is universally recognized that these interests of themselves are in some measure clothed with the legal incidents of property in the taxing state and enjoy there the benefit and protection of its laws.\n Similarly, I do not doubt that a state may tax the income of its citizen derived from land in another state. The right to impose the tax is founded upon the power to exact it, coupled with the protection which the state affords to the taxpayer in the receipt and enjoyment of his income. Lawrence v. State Tax Commission of Mississippi, \n286 \nU.S. 276, 279\n, 52 S. Ct. 556. I can perceive no more constitutional objection to imposing such a tax than to the taxation of a citizen on income derived from a business carried on by the taxpayer in another state, and subject to taxation there, which we upheld in Lawrence v. State Tax Commission, supra; see Cook v. Tait, \n265 \nU.S. 47\n, 44 S.Ct. 444, or to the tax on income derived from securities having a tax situs in another state, upheld in Maguire v. Trefry, \n253 \nU.S. 12\n, 40 S.Ct. 417; see, also, Fidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Louisville, \n245 \nU.S. 54\n, 38 S.Ct. 40, L.R.A. 1918C, 124; compare DeGanay v. Lederer, \n250 \nU.S. 376\n, 39 S.Ct. 524. The fact that it is now thought by the court to be necessary to discredit or overrule Maguire v. Trefry, supra, in order to overturn the tax imposed here, should lead us to doubt the result, rather than the authority which plainly challenges it, and should give us pause before reading into the Fourteenth Amendment so serious and novel a restriction on the vital elements of the taxing power.\n The present tax, measured by income, is upon intangible property interests owned by a citizen of Ohio. They are represented by transferable certificates, issued, by trustees of land, under contracts by which each trustee undertakes to hold the title of specified lands in trust for the benefit of the certificate holders; to receive the income and to \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 437]\n\u00a0\n pay it over to them ratably, after meeting expenses and depreciation; and to receive and distribute ratably the proceeds of sale of the land if sold under existing options. In the event of default by the lessee, the trustee is given plenary authority to terminate the lease, take possession of the land and sell it, as fully as though it were the sole legal and equitable owner. The trustee is authorized to settle claims upon contract and tort made against the trustee or the trust estate, and is entitled to indemnity from the estate for all personal liability and expenses. It is authorized to borrow money and to give the trust estate as security.\n The beneficiaries have no right to possession or to partition of the property, and can maintain no action at law with respect to it. They cannot be assessed, and incur no liability by virtue of the administration of the trust estate. The trust certificates are freely transferable, as are shares of stock in a corporation. The rights of the beneficiaries are so identified with the certificates that they may be transferred only on surrender of the certificate to the trustee. Certificates lost, stolen, or destroyed may be replaced by the trustee at its option and in its discretion. Compare Selliger v. Kentucky, \n213 \nU.S. 200, 206\n, 29 S.Ct. 449.\n There is thus created an active trust of land, under which the trustee is clothed with all the incidents of legal ownership, and which is given the status of a business entity separate the distinct, for all practical purposes, from the interests of the certificate holders. See Crocker v. Malley, \n249 \nU.S. 223\n, 39 S.Ct. 270, 2 A.L.R. 1601; Hecht v. Malley, \n265 \nU.S. 144, 161\n, 44 S.Ct. 462; Burk- Waggoner Oil Association v. Hopkins, \n269 \nU.S. 110\n, 46 S.Ct. 48. The beneficiaries have none of the incidents of legal ownership. They can neither take nor defend possession of the land. But they are clothed with rights in personam, in form both contractual and equitable, enforceable against the trustee by suit in equity for an accounting, to compel performance of the trust or to restrain breaches of it. \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 438]\n\u00a0\n Such actions are transitory and maintainable wherever the trustee may be found. Massie v. Watts, 6 Cranch, 148, 158-160; Beattie v. Johnstone, 8 Hare 169, 177; Gardner v. Ogden, 22 N.Y. 327, 333-339, 78 Am. Dec. 192.\n The owner of the certificates in Ohio is thus vested with valuable rights, differing from those of ordinary ownership, including those enforceable against the trustee within as well as without the state. They are brought within the control of the state. These rights, the physical certificates with which they are identified, and the receipt and enjoyment of their income by the owner, are each protected by Ohio laws. If we look to substance rather than form, to the principles which underlie and justify the taxing power, rather than to descriptive terminology which, merely as a matter of convenience, we may apply to the interest taxed, it would seem to be as much subject to the taxing power as any other intangible interest brought within the control and protection of the state, even though its ultimate economic enjoyment may be dependent wholly on property located and taxed elsewhere. See Citizens' National Bank v. Durr, supra; Maguire v. Trefry, supra, \n253 \nU.S. 12, 16\n, 40 S.Ct. 417.\n It is unimportant what labels writers on legal theory, the courts of Ohio, or this court may place upon this interest. The Fourteenth Amendment did not adopt as ultimate verities the quaint distinctions taken three centuries ago by Sir Edward Coke between things that savour of the realty and other forms of right, and between corporeal and incorporeal rights. In applying the Fourteenth Amendment we may recognize, what he failed to realize, that all rights are incorporeal, and that whether they are rightly subjected to state taxing power must be determined by recourse to the principles upon which taxes have universally been laid and collected, rather than by the choice of a label which, by definition previously agreed upon, will infallibly mark the interest as nontaxable. \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 439]\n\u00a0\n In every practical aspect-and taxation is a practical matter-the trust certificate holder stands in the same relationship to the land as the stockholder of a landowning corporation. It is not denied that the petitioner receives as much benefit and protection from the state of Ohio with respect to his certificates as does the owner of corporate stock, or that his interest is as much within the reach of the state power. Only by resort to subtle refinements of legal doctrine, devised without reference to the problems of taxation and irrelevant to them, or by treating the Fourteenth Amendment as an instrument for giving effect to our own peculiar convictions of what is morally or economically desirable, is it possible to sustain the taxation of the one and not the other.\n Even though the tax be destroyed so far as it is imposed on petitioner's interest in the trusts of lands outside of Ohio, it cannot, for any reason advanced to support that conclusion, be deemed invalid as applied to appellant's interest in the Ohio trusts. The opinion of the court suggests no other reason.\n Whatever name we may give to the interest taxed, Ohio is not without jurisdiction of the land, the trustee, the certificates, or the owners of them. All are within the state. The objection to double taxation by a single sovereign is no more potent under the Fourteenth Amendment than the objection that a tax otherwise valid has been doubled. See Carley & Hamilton v. Snook, \n281 \nU.S. 66, 72\n, 50 S.Ct. 204, 68 A.L.R. 194; Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40\n, 54 S.Ct. 599. The imposition of a tax on a particular interest in land already taxed ad valorem does not infringe any constitutional immunity. Swiss Oil Corporation v. Shanks, \n273 \nU.S. 407, 413\n, 47 S.Ct. 393, and cases cited.\n The fact that the certificates are taxed, and the owners of interests in trusts of land not represented by certificates are untaxed, plainly involves no forbidden discrimi- \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 440]\n\u00a0\n nation. The owners of transferable certificates, representing an equitable interest in a trust of land divided into shares, enjoy privileges and advantages not attaching to other forms of ownership, which are an adequate basis for a difference in taxation. See Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 121\n, 30 S.Ct. 496; Bell's Gap R. Co. v. Pennsylvania, \n134 \nU.S. 232, 237\n, 10 S.Ct. 533; Home Insurance Co. v. New York, \n134 \nU.S. 594, 606\n, 10 S.Ct. 593; Brown-Forman Co. v. Kentucky, \n217 \nU.S. 563, 572\n, 30 S.Ct. 578; State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527, 537\n, 51 S. Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464.\n The judgment now given cannot rest on the Delphic concession of counsel, that the state has 'no power to tax land or interests in land situate beyond its borders,' and that, if situate within the state, there is no power to tax them 'in any other manner than by uniform rule according to value.' The concession, so far as it relates to the Ohio trusts, plainly has reference to requirements of the state and not the federal Constitution. For the Fourteenth Amendment does not restrict a state to the taxation of all interests in land uniformly according to value.\n We are not concerned with the validity of the tax under the state Constitution. The state court has plenary power to settle that question for the litigants and for us, Withers v. Buckley, 20 How. 84, 89; Pennsylvania College Cases, 13 Wall. 190, 212; Walker v. Sauvinet, \n92 U.S. 90\n; Southwestern Oil Co. v. Texas, supra, \n217 \nU.S. 114, 119\n, 30 S.Ct. 496, as it has done by sustaining the tax. No concession of counsel about his theory of the law requires us to adopt his theory, however mistaken and irrelevant, for decision of the federal question which is alone before us. None can confer on us jurisdiction to review on appeal the decision of a state question by the highest court of the state, or excuse the abuse of power involved in our reversing its judgment on state grounds.\n The objections to the tax affecting the Ohio trusts present no substantial federal question, or any which the \n\n[295 U.S. 422, 441]\n\u00a0\n court has deemed it necessary to consider. The tax affecting the extrastate trusts should be sustained as not infringing any constitutional guarantee.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] By Act of June 29, 1931 (114 Ohio Laws p. 714) providing for levy of taxes on intangible property etc., the Ohio General Assembly amended sections 5323, 5324, 5325, 5326, 5327, 5328, 5360, 5382, 5385, 5386, 5388, 5389 of the General Code and added supplemental sections 5325-1, 5328-1, and 5328-2. \n[\nFootnote 2\n]  5388.

CORP. v. WESTCHESTER SERVICE CORP.(1935)\nNo. 211\nArgued: December 7, 1934Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Alfred B. Nathan and George C. Levin, both of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. Ernest E. Wheeler, of New York City, for respondent. \n\n[293 U.S. 449, 450]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This action was brought by the Shanferoke Coal & Supply Corporation, a citizen of Delaware, in the federal court for Southern New York against the Westchester Service Corporation, a citizen of the latter state. The declaration alleged that the defendant had by a contract in writing agreed to purchase from the plaintiff a large quantity of coal to be taken in installments throughout a period of years, and that the defendant had, after accepting part of the coal, repudiated the contract. The defendant set up in its answer, as a special defense, that prior to the commencement of the action a dispute had arisen concerning the construction of the contract, the rights and duties of the respective parties thereunder, and its performance, that the contract contained an arbitration clause, and that prior to the commencement of the action the defendant had notified the plaintiff of its readiness and willingness to submit the dispute to arbitration and ever since had been ready and willing to do so, but that the plaintiff had refused to proceed with the arbitration. The defendant then moved that the action, and all proceedings therein, be stayted until an arbitration should be had in accordance with the terms of the contract sued on. The motion was heard on affidavits and counter affidavits.\n The arbitration clause is as follows:\n'In case any dispute should arise between the Buyer and Seller as to the performance of any of the terms of this agreement, such dispute shall be arbitrated and the cost thereof shall be borne equally by both parties. The Buyer and the Seller shall each appoint one arbitrator and the two arbitrators so appointed shall select a third arbitrator and the decision of a majority of the three arbitrators shall be final and conclusive on both parties. \n\n[293 U.S. 449, 451]\n\u00a0\n In case for any reason any such arbitration shall fail to proceed to a final award, either party may apply to the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order compelling the specific performance of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the arbitration laws of the State of New York.'\n\n The District Court interpreted the clause as making the arbitration enforceable only in state courts of New York; and on that ground denied the stay. On an appeal from the order of denial, the Court of Appeals held that, even if the clause should be so interpreted, section 3 of the United States Arbitration Act (9 USCA  3) authorized the stay. \n1\n It therefore reversed the order and directed the District Court to grant the stay, with leave to that court 'to vacate it at any time, should it appear that the defendant is in default in proceeding with the arbitration.' 70 F.(2d) 297, 299. This Court granted certiorari \n293 \nU.S. 541\n, 55 S.Ct. 95, 79 L.Ed. --.\n First. The order of the District Court denying the stay was not a final judgment appealable under section 128 of the Judicial Code, as amended (28 USCA  225). Being an interlocutory order, it was appealable to the Circuit Court of Appeals under section 129, as amended (28 USCA  227), only if the denial of the stay should be deemed the denial of an injunction. Compare General Electric Co. v. Marvel Co., \n287 \nU.S. 430, 432\n, 53 S.Ct. 202. That question we must first determine, although it was not raised below or by counsel here. See Mansfield, etc., Ry.

New York Life Insurance Co., \n293 \nU.S. 379\n, 55 S.Ct. 310, decided this day, an order granting or denying a stay based on an equitable defense or cross-bill interposed in an action at law under section 274b ( 28 USCA  398) is appealable under section 129, as amended (28 USCA  227). We are of the opinion that the special defense setting up the arbitration agreement is an equitable defense or cross-bill within the meaning of section 274b, and that the motion for a stay is an application for an interlocutory injunction based on the special defense. Compare Red Cross Line v. Atlantic Fruit Co., \n264 \nU.S. 109, 121\n, 44 S.Ct. 274. As bearing on this question of jurisdiction on appeal it is immaterial whether or not the terms of the contract sued on would preclude entry in a federal court of a decree for specific performance of the arbitration. Since the appeal here in question was taken within thirty days from the entry of the order denying the stay, the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction under section 129, as amended (28 USCA  227).\n Second. The plaintiff contends that the District Court was without power to grant the stay, because the contract provides that arbitration can be compelled only by proceedings in a state court of New York. The provision is that 'either party may apply to the Supreme Court of the State of New York for an order compelling specific performance of this arbitration agreement in accordance with the arbitration law of the State of New York.' The contract does not in terms prohibit proceedings in the federal court. Whether it should be construed so as to exclude the bringing of a suit in the federal court to compel specific performance of the agreement to arbitrate, we have no occasion to decide. For the District Court was not asked, in the proceedings now under review, to compel specific performance. The motion was to stay the action until arbitration shall have been had; and the direction of the Court of Appeals was limited to granting a stay. Section 3 of the United States Arbitra- \n\n[293 U.S. 449, 453]\n\u00a0\n tion Act (9 USCA  3) provides broadly that the court may 'stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement.' We think the Court of Appeals was clearly right in concluding that there is no reason to imply that the power to grant a stay is conditioned upon the existence of power to compel arbitration in accordance with section 4 of the act (9 USCA  4).2 Marine Transit Co. v. Dreyfus, \n284 \nU.S. 263, 274\n, 52 S.Ct. 166, is not to the contrary. There is, no the other hand, strong reason for construing the clause as permitting the federal court to order a stay even when it cannot compel the arbitration. For otherwise, despite congressional approval of arbitration, it would be impossible to secure a stay of an action in the federal courts when the arbitration agreement provides for compulsory proceedings exclusively in the state courts, since only in exceptional circumstances may a state court enjoin proceedings begun in a federal court. See Central National Bank v. Stevens, \n169 \nU.S. 432\n, 18 S.Ct. 403. Compare section 265 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  379); Kline v. Burke Construction Co., \n260 \nU.S. 226\n, 43 S.Ct. 79, 24 A.L.R. 1077\n\n\n Third. The plaintiff also contends that the defendant was not entitled to a stay because its answer raised no arbitrable issues, and because, on the facts developed by the affidavits, the defendant appears to have waived its rights under the arbitration clause by unreasonable delay \n\n[293 U.S. 449, 454]\n\u00a0\n in demanding arbitration. The reasons why these contentions are without merit are sufficiently stated in the opinion of the Court of Appeals.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Act of February 12, 1925, c. 213,  3, 43 Stat. 883 (9 USCA  3): 'If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] In the lower federal courts there has been some difference of opinion as the whether a stay should be granted when the court is not in a position to compel arbitration.

SNOW(1935)\nNo. 102\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 1, 2]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Newton D. Baker, of Cleveland, Ohio, Albert L. Ely, of Akron, Ohio, and Amasa C. Paul, of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ralph E. Williamson, of Minneapolis, Minn., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Certiorari was granted, \n293 \nU.S. 537\n, 55 S.Ct. 78, 79 L.Ed. --, to review a decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 70 F.(2d) 564, which reversed the decree of the District Court and held valid, but not infringed, the first claim of the Smith patent, No. 1,262,860, of April 16, 1918, for an improved apparatus and method for the incubation of eggs. \n1\n The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held the same claim valid and infringed in Waxham v. Smith, 70 F.(2d) 457, in which case certiorari was also granted, \n294 \nU.S. 20\n, 55 S.Ct. 277. The question thus presented is one of the scope of the claim.\n Only so much of the patent as relates to a method for incubation is now involved. Correct appreciation of the contentions made requires a brief exposition of the well-known phenomena which attend the incubation of eggs under natural conditions.\n The period for hatching eggs of the domestic hen is twenty-one days. The eggs are cold at the beginning of the period of incubation, although at that time generation has already progressed slightly. Continuation of this process and successful incubation depend upon the \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 4]\n\u00a0\n application of heat to the eggs, and the maintenance of their temperature at not less than body heat, about 100 F., and not more than 105 F. Any substantial divergence from this range of temperature results in deterioration or death of the embryo, and consequent failure of the hatching process. If the temperature is maintained within this range, the eggs during the first ten days of the period absorb heat required to generate and maintain the life of the embryo. The eggs are then said to be endothermic or heat absorbing. From the eleventh day until the end of the period the embryo has developed to a point at which the egg generates more heat than is needed to keep the embryo alive. They are then said to be exothermic. From that time on the excess heat is given off to the surrounding air or to objects in contact with the eggs, if at a lower temperature than the eggs.\n The development of heat accompanies the oxidation of food elements within the egg, in consequence of which it gives off carbon dioxide during the period of incubation and absorbs oxygen from the external air, both of which pass through the shell of the egg and its lining membrane. During the period of incubation there is also gradual evaporation of moisture from the egg, which tends to reduce its temperature slightly. The best results are obtained if the total evaporation during incubation does not exceed about 15 per cent. Evaporation in excess of that amount affects the embryo adversely; the chick when hatched being undeveloped and lacking normal strength.\n Successful artificial incubation therefore involves conformity to three principal requisites: The maintenance of proper temperature during the period of incubation, the prevention of excessive evaporation of moisture, and the supply of an adequate amount of oxygen, which involves also the removal from the incubator of the carbon dioxide which results from oxidation of the contents of the egg. \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n The artificial incubation of eggs is an ancient art. It appears to have been known to the Egyptians two thousand years ago, and for a comparable period to the Chinese. Until Smith, the patentee, carried on his experiments, the effort had been generally to reproduce as nearly as practicable the natural conditions of incubation. In practice eggs, in relatively small numbers, seldom more than 300, and usually less, were placed, on the same level, in a cabinet with heating means above the eggs, so that the temperature above the eggs was maintained at a higher point, about 103 F., than that below. To secure the requisite exposure of the eggs to the higher temperature, it was necessary, in the course of incubation, to turn the eggs frequently, as is done by the hen in nature. Provision was made for supplying fresh air to the cabinet and for humidifying the air within the cabinet. All incubators were of the still air type; that is to say, the only movement of air within the incubator was that caused by variations of temperature at different points within the cabinet, resulting in some transmission of heat by radiation or convection. The opinion seems to have prevailed that the presence of currents of air either within or surrounding the cabinet was harmful. Successful operation of this method required nice adjustments of the heating means so as to avoid overheating as the eggs passed into the more advanced stages of incubation, reaching their highest temperature about the seventeenth day.\n Smith, conceived the idea, embodied in his patent, of setting the eggs in staged incubation within the cabinet and applying to them, in convenient arrangement for that purpose, a current of heated air, propelled by means other than convection. Staged incubation is the successive setting of eggs in the same cabinet at brief intervals, of about three days. At the twenty-first day there would thus be several settings of eggs in the incubator, each at a different stage of incubation, part in the endothermic \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n stage and part in the exothermic. Smith arranged the egg trays or racks in tiers, so that air could be freely circulated among the eggs. He subjected them to a continuous current of air of the requisite constant temperature of about 100 F., propelled by a fan so that it would circulate freely and repeatedly throughout the cabinet. The heat of the eggs in the later stages of incubation was thus carried by the circulating air of lower temperature to the cooler eggs, in the earlier stages, so that there was a continuous tendency to equalize the temperature throughout the cabinet at approximately the temperature of the introduced current of air.\n Before Smith there had been efforts to set eggs in staged incubation, but without practical success, because of the difficulties of securing adequate heat distribution within the incubator. He was the first to apply mechanically circulated currents of air to eggs so arranged. He followed this procedure in conjunction with the use of a restricted opening for the elimination of foul air. By this combination the difference in temperature of the eggs was equalized within the desired range throughout the incubator during the period of incubation, the air within the incubator was gradually replaced by fresh air, and the moisture of the eggs was conserved. His method thus solved the major problems of artificial incubation in a highly efficient manner. It was novel and involved invention. See The Barbed Wire Patent Case, \n143 \nU.S. 275, 283\n, 12 S.Ct. 443; Krementz v. S. Cottle Co., \n148 \nU.S. 556, 559\n, 560 S., 13 S. Ct. 719.\n That it was invention is not seriously disputed here, and of the many courts which have passed on the patent none has denied its validity. The new method had certain marked advantages over earlier ones. It was possible to carry on the process of incubation continuously by placing fresh eggs in the incubator at intervals, as those of the most advanced stage hatched and the new-born chicks were removed. It was possible to apply \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n heated air to the eggs at a constant temperature, thus avoiding the necessity of varying by nice adjustments the temperature of the applied air, so as to conform to the varying temperatures of the eggs as they passed through successive stages of incubation. As the egg racks or trays could be placed in tiers, instead of on a single level, it was possible to arrange them more compactly and greatly increase the number of eggs in a single incubator. Before staged incubation, as developed by Smith, it had not been practicable to operate incubators of a capacity of more than about 300 eggs. By use of the new method, it is possible to operate successfully an incubator containing as many as 52,000 eggs, and the percentage of eggs successfully hatched by artificial incubation has been materially raised.\n The commercial success of the new method was immediate and striking. At first the inventor devoted himself to developing his own hatchery for the use of the new method; it was the largest in existence, with a capacity of over 1,000,000 eggs. In 1922 he began the manufacture and sale of the new incubator.\n In ten years he, and a corporation which he had organized for the purpose, had made sales of incubators aggregating about $24,000,000, having a total egg capacity of over 188,000,000. The old type of incubation, with eggs arranged at a single level, all in a single stage of incubation, has thus become obsolete.\n That the method employed in the Smith type of incubator was novel and revolutionary in the industry is not challenged. The question presented here is, What scope may rightly be given to claim 1 of the patent; whether the petitioner has drafted it in such form as to secure the fruits of his invention? Claim 1 reads as follows:\n'1. The method of hatching a plurality of eggs by arranging them at different levels in a closed chamber having restricted openings of sufficient capacity for the escape \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n of foul air without undue loss of moisture and applying a current of heated air, said current being created by means other than variations of temperature and of sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature, whereby the air will be vitalized, the moisture conserved and the units of heat will be carried from the eggs in the more advanced stage of incubation to those in a less advanced stage for the purpose specified.'\n\n It will be observed that the claim, standing by itself, asserts the essential elements of the method of incubation to be: (a) The arrangement of the eggs at different levels in staged incubation in a closed chamber, having restricted openings of sufficient capacity for the escape of foul air without undue loss of moisture; (b) the application to the eggs of heated air in a current created by means other than variation of temperature; and (c) as marking the boundaries of the claim, the current of air is to be of sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse, and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature whereby the air will be vitalized, moisture conserved, and the units of heat carried from the eggs in the more advanced stage to those in the less advanced.\n To avoid petitioner's charge of infringement, two main contentions are pressed by respondents: First, that claim 1 is restricted to an arrangement of the eggs in such order with respect to the direction of the propelled current of heated air that it will first come in contact with the more advanced eggs. Thus construed, respondents do not infringe, as concededly the movement of air within their incubator does not pass to the eggs in staged incubation in any particular order. Second, that the movement of air in respondents' incubator, produced by the agitating action of fans or propellers, does not result in 'a current of air' traveling in a constant predestined path within the meaning of claim 1. In passing upon these conten- \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n tions it is necessary to ascertain the proper scope of claim 1 and to determine whether the characteristic features of respondents' incubator come within its scope. Respondents maintain that the claim is restricted in its scope in the manner indicated above (a) by the disclosures of the patent itself; (b) by the prior art, including the patentee Smith's own prior public usage; and (c) by estoppels arising from the file wrapper record of the patent.\n\n 1. \nThe court below rested its decision on its interpretation of claim 1, read in the light of the disclosures of the patent, as restricting the patented method to a particular arrangement of the eggs, whereby the current of heated air, after being introduced into the cabinet, first comes in contact with the eggs in the most advanced stage of incubation. It reached this conclusion by comparison of that part of the claim, which speaks of the units of heat as being 'carried from the eggs in the more advanced stage of incubation to those in a less advanced stage,' with the specifications, which disclose an arrangement of the eggs such that the introduced current of heated air first passes to the more advanced eggs. As respondents' incubators have no such arrangement of the eggs, and as in consequence the forced draft of heated air does not reach the eggs in any particular order, the court held that the respondents do not infringe claim 1.\n The patentee, obedient to the command of the statute (Rev. St.  4888 ( 35 USCA  33)), gave such description of the manner of using his discovery as would enable others skilled in the art to use it. The specifications first describe generally the method by which the eggs in staged incubation are arranged in tiers and subjected to forced circulation of heated air through the incubating chamber. The patent states: 'The temperature of circulating air should be such as will prevent the eggs in the early stage of incubation from falling below 100 and the speed or velocity of the circulating air should be such as to carry the heat \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n away from the eggs in the later stage of incubation and thereby hold the temperature of those eggs at 105 or slightly below that. It is manifest that the temperature will remain practically the same throughout the column of eggs, but the air is impelled with sufficient velocity to carry the heat away from the eggs which happen to be in the advanced stage of incubation.' The drawings and specifications show the eggs arranged in tiers on either side of the chamber, with an open space or corridor between, at the top of which a revolving fan forces the air downward in the open space of the corridor. Above the fan is a valve-controlled air intake for the introduction of fresh air, and above the trays of eggs on either side are shown 'outlets for the release of foul air ... of such restricted capacity as to prevent the undue escape of moisture.'\n It is true that drawings and specifications indicate a particular arrangement of the eggs from the top to the bottom of the tiers of trays, according to the stage of the incubating process, the eggs being arranged progressively from the least advanced, placed at the top, to the most advanced, placed at the bottom of the tiers. They indicate also that, as the eggs most advanced are hatched, they are to be replaced by moving downward the trays containing the several successive settings of eggs which are in earlier stages of incubation. They also speak of a 'column' of air of such speed as to keep the temperature substantially uniform, and show curtains hanging from the top of the chamber covering the ends of the trays on either side of the corridor and extending to a point a short distance above the floor.\n With this arrangement the air would be propelled downward to the floor of the chamber, gaining access to the eggs by passing beneath the ends of the curtains to the trays of eggs at the bottom of the tiers. So much of the air as was introduced through the intake would thus reach \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n the more advanced eggs first. It would then be deflected upward through the egg trays to the top of the chamber, and so much of it as did not pass out through the restricted capacity outlets located at the top of the tiers of trays would be returned to the fan to be propelled again through the described circuit.\n We may take it that, as the statute requires, the specifications just detailed show a way of using the inventor's method, and that he conceived that particular way described was the best one. But he is not confined to that particular mode of use, since the claims of the patent, not its specifications, measure the invention. Paper Bag Patent Case, \n210 \nU.S. 405, 419\n, 28 S.Ct. 748; McCarty v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., \n160 \nU.S. 110, 116\n, 16 S.Ct. 240; Winans v. Denmead, 15 How. 330, 343. While the claims of a patent may incorporate the specifications or drawings by reference, see Snow v. Lake Shore & M. S. Railroad Company, \n121 \nU.S. 617, 630\n, 7 S.Ct. 1343, and thus limit the patent to the form described in the specifications, it is not necessary to embrace in the claims or describe in the specifications all possible forms in which the claimed principle may be reduced to practice. It is enough that the principle claimed is exemplified by a written description of it and of the manner of using it 'in such full, clear, concise, and exact terms' as will enable one 'skilled in the art to make, construct, compound and use the same.'\n Here the specifications showed an arrangement of the eggs and a means of guiding the current of air so that it would reach the most advanced eggs first. But neither the arrangement nor the means of guiding the current of air are requisite to the application of the principle which Smith discovered and claimed. Without either, the heated air may be given, as claim 1 prescribes, 'sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature whereby ... the units of heat will be carried \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n from the eggs in the more advanced stage of incubation to those in a less advanced stage.' Claim 1 made no mention of curtains or any column of air or means of guiding the current of air, and the inventor made no claim for any particular arrangement of the eggs, except that they should be at different levels. Moreover, while the specifications and drawings show a particular arrangement of the eggs and a particular direction of the current, nowhere, in specifications or claim, is it stated either that the direction of the current is material or, what is the equivalent, that the order in which it reaches the eggs is material.\n Only by resort to the assumption that heat units could not be carried from the more advanced to the cooler and less advanced eggs, unless the initially introduced air first came in contact with the more advanced, is it possible to support the conclusion of the court below and read the claim as calling for a particular arrangement which would enable the air current to reach the advanced eggs first. Such, of course, would be the case only if the current of air were to make a single circuit, and either remain at its end in contact with the cooler eggs or pass out of the incubator altogether. Neither occurs in petitioner's machine, and there is no reason to suppose that either would produce the desired equalization of temperature. The specifications and claim both contemplate a continuous circulation of the current of heated air through the chamber, which, regardless of its direction, would continuously operate, by repeated contacts with the eggs in all stages, to equalize the temperature throughout the chamber by carrying heat units from the warmer to the cooler eggs.\n The claim conforms to the specifications in prescribing 'restricted openings of sufficient capacity for the escape of foul air without undue loss of moisture.' The amount of foul air allowed to escape through the outlet of restricted capacity necessarily controls the amount of \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n air taken in. In petitioner's commercial machines, regulated to produce the prescribed result in air vitalization and conservation of moisture, the interchange of foul air for fresh is from 1\/2 to 1 per cent. to 3 per cent. of the air content for each complete circuit of the chamber. This means that the air content of the chamber must make the circuit many times, theoretically from 33 to 200, before an equal volume of fresh air would be drawn in through the intake. Such continuous circulation of the air at constant temperature, lower than that of the more advanced eggs and higher than that of the less advanced, tends to produce the equalization of the temperature of the eggs by flow of heat units from the warmer eggs to the cooler, regardless of the direction of the current in the circuit, and regardless of the particular stage of the eggs which it reaches first. With other factors constant, the efficiency of this equalization process would depend upon the velocity of the current. The statement of claim 1 is that the current of air is to be 'of sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature.' The specifications state: 'It is obvious that the fans can be so arranged and can be operated at such speed as to cause the hot air to circulate fast enough to keep the temperature throughout the chamber between the limits of 100 and 105 .'\n It is evident that claim 1 does not prescribe that the current of air shall be propelled by any particular means, except that it shall be by means other than variation of temperature, nor does it prescribe that the means of propulsion shall be given any particular location, or that the current of air shall be guided by any particular means or given any particular direction. The omission of these requirements from claim 1 is the more pointed as the other claims of the patent speak in particular of a power-driven fan, of the location of the fan, of curtains and a partition obviously intended to give direction to the cur- \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n rent of air, of a vertically directed current of air, and of air circulating from the bottom of the chamber into the parts of it occupied by the tiers of egg trays. Thus by striking and obviously intended contrast with other claims, claim 1 covers broadly the assential elements of the Smith invention as we have already described it. Symington Co. v. National Malleable Castings Co., \n250 \nU.S. 383, 385\n, 39 S.Ct. 542; Lamson Consolidated Store Service Co. v. Hillman, 123 F. 416, 419 (C. C.A.7th); Wm. B. Scaife & Sons Co. v. Falls City Woolen Mills, 209 F. 210, 214 (C.C.A.6th).\n Examination of the claim, in the light both of scientific fact and of the particular form in which the petitioner reduced the claim to practice as described in the specifications, makes it plain that the claim does not call for a particular order or arrangement of the eggs in staged incubation in the incubator, or that the propelled current should reach them in any particular order, or that it should be guided, controlled, or directed by any particular means, or in any particular manner other than that it should be of sufficient velocity to produce the results prescribed by the claim. If the matter were doubtful, it is plain from what has been said that the character of the patent and its commercial and practical success are such as to entitle the inventor to broad claims and to a liberal construction of those which he has made. Morley Sewing Machine Co. v. Lancaster, \n129 U.S. 263\n, 273-277, 9 S.Ct. 299; Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota & O. Paper Company, \n261 \nU.S. 45, 63\n, 43 S.Ct. 322; Winans v. Denmead, supra, 341 of 15 How.. In such circumstances, if the claim were fairly susceptible of two constructions, that should be adopted which will secure to the patentee his actual invention, rather than to adopt a construction fatal to the grant, Keystone Manufacturing Co. v. Adams, \n151 \nU.S. 139, 144\n, 145 S., 14 S. Ct. 295; McClain v. Ortmayer, \n141 \nU.S. 419, 425\n, 12 S.Ct. 76.\n\n 2. \nWe find nothing in the file wrapper defense to disturb our conclusion as to the correct interpretation of claim 1. It is a familiar rule that a patentee cannot \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n broaden his claim by dropping from it an element which he was compelled to add in order to secure his patent. I. T. S. Rubber Co. v. Essex Rubber Co., \n272 \nU.S. 429, 443\n, 47 S.Ct. 136; Smith v. Magic City Kennel Club, \n282 \nU.S. 784, 789\n, 790 S., 51 S.Ct. 291. But the file wrapper lends no support for the application of this rule to petitioner's claim 1.\n The history of Smith's application in the Patent Office is a long one. Four groups of method claims were successively presented to the Patent Office, and three were successively rejected. The fourth group ultimately matured into claims 1, 2 and 3 of the patent. It suffices to say that claims 1 and 25 of the first group claimed broadly, 'The method of hatching eggs by arranging the eggs in a column and applying heated air forced about the eggs, the heated air being adapted to the eggs in various stages of incubation,' and 'The method of hatching eggs by arranging the eggs in a column one above the other and forcing heated air through said column.' In due course the broad claims thus asserted were modified and narrowed by the inclusion of new elements, until they appeared in the form of claim 1 of the patent. But, as we have seen, none of these additions involve any particular order of arrangement of the eggs or any particular direction or control of the air current, except that the current is to be 'of sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature.'\n It is an illuminating fact that the entire written argument filed in support of claim 1, as it was finally presented to the Patent Office and allowed, makes no reference to any order or arrangement of the eggs, or to shifting the location of the eggs in the incubator, no reference to the location of the fan, the direction of the air current, or to curtains or partitions. The features emphasized were the superiority, over drafts caused by variations of temperature, of 'current produced by mechanical \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n means' applied to eggs in staged incubation arranged at different levels, the conservation of moisture, and the elimination of foul air by the restricted air outlets, all features of claim 1 which are characteristic of both petitioner's and respondents' incubators. We find nothing in the file wrapper to suggest that any addition was made to claim 1 to restrict the patent to any particular order of arrangement of the eggs or any particular direction or means of control of the current of air, other than its velocity, and nothing to estop the patentee from asserting that the claim is not restricted by such features. See Baltzley v. Spengler Loomis Mfg. Co., 262 F. 423, 426 (C.C.A.2d); National Hollow B.-B. Co. v. Interchangeable B.-B. Co., 106 F. 693, 714 (C.C.A.8th). It is of no moment that in the course of the proceedings in the Patent Office the rejection of narrow claims was followed by the allowance of the broader claim 1. Westing-house Electric & Mfg. Co. v. Condit Electrical Mfg. Co., 194 F. 427, 430 (C.C.A.2d).\n\n 3. \nClaim 1 is not limited by the prior art. It is urged that there was disclosure by Smith by public use more than two years before his application for the patent. At the time indicated he used commercially an incubator arranged in three completely separated compartments in each of which there was circulation of the air by a fan. But there was no staged incubation in any single compartment.\n The German patent, Stulik, No. 155,917, issued in 1901, disclosed the arrangement of trays of eggs in staged incubation in an inclosed column or stack, with the endothermic eggs at the bottom. The eggs were subjected to a rising column of heated air, which was allowed to escape at the top of the chimney. There was no forced draft of air, no circulation or re- circulation of air, and in consequence no carrying of heat units from the more advanced eggs at the top to the less advanced eggs at the bottom. \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n Other patents named, as Winkler, No. 286,756, of 1883, and Zimmer, No. 1,075,747, of 1913, show types of staged incubation, but made no use of a current of air propelled by means other than variations of temperature, and in other respects were so plainly impractical as to call for no extended discussion. This is true also of the description in the 1867 edition of Ure's Dictionary, 652, 653, said to represent a method of incubation devised in 1777 by Bonnemain, a Frenchman, and not used since the French Revolution, by which eggs in staged incubation were placed in a closed room heated by hot-water pipes, but without other means of producing currents of air. Such rudimentary experiments with isolated elements of Smith's combination did not anticipate his invention. See Smith & Griggs Mfg. Co. v. Sprague, \n123 \nU.S. 249, 255\n, 8 S.Ct. 122.\n Other patents are cited showing varying types of incubators in which the eggs were placed at different levels, but in which the circulation of air through the incubating chamber by means other than variations in temperature is wanting. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n The Proctor & Knowles patent, No. 426,321 of 1890, and the Schwartz patent, No. 535,175 of 1895, for methods and apparatus for conditioning tobacco and other materials, as well as other procedures for ventilation, are so remote from the problems and procedure for hatching eggs as to call for no comment.\n This history of the prior art serves to emphasize rather than to discredit the striking advance made by Smith in effecting the combination defined in claim 1. More than the skill of the art was involved in combining and adjusting its elements in such fashion as to solve the major prob- \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n lems of artificial incubation. The prior art discloses no application of a continuously circulating current of air to eggs in staged incubation which would restrict claim 1 with respect either to the arrangement of the eggs or the direction or control of the current of air.\n\n 4. \nThere remains the question of infringement. The respondents' machine exhibits a closed chamber, with restricted outlet for the escape of foul air and an intake for fresh air, with eggs arranged at different levels in staged incubation, with a fan-impelled movement of air which circulates and recirculates throughout the chamber. The air moves over and about the eggs, carrying the units of heat from the warmer to the cooler eggs, maintains a substantially uniform temperature throughout the chamber, vitalizes the air and conserves moisture.\n As claim 1 of petitioner's patent is not restricted to any particular order in which the current of air reaches the eggs, respondents do not avoid infringement by interspersing indiscriminately, as they do, the trays of eggs in different stages of incubation. Respondents' claim of noninfringement is thus reduced to the contention that their incubators do not employ circulating currents of air called for by claim 1. Their emphasis is on the agitation of air in respondents' machine in such a manner that its movement does not follow defined paths through the chamber so as to answer to the description 'current of air.'\n In respondent's machine fans or air propellers are located at either side of the chamber, about midway of its height, near the wall and between the wall and tiers of egg trays. They are constructed and operated in such fashion that the air is 'drawn' by their action from the central corridor through the tiers of eggs toward the center of the propellers. There, by the centrifugal action of the propellers, it is thrown off the ends of the propeller blades toward the top, bottom, and adjacent ends of the chamber. There it is deflected by ceiling, floor, and ends \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n of the chamber into the corridor, from whence it is, in due course, again drawn through the tiers of eggs to the propellers. The propellers are operated, and the air moves, continuously. Since the main movement of the air at the top and bottom of the tiers is toward the center corridor, and since the fans draw in air through the middle of the tiers, there are points in the space occupied by the tiers where the movement of the air is toward the corridor until it joins and is turned back by the current moving toward the propellers.\n Claim 1, as already stated, does not call for a current of air moving in any particular direction. Assuming, without deciding, that it calls for a current of air so constant in its movement and direction as not to depart substantially from a well-defined path, one would expect that a fan operating, as in respondents' machine, within a closed chamber under substantially constant conditions, would produce currents of air without substantial variations of path. No valid scientific reason or explanation is advanced for any different result. Extensive testimony and elaborate arguments are presented to support the contention that, notwithstanding the application of force to the air within the closed chamber by the action of respondents' propellers, under practically constant conditions, the results produced are so variable that 'the air goes where it 'listeth\"; they are not convincing. The conclusion is abundantly supported by evidence that there is a continuous movement of air from the blades of respondents' propellers toward the top and bottom and sides of the chamber, thence to the corridor, and thence through the tiers of egg trays back to the propellers, and that this movement achieves the purpose declared in claim 1, 'to circulate, diffuse and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature.' The trial judge so found.\n That there is a mixture of the air and some confusion of its movement in the corridor, and that at different \n\n[294 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n levels within the space occupied by the tiers of trays the movement is not in the same direction, is immaterial. It is enough that there is a movement of air in current form following substantially defined paths through the tiers of egg trays, sufficient to effect the desired transfer of heat units. Claim 1 does not prescribe that a current of air is to be maintained throughout the chamber. It calls for the application to the eggs of a current of air 'of sufficient velocity to circulate, diffuse and maintain the air throughout the chamber at substantially the same temperature.' This respondents accomplish by the currents of air set in motion either directly or indirectly by the movement of the blades of the propellers. The method is that of Smith. Respondents do not avoid infringement of the method by varying the details of the apparatus by which they make use of it. Cochrane v. Deener, \n94 U.S. 780\n, 788; Tilghman v.

COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1935)\nNo. 663\nArgued: March 15, 1935Decided: April 29, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 134, 135]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Henry M. Ward, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the court.\n This case presents further questions regarding the application to marginal transactions on the stock exchange of Article 58 of regulations No. 74, as well as some of those already considered in Helvering v. Rankin, \n295 \nU.S. 123\n, 55 S.Ct. 732, 79 L.Ed. --, decided this day.\n Snyder was the salaried secretary of an insurance company. During 1928, as in previous years, he made on his individual account, at different dates and different prices \n\n[295 U.S. 134, 136]\n\u00a0\n many purchases and sales on margin of United Gas Improvement Company stock. In his federal income tax return for the calendar year 1928 he reported, apparently, no profits from trading on the stock exchange. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue concluded that he had made large gains; determined that his net income was $197.495.85; and, after making the appropriate deductions, assessed a deficiency tax of $38,961.22. The large income computed by the Commissioner was the result of applying the sales made in 1928 against purchases in earlier years, in accordance with the 'First-in, first-out' regulation and sections 111-113 of the act (26 USCA  2111-2113). The Board of Tax Appeals (29 B.T.A. 39) and the United States Circuit Court of Appeals (73 F.(2d) 5) affirmed the Commissioner's determination. The facts found by the Board of Tax Appeals, upon which the case was submitted, are these:\n Snyder traded in United Gas Improvement Company stock for profit through brokers on margin; and increased his holdings by the method known as 'pyramiding.' On January 1, 1928, there stood to his credit 5,300 shares; and his debit balances aggregated $501,865.59. He purchased during the tax year 10,600 shares and sold 7,900. At the close of the year, 8,000 shares stood to his credit, and his debit balances aggregated $932,822.67. Upon rises in the market, paper profits had been used to increase his holdings. Upon declines in the market, when his margin fell below the required percentage, the brokers reduced his debit balances by sufficient sales to make up the deficiency in the margin. The purchases and sales were effected by the brokers transferring so-called 'street certificates,' each for 100 shares, in the name of some stock exchange concern, endorsed by it in blank. At no time was any stock certificate delivered by the brokers to Snyder, or by him to them; nor was any certificate earmarked for him or his account. The certificates were inextricably \n\n[295 U.S. 134, 137]\n\u00a0\n mingled with other securities pledged with banks. They were at all times incapable of identification as having been bought or sold for the account of Snyder. The transactions between him and the brokers were reflected solely in entries in Snyder's account on the brokers' books; and no entry indicated that any particular lot theretofore purchased had been sold or retained. The only attempt at identification found by the Board, was the uncontradicted testimony of Snyder to the effect that 'in each case where a sale was made it was his intention to sell the last acquired stock first and shortly thereafter to buy back an equivalent amount in order to increase his margin and acquire additional shares of the stock.'\n First. Snyder contends, in the alternative, that his intention to sell the last acquired stock first, constituted sufficient identification to make the 'First-in, first-out' rule inapplicable; or else that the regulation as applied to marginal transactions on the stock exchange is invalid, because there is no possible means, other than the trader's intentions, of identifying the shares sold. What has already been said in Helvering v. Rankin is enough to dispose of both of these contentions. It is there determined that shares traded on margin are capable of identification for the purposes of the regulation; but that the mere intention of the trader to sell particular shares, without further designation, does not constitute sufficient identification.\n Second. Snyder contends that the 'First-in, first-out' regulation may not, consistently with the provisions of the Revenue Act of 1928, be applied to the facts of this case. The argument is that his market operations constituted a trade or business as those terms are used in section 22(a) of the act (26 USCA  2022(a); that according to that section, and the applicable decisions of this Court, Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S.Ct. 150, Woolford Realty Co. v. Rose, \n286 \nU.S. 319\n, 52 S.Ct. 568, gross income from such business, as well as net in- \n\n[295 U.S. 134, 138]\n\u00a0\n come under section 23 of the act (26 USCA  2023), must be computed entirely with respect to transactions within the taxable year; and that sections 111-113 (26 USCA  2111-2113), upon which the government relies, are not applicable because they relate only to 'sales of property, including securities, held for investment,' and have no application to sales made in the course of a 'business of trading on the stock exchange.' On this assumption, Snyder argues that the income realized during the taxable year from his stock transactions is not the aggregate of the gains and losses on each sale of securities, measured by the difference between the sale and cost prices of the securities sold, but the profit or loss realized as a result of all market operations, purchases as well as sales, made during the taxable year. Such profit or loss, he now suggests, must be computed 'by taking the difference between the purchase price and the sales price of shares bought and sold during the year, deducting expenses, such as commissions, taxes and interest.' Thus computed, he concludes, his market operations resulted in a gross income of $43,692; and adding his salary, insurance commissions and dividends, and deducting the expenses of his stock operations (interest paid brokers) his net taxable income was $ 39,682, and his total tax $1,897.77.\n Third. Neither in the findings of the Board of Tax Appeals, nor in the facts upon which the case was submitted to it, is there any support for the controverted allegation in Snyder's petition that his market operations constituted a 'business regularly carried on for profit.' \n1\n It is true that a taxpayer may be engaged in more than one trade or business, as those terms are used in various \n\n[295 U.S. 134, 139]\n\u00a0\n provisions of the Revenue Acts; and that, in addition to other business activities, one may be 'regularly engaged in the business of buying and selling corporate stocks.' Compare Dalton v. Bowers, \n287 \nU.S. 404\n, 53 S.Ct. 205; Burnet v. Clark, \n287 \nU.S. 410\n, 53 S.Ct. 207; Washburn v. Com'r of Internal Revenue (C.C.A.) 51 F.(2d) 949. It is also true that the Department has ruled, and the Board has held, that a taxpayer who, for the purpose of making a livelihood, devotes the major portion of his time to speculating on the stock exchange may treat losses thus incurred as having been sustained in the course of a trade or business. \n2\n Snyder, however, did not allege or attempt to prove that he had devoted the major part, or any substantial part, of his business day to his stock transactions. Nor were there any facts adduced to show that he might properly be characterized as a 'trader on an exchange, who makes a living in buying and selling securities.' Bedell v. Com'r of Internal Revenue (C.C.A.) 30 F.(2d) 622, 624; compare Mente v. Eisner (C.C.A.) 266 F. 161, 11 A.L.R. 496. Indeed, according to his petition, his intention throughout the year 1928, was, by 'taking advantage of the turns of the market,' not to draw out cash profits from his operations, but 'to increase the holdings of U.G.I. stock carried for his account by (his) brokers to as great an extent as the margin of his account permitted.' There is no substantial evidence in the record to sustain a finding by the Board, had there been one, to the effect that Snyder's market operations constituted a trade or business within the meaning of section 22 of the Revenue Act of 1928\n\n\n Fourth. The attack upon the Commissioner's method of computing income falls with the unsupported allega- \n\n[295 U.S. 134, 140]\n\u00a0\n tion that the stock transactions constituted a 'business regularly carried on for profit.' In his brief in support of his petition to this Court for certiorari, Snyder makes it clear, perhaps for the first time, that he is 'insistent upon the point that the operations constitute a trade or business or transaction entered into for profit, not in order to deduct losses, but to emphasize the controlling rule that the law requires the tax to be computed on the segregated transactions of the year.' But it is now too well settled for argument, that gains realized from sales of property purchased in previous years, measured, as prescribed by sections 111-113 of the 1928 Act, by the excess of proceeds of sale over cost, constitute income taxable in the year in which the sales are made. Doyle v. Mitchell Bros. Co., \n247 \nU.S. 179, 184\n, 185 S., 38 S.Ct. 467; Hays v. Gauley Mountain Coal Co., \n247 \nU.S. 189, 192\n, 38 S.Ct. 470; MacLaughlin v. Alliance Insurance Co., \n286 \nU.S. 244, 250\n, 52 S.Ct. 538. The contention that the rule is applicable only to the sale of capital assets, and not to sales made in the course of a 'business of trading on the stock exchange,' need not be disposed of on its merits, but see Gray v. Darlington, 15 Wall. 63, 66, Merchants' L. & T. Co. v. Smietanka, \n255 \nU.S. 509, 520\n, 41 S.Ct. 386, 15 A.L. R. 1305, since Snyder has failed to establish that the securities sold were held primarily for sale in the regular course of business. \n3\n And obviously, whether or not the stock transactions constituted a trade or business, the computation of gross income therefrom by deducting from sales of the current year the cost of securities sold, as determined by the purchase prices of previous years, is not comparable to the unsuccessful attempt in Burnet v. Sanford & Brooks \n\n[295 U.S. 134, 141]\n\u00a0\n Co., \n282 \nU.S. 359\n, 51 S.Ct. 150, to offset gross income of the current year against losses or expenses of previous years. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n Fifth. Moreover, Snyder suggests no other practicable method of accounting which would reflect income for the year more fairly than the method adopted by the Commissioner. \n5\n He concedes that he is not a dealer in securities, in the sense of one who buys securities for the purpose of resale to customers; and that consequently, he is not entitled to compute income on an inventory basis. \n6\n Compare Lucas v. Kansas City Structural Steel Co., \n281 \nU.S. 264, 268\n, 50 S.Ct. 263; United States Cartridge Co. v. United States, \n284 \nU.S. 511, 520\n, 52 S.Ct. 243. His suggestion that gross income from trading be computed by deducting purchase prices from sale prices during the year would offer a feasible substitute only if it could be assumed that the number of purchases and sales would be approximately equal \n\n[295 U.S. 134, 142]\n\u00a0\n each year and that any differences would be averaged out in the course of a number of years. That assumption is unwarranted, particularly in view of Snyder's professed object 'to accumulate as many shares of U.G.I. as he could.' \n7\n His alternative suggestion, that, since purchases in fact exceeded sales during 1928, the 'First-in, first-out' rule, if applied at all, should be confined to purchases and sales in the course of the year, adds nothing to the contentions that have already been considered in this case or in Helvering v. Rankin.\nAFFIRMED.\n Mr. Justice STONE concurs in the result, but thinks that the petitioner failed to show that the particular shares sold were capable of identification with respect to the date of their purchase, and that they could not be identified merely by the taxpayer's designation of them to the broker as the shares to be sold. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n295 \nU.S. 769\n, 55 S.Ct. 913, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The answer of the Commissioner denied that the 'brokerage accounts ... constituted a trade or business within the meaning of any provision of the Revenue Act of 1928.'

Appellant alleged that he was threatened with prosecution under chapter 781 of the Laws of 1933, Ex. Sess., of the state of New York, which made it a misdemeanor to violate any provision of a code of fair competition as approved by the President of the United States under Title 1,  1 et seq. of the National Industrial Recovery Act. 48 Stat. 195 (15 USCA  701 et seq.) It appears that the charge of violation of the code related to the provisions which limited the amount to be allowed for an old car 'traded in' as part payment for a new car and required the maintenance of factory list prices, plus certain charges, with a prohibition against discounts, gratuities, etc., for the purpose of inducing purchases. The state statute was challenged as repugnant to the Constitution of the state, by reason of an improper delegation of legislative power, and also as effecting a deprivation of liberty and property without due process of law in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.\n Appellant's application for an interlocutory injunction was heard in the District Court by three judges.

An order to that effect was entered and the case comes here on appeal.\n Upon the argument at this bar, the questions were raised (1) whether the district attorney was an officer of the state within the meaning of section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380), and (2) whether the complaint stated a cause of action within the equitable jurisdiction of the District Court. The case was continued to permit the parties to file briefs upon these questions, and the briefs are now in.\n First. If the district attorney of the county of New York is to be deemed a local officer, performing a local function in a matter of interest only to the particular county, section 266 of the Judicial Code has no application and we are without jurisdiction of this direct appeal from the District Court.

Packing Co., \n292 \nU.S. 386, 390\n, 54 S.Ct. 732\n\n\n The office of district attorney in the state of New York was created in 1801. In each of the districts as then established, which included several counties, he was charged with duties which previously had devolved upon an Assistant Attorney General. In 1815 the county of New York was made a separate district, and in 1818 provision was made for the appointment of a district attorney in each county. The power of appointment was vested in the governor and the council of appointment until the Constitution of 1821, when that power was given to the county courts. The Constitution of 1846 provided that district attorneys should be chosen by the electors of the respective counties.\n Despite this provision for local elections, the district attorney in each county has been regarded as a state officer performing a state function and taking the place, in \n\n[295 U.S. 89, 93]\n\u00a0\n respect to his duties within the district or county, of the Attorney General, upon whom at the outset these duties had been laid. Lincoln's Constitutional History of New York, vol. 2, pp. 529, 530; vol. 4, pp. 722, 723. Under the state statutes prior to 1892, it appears that district attorneys were classified as judicial officers. N.Y. 1 Rev. Stat., pt. 1, c. 5, tit. 1. In Fellows v. Mayor, etc., of City of New York (1876) 8 Hun ( N.Y.) 484, 485, dealing with the status of an assistant district attorney, the court said: 'It is conceded that the district attorney is a State officer. It could not well be questioned.' And in People ex rel. Lyon v. Nicoll (Sup. 1891), 32 N.Y.S. 279, 280, the court referred to the office of the district attorney as 'a state office, classified by the Revised Statutes as a judicial office.'\n In the Public Officers Law of 1892, c. 681 (now Laws 1909, c. 51, chapter 47 of the Consolidated Laws of New York, article 1,  2) a different classification was made and public officials were defined as either 'state officers' or 'local officers,' the latter embracing officers chosen 'by the electors of a portion only of the state.' District attorneys fall within this description of local officers. Notwithstanding the change in classification, they are still to be deemed a part of the judicial system of the state, each performing within his county a distinctively state function. Lincoln's Constitutional History of New York, loc. cit. See Opinions, Attorney General of New York, 1924, p. 120.\n In this view we cannot regard the local description, or the method of selecting the officer, as decisive with respect to the application of section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380). That section relates to suits in which an interlocutory injunction is sought to restrain, on constitutional grounds, the enforcement 'of any statute of a State by restraining the action of any officer of such State in the enforcement or execution of such statute, or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under and pursuant to the statutes \n\n[295 U.S. 89, 94]\n\u00a0\n of such State.' To determine the application of this provision, we must have regard both to the nature of the legislative action which is assailed and to the function of the officer who is sought to be restrained. We have said that the reference is not to every legislative action, regardless of its nature and scope, but to a statute 'of general application' or an order of a state board or commission. Thus, the section does not apply to suits to restrain the enforcement of municipal ordinances or the orders of a city board. Ex parte Collins, supra. And, although the constitutionality of a statute is challenged, the provision is inapplicable where the defendants are local officers and the suit 'involves matters of interest only to the particular municipality or district.' Id. Accordingly, a suit against local officials to enjoin the collection of taxes assessed against shares in a national banking association, in pursuance of a state law but 'by, and for the sole use of, the city,' was found not to be within the section. Ex parte Public National Bank, supra. We pointed out that the suit must not only seek to have a state statute declared unconstitutional, or that in effect, but to restrain the action 'of an officer of the state.' But the court was careful to reserve the question whether so-called local officers might not in fact represent the state or exercise 'state functions in the matters involved,' so as to bring the suit to restrain their action within the provision for three judges and direct appeal. Id., \n278 U.S. 101\n, page 105, 49 S.Ct. 43.\n Where a statute embodies a policy of state-wide concern, an officer, although chosen in a political subdivision and acting within that limited territory, may be charged with the duty of enforcing the statute in the interest of the state and not simply in the interest of the locality where he serves. This is especially true in the case of a prosecuting officer who acts for the entire state, as a part of its machinery of enforcement, in proceedings against violators of the state statute. The function of \n\n[295 U.S. 89, 95]\n\u00a0\n such an officer, in enforcing a statute of general application, is of controlling importance in giving effect to the intent of the Congress.\n In the instant case it is manifest that the statute under attack attempted to establish a state-wide policy, and not one merely in the interest of the particular county. The defendant is charged with the duty of enforcing the statute by prosecuting those who disobey it, and in performing that duty he acts not merely in the local interest, but in the name of the people of the state in compelling observance of its laws. In that enforcement, he is acting in a true sense as an officer of the state. Appellant sought to restrain his action in that aspect, and hence we think that the case fell within section 266 of the Judicial Code (28 USCA  380) and was properly heard by three judges.\n Second. We pass to the question whether the bill of complaint stated a cause of action within the equitable jurisdiction of the District Court.\n The general rule is that equity will not interfere to prevent the enforcement of a criminal statute even though unconstitutional. Hygrade Provision Co. v. Sherman, \n266 \nU.S. 497, 500\n, 45 S.Ct. 141. See, also, In re Sawyer, \n124 U.S. 200\n, 209-211, 8 S.Ct. 482; Davis & Farnum Manufacturing Co. v. Los Angeles, \n189 \nU.S. 207, 217\n, 23 S. Ct. 498. To justify such interference there must be exceptional circumstances and a clear showing that an injunction is necessary in order to afford adequate protection of constitutional rights. See Terrace v. Thompson, \n263 \nU.S. 197, 214\n, 44 S.Ct. 15; Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 143\n, 44 S.Ct. 257; Tyson & Bros. United Theatre Ticket Offices v. Banton, \n273 \nU.S. 418, 428\n, 47 S.Ct. 426, 58 A.L.R. 1236; Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., \n274 \nU.S. 445, 452\n, 47 S.Ct. 681; Ex parte Young, \n209 \nU.S. 123, 161\n, 162 S., 28 S.Ct. 441, 13 L.R.A.(N.S.) 932, 14 Ann.Cas. 764. We have said that it must appear that 'the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate'; otherwise, the accused should first set up his defense in the state court, even though the validity of a statute is challenged. There is ample oppor- \n\n[295 U.S. 89, 96]\n\u00a0\n tunity for ultimate review by this Court of federal questions. Fenner v. Boykin, \n271 \nU.S. 240, 243\n, 244 S., 46 S.Ct. 492, 493.\n Appellant's bill of complaint failed to meet this test. Appellant alleged that the district attorney had applied to a magistrate of the city of New York for the issue of a summons directing the appearance of the appellant, to the end that an investigation should be made of a complaint against him for violation of the provisions of the 'Motor Vehicle Retailing Code,' and that an information charging violation should be drawn. He alleged that the district attorney intended, unless restrained, to institute criminal proceedings. The state statute made any violation of the provisions of the code a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not exceeding $500 for each offense. The bill contained general allegations of irreparable damage and deprivation of 'rights, liberties, properties, and immunities' without due process of law, if the statute were enforced. But the bill failed to state facts sufficient to warrant such conclusions, which alone were not enough. The bill alleged that appellant had a large business in buying and selling motor vehicles, but the statute did not prohibit the continuance of that business and the bill gave no facts to show that the particular requirements of the code, which were in question, would create such a serious interference as to require equitable relief. Aside from the statement of general and unsupported conclusions, the case presented by the bill was the ordinary one of a criminal prosecution which would afford appropriate opportunity for the assertion of appellant's rights. So far as the bill disclosed, nothing more than a single prosecution was in contemplation, a point which the district attorney emphasized by his disclaimer, on the hearing below, of any intention to institute any further prosecution against appellant until his rights, constitutional or otherwise, had been adjudicated in the pending criminal proceeding. \n\n[295 U.S. 89, 97]\n\u00a0\n The bill should have been dismissed upon the ground that it failed to state a case within the equitable jurisdiction of the District Court. The decree is modified accordingly, and, as modified, the decree is affirmed.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","154":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSPRUILL v.

King, of Portland, Me., for appellant.\n Mr. Clyde R. Chapman, of Belfast, Me., for appellee.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n Chapter 259 of the Public Laws of the State of Maine of 1933 placed common carriers operating motor vehicles for the transportation of goods for hire under the control of the Public Utilities Commission and required them to obtain certificates of public convenience and necessity which, however, were to be granted as a matter of right in the case of carriers who had provided adequate, responsible, and continuous service since March 1, 1932\n\n\n Appellant, John M. Stanley, applied to the Commission for a certificate to enable him to operate as a common carrier from Portland to Haines Landing in that State. Upon hearing, the Commission determined that he was entitled, as a matter of right, to a certificate for operation between Portland and Lewiston, but not north of the latter point, as it did not appear that he had supplied the described service north of Lewiston since March 1, 1932. The Commission found that there were several common carriers operating over all, or portions, of the route between Lewiston and Haines Landing, including those which were entitled to certificates as a matter of right, and denied appellant's application for that part of the route. Complaining that this determination deprived him of his property without due process of law, and denied to him the equal protection of the laws, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, appellant obtained review by the Supreme Court \n\n[295 U.S. 76, 78]\n\u00a0\n of the State which overruled his exceptions and sustained the Commission's action. 133 Me. 91, 174 A. 93. The case comes here on appeal.\n Appellant's contentions are without merit. No question as to interstate transportation is involved. In safeguarding the use of its highways for intrastate transportation, carriers for hire may be required to obtain certificates of convenience and necessity. Packard v. Banton, \n264 \nU.S. 140, 144\n, 44 S.Ct. 257; Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 264\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 87 A.L.R. 721. In the exercise of this power the Legislature could determine, within reason, as of what period the service of carriers for hire over its highways did not impair their use or cause congestion, and require certificates for those seeking to supply additional transportation for a later period. The selection of any date would necessarily establish a distinction between service immediately before and after, but that, like similar selections of distances, weights, and sizes, would not of itself prove that the choice is beyond the range of legislative authority.

STATE OF WYOMING(1935)\nNo. 16\nArgued: Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 40, 41]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Ray E. Lee, of Cheyenne, Wyo., for defendant.\n Mr. Paul F. Good, of Lincoln, Neb., for complainant.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Nebraska, by leave of court, has filed a bill of complaint against Wyoming praying ascertainment of the equitable apportionment, as between the two states, of the waters of the North Platte river, and a decree to enforce compliance with the findings in that behalf. Wyoming has presented a motion to dismiss.\n The allegations of the bill, in summary, are: The river, a nonnavigable stream, has its source in Colorado, enters and traverses Wyoming, crosses the state line into Nebraska, and in that state unites with the South Platte to form the Platte river, which flows from the junction through Nebraska to the Missouri river, the eastern boundary of the state. Nebraska's citizens need irrigation water from the Platte above Grand Island and the North Platte; appropriation of water from these streams by her citizens began in 1882, continues to the present time, and is of large extent. Plaintiff and defendant alike recognize by their laws the doctrine that the waters of streams may be appropriated for beneficial use and that he whose appropriation is prior in time has the superior \n\n[295 U.S. 40, 42]\n\u00a0\n right. Appropriations of the waters of the North Platte have been made in both states. The Reclamation Act of the United States1 authorized the construction of reservoirs in Wyoming for storage of water to be used for irrigation, and the Secretary of the Interior, pursuant to the act, applied to the state engineer of Wyoming and obtained from him permission to construct in that state reservoirs for impounding the waters of the North Platte, and to appropriate waters, and was awarded a priority date. Reservoirs of large capacity have accordingly been constructed and operated by the United States, but solely under and subject to the irrigation and appropriation laws of Wyoming. Projects completed under the Reclamation Act are also supplied with water withdrawn from the direct flow of the North Platte, and the Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior of the United States has, pursuant to the Warren Act,2 contracted with irrigation projects having earlier priorities to supplement the direct flow rights of such projects by the addition of waters stored in its reservoirs. All of the acts of the Reclamation Bureau in operating the reservoirs so as to impound and release waters of the river are subject to the authority of Wyoming; and she and her officers are under the duty to administer these waters fairly and impartially, and to control appropriators whose rights arise under the law of Wyoming from encroaching upon the rights of Nebraska appropriators by diminishing the flow so that the latter are unable to obtain the waters embraced within their appropriations. This duty Wyoming officials have neglected and disregarded, in spite of Nebraska's protests; and have permitted the diversion of waters belonging to Nebraska's appropriators to the great loss and damage of \n\n[295 U.S. 40, 43]\n\u00a0\n her citizens. The priorities of the appropriators in each state, including the Bureau of Reclamation, can be ascertained, and investigation discloses that the defendant has allotted the Bureau too early a date with respect to a proposed project, and unless restrained Wyoming will permit appropriation in aid thereof.\n The motion to dismiss advances there propositions of law.\n\n 1. \nColorado is said to be an indispensable party, because the bill discloses that the North Platte rises in that state and drains a considerable area therein. The contention is without merit. Nebraska asserts no wrongful act of Colorado and prays no relief against her. We need not determine whether Colorado would be a proper party, or whether at a later stage of the cause pleadings or proofs may disclose a necessity to bring her into the suit. It suffices to say that upon the face of the bill she is not a necessary party to the dispute between Nebraska and Wyoming concerning the respective priorities and rights of their citizens in the waters of the North Platte river.\n\n 2. \nThe motion asserts that the Secretary of the Interior is an indispensable party. The bill alleges, and we know as matter of law,3 that the Secretary and his agents, acting by authority of the Reclamation Act and supplementary legislation, must obtain permits and priorities for the use of water from the state of Wyoming in the same manner as a private appropriator or an irrigation district formed under the state law. His rights can rise no higher than those of Wyoming, and an adjudication of the defendant's rights will necessarily bind him. Wyoming will stand in judgment for him as for any other appropriator in that state. He is not a necessary party. \n\n[295 U.S. 40, 44]\n\u00a0\n 3. Wyoming says that the bill fails to state a cause of action in equity and states no matter of equity entitling Nebraska to the relief for which she asks. The printed argument submitted on behalf of defendant asserts that the complaint is vague and indefinite in its assertions of fact and may be read as claiming the entire flow of the river for use in Nebraska. We do not so read the bill. The plaintiff asserts that appropriations have been made in both states; that some in Wyoming are prior to others in Nebraska and vice versa, and prays an ascertainment of the proper dates of all and relief in conformity with the facts found.\n In oral argument the defendant called attention to statements in the bill to the effect that certain of the Nebraska water users whose rights the plaintiff desires adjudicated, must take water from the Platte river which is formed by the confluence of the North and the South Platte rivers; that the latter rises in Colorado and flows for a substantial distance through Nebraska before it joins the North Platte, and the bill fails to state anything respecting the augmentation of the flow of the Platte from the South Platte, which increment should be considered in ascertaining the amount of the waters contributed by the North Platte to which these users are entitled as against users in Wyoming. It is said the plaintiff's failure to mention the contribution of the South Platte or to signify a willingness that the water this stream supplies to the Platte shall be taken into account, is a failure to tender equity, and requires a dismissal of the suit. We think the position is not well taken. The bill states 'that in the drainage basin of the said Platte and North Platte Rivers, between the said state line dividing the State of Nebraska from the State of Wyoming, and the City of Grand Island, Nebraska, there are no tributaries of the said North Platte and Platte Rivers supplying any substantial amount of water. ...' If the \n\n[295 U.S. 40, 45]\n\u00a0\n fact be otherwise, Wyoming may traverse this allegation and thus make it an issue to be determined with proper regard to such proofs as may be produced respecting the supply from the South Platte.\n We think no sufficient ground appears for dismissing the bill.\n The motion is denied, and the defendant will be given sixty days within which to answer the bill. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] June 17, 1902, c. 1093, 32 Stat. 388, U.S.C., tit. 43,  372, 373, 381, 383, 391, 392, 411, 416, 419, 421, 431, 432, 434, 439, 461, 476, 491, 498 (43 USCA  372, 373 note, 381, 383, 391, 392, 411, 416, 419, 421, 431, 432, 434, 439, 461, 476, 491, 498). \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Feb. 21, 1911, c. 141, 36 Stat. 925, U.S.C., tit. 43,  523-525 ( 43 USCA  523-525). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act of June 17, 1902, c. 1093,  8, 32 Stat. 390, U.S.C., tit. 43,  383 (43 USCA  383). \n\n\n\n\n","161":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTATE OF NEW JERSEY v.

The purpose of the petition is to obtain a ruling that the dumping of sludge gathered by sedimentation and free of any matter capable of floating is not a violation of the decree. The petition states that the sludge consists of about 90 per cent. water and about 10 per cent. finely divided solids that settle to the bottom of the water, and in substance that no floating matter is included in the sledge; that defendant takes to sea about 4,000 tons of sludge per month and dumps it not less than ten miles from shore; and that the amounts dumped by defendant have ranged between one-twentieth and one- sixth of those dumped contemporaneously at the same place by the plaintiff or its political subdivisions.\n The petition prays this court to direct the state of New Jersey to show cause why (1) a ruling should not be made to the effect that the dumping of sludge, free \n\n[296 U.S. 259, 261]\n\u00a0\n from any matter capable of floating, at places not less than 10 miles from any shore, is not a violation of the decree, or (2) in the alternative, why this court should not modify the decree so as to permit defendant to dump nonfloating sewage sludge as aforesaid.\n The Court ordered that a rule issue requiring plaintiff to show cause why leave to file the petition should not be granted. November 15, 1935, plaintiff by its return consented to the filing of defendant's petition. And at the same time plaintiff filed its motion for the appointment of a special master with power to summon witnesses, to take testimony, 'to make findings of fact and conclusions of law, respecting the allegations of the petition, and to submit the same to the Court with his recommendations, in respect to defendant's prayer therein.'\n Upon consideration of the premises, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed:\n Defendant's motion for leave to file its petition is granted. The facts alleged therein do not constitute a violation of the decree of December 4, 1933. Plaintiff's return and motion are not sufficient to put in issue the allegations of defendant's petition or to show that defendant has failed to comply with the decree.

STATE OF MICHIGAN(1935)\nNo. 15\nArgued: April 8, 1935Decided: May 20, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 455, 456]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. J. Bieberstein, of Madison, Wis., John W. Reynolds, of Green Bay, Wis., and Joseph E. Messerschmidt, of Madison Wis., for the State of Wisconsin.\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 455, 457]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Meredith P. Sawyer, of Menominee, Mich., for the State of michigan.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case concerns the Green Bay section of the boundary between these States. In Michigan v. Wisconsin, \n270 \nU.S. 295\n, 46 S.Ct. 290, 296, the entire boundary was involved. As to that section, the question was whether islands within the bay and other islands surrounded by its waters and those of Lake Michigan belonged to one or the other State. The territory of Wisconsin was created by an Act of April 20, 1836, c. 54, 5 Stat. 10. The stretch of boundary in question is described: '... to a point in the middle of said lake (Michigan), and opposite the main channel of Green Bay, and through said channel and Green Bay to the mouth of the Menominee river. ...' Section 1. By the Enabling Act of June 15, 1836, c. 99, 5 Stat. 49, under which Michigan became a State January 26, 1837, it is described in the reverse direction: '... thence, down the centre of the main channel of the same (Menominee river), to the centre of the most usual ship channel of the Green bay of Lake Michigan; thence, through the centre of the most usual ship channel of the said bay to the middle of Lake Michigan. ...' Section 2.\n As to the section there involved, we said: 'In determining the boundary through this section, the question is not embarrassed by differences of description. (\n270 U.S. 295\n, page 314, 46 S.Ct. 290, 296) ... The evidence shows that there are two distinct ship channels, to either of which this description might apply. From the mouth of the Menominee, the channel, according to the Michigan claim, proceeds across the waters of Green Bay in an \n\n[295 U.S. 455, 458]\n\u00a0\n easterly direction until near the westerly shore of the Door county peninsula; thence, in close proximity to the shore, in a northerly direction to a point opposite Death's Door channel (or Porte des Morts); thence through that channel into Lake Michigan. The channel claimed by Wisconsin, after leaving the mouth of the Menominee, turns to the north and pursues a northerly direction to a point opposite the Rock Island passage, which lies between Rock Island and St. Martin's Island; thence through the Rock Island passage into Lake Michigan. The territory in dispute lies between these rival channels, and embraces two groups of islands: (1) Chambers Island, the Strawberry Islands, and a few others, small and unnamed, all within the main waters of Green Bay west of the Door county peninsula; and (2) Rock, Washington, Detroit, and Plum Islands, lying between Death's Door channel and the Rock Island passage, at the north end of the peninsula. The evidence as to which of the two ship channels was the usual one at the time of the adoption of the Michigan Enabling Act is not only conflicting, but of such inconclusive character that, standing alone, we could base no decree upon it with any feeling of certainty. (\n270 U.S. 295\n, page 315, 46 S.Ct. 290, 297) ... But it is not necessary, for ... the title of Wisconsin to the disputed area now in question is established by long possession and acquiescence, and this conclusion is justified by evidence and concessions of the most substantial character. (\n270 U.S. 295\n, page 316, 46 S.Ct. 290, 297) ... The result is that complainant has failed to maintain her case in any particular, and that the claims of Wisconsin as to the location of the boundary in each of the three sections are sustained.' \n270 U.S. 295\n, page 319, 46 S.Ct. 290, 298.\n The decree (\n272 \nU.S. 398\n, 47 S.Ct. 114) defines the section: 'thence down the center of the main channel of the ... Menominee to the center of the harbor entrance of said Menominee river; thence in a direct line to the most usual ship channel of Green Bay, passing to the north of \n\n[295 U.S. 455, 459]\n\u00a0\n Green Island and westerly of Chambers Island and through the Rock Island Passage into Lake Michigan, by courses and distances as follows: From a point midway between the outer ends of the Menominee river piers; thence east by south, seven and one-half miles to the center of the most usual ship channel of the Green Bay; thence along said ship channel north by east one-eighth east, eight and seven-eighths miles; thence continuing along said ship channel north by east seven-eighths east, twenty-seven miles; thence continuing along said ship channel, east one-fourth north, ten and one-fourth miles; thence east three-fourths north to the boundary between the state of Michigan and the state of Wisconsin in the middle of Lake Michigan.'\n Michigan concedes that the first distance should be seven and one- eighth instead of seven and one-half miles. Wisconsin insists that the first course should be eliminated and a more northerly one substituted for it. The parties agree that the third course was intended to be 'northeast seven-eighths east' instead of 'north by east seven-eighths east.' Wisconsin claims that, even if corrected as to the course and distance mentioned, the description would deprive her of about 35 miles of fishing area opposite the city of Menominee which, as she says, has always been under her jurisdiction. And she prays that this description be changed so as to read: 'to the outer end of the piers at Menominee being the center of the harbor entrance of said Menominee River, thence in a direct line to a point half-way from Chambers Island to the Michigan mainland measured from the water's edge at the narrowest channel; thence in a direct line to the west end of the Whaleback Shoal; thence in a direct line to a point half-way from the water's edge adjacent to Boyer's Bluff to the water's edge on the Michigan mainland at the mouth of Bark River; thence in a direct line to a point half-way from the water's edge at \n\n[295 U.S. 455, 460]\n\u00a0\n Boyer's Bluff to Driscoll Shoal; thence in a direct line to the light on St. Martin's Shoal; thence east three-quarters north to the boundary between the State of Michigan and the State of Wisconsin in the middle of Lake Michigan.'\n We appointed Frederick F. Faville special master. And, in accordance with our order, he has taken the evidence, made findings of fact, stated his conclusions of law and recommendations for a decree, all of which with a transcript of the testimony, the maps, charts, and other exhibits, are included in the report he has submitted to the court.\n Michigan, while conceding the court has power to make the decree correspond with the opinion in Michigan v. Wisconsin, asserts that the boundary line here in controversy was involved in the former case and suggests that the court is without jurisdiction to establish any other line. The evidence shows, and the master found: After announcement of our decision, counsel for the parties agreed upon a form of decree to carry it into effect and consented that it be entered. Due to mutual mistakes, it was erroneous in the respects above indicated and because of their consent it was adopted and entered by the court. The location of the boundary line dividing the waters of the bay between the States was not in issue. No evidence was offered for the determination of that question. It was all addressed to the controversy concerning the islands-the matter then in dispute. The master rightly concluded the court has jurisdiction to correct the decree (Thompson v. Maxwell Land Grant & R. Co., \n95 \nU.S. 391, 397\n, 399 S.) and to establish the true boundary line through Green Bay. Hopkins v. Lee, 6 Wheat. 109, 113, 114; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n256 \nU.S. 70, 86\n, 41 S.Ct. 420.\n The parties rightly assume that there is no difference between the description of the boundary through Green Bay given in the act creating Wisconsin Territory and that specified in the Michigan Enabling Act. Michigan v. Wisconsin, \n270 U.S. 295\n, \n\n[295 U.S. 455, 461]\n\u00a0\n 314, 46 S.Ct. 290. The evidence shows, and the master found: When these acts were passed, there was no 'main' or 'most usual ship' channel. Movements of sailing vessels, then used, were not limited to any channel and, except to avoid islands, shoals and reefs, they went directly to their destinations. Ships came and went between Lake Michigan and Green Bay to and from the mouth of the Menominee, and the southerly end of the bay, the site of the city of Green Bay. They passed east and west of Chambers Island and through the Strawberry passage. Neither State has ever exercised jurisdiction over the triangular area at the mouth of the Menominee or over any other waters of the bay that are now in controversy.\n As it is impossible to identify any channel in the bay as that indicated by the acts referred to, the intention of Congress must be otherwise ascertained. By principles of international law, that apply also to boundaries between States constituting this country, it is well established that when a navigable stream is a boundary between States the middle of the main channel, as distinguished from the geographical middle, limits the jurisdicton of each unless otherwise fixed by agreement or understanding between the parties. That rule rests upon equitable considerations and is intended to safeguard to each State equality of access and right of navigation in the stream. Iowa v. Illinois, \n147 \nU.S. 1, 7\n, 13 S.Ct. 239. This court has held that, on occasion, the principle of the thalweg is also applicable to bays, estuaries and other arms of the sea. Louisiana v. Mississippi, \n202 \nU.S. 1, 50\n, 26 S.Ct. 408; New Jersey v. Delaware, \n291 \nU.S. 361, 379\n, 54 S.Ct. 407. The doctrine of the thalweg is a modification of the more ancient principle which required equal division of territory and was adopted in order to preserve to each State equality of right in the beneficial uses of the boundary streams as a means of navigation. Minnesota v. Wisconsin, \n252 \nU.S. 273, 282\n, 40 S.Ct. 313. No right of either party to use the waters of the bay for \n\n[295 U.S. 455, 462]\n\u00a0\n navigation is here involved. Questions of territorial jurisdiction in respect of fishing constitute the occasion of the present controversy. And it confidently may be assumed that when fixing the boundary lines in the waters of the bay Congress intended that Michigan and the State to be erected out of Wisconsin Territory should have equality of right and opportunity in respect of these waters, including navigation, fishing and other uses. On the facts found, equality of right can best be attained by a division of the area as nearly equal as conveniently may be made, having regard to the matters heretofore litigated and finally adjudged between these States. The rule that the States stand on an equal level or plane under our constitutional system (Wyoming v. Colorado, \n259 \nU.S. 419, 465\n, 470 S., 42 S.Ct. 552) makes in favor of that construction of the boundary provisions under consideration. Cf. Connecticut v. Massachusetts, \n282 \nU.S. 660, 670\n, 51 S.Ct. 286.\n The pleadings reflect opposing claims as to the title to some part of tracts called 'Grassy Island' and 'Sugar Island,' bordering on the north bank, and a short distance from the mouth, of the Menominee river. The master found that neither is an island and that each is a part of the mainland of Michigan, and concluded that both belong to that State. Wisconsin does not except to any of the findings or conclusions in respect of these tracts.\n The decree to be entered in this case will establish the boundary through and along, or near, the middle of the waters of Green Bay that are here involved. That line commences at a point midway between the piers at the harbor entrance of the Menominee River; thence east by south seven and one-eighth miles; thence approximately north by east one-eighth east, about eight and seven-eighths miles; thence to and along a line in or near the middle of the bay to a point west of the Rock Island passage; thence easterly by courses and distances to be designated through that passage to the boundary in the mid- \n\n[295 U.S. 455, 463]\n\u00a0\n dle of Lake Michigan. The decree will appropriately define the tracts called 'Grassy Island' and 'Sugar Island' and declare them to belong to Michigan.\n The case is referred to the special master and he is directed to prepare and submit to the court a form of decree which will give effect to this decision. Inasmuch as the preparation of the decree may involve the ascertainment of physical facts and the formulation of technical descriptions, the master is authorized to hear counsel, take evidence and procure such assistance, if any, as may be necessary to enable him conveniently and promptly to discharge the duties here imposed upon him. He may call upon counsel to propose forms of decree. He is directed to give them opportunity to submit objections to the form prepared by him and to include the objections, if any, in his report.\n It is so ordered. \n\n\n\n","164":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSTEELE v.

HOSIERY MOTOR-MEND CORPORATION(1935)\nNo. 588\nArgued: Decided: April 29, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 237, 238]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Henry Gilligan, J. Preston Swecker, and Vernon E. Hodges, all of Washington, D.C., for Stelos Co., Inc.\n Messrs. Hugh M. Morris, of Wilmington, Del., and N. A. Stancliffe, of New York City, for Hosiery Motor-Mend Corporation et al.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause presents issues as to validity and infringement of claim 23 of the Stephens reissue patent, No. 16,360, for 'an improvement in needles and its (sic) method of use.' The Stelos Company, owner of the patent, sued Hosiery Motor-Mend Corporation and others for infringement. The District Court adjudged the claim invalid by reason of failure to make proper disclosure of the alleged invention, and anticipation; and also thought that, if the claim were sustained, the defendants did not infringe, and dismissed the bill. \n1\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the prior art required so narrow a construction of the claim as to exclude the method charged as an infringement and affirmed the decree. \n2\n We granted certiorari 3 to resolve a conflict with a decision of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia. \n4\n In support of \n\n[295 U.S. 237, 239]\n\u00a0\n the judgment, the defendants might have urged the point as to invalidity, decided against them in the Circuit Court of Appeals, without applying for a cross-writ of certiorari. \n5\n Out of excess of caution, however, they prayed for the writ. Since both writs would run to but one judgment and bring up the same record, we granted the prayer in No. 653.6\n To knit is to form a fabric by the interlacing of a single yarn or thread in a series of connected loops. In knitted articles, of which a silk stocking is an example, a break in the thread anywhere in the fabric will cause a number of loops to pull out, leaving in their place parallel threads. The consequent defect is called a ladder or a run. The only possible method of repair consists in picking up the thread at the end of the run and reknitting by reforming the loops throughout the ladder, fastening the thread upon the completion of the operation. It has long been known that this could be accomplished by the use of a needle having a hook at the end resembling an ordinary crochet needle, but the task involved difficulties and the result was often unsatisfactory.\n Stephens' patent is for an improved latch needle for this work and for a method of executing the repair. Twenty-two claims for the needle are not in issue. Claim 23, which covers the method, is the basis of the suit. The method is stated in the patent to consist:\n'In stretching the fabric over a suitable holder,\n\n'Inserting a repairing device having a hook and pivoted latch through a loop formed in the run or raveling,\n\n'Continuing this movement on through the fabric while holding the device laterally out of alignment with the run or raveling until the loop has slid back over the end of the latch and beneath the latter, \n\n[295 U.S. 237, 240]\n\u00a0\n 'Then reversing the movement of the device through the loop,\n\n'Catching the next forward thread in the hook while the loop is being pulled over the latch causing the latch to close over the thread, and the loop to be cast off over the end of the device, the thread caught in the hook thereupon forming a new loop, taking the place of the first-described loop,\n\n'Then reinserting the device into the fabric as before, and repeating the operating until the run or raveling has been repaired,\n\n'And finally fastening the thread.'\n\n In the commercial method practiced by the owner of the patent and its licensees, the fabric is stretched over the top of a china or porcelain eggcup held in the left hand. The degree of stretching can in this way be adjusted for the first step in the process and increased or relaxed as the work progresses. The needle is held in the right hand at an angle to the plane of the fabric and worked back and forth through the material. Whether the needle is also inclined laterally out of the line of the run is disputed. The patentee says this is unnecessary and is not in fact practiced. The defendants disagree, and contend that a pivoted latch needle will not otherwise perform its function. The alleged infringers employ a metal holder shaped like an eggcup and a sliding latch needle, which they punch through the material and draw back at approximately a right angle to the fabric.\n Stephens, while in Mexico in 1921 or 1922, noticed a Mrs. De Marr repairing runs by stretching stockings over her finger and reforming the loops with a latch needle. On her behalf he forwarded to a patent attorney a description and specification in his own handwriting, and an application for patent was filed by Mrs. De Marr. A half interest was assigned to Stephens. Certain prior patents \n\n[295 U.S. 237, 241]\n\u00a0\n were cited against the claims, and the application was abandoned. Shortly thereafter Stephens filed in his own name an application for patent of an improved pivoted latch needle and for an improved method of repairing runs. The method claim called for the use of a pivoted latch needle having all the features of that described in the application, and was accordingly rejected inter alia because it was not a method claim, since it required Stephens' specific construction of the needle. The applicant redrafted the claim to call merely for a pivoted latch needle, and added the element that the needle should be held laterally out of alignment with the run. We think the method claim is bad for want of proper disclosure and as lacking invention.\n\n 1. \nThe first step is described as 'stretching the fabric over a suitable holder.' It is now said that an eggcup or something of like construction is the only suitable holder, because no other device affords a rest for the operator's hand and permits continuous stretching in varying degree during the repair operation. The patent drawings show no holder of any sort. The specifications merely say: 'In other methods the fabric is stretched over the finger tip, making it difficult to insert the hook beneath the thread. This objection is obviated in the present invention by stretching the fabric over a porcelain dish, allowing sufficient depth for the free use of the needle.' Obviously the phrase 'a porcelain dish' is not descriptive of an eggcup. There is nowhere any reference to the control of the degree of stretching which is now said to be essential and to be afforded only by such a holder. The patentee testified on the trial that he tried and discarded many types of holder until he hit upon this one. If so, why did he not describe or claim it? He did so in an application for patent filed much later. He is upon the horns of a dilemma; he either discovered this form of holder and its virtues prior to the application for this \n\n[295 U.S. 237, 242]\n\u00a0\n patent or he found it later. If the first supposition be correct, his application violated R.S.  4888;7 if the second, his patent does not cover the eggcup holder.\n Nowhere does the claim or the specification disclose the element that the fabric must not be tautly stretched over the holder, or that it must be so held that the tension can be varied. It is said that the use of the present participle 'stretching' rather than the past participle 'stretched' makes the matter clear; but scrutiny of both claim and specification discloses no teaching as to the stretching of the fabric, or any regulation of the tension, or that it may not be tightly stretched over the holder and secured in that condition prior to commencing the repair. The specification of a 'sutable' holder certainly covers none of these alleged essentials. These omissions emphasize the failure to make the fair disclosure demanded by R.S.  4885 (35 USCA  33).\n The patentee says that in the old finger method the needle necessarily was held nearly in the plane of the fabric, whereas in his method it is approximately at a right angle thereto, and operated by a punching motion. The description of the operation in the patent is almost identical with that of Mrs. De Marr's abandoned application, drawn in Stephens' own hand, which was for the finger as contrasted with the punch method; and, so far as the angle at which the needle is to be held, is very similar to Pogson's disclosure in 1921, which Stephens says does not describe the punch method. When we come to the claim, we find the phrase 'while holding the device laterally out of alignment with the run.' This, we are told, is novel, and means that the needle is not to be used in or nearly parallel with the plane of the Fabric, \n\n[295 U.S. 237, 243]\n\u00a0\n but at an angle thereto. 'Laterally out of allignment to the run' is not equivalent to 'at an angle to the plane of the fabric.' That the applicant did not intend it to be so understood is shown by his repeated use of the word 'laterally,' in the specifications, as the equivalent of off to one side; and by this sentence: 'The clearance afforded ... makes it possible to hold the needle down closer to the fabric. ...' There is no disclosure of any up and down punch system, such as the defendants use.\n\n 2. \nPivoted latch needles are old in the art. Holders which have an opening to give room for the insertion of a needle such as that of an eggcup are old for use in darning. The method of reforming loops in knitted goods with pivoted latch needles was known prior to the application for this patent. The combination of the use of the eggcup type holder and the pivoted latch needle did not entitle Stephens to a patent, and the addition of the element that the needle should be held at an angle to the plane of the fabric, if that is in fact what the claim means, is insufficient to raise the method to the dignity of invention.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 60 F.(2d) 1009. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 72 F.(2d) 405. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] \n294 \nU.S. 702\n, 55 S.Ct. 514, 79 L.Ed. --. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Finch Corp. v.

One set of tables includes stores whose sales are in excess of a million dollars. They are divided into four classes (one million to two million; two million to four million; four million to ten million; ten million and over). Referring to these classes, the report says (page 10): 'While noticeable differences appeared in net profit for stores grouped according to volume of sales, these differences were even greater in the case of total net gain both as a percentage of net sales and as a percentage of net worth. In each instance these figures varied directly with the volume of sales, and a distinctly more favorable showing was made by the larger firms.' Another set of tables includes stores whose sales were under a million dollars. Among these the most favorable net profit showing was that of the group with volume of sales between one-quarter and one-half million. Between half a million and a million the ratio of increase declined. Even there, however, the showing was more favorable than for stores under a quarter of a million, where the average was one of loss. Bulletins 78, 83, and 85 state the operations for later years with results not greatly different. Even in years of loss, the percentage of loss had in the main a tendency to be lower as the volume of the sales increased. 'It is quite clear that the larger stores operated on a distinctly more satisfactory basis than the smaller stores, and that success as measured by earnings varies directly with size.'

At most, the operations of that year might call under the Kentucky decisions for a modification of the judgment.

KEYES(1935)\nNo. 142\nArgued: December 6, 1934Decided: May 20, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 403, 404]\n\u00a0\n Mr. William Neff, of Tulsa, Okl., for appellant.\n Mr. Richard H. Wills, of Tulsa, Okl., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This was a suit brought in a court of Seminole county, Okl., by a full-blood Creek Indian to recover an \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 405]\n\u00a0\n interest in land inherited from his grandmother, also a full-blood Creek Indian, and afterward sold by his guardian. The asserted grounds for a recovery were (1) that the proceedings whereby the plaintiff was adjudged an incompetent and subjected to guardianship on that basis, and also the proceedings leading to the sale, were invalid, because in some particulars irregular or not in accord with the laws of Oklahoma; (2) that the sale was in contravention of a controlling federal restriction on alienation; and (3) that an Act of Congress of April 12, 1926, c. 115,  2, 44 Stat. 239, permitted the suit to be brought within two years after the act's approval, notwithstanding any bar which may have arisen under the state statutes of limitation before such approval.\n The defendants answered and a trial was had at which judgment was given for them on a demurrer to the plaintiff's evidence. The Supreme Court of the state affirmed the judgment, 167 Okl. 531, 30 P.(2d) 875, and put its decision on the grounds (a) that the suit was barred by the state statutes of limitation, and (b) that the Act of Congress of April 12, 1926, relied on by the plaintiff as avoiding such a bar, could not be applied, because, if applied, if would deprive the defendants, who are holding under the guardian's sale, of vested rights without due process of law. The court's opinion did not mention the federal restriction on alienation set up by the plaintiff; but, of course, the judgment necessarily meant that the court regarded the asserted restriction as not requiring a different result.\n The plaintiff brings the case here by appeal, and complains that the Supreme Court of the state erred (1) in applying the state statutes of limitation over his objection that they could not be applied without bringing them into conflict with the federal statute restricting alienation, and (2) in holding the Act of Congress of April 12, 1926, invalid as applied to the situation disclosed. \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 406]\n\u00a0\n The facts in the light of which these complaints are to be considered are as follows:\n The plaintiff and his grandmother were full-blood Indians of the Creek Tribe, enrolled as such, and entitled to share in the allotment of the tribal lands among the members. She died before receiving her allotment, and after her death the land in question, which was part of the tribal lands, was allotted and patented in her right, the patent being issued to her 'heirs' without naming them. Under the applicable statute the heirs received the land as an inheritance from her and not as an allotment in their own right. \n1\n The plaintiff was one of the heirs. He also received an allotment in his own right; and thus, like many others, he had a personal allotment as well as an interest in inherited land.\n Thereafter, in 1907, the county court of Hughes county, Okl., regularly appointed John A. Jacobs guardian of the plaintiff's person and estate, he then being a minor, and that being the county of his residence. In 1914 that court entered an order (1) reciting it was made after a hearing in the plaintiff's presence and at which he was examined; (2) finding he was then over the age of 21 years, but was incompetent to manage his own affairs and still in need of a guardian; (3) also finding Jacobs, the then guardian, was a proper person to be continued as such; (4) declining to accept a resignation tendered by Jacobs; and (5) ordering that the guardianship be continued, and that thereafter Jacobs should act 'as guard- \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 407]\n\u00a0\n ian for North Stewart, incompetent,' and should 'be governed by the laws relating thereto.'1a Jacobs assented; and the subsequent proceedings were all entitled 'In the Matter of the Guardianship of Noah Stewart, an Incompetent.'\n In May, 1916, the guardian by a verified petition requested the county court to authorize a sale of the plaintiff's interest in the inherited land for the purpose of securing money needed for his maintenance and support and for the improvement of his personal allotment. A month later the court entered an order reciting a hearing on that petition after lawful notice; finding the proposed sale was necessary for the purposes named; and directing the guardian to make the sale. Under that order the guardian made the sale at public auction to the highest bidder and reported it to the county court. July 11, 1916, the court entered an order (1) finding that due notice of the intended sale was given, that the sale was fairly conducted and legally made, and that the price was not disproportionate to the value of the property; (2) confirming and approving the sale; and (3) directing the guardian to execute a deed to the purchaser. The purchase price was paid to the guardian and he executed and delivered to the purchaser a deed, which was filed for record in the proper office July 12, 1916. The purchaser then entered into possession and he and his grantees remained in possession continuously thereafter. The defendants are the present claimants under the guardian's sale.\n As part of the plaintiff's evidence, it was stipulated that the Secretary of the Interior had never removed any restrictions on the alienation of the inherited land, and that the same thing was true of the plaintiff's personal allot- \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 408]\n\u00a0\n ment. But the defendants, although joining in the stipulation, objected that the facts stipulated were immaterial.\n August 4, 1917, the county court after a hearing entered an order adjudging that the plaintiff had become competent and discharging the guardian. The present suit was begun April 11, 1928\n\n\n The Supreme Court of the state (167 Okl. 531, 30 P.(2d) 875, 877) in applying the state statutes of limitation said:\n'Under the provisions of section 1444, O.S. 1931, no action for the recovery of any estate, sold by a guardian, can be maintained by the ward, unless it is commenced within three years next after the termination of the guardianship, or when a legal disability to sue exists by reason of minority or otherwise, at the time when the cause of action accrues, within three years next after the removal thereof. The plaintiff could have commenced his action at any time within three years after August 4, 1917. Under the provisions of section 100, O.S. 1931, any person entitled to bring an action for the recovery of real property, who may be under any legal disability when the cause of action accrues, may bring his action within two years after the disability is removed. Under that statute the plaintiff could have brought his action within two years after August 4, 1917. Under the provisions of the second subdivision of section 99, O.S. 1931, an action for the recovery of real property sold by a guardian, upon an order or judgment of a court directing such sale, brought by the ward or his guardian, must be brought within five years after the date of the recording of the deed made in pursuance of the sale. Under that statute the plaintiff could have brought his action within five years after the 12th day of July, 1916.'\n\n Under the state statutes thus described, the court held that the plaintiff's asserted right to call in question the guardian's sale was barred before the suit was begun and \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 409]\n\u00a0\n before the approval of the Act of Congress of April 12, 1926.\n\n 1. \nWas the guardian's sale, as directed and approved by the county court, a forbidden alienation within the meaning of any then existing federal restriction? The plaintiff insists it was and points to the Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, as containing the restriction.\n As a preliminary to considering that statute, it will be helpful to refer to the conditions and legislation which preceded its enactment.\n The Creek Tribe was one of the Five Civilized Tribes, each of which owned and occupied a tribal domain in the Indian Territory. Congress never provided a territorial government for that Territory, but ultimately did establish local courts therein and invested them with probate, as well as civil and criminal, jurisdiction. The laws for the Territory consisted largely of Arkansas statutes put in force therein by Congress; and these statutes included chapters providing comprehensively for the administration of estates of decedents, minors and incompetents, and for the sale of their property. At first the adopted Arkansas statutes were not intended to be fully applicable to Indians, but Congress soon made them applicable to all persons, 'irrespective of race,' 2 and later on declared that the courts in the Territory should have 'full and complete jurisdiction' of all 'estates of decedents, the guardianships of minors and incompetents, whether Indians, freedmen, or otherwise.' \n3\n\u00a0\n\n November 16, 1907, the territory of Oklahoma and the Indian Territory were admitted into the Union as the state of Oklahoma under an enabling act passed by Congress June 16, 1906, c. 3335, 34 Stat. 267, and amended \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 410]\n\u00a0\n March 4, 1907, c. 2911, 34 Stat. 1286. The enabling act and the Constitution of the new state united in declaring that, with exceptions not material here, 'all laws in force in the Territory of Oklahoma' at the time of the state's admission should be 'in force throughout the State' and that the 'courts of original jurisdiction of such State' should be the successors of 'all courts of original jurisdiction of said Territories.'\n The laws of the territory of Oklahoma which were thus put in force 'throughout' the new state included comprehensive provisions for the administration of estates of decedents, the appointment of guardians of minors and incompetents, and the management and sale of their property. In the territory of Oklahoma jurisdiction over these subjects was vested in probate courts and by the Constitution of the new state that jurisdiction was committed to county courts.\n The lands of the Creek Tribe were allotted among its enrolled members pursuant to the Act of March 1, 1901, c. 676, 31 Stat. 861, as modified and supplemented by the Acts of June 30, 1902, c. 1323, 32 Stat. 500, and March 3, 1905, c. 1479, 33 Stat. 1071. Under these acts lands allotted to living members in their own right were subjected to specified restrictions on alienation; but those allotted in the right of deceased members were left unrestricted. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The Act of April 26, 1906, c. 1876, 34 Stat. 137, substituted a system of revised restrictions made applicable to all of the Five Civilized Tribes. In section 19 it dealt with restrictions relating to lands of living allottees, and in section 22 with those relating to inherited lands, including, as this court has held, lands allotted in the right of deceased members. \n5\n Under section 22 the right of full-blood Indian heirs to alienate the inherited lands was subjected to the \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 411]\n\u00a0\n restriction that the conveyance be approved by the Secretary of the Interior.\n The Act of May 27, 1908, c. 199, 35 Stat. 312, again revised the restrictions and practically substituted its section 1 for section 19 of the act of 1906, and its section 9 for section 22 of that act. Thus, like the act of 1906, it dealt with the restrictions relating to lands of living allottees separately from those relating to inherited lands.\n In section 1 the act of 1908, after declaring that certain lands of designated classes of allottees 'shall be free from all restrictions,' provides:\n'All homesteads of said allottees enrolled as mixed-blood Indians having half or more than half Indian blood, including minors of such degrees of blood, and all allotted lands of enrolled full-bloods, and enrolled mixed-bloos of three-quarters or more Indian blood, including minors of such degrees of blood, shall not be subject to alienation, contract to sell, power of attorney, or any other incumbrance prior to April twenty-sixth, nineteen hundred and thirty-one, except that the Secretary of the Interior may remove such restrictions, wholly or in part, under such rules and regulations concerning terms of sale and disposal of the proceeds for the benefit of the respective Indians as he may prescribe.'\n\n Counsel for the plaintiff place some reliance on that restriction. But there is no basis for doing so. The plaintiff's relation to the land in question was that of an heir, and not that of an allottee. \n6\n The land was allotted in the right of his deceased grandmother; so she rather than he should be regarded as the allottee.\n Section 9 relates to the alienation of inherited lands. So far as is material here it provides:\n'That the death of any allottee of the Five Civilized Tribes shall operate to remove all restrictions upon the alienation of said allottee's land: Provided, That no con- \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 412]\n\u00a0\n veyance of any interest of any full-blood Indian heir in such land shall be valid unless approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of said deceased allottee.'\n\n While this provision, if taken literally, might be regarded as confined to subsequent deaths and resulting heirships, a reading of the entire act, including its introductory sentence, shows that the purpose was to prescribe rules respecting future alienation by heirs-as well where they had become such before the act as where they might become such thereafter. The provision has been so applied by this court. \n7\n\u00a0\n\n The first sentence in the quoted part of section 9, where not restrained by the proviso, undoubtedly frees the inherited lands from all restrictions on alienation. But as respects an heir who is a full-blood Indian, the proviso obviously restrains that sentence, and, if taken literally, makes unlawful any conveyance of any interest of such an heir in the inherited lands unless the conveyance be approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of the deceased allottee. Here the heir was a full-blood Indian. So the question arises, whether the proviso is intended to include a conveyance made pursuant to a guardian's sale, such as was directed and approved by the county court in this instance.\n The proviso makes no mention of minors or incompetents under guardianship or of conveyances made by their guardians under the direction of courts having jurisdiction of their estates. Under other acts of Congress, the persons and estates of Indian minors and incompetents in the Indian Territory and the state of Oklahoma have long been subjected to the jurisdiction of local courts; and that jurisdiction is recognized throughout the allotment statutes before described and in section 2 of the act of 1908. True, \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 413]\n\u00a0\n that jurisdiction could not be exercised otherwise than in keeping with the laws of Congress relating to such Indians and their lands; but this constitutes no reason for putting aside the statutes granting and recognizing the jurisdiction when a related statute is being emamined and construed.\n The court which would have jurisdiction of the settlement of the estate of the deceased allottee (plaintiff's grandmother) is either the same county court that directed and approved the guardian's sale or the county court in an adjoining county. So, the court named in the proviso and the one which directed and approved the guardian's sale were either identical or of the same rank.\n A similar question respecting the construction and application of the proviso was considered by this court in 1920. The case involved a sale of inherited land by the guardian of minor heirs who were full-blood Creek Indians, the guardian having acted under the order of the court having control of the guardianship; and it was held that the proviso, rightly construed, did not include such a sale.\n In that case the court said:8\n'If in this instance the same court had had jurisdiction of the guardianship of the minor heirs and of the settlement of the estate of the deceased allottee, no embarrassment would have ensued; but as that was not the case, the question arises whether it was essential that the guardian's conveyance, directed and approved as it was, by the court having control of the guardianship, should also be approved by the court having jurisdiction of the settlement of the deceased allottee's estate. The Circuit Court of Appeals (250 F. 209) answered in the negative; and, while the question is not free from difficulty, we think that solution of it is right. \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 414]\n\u00a0\n 'Of course, the purpose in requiring any approval is to safeguard the interests of the full-blood Indian heir. Where he is a minor he can convey only through a guardian, and no court is in a better situation to appreciate and safeguard his interests than the one wherein the guardianship is pending. Besides, as a general rule, a guardianship carries with it exclusive power to direct the guardian and to supervise the management and disposal of the ward's property. It is so in Oklahoma. This rule is so widely recognized and so well grounded in reason that a purpose to depart from it ought not to be assumed unless manifested by some very clear or explicit provision. ... The proviso does not mention minors under guardianship; and to regard its general words as including them will either take all supervision of the sale of their interest in herited lands from the court in which the guardianship is pending, or subject that court's action to the approval of another court of the same rank. In either event conflict and confusion will almost certainly ensue and be detrimental to the minor heirs. But, if the proviso be regarded, as well it may, as referring to heirs not under guardianship ... all full- blood heirs will receive the measure of protection intended. We think this is the true construction.'\n\n In principle what was said there is applicable here. That the Indian heir in that case was a minor and in this was an incompetent is not material. The important thing, both there and here, is that the conveyance was made under the direction of the court having jurisdiction of a pending guardianship over the heir's estate. The guardianships were alike in point of congressional authorization and recognition, had like purposes, and were attended by like measures of control.\n Plainly the proviso should be read in connection with the statutes whereby Congress authorized and recognized such guardianships and in the light of familiar rules of \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 415]\n\u00a0\n construction. Upon such a reading it becomes reasonably certain that the proviso, although couched in general terms, is not intended to include a conveyance made by the guardian of a minor or incompetent heir pursuant to a sale directed and approved by the court having control of the guardianship of the heir's estate.\n The review which we have made of the federal restrictions shows that the guardian's sale was not a forbidden alienation under any of them.\n\n 2. \nWe come then to the contention respecting the application of the state statutes of limitation. It proceeds on the assumption, first, that the guardian's sale was in direct conflict with the federal restrictions on alienation; and, secondly, that the proceedings whereby the plaintiff was brought under guardianship as an incompetent, as also the later proceedings leading to the sale, were not in conformity with the state statutes, and that these irregularities brought the sale in conflict with the restrictions.\n We have already shown that the first assumption is not tenable. And we are of opinion the second is ill-grounded.\n When Congress subjected Indian minors and incompetents and their estates to the laws of the state in respect of guardianships, it did not thereby incorporate those laws into the federal restrictions. It merely gave its assent to their application to such Indians. The laws remained state laws, as before, and as such were to be applied to these Indians. Congress expressly imposed a limitation fixing stated ages of majority for them. This, of course, put that matter beyond the reach of the state statutes, and the courts of the state have so ruled. Apart from this limitation and some others not material here, the state laws have the same application to Indian guardianships that they have when the wards are minors or incompetents of other races. \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 416]\n\u00a0\n Whether the proceedings in such Indian guardianships conform to the state statutes is a question of state, not federal, law. And, in the absence of congressional provision to the contrary, the time and mode of seeking the correction of errors believed to have been committed by the state courts in such proceedings, as also the effect of inaction in that regard, are all controlled by the state laws, as in the instance of other guardianship proceedings.\n It follows from these considerations that, subject to a matter about to be considered, no federal statute or right was violated or infringed in applying the state statutes of limitation to this suit.\n\n 3. \nThe remaining question is whether there was error in the ruling that the Act of April 12, 1926, could not be given effect in this case without depriving the defendants of property contrary to the due process of law clause of the Constitution.\n The defendants hold the rights transferred by the guardian's sale and deed. The deed was filed for record July 12, 1916, and the grantee then went into possession. The plaintiff had then attained his majority, but was under guardianship as an incompetent. That disability and guardianship terminated August 4, 1917. The guardian's sale and deed were not challenged until April 11, 1928, when this suit was begun. In the meantime any right the plaintiff may have had to challenge the sale and deed had become barred by section 1444 and subdivision 2 of  99 of the state statutes of limitation (St. 1931). The bar became effective July 12, 1921, if not August 4, 1920, in that under the operation of those statutes the guardian's sale and deed then ripened into an unassailable title.\n Section 2 of the Act of April 12, 1926 (44 Stat. 240) declares that:\n'No cause of action which heretofore shall have accrued to' any restricted Indian of any of the Five Civilized Tribes 'shall be barred prior to the expiration of a \n\n[295 U.S. 403, 417]\n\u00a0\n period of two years from and after the approval of this Act, even though the full statutory period of limitation shall already have run or shall expire during said two years' period, and any such restricted Indian, if competent to sue, or his guardian, or the United States in his behalf, may sue upon any such cause of action during such two years' period free from any bar of the statutes of limitations.'\n\n We are of opinion that so much of the section as purports to free from any bar of the statutes of limitation a cause of action such as is here presented, notwithstanding the full period of limitation had run prior to the act's approval, falls nothing short of an attempt arbitrarily to take property from one having a perfect title and to subject it to an extinguished claim of another.\n As respects suits to recover real or personal property where the right of action has been barred by a statute of limitations and a later act has attempted to repeal or remove the bar after it became complete, the rule sustained by teason and preponderant authority is that the removing act cannot be given effect consistently with constitutional provisions forbidding a deprivation of property without due process of law. 9 'The reason is,' as this court has said, 'that, by the law in existence before the repealing act, the property had become the defendant's. Both the legal title and the real owership had become vested in him, and to give the act the effect of transferring this title ... would be to deprive him of his property without due process of law.' \n10\n\u00a0\n\n The state court so ruled in this suit, and we sustain that ruling.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The allotment in the right of the grandmother was made under section 28 of the act of March 1, 1901 (31 Stat. 869) which, after providing for the enrollment of all tribal citizens living on April 1, 1899, declares, 'and if any such citizen has died since that time, or may hereafter die, before receiving his allotment of lands and distributive share of all the funds of the tribe, the lands and money to which he would be entitled, if living, shall descend to his heirs ... and be allotted and distributed to them accordingly.' \n 1a See Mullen v.

Mullen, both of Washington, D. C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Frank J. Wideman, Asst. Atty. Gen., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Sandy Fox, for whom this suit was instituted, is a full-blood Creek Indian. Certain funds, said to have been \n\n[295 U.S. 418, 419]\n\u00a0\n derived from his restricted allotment, in excess of his needs were invested. The proceeds therefrom were collected and held in trust under direction of the Secretary of Interior. The question now presented is whether this income was subject to the federal tax laid by the 1928 Revenue Act (chapter 852,  11, 12, 45 Stat. 791, 26 USCA  2011, 2012). The Commissioner, the Board of Tax Appeals, and the court below answered in the affirmative.\n Petitioner maintains that the court should have followed the rule which it applied in Blackbird v. Commissioner (C.C.A.) 38 F.(2d) 976, 977; also that it erroneously held Congress intended to tax income derived from investment of funds arising from restricted lands belonging to a full- blood Creek Indian.\n Blackbird, restricted full-blood Osage, maintained that she was not subject to the federal income tax statute. The court sustained that view and declared:\n'Her property is under the supervising control of the United States. She is its ward, and we cannot agree that because the income statute, Act of 1918 (40 Stat. 1057), and Act of 1921 (42 Stat. 227), subjects 'the net income of every individual' to the tax, this is alone sufficient to make the Acts applicable to her. Such holding would be contrary to the almost unbroken policy of Congress in dealing with its Indian wards and their affairs. Whenever they and their interests have been the subject affected by legislation they have been named and their interests specifically dealt with.'\n\n This does not harmonize with what we said in Choteau v. Burnet (1931) \n283 \nU.S. 691, 693\n, 696 S., 51 S.Ct. 598, 600:\n'The language of sections 201 and 211(a) (Revenue Act 1918) subjects the income of 'every individual' to tax. Section 213(a) includes income 'from any source whatever.' \n1\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 418, 420]\n\u00a0\n The intent of Congress was to levy the tax with respect to all residents of the United States and upon all sorts of income. The act does not expressly exempt the sort of income here involved, nor a person having petitioner's status respecting such income, and we are not referred to any other statute which does. ... The intent to exclude must be definitely expressed, where, as here, the general language of the act laying the tax is broad enough to include the subject-matter.'\n\n The court below properly declined to follow its quoted pronouncement in Blackbird's Case. The terms of the 1928 Revenue Act are very broad, and nothing there indicates that Indians are to be excepted. See Irwin v. Gavit, \n268 \nU.S. 161\n, 45 S.Ct. 475; Heiner v. Colonial Trust Co., \n275 \nU.S. 232\n, 48 S.Ct. 65; Helvering v. Stockholms, etc ., Bank, \n293 \nU.S. 84\n, 55 S.Ct. 50; Pitman v. Commissioner (C. C.A.) 64 F.(2d) 740. The purpose is sufficiently clear.\n It is affirmed that 'inalienability and nontaxability go hand in hand; and that it is not lightly to be assumed that Congress intended to tax the ward for the benefit of the guardian.'\n The general terms of the taxing act include the income under consideration and if exemption exists it must derive plainly from agreements with the Creeks or some act of Congress dealing with their affairs.\n Neither the Creek agreement of 1901 (31 Stat. 861), nor the Supplemental Agreement of 1902 (32 Stat. 500), conferred general exemption from taxation upon Indians; homesteads only were definitely excluded, although alienation of allotted lands was restricted.\n The suggestion that exemption must be inferred from the Act of April 26, 1906 (34 Stat. 137) or Act of May 27, 1908 \n\n[295 U.S. 418, 421]\n\u00a0\n (35 Stat. 312) is not well founded. The first of these extended restrictions upon the alienation of allotments for twenty-five years unless sooner removed by Congress, and provided: 'Sec. 19. ... That all lands upon which restrictions are removed shall be subject to taxation, and the other lands shall be exempt from taxation as long as the title remains in the original allottee.' This exemption related to land and not to income derived from investment of surplus income from land. Moreover, the act itself was superseded by the second one which did not contain the quoted provision, but declared: 'Sec. 4. That all land from which restrictions have been or shall be removed shall be subject to taxation and all other civil burdens as though it were the property of other persons than allottees of the Five Civilized Tribes. ...'\n We find nothing in either act which expresses definite intent to exclude from taxation such income as that here involved. See Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., \n276 \nU.S. 575, 581\n, 48 S.Ct. 333.\n Nor can we conclude that taxation of income from trust funds of an Indian ward is so inconsistent with that relationship that exemption is a necessary implication. Non-taxability and restriction upon alienation are distinct things. Choate v. Trapp, \n224 \nU.S. 665, 673\n, 32 S.Ct. 565. The taxpayer here is a citizen of the United States, and wardship with limited power over his property does not, without more, render him immune from the common burden.\n Shaw v. Gibson-Zahniser Oil Corp., supra, held that restricted land purchased for a full-blood Creek-ward of the United States-with trust funds was not free from state taxation, and declared that such exemption could not be implied merely because of the restrictions upon the Indian's power to alienate.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Like provisions are in sections 210 and 211(a), Revenue Acts 1921, 1924, 1926 (26 USCA  951, 952 notes), and sections 11 and 12(a), Revenue Act 1928 (26 USCA  2011, 2012(a); section 213(a), Revenue Acts 1921, 1924, 1926 (26 USCA  954(a) and note), and section 22, Revenue Act 1928 ( 26 USCA  2022). \n\n\n\n\n","170":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSWANSON v.

Atty. Gen., for respondent. \n\n[296 U.S. 362, 363]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The question presented is whether the income of the 'Lake View Land Association' for the years 1925 and 1926 was subject to tax as the income of a trust under section 219 of the Revenue Act of 1926,1 or as the income of an 'association' by virtue of section 2(a)(2) of that act. \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals held the taxpayer to be an 'association' and affirmed the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals to that effect. 76 f.(2d) 651, 652. This Court granted a writ of certiorari. See Morrissey v. Commissioner, \n296 \nU.S. 344\n, 56 S.Ct. 289, decided this day.\n The material facts as found by the Board of Tax Appeals are as follows: Joseph E. Swanson and Ralph C. Otis, in 1914, acquired a piece of vacant land in the city of Chicago with the view of improving it by the erection of an apartment house, the title being taken by Swanson. An apartment house was built. Subsequently, in 1915, at the suggestion of their attorney, they entered into a trust agreement for the purpose of carrying the title to the property. The trust was designated as the 'Lake View Land Association.' The first trustees were Ralph C. Otis, Joseph E. Swanson, and Allen G. Mills. Petitioners set forth the following summary of the trust agreement, taken from the opinion of the Circuit Court of Appeals:\n'Under the trust agreement, the trustees were given the complete management and control of the property, to exchange, reconstruct, remodel, sell, or improve at their discretion or to borrow money secured by the property. They were authorized to rent suitable quarters for the transaction of the business of the trust and employ such \n\n[296 U.S. 362, 364]\n\u00a0\n assistants as they required. The agreement provided for the issuance of 'receipts to evidence the interests of the beneficiaries, representing 1, 000 shares at the par value of $100 each. It was provided that the receipts were evidences of the ownership of personal property and not real estate. They might be transferred by assignment. Originally, one-half of the shares were issued to Otis and one-half to Swanson, who later transferred their interests to their wives, who owned the shares during 1925 and 1926. The agreement provided that the trust could sue and be sued; 3 that neither the trustees nor the beneficiaries should be personally liable, and that all persons dealing with the trustees must look only to the property of the trust; that it should be terminated at the expiration of twenty years after the death of the last survivor of certain named persons or by the trustees in their discretion at any time before the expiration of the twenty years by selling all the property held by them as such and distributing the net proceeds of such sale. The trust had succession and was not terminated by the death of a trustee or beneficiary.'\n\n The Court of Appeals also stated that 'the trustees of the Lake View Land Association never assembled in formal meetings, never adopted resolutions or took formal action with reference to the affairs of the property, kept no minute books, had no by-laws. They elected no officers and no so-called board of directors.'\n The compensation of the trustees was to be fixed by themselves, but was not to exceed 2 1\/2 per cent. of the gross income of the trust. After making provision for the payment of outstanding claims, the net income was to be divided among the beneficiaries according to their interests, and on the request of any beneficiary the trustees \n\n[296 U.S. 362, 365]\n\u00a0\n were to render annual accounts. The trust agreement also made provision for a written registry of beneficiaries, who could transfer their interests in a described manner, after having first offered them to the other beneficiaries.\n The renting of apartments, the details of management, and the distribution of net income were committed to a firm (of which Joseph E. Swanson was a member) engaged in the business of buying and selling real estate and managing properties. That firm acted under the direction of Ralph C. Otis and Joseph E. Swanson and the 'entire affairs of the Lake View Land Association' were at all times in their hands.\n Applying the governing principles, as set forth in our opinion in Morrissey v. Commissioner, supra, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the trust constituted an association and was taxable as such. The limited number of actual beneficiaries did not alter the nature and purpose of the common undertaking. Nor did the fact that the operations of the association did not extend beyond the real property first acquired change the quality of that undertaking.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Judgment affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 44 Stat. 32, 26 U.S.C.A.  161-167 and notes. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 44 Stat. 9, 26 U.S.C.A.  1696(3). \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Petitioners submit that this provision of the agreement should, under the law of Illinois, be taken to imply that the trustees could sue and be sued as individuals, and not 'the trust as an entity.' \n\n\n\n\n","171":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSWINSON v. CHICAGO, ST. P., M. & O. RY. CO.(1935)\nNo. 383\nArgued: Decided: March 11, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Ernest A. Michel and Tom Davis, both of Minneapolis, Minn., for petitioner.\n Mr. Warren Newcome, of St. Paul, Minn., for respondent. \n\n[294 U.S. 529, 530]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Swinson, a freight brakeman in the employ of the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis & Omaha Railway, brought this action under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) in the federal District Court for Minnesota. The accident occurred while he was releasing a hand brake at the end of a tank car. The brake was tightly set. To release it required the application of considerable force to the brake wheel. In order to exert such force, Swinson placed his left foot on the running board, his right foot on a grabiron or handhold, which consisted of a round iron bar bent at the ends, attached horizontally to the under side of the running board, and extending beyond it a few inches. As he exerted foot pressure on the grabiron, the plank to which it was attached split, and one of the bolts securing the grabiron pulled through. As a result, he lost his balance, fell in front of the moving car, and was seriously injured. The parties were engaged, and the car was used, in interstate commerce.\n Swinson claimed that the railway was liable, independently of negligence on its part, because it had failed to provide the 'secure grab irons or handholds' required by the Safety Appliance Act. \n1\n The railway contended that it was not liable because the grabiron had been used by Swinson for a purpose for which it was not intended; since the purpose of Congress in requiring 'secure grab irons or handholds' was to supply an appliance to grasp with the \n\n[294 U.S. 529, 531]\n\u00a0\n hands, not to provide a foot brace or support to secure leverage in releasing a hand brake. Although there was evidence that the grabiron was inadequate and defective even for its so-called 'intended use' of being grasped by the hands, and also evidence that the use which Swinson had made of the grabiron was customary, the trial court sustained the railway's contention and directed a verdict for it. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment entered upon the verdict, 72 F.(2d) 649. Certiorari was granted, \n293 \nU.S. 546\n, 55 S.Ct. 123, 79 L.Ed. --, because the precise question, which is of importance, had not been dediced by this Court.\n The Safety Appliance Act (45 USCA  1 et seq.) has been liberally construed so as to give a right of recovery for every injury the proximate cause of which was a failure to comply with a requirement of the act. Thus, although the act was intended primarily for the protection of railroad employees, it was held in Fairport, Painesville & Eastern R. Co. v. Meredith, \n292 \nU.S. 589\n, 54 S.Ct. 826, that a traveler on the highway could recover for injury resulting from failure to maintain in usable condition the power brake required by the Safety Appliance Act. Although this section of the act was originally intended for 'greater security to men in coupling and uncoupling cars,' it was held in Davis v. Wolfe, \n263 \nU.S. 239, 243\n, 44 S.Ct. 64, 66, that a freight train conductor could recover for an injury resulting from failure of a grabiron, which he had grasped while standing on the sill step and signaling the fireman. There, the Court said that an employee 'can recover if the failure to comply with the requirements of the Act is a proximate cause of the accident, resulting in injury to him while in the discharge of his duty, although not engaged in an operation in which the safety appliances are specifically designed to furnish him protection.'\n As failure of the grabiron was the proximate cause of the injury, it was error to direct a verdict for the defendant. There was evidence on which the jury might have \n\n[294 U.S. 529, 532]\n\u00a0\n found that the grabiron was not secure for use strictly as a handhold; and that if it had been, it would not have failed, since the use made of it by Swinson did not subject it to appreciably greater strain. There was evidence, also, that use as a foot brace was a natural and not unusual one. For such a use of the grabiron, Swinson was entitled to assume that it was secure. Compare Lehigh Valley R. Co. v. Howell (C.C.A.) 6 F.(2d) 784; Didinger v. Pennsylvania R. Co.

Barry, of Fort Smith, Ark., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND delivered the opinion of the Court.\n These cases, depending upon the same facts, present the same question. On January 10, 1931, in an insolvency proceeding, Taylor was appointed by a state chancery court in Arkansas receiver of the Parks Dry Goods Company, and Duty as his attorney. On February 11th, a month later, a petition in bankruptcy against the corporation was filed in the federal District Court having jurisdiction. Two days later, the corporation was adjudicated a bankrupt. On the same day, the chancery court allowed Taylor compensation as receiver in the sum of $1,500, and Duty compensation as attorney in the sum of $500. The receiver turned over the estate to the trustee with the exception of these sums, which petitioners refused to deliver. The trustee applied for a summary order upon petitioners, directing them to turn over to him the sums thus withheld. The referee granted the trustee's application, which the District Court sitting in bankruptcy, affirmed; and this, in turn, was affirmed upon appeal by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 71 F.(2d) 157. Upon these facts, the question presented is whether the bankruptcy court had authority to compel the turnover by summary proceeding and order, or whether petitioners \n\n[293 U.S. 470, 472]\n\u00a0\n were adverse claimants so that a plenary action was required.\n Upon adjudication in bankruptcy, an the property of the bankrupt rests in the trustee as of the date of the filing of the petition. Upon such filing, the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court becomes paramount and exclusive; and thereafter that court's possession and control of the estate cannot be affected by proceedings in other courts, whether state or federal.

Metzel (C.C.A.) 230 F. 40, 44, 45, and cases cited.\n The status of a receiver is unlike, for example, that of an assignee for the benefit of creditors. The receiver is an officer of the court which appoints him. Stuart v. Boulware, \n133 \nU.S. 78, 81\n, 10 S.Ct. 242. The property in his hands is not, in a legal sense, in his possession. It is in the possession of the court, whose appointee he is, by him as its officer. Thompson v. Phenix Ins. Co., \n136 \nU.S. 287, 297\n, 10 S.Ct. 1019; Fosdick v. Schall, \n99 U.S. 235\n, 251. In the present case, with the supervening bankruptcy, the possession of the state court came to an end, and that of the bankruptcy court immediately attached. This result was binding upon the state court and equally binding upon the receiver as custodian for that court. Before the petition in bankruptcy was filed, the receiver's compensation as well as that of his counsel were matters wholly within the control of the state court. Stuart v. Boulware, supra, at pages 81, 82, of 133 U.S., 10 S.Ct. 242; High on Receivers (4th Ed.)  781. But with the \n\n[293 U.S. 470, 473]\n\u00a0\n filing of the petition in bankruptcy, the power of the state court in that respect ceased; and its order fixing the compensation of the receiver and his counsel was a nullity because made without jurisdiction, such jurisdiction then having passed to the bankruptcy court. Gross v. Irving Trust Co., supra.\n Since the order of the state court was the sole foundation for their claims and that was void, petitioners had no more right to the sums subtracted or to be subtracted from the estate than they had to the remainder of the estate. That estate, including such sums, was still in custodia legis-only the possession had passed automatically from the state court to the bankruptcy court. Thereafter, the estate in its entirety was held by the receiver as a mere repository for the bankruptcy court and therefore not adversely; and petitioners, in respect of that part of it erroneously awarded as compensation, were in no sense adverse claimants. Their claims were colorable only and subject to the summary power of the bankruptcy court.

Andrew G. Haley, of Washington, D.C., and John P. Hannon and Wm. P. Lord, both of Portland, Or., for petitioner.\n Messrs. W. Lair Thompson and Wallace McCamant, both of Portland, Or., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner was a passenger on the steamship 'Admiral Peoples' on her voyage from Wilmington, Cal., to Portland, Or. While disembarking at Portland, petitioner was injured by falling from a gangplank leading from the vessel to the dock. This libel in rem against the vessel alleged that respondent placed the gangplank so that it sloped from the ship toward the dock at an angle of from ten to fifteen degrees; that it was approximately two feet in width and eighteen feet in length and was equipped with the usual rope railings which terminated approximately three feet from each end; that the level of the plank at the shore end was about six inches above the level of the dock, thereby creating a step from the plank to the dock; that upon instructions from one of respondent's officers, libelant proceeded along the plank, and as she reached its lower end, being unaware of the step and having no warning, she fell from the plank and was 'violently and forcibly thrown forward upon the \n\n[295 U.S. 649, 651]\n\u00a0\n dock in such manner as to cause the injuries hereinafter set forth.' Libelant alleged negligence in failing to provide a hand rope or railing extending along either side of the gangplank to the shore end, in failing to have the plank flush with the dock or taper off to the level of the dock, and in failing to give warning of the step.\n Respondent's exception to the libel, upon the ground that the case was not within the admiralty jurisdiction, was sustained by the District Court, and its judgment dismissing the libel was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. In view of an asserted conflict with other decisions of the federal courts,1 we granted a writ of certiorari. \n294 \nU.S. 702\n, 55 S. Ct. 546, 79 L.Ed. --.\n This is one of the border cases involving the close distinctions which from time to time are necessary in applying the principles governing the admiralty jurisdiction. That jurisdiction in cases of tort depends upon the locality of the injury. It does not extend to injuries caused by a vessel to persons or property on the land. Where the cause of action arises upon the land, the state law is applicable. The Plymouth, 3 Wall. 20, 33; Johnson v. Chicago & Pacific Elevator Co., \n119 \nU.S. 388, 397\n, 7 S.Ct. 254. 30 L.Ed. 447; Cleveland, Terminal & V.R. Co. v. Cleveland Steamship Co., \n208 \nU.S. 316, 319\n, 28 S.Ct. 414, 13 Ann.Cas. 1215; Atlantic Transport Co. v. Imbrovek, \n234 \nU.S. 52, 59\n, 34 S. Ct. 733, 51 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1157; State Industrial Commission v. Nordenholt Company, \n259 \nU.S. 263, 272\n, 42 S.Ct. 473, 25 A. L.R. 1013; T. Smith & Son v. Taylor, \n276 \nU.S. 179, 181\n, 48 S.Ct. 228; compare Vancouver S.S. Co. v. Rice, \n228 \nU.S. 445, 448\n, 53 S.Ct. 420.\n The basic fact in the instant case is that the gangplank was a part of the vessel. It was a part of the vessel's equipment which was placed in position to enable its passengers to reach the shore. It was no less a part of the vessel because in its extension to the dock it pro- \n\n[295 U.S. 649, 652]\n\u00a0\n jected over the land. Thus, while libelant was on the gangplank, she had not yet left the vessel. This was still true as she proceeded to the shore end of the plank. If while on that part of the vessel she had been hit by a swinging crane and had been precipitated upon the dock, the admiralty would have had jurisdiction of her claim. See Minnie v. Port Huron Terminal Company, \n295 \nU.S. 647\n, 55 S.Ct. 884, 79 L.Ed. --, decided this day. If instead of being struck in this way, the negligent handling of the vessel, as by a sudden movement, had caused her to fall from the gangplank, the cause of action would still have arisen on the vessel. We perceive no basis for a sound distinction because her fall was due to negligence in the construction or placing of the gangplank. By reason of that neglect, as the libel alleges, she fell from the plank and was violently thrown forward upon the dock. Neither the short distance that she fell, nor the fact that she fell on the dock and not in the water, alters the nature of the cause of action which arose from the breach of duty owing to her while she was still on the ship and using its facility for disembarking.\n This view is supported by the weight of authority in the federal courts. In The Strabo (D.C.) 90 F. 110, Id. (C.C.A.) 98 F. 998, libelant, who was working on a vessel lying at a dock, attempted to leave the vessel by means of a ladder which, by reason of the master's negligence, was not secured properly to the ship's rail and in consequence the ladder fell and the libelant was thrown to the dock and injured. The District Court, sustaining the admiralty jurisdiction, asked these pertinent questions (90 F. 110, page 113): 'If a passenger, standing at the gangway, for the purpose of alighting, were disturbed by some negligent act of the master, would the jurisdiction of this court depend upon the fact whether he fell on the deck, and remained there, or whether he was precipitated upon the dock in the first instance, or finally landed there after first falling on some part of the ship? If a seaman, by the master's neglect, \n\n[295 U.S. 649, 653]\n\u00a0\n should fall overboard, would this court entertain jurisdiction if the seaman fell in the water, and decline jurisdiction if he fell on the dock or other land? The inception of a cause of action is not usually defined by such a rule.' The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Second Circuit, affirming the decision of the District Court (98 F. 998, page 1000), thought it would be a too literal and an inadmissible interpretation of the language used in The Plymouth, supra, to say that 'if a passenger on board a steamship should, through the negligence of the owners, stumble on the ship upon a defective gangplank, and be precipitated upon the wharf, the injury would not be a maritime tort.' 'The language employed in the Plymouth decision,' said the court, 'and which was applicable to the circumstances of that case, does not justify such a conclusion.' And, deciding the case before it, the Circuit Court of Appeals said: 'The cause of action originated and the injury had commenced on the ship, the consummation somewhere being inevitable. It is not of vital importance to the admiralty jurisdiction whether the injury culminated on the stringpiece of the wharf or in the water.' See, also, The Atna (D.C.) 297 F. 673, 675, 676; The Brand (D.C.) 29 F.(2d) 792.\n In L'Hote v. Crowell (C.C.A.) 54 F.(2d) 212, 213, a longshoreman, who had been working on a wharf in putting bales in a sling which was raised by the ship's tackle and then lowered into its hold, was riding on the last load when the sling struck against the rail or side of the ship, with the result the he fell to the wharf and was injured. The Circuit Court of Appeals of the Fifth Circuit said that he had 'finished his work on the wharf and from the time he was lifted from it by the sling by means of the ship's tackle was under the control of an instrumentality of the ship'; and, in that view, the jurisdiction of admiralty was sustained. The ruling in that case was not disturbed by our decision on certiorari (as the Circuit Court of Ap- \n\n[295 U.S. 649, 654]\n\u00a0\n peals in the instant case mistakenly supposed), as our writ was expressly limited to the question raised by the review of the deputy commissioner's finding as to the dependency of a claimant for compensation under the Longshoremen's and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act, 33 USCA  901-950. \n285 \nU.S. 533\n, 52 S.Ct. 406. We decided simply that the finding of the deputy commissioner, upon evidence, against the dependency of the claimant, was final, and accordingly we directed the affirmance of his order. \n286 \nU.S. 528\n, 52 S.Ct. 499. See Voehl v. Indemnity Insurance Co., \n288 \nU.S. 162, 166\n, 53 S.Ct. 380, 87 A.L.R. 245.\n We think that the libel presented a case within the jurisdiction of admiralty. The decree of the Circuit Court of Appeals is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Compare The Strabo (D.C.) 90 F. 110; Id.

CO.(1935)\nNo. 521\nArgued: February 13, 1935Decided: March 4, 1935\n\n\n\n Mr. Homer L. Loomis, of New York City, for petitioner.\n Mr. D. Roger Englar, of New York City, for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Three shipments totaling 4,266 barrels of cherries in brine were loaded at Italian ports upon the steamship Ansaldo San Giorgio I consigned to the respondent at ports in the \n\n[294 U.S. 494, 495]\n\u00a0\n United States. The cargo arrived in bad condition due to improper stowage and the respondent filed a libel to recover damages. Trial in the District Court resulted in an interlocutory decree for the respondent. \n1\n The cause was referred to a commissioner, who found that the containers and the cherries were in good condition when shipped, 162 barrels had become a total loss and there was additional damage equivalent to a loss of 419 barrels. He computed the damages on the basis of the market value of the goods at destination on the date of arrival. The petitioner resisted any award, relying on the following clause in the bills of lading: 'In the event of claims for loss, damage or short delivery the same shall be adjusted on the basis of the invoice value of the entire shipment adding expenses necessarily incurred.' The proof was that, owing to favorable market conditions existing at destination, the market value of all the merchandise which remained, sound as well as damaged, exceeded the values stated in the invoices, plus freight. The commissioner held the quoted clause an invalid stipulation exempting the carrier from liability for negligence, as there was no showing that the shipper had been offered a choice of rates adjusted according to the value placed upon the goods. Upon exceptions, the district court accepted the commissioner's findings, but held the clause a reasonable and lawful agreement for measuring damages, and denied the respondent any recovery. \n2\n The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decree and affirmed the computation of damages submitted by the commissioner. \n3\n Though no conflict of decision in the federal appellate courts is cited, and the novelty of the question presented \n\n[294 U.S. 494, 496]\n\u00a0\n would not, in the absence of general importance, move us to grant certiorari, we issued the writ4 because the decision below is alleged to conflict with principles established by our decisions. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n The question presented is whether the cause appearing in the bill of lading is valid and constitutes a defense to the shipper's claim for negligence damage to a portion of the consignment.\n A common carrier is answerable for loss or damage to the goods transported from any cause save the act of God or the public enemy. The measure of the shipper's recovery is normally the market value of the goods at destination, in like condition as they were when shipped, on the date when they should have arrived. \n6\n The carrier may exempt himself by contract from liability for the consequences of events beyond his control, 7 but he cannot contract for relief from liability for his own negligence, even though he give a special consideration for an agreement to that effect. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Two so-called valuation clauses have been in frequent use. One is a true limitation agreement. It recites that a sum named in the bill of lading is the agreed value of the goods, or their value per unit or per package, in the absence of the shipper's declaration of a higher value; that the rate is fixed with reference to the specified value, and if a greater be declared a higher rate will apply; that in consideration of the rate to be charged, the carrier's liability \n\n[294 U.S. 494, 497]\n\u00a0\n for loss or damage shall be limited to the stipulated value. In case of loss or damage this clause enures to the carrier's, but not to the shipper's benefit. The latter can in no event recover more than his actual loss, but may have to take much less. The damages are computed in the usual way without reference to the stipulation, but, if when so computed they exceed the agreed limit of value, no recovery of the excess may be had. \n9\n Such a stipulation, we have said, is not enforcible unless the shipper, for agreeing to such a limitation of the carrier's liability, receives a consideration consisting in the offer of a lower rate as against a higher rate offered for the service without such limitation;10 or, as has been said, the rate is tied to the release. \n11\n Agreements of this kind are held to be reasonable and not offensive to the public policy against contracts relieving the carrier from its own negligence. \n12\n The agreement as to value in consideration of carriage at the lower rate thus obtained is held to estop the shipper from demanding damages in excess of the agreed value.\n The other is a true valuation clause. It is to the effect that in event of loss or damage for which the carrier is liable, the same shall be computed on the basis of the value of the goods at the place and time of shipment. Such a provision may benefit the shipper if the goods depreciate prior to the time for delivery by the carrier, and may lessen the carrier's normal liability if they should appreciate prior to that time. This and other federal \n\n[294 U.S. 494, 498]\n\u00a0\n courts have decided a number of cases in which it appeared that a bill of lading embodied such a stipulation. In some the parties treated the clause as binding and no decision was made on the point. \n13\n In one case it was held to be prohibited by the Cummins Amendment to the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  20),14 but its validity in cases not controlled by that enactment was not decided. In several cases there are expressions, not necessary to the decisions, to the effect that it is a reasonable and lawful provision for measuring damages. 15 In none was there a decision that a choice of rates was essential to its validity, although there are indications of that view. \n16\n The contention is that as no alternative rate applicable to liability measured by full value at destination was here afforded the shipper the clause is void. The weight of authority in the state courts seems to be in favor of upholding the clause even though no such choice is open to the shipper. \n17\n There is much to be said in favor of an agreement by which the parties adopt an agreed value as a measure of recovery for loss or damage to goods not delivered by the carrier or damaged in transit. We have no occasion to determine the requirements or the validity of such a contract, as we are of opinion, that whatever is the right view as to such a valuation clause, the one here employed would be unreasonable and contrary to public policy even if supported by a valid \n\n[294 U.S. 494, 499]\n\u00a0\n consideration, and cannot estop the respondent to claim damages measured according to the general rule. The contract plaintiff requires that if, after deduction of all loss and damage, the remaining cargo, in its then condition is worth more at destination than the whole cargo at place and time of shipment, the carrier shall be wholly exonerated. As pointed out by the court below if there were a short delivery of fifty cases out of a shipment of one hundred cases, but the market value of the goods delivered at the port of destination were equal to the invoice value of the hundred cases, plus freight, the carrier would pay nothing for negligent loss of half the shipment. Such an agreement is against public policy as its effect is to relieve the carrier from the consequences of its negligence. \n 18\n\u00a0\n\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 1928 A.M.C. 109.

Co. and others.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This cause calls for the application of familiar principles governing the issuance of the writ of mandamus. The petitioners urge that the courts below erred in denying the writ. For an understanding of the contention the circumstances out of which the litigation arose should be stated.\n Prior to the year 1906, ten railroads entering Kansas City used a union depot. Two others, the Chicago Great Western and the Kansas City Southern (the petitioners), \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 53]\n\u00a0\n used the station belonging to the latter. The union station was inadequate, and there was agitation for better facilities. As a consequence, the ten roads set about to acquire the necessary property and rights and to construct a new union terminal. The instrumentality created for the purpose was the respondent the Kansas City Terminal Railway Company, a corporation organized by the railroads, for whose stock they subscribed in equal shares. This company acquired from the constituent roads and from others the property and franchises requisite to the construction of the terminal. In addition to the moneys subscribed for stock, the terminal company borrowed in excess of $50,000,000.\n The financing and operation of the project was governed by an operating agreement between the railroads, the terminal company, and a trustee, which provided, amongst other things, for the construction, maintenance, and operation of the terminal and its use by the proprietary companies throughout a term of two hundred years; equal ownership of the terminal company's stock; the admittance of other railroads on equal terms as to ownership of stock and use of the property by consent of two-thirds of the participants not in default under the agreement; issuance and sale of the terminal company's bonds secured by mortgage on its property; payment by each proprietary road of an equal share of taxes and governmental charges of the company and of interest and principal of its mortgage indebtedness; payment of a defaulting railroad's share of these charges by the remaining proprietaries in equal shares; exclusion of any defaulting road from the use of the facilities; the sharing of expenses of maintenance and operation by the using companies in proportion to each one's use. The stock of the terminal company was deposited with a trustee, subject to a voting trust, to prevent its transfer to any one not a party to the operating agreement. The roads also assigned the operating agreement to the mortgage trustee as additional \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 54]\n\u00a0\n security. In 1910 the petitioners became parties to the agreement pursuant to its provisions.\n The appointment of receivers in 1915 for the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company, one of the proprietary railroads, was followed by foreclosure under its mortgages. The decree of sale in foreclosure permitted the purchaser to adopt or reject any executory contract of the debtor. The purchasers organized the Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railroad Company (hereinafter designated M., K. & T.) to take title to the property, and that company elected not to be bound by the operating agreement, with the result that it was without terminal facilities in Kansas City. Because of this lack, it applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission pursuant to section 3(4) of the Interstate Commerce Act1 for an order granting it the right to use the terminal, conditioned on payment of compensation proportioned to use. A temporary order was issued, and the matter set for final hearing. Prior to the hearing, all of the eleven remaining railroads, parties to the operating agreement, intervened. Those designated as the larger users of the terminal opposed the granting of the petition. Those termed the smaller users (including the petitioners in the present case) asked that, if the prayer of the M., K. & T. should be granted, they be afforded relief from the hardship and inequality of burden imposed upon them by the agreement by revision of the existing arrangement so that they might thereafter make use of the terminal upon terms as favorable as might be greanted the M., K. & T. They based their request upon sections 3(1)(3)( 4) and 15a of the act to regulate commerce, as amended, 49 USCA  3(1, 3, 4), 15a. A motion was made to strike the intervening petitions of the small users on various grounds, amongst them that the Commission had no power to make an order superseding, modifying, nullifying, or reforming the operating contract. \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 55]\n\u00a0\n The matter came on for hearing, evidence was presented, and the petitioners showed that their use of the terminal over a period of years had averaged less than 3 per cent. of the total use, while their contribution to the interest and taxes amounted to 8 1\/3 per cent. of the total. For example, in 1932 each of the the basis of actual use, some of the larger users would have paid approximately $600,-twelve proprietary railroads paid approximately $200,000 on account of interest and taxes. If these charges had been divided on 000 and the petitioners only a little more than $50,000 each. The Commission's report indicates that the operating agreement is inequitable, since it calls for payments by the smaller lines in excess of benefits derived, and permits the larger lines to enjoy the use of the facilities at an expense, proportioned to use, much less than that imposed upon the smaller users.\n The Commission filed its report and order November 10, 1925.2 With respect to the relief sought by the M., K. & T., it developed there was pending in a federal court an action to determine the legality of that road's election to denounce the operating agreement. The Commission therefore withheld action, ordering that, if the decision of the court should be that the new railroad had no right of abandonment, the petition would, upon motion, be dismissed; but, if the court should sustain the right of abrogation, the M., K. & T. might then move for an order granting it the use of the terminal upon an agreed compensation, and, if no agreement could be reached, upon such terms as the Commission might fix. The intervening petitions of the smaller users were dismissed. So matters stood until the right of the M., K. & T. to reject the agreement had been judicially affirmed. Thereupon that company applied to the Commission for the ascertainment of the compensation it should pay for use of the terminal, and the small users, including the present \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 56]\n\u00a0\n petitioners, presented petitions for rehearing upon the order of November, 1925, dismissing their interventions. These petitions were denied June 1, 1933, and the Commission proceeded to hear the case as one involving only the compensation to be paid by the M., K. & T. for use of the terminal. The petitioners then applied to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for a writ of mandamus directed to the Commission requiring it to vacate its orders of November, 1925, and June, 1933, with respect to the petitioners' interventions, and to hear and decide upon the merits the issues thereby raised. A rule to show cause issued, the Commission and certain interveners answered, the petitioners demurred to the answers, the court overruled the demurrers, and, as the petitioners elected to stand thereon, dismissed the petitions. Upon appeal, the Court of Appeals of the District affirmed the judgment. \n3\n We granted a writ of certiorari. \n4\n\u00a0\n\n The petitioners rely principally upon paragraphs (1), (3), and (4) of section 3 of the act. The paragraphs are quoted in the margin. \n5\n Their position is that, if the M., K. & T. \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 57]\n\u00a0\n is granted the use of the terminal pursuant to section 3(4) on a basis more favorable than that available to its predecessor and to the petitioners under the operating agreement, unlawful discrimination forbidden by section 3 will result; and, further, that they are entitled to petition for the grant of use upon compensation to be fixed by the Commission under paragraph (4) although they are parties to the agreement fixing their rights in the terminal. The respondents, by their motion to dismiss, challenged the power of the Commission to grant the relief asked. That body thus stated the problem presented:\n'Whether, then, Congress has or has not appropriately exerted its plenary power directly or through us is a question at the threshold of each case, and it remains here \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 58]\n\u00a0\n to consider whether the particular power invoked by the interveners has been conferred upon us.'\n\n After a discussion of paragraph (4), the Commission concluded:\n'The power and authority thus invoked are not conferred by the quoted paragraph.'\n\n With respect to paragraph (3) it was held that, as the charges in question were essentially capital charges, they have no relation, direct or indirect, to the interchange of traffic between the several lines using the terminal, as contemplated by this paragraph, and the Commission was without authority thereunder to make the requested order.\n Referring to paragraph (1), which prohibits undue prejudice or preference as between particular persons, firms, corporations, or localities, or particular descriptions of traffic, the Commission said:\n ,'Assuming, without now deciding, that the provisions of paragraph (1) are broad enough to embrace, as between the parties thereto, a joint terminal agreement into which all the lines have voluntarily entered and for which they are mutually responsible, the distribution of the charges here in question is not shown to fall within their condemnation. Those charges are distinctly capital charges, based upon the terminal property itself, not upon its use, in no sense assumed by or chargeable to the proprietary lines as compensation for uses they either do or may make, and are divided among the lines in the proportions of their equitable titles to or interests in the property. For their respective uses of the property the lines severally assume maintenance and operating expenses in corresponding proportions. This is not shown to be undue prejudice or preference or unjust discrimination. Each proprietary pays an equal share of the aggregate interest and taxes upon its equal share in the aggregate property.' \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 59]\n\u00a0\n A contention that the case came within the declaration of policy of section 15a, with respect to the adjustment of rates so that the carriers as a whole or by groups will under honest, efficient, and economical management earn a fair return upon their railway property used in transportation was answered by the Commission thus:\n'Neither expressly nor by implication does the provision embrace a direct or indirect revision or reformation of any such contract, lawful in itself as far as appears, as that here in question; and we are unable to find the requisite power or authority in any other provision of the act.'\n\n The petitioners insist that under the plain terms of the act the Commission had jurisdiction of their complaints, but refused to entertain them, and that mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel a hearing and determination upon the merits. The respondents reply that the act plainly confers no such jurisdiction, or at least that the matter is not so clear as to warrant interference by mandamus, and, in the alternative, that the Commission did take jurisdiction of the complaints and decide the merits. The Court of Appeals, without deciding whether the act confers authority to grant the relief, held that the Commission in fact took jurisdiction, heard the cases, and decided as matter of law that it was without power or authority in the premises; that this constituted a decision which, whether right or wrong as matter of law, was impregnable to the writ of mandamus. We concur in the result reached, but for reasons differing somewhat from those announced by that court.\n\n 1. \nThe language used by the Commission with respect to the application of paragraph (1) of section 3 of the act lends color to the respondents' argument that upon consideration of the whole record the Commission reached the conclusion that the enforcement of the operating agreement against the petitioners while exempting the new applicant, the M ., K. & T., from its terms, did not amount to dis- \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 60]\n\u00a0\n crimination as defined by the act. If this is a proper characterization of that body's action, no court can by mandamus compel it to alter its decision. Where judgment or discretion is reposed in an administrative agency and has by that agency been exercised, courts are powerless by the use of the writ to compel a different conclusion. \n6\n We are, however, of opinion that, fairly considered, the report does not bear the construction contended for, but shows the Commission, upon analysis of the complaint and the evidence, found that the act did not confer authority to accord the relief demanded.\n\n 2. \nThe petitioners insist that, as they stated a case alleged to fall within the provisions of the act, they were entitled to have the Commission consider the case as stated, and this right they were denied. They say the writ ought to issue to compel that body to hear and decide their case. The Court of Appeals, answering the contention, held that the Commission did in fact entertain the complaint, decided the cause, and, even if it erred as matter of law in respect of its statutory power, cannot be coerced by mandamus to reverse its decision. The petitioners say that the fallacy in this reasoning is that, whether the Commission refuses to receive a complaint, or upon receiving it entertains and grants a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, its action comes to the same thing, namely, a refusal of jurisdiction. We think that this is so. Whether an administrative tribunal refuses to hear, or upon a hearing determines that as a matter of law it lacks power to act, it is either correct in its conclusion or incorrect, and the question is whether, if it errs in refusing to act, it is compellable be mandamus to proceed. \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 61]\n\u00a0\n 3. If beyond peradventure the act does not confer upon the Commission the power invoked by a complainant, the writ will not be granted. \n7\n If on the other hand power and authority are plainly found in the act, and the Commission erroneously refuses to exercise such power and authority, mandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel that body to proceed and to hear the case upon the merits. The fact that the complaint has been heard and, after hearing, the Commission has refused to enter an order because in its opinion no authority for such action is conferred by the statute, will not avail with the courts to prevent mandamus to correct a plain error of the Commission in renouncing jurisdiction. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n 4. \nThe ultimate question, then, upon the answer to which the decision of this case must turn, is whether, in holding that the statute granted it no authority to act in the premises, the Commission was so plainly and palpably wrong as matter of law that the writ should issue. It is to be noted that the solution of this question does not depend upon whether in a proper case this court would reach the same conclusion as that of the Commission. If that body had taken jurisdiction and granted relief, a remedy would have been available to the respondents by the filing of a bill in equity to set aside the order and to enjoin its enforcement. \n9\n Had the matter been thus presented, it would have been incumbent upon the courts, however doubtful the question, to decide it. But the order here made was negative in form and substance-the refusal of relief-and the remedy by suit in equity \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 62]\n\u00a0\n was therefore not available to the petitioners. \n10\n The absence of a remedy by suit or action to redress alleged error of an administrative body is not in itself sufficient to invoke the power of mandamus. Not only must there be no such remedy, but it must appear that the administrative tribunal was plainly and palpably wrong in refusing to take jurisdiction. Is this shown in the present instance? We think not. The Commission, in a careful and painstaking review of the legislation defining its powers, professed itself unable to find a grant of authority to set aside commitments in the nature of capital charges for property owned and used by the carriers. It adverted to the fact that paragraph (1) of section 3 of the act was directed to discriminations, preference, and prejudice in the performance of the duties of the carrier towards the public which dealt with them as carriers, and related particularly to rates, fares, and charges, and that paragraph (3) was adopted to prevent discriminations and unfair practices as between carriers in interchange of freight and traffic. The language now found in these paragraphs has remained without amendment since the adoption of the original act in 1887. It concluded that petitioners could not invoke the new paragraph (4) added to section 3 by the Transportation Act 1920, because it was intended to give a right of use to one then having no such right in a terminal owned by another line, and was inapplicable to a case like the present, where the petitioners by their own voluntary agreement were entitled, and for many years had been entitled, to the use of a terminal of which they were in effect part owners. The Commission found itself unable to hold that the broad policy declared by section 15a so altered the meaning of section 3 as to change the nature of the discriminations and practices denounced by that section. Its decision was not unanimous; certain of the members being of the opinion that power to grant the \n\n[294 U.S. 50, 63]\n\u00a0\n relief demanded could be spelled out of the act reading it as a whole and as amended by the Transportation Act 1920. This statement of the views of the Commission indicates that its conclusion was not so clearly erroneous as to call for the exercise of the extraordinary power involved in the issuance of mandamus. Where the matter is not beyond peradventure clear, we have invariably refused the writ, even though the question were one of law as to the extent of the statutory power of an administrative officer or body. 11 We think this principle applicable in the present case, and that the courts below were right in refusing the writ.\n The judgment is affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n294 \nU.S. 731\n, 55 S.Ct. 504, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 49 U.S.C.  3(4), 49 USCA  3(4). \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Missouri-Kansas-Texas R.

Such provisions in obligations thereafter incurred are prohibited. The resolution provides that 'Every obligation, heretofore or hereafter incurred, whether or not any such provision is contained therein or made with respect thereto, shall be discharged upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.'\n'Approved, June 5, 1933, 4:40 p.m.'\n\n In No. 270, the suit was brought upon a coupon of a bond made by the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company under date of February 1, 1930, for the payment of $1,000 on February 1, 1960, and interest from date at the rate \n___ 'Sec. 2. The last sentence of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of section 43 of the Act entitled 'An Act to relieve the existing national economic emergency by increasing agricultural purchasing power, to raise revenue for extraordinary expenses incurred by reason of such emergency, to provide emergency relief with respect to agricultural indebtedness, to provide for the orderly liquidation of joint-stock land banks, and for other purposes', approved May 12, 1933, is amended to read as follows:\n\"All coins and currencies of the United States (including Federal Reserve notes and circulating notes of Federal Reserve banks and national banking associations) heretofore or hereafter coined or issued, shall be legal tender for all debts, public and private, public charges, taxes, duties, and dues, except that gold coins, when below the standard weight and limit of tolerance provided by law for the single piece, shall be legal tender only at valuation in proportion to their actual weight.' \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 293]\n\u00a0\n of 4 1\/2 per cent. per annum, payable semiannually. The bond provided that the payment of principal and interest 'will be made ... in gold coin of the United States of America of or equal to the standard of weight and fineness existing on February 1, 1930.' The coupon in suit, for $22.50, was payable on February 1, 1934. The complaint alleged that on February 1, 1930, the standard weight and fineness of a gold dollar of the United States as a unit of value 'was fixed to consist of twenty-five and eight- tenths grains of gold, nine-tenths fine,' pursuant to the Act of Congress of March 14, 1900 (31 Stat. 45,  1, 31 USCA  314), and that by the Act of Congress known as the Gold Reserve Act of 1934 (January 30, 1934, 48 Stat. 337), and by the order of the President under that act, the standard unit of value of a gold dollar of the United States 'was fixed to consist of fifteen and five-twenty-firsts grains of gold, nine-tenths fine,' from and after January 31, 1934. On presentation of the coupon, defendant refused to pay the amount in gold, or the equivalent of gold in legal tender of the United States which was alleged to be, on February 1, 1934, according to the standard of weight and fineness existing on February 1, 1930, the sum of $38.10, and plaintiff demanded judgment for that amount.\n\n Defendant answered that by acts of Congress, and, in particular, by the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, defendant had been prevented from making payment in gold coin 'or otherwise than dollar for dollar, in coin or currency of the United States (other than gold coin and gold certificates),' which at the time of payment constituted legal tender. Plaintiff, challenging the validity of the Joint Resolution under the Fifth and Tenth Amendments, and article 1,  1, of the Constitution of the United States, moved to strike the defense. The motion was denied. Judgment was entered for plaintiff for $22.50, the face of the coupon, and was affirmed upon appeal. The Court of Appeals of the state considered the federal question and \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 294]\n\u00a0\n decided that the Joint Resolution was valid. 265 N.Y. 37, 191 N.E. 726, 62 A.L.R. 1523. This Court granted a writ of certiorari October 8, 1934, \n293 \nU.S. 546\n, 55 S.Ct. 103, 79 L.Ed. --.\n In Nos. 471 and 472, the question arose with respect to an issue of bonds, dated May 1, 1903, of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Company, payable May 1, 1933. The bonds severally provided for the payment of 'One Thousand Dollars gold coin of the United States of the present standard of weight and fineness,' with interest from date at the rate of 4 per cent. per annum, payable 'in like gold coin semi-annually.' In 1917, Missouri Pacific Railroad Company acquired the property of the obligor subject to the mortgage securing the bonds. In March, 1933, the United States District Court, Eastern District of Missouri, approved a petition filed by the latter company under section 77 of the Bankruptcy Act (11 USCA  205). In the following December, the trustees under the mortgage asked leave to intervene, seeking to have the income of the property applied against the mortgage debt, and alleging that the debt was payable 'in gold coin of the United States of the standard of weight and fineness prevailing on May 1, 1903.' Later, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and the United States, as creditors of the debtor, filed a joint petition for leave to intervene, in which they denied the validity of the gold clause contained in the mortgage and bonds. Leave to intervene specially was granted to each applicant on April 5, 1934, and answers were filed. On the hearing, the District Court decided that the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, was constitutional and that the trustees were entitled, in payment of the principal of each bond, to $1,000 in money constituting legal tender. In re Missouri Pac. R. Co., 7 F.Supp. 1. Decree was entered accordingly, and the trustees (respondents here) took two appeals to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 240, 295]\n\u00a0\n While these appeals were pending, this Court granted writs of certiorari November 5, 1934. U.S. v. Bankers' Trust Co., \n293 \nU.S. 548\n, 55 S.Ct. 145, 79 L.Ed. --.\n The Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, was one of a series of measures relating to the currency. These measures disclose not only the purposes of the Congress but also the situations which existed at the time the Joint Resolution was adopted and when the payments under the 'gold clauses' were sought. On March 6, 1933, the President, stating that there had been 'heavy and unwarranted withdrawals of gold and currency from our banking institutions for the purpose of hoarding' and 'extensive speculative activity abroad in foreign exchange' which had resulted 'in severe drains on the Nation's stocks of gold,' and reciting the authority conferred by section 5(b) of the Act of October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. 411 (50 USCA Appendix  5 note)), declared 'a bank holiday' until March 9, 1933. On the same date, the Secretary of the Treasury, with the President's approval, issued instructions to the Treasurer of the United States to make payments in gold in any form only under license issued by the Secretary.\n On March 9, 1933, the Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act, 48 Stat. 1. All orders issued by the President or the Secretary of the Treasury since March 4, 1933, under the authority conferred by section 5(b) of the Act of October 6, 1917, were confirmed. That section was amended (12 USCA  95a) so as to provide that, during any period of national emergency declared by the President, he might 'investigate, regulate, or prohibit,' by means of licenses or otherwise, 'any transactions in foreign exchange, transfers of credit between or payments by banking institutions as defined by the President, and export, hoarding, melting, or earmarking of gold or silver coin or bullion or currency, by any person within the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof.' The act also amended section 11 of the Federal Reserve Act (39 Stat. 752, 12 USCA  248(n) so as to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 296]\n\u00a0\n require all persons to deliver to the Treasurer of the United States 'any or all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates' owned by them, and that the Secretary should pay therefor 'an equivalent amount of any other form of coin or currency coined or issued under the laws of the United States.' By Executive Order of March 10, 1933 (No. 6073), 12 USCA  95 note, the President authorized banks to be reopened, as stated, but prohibited the removal from the United States, or any place subject to its jurisdiction, of 'any gold coin, gold bullion, or gold certificates, except in accordance with regulations prescribed by or under license issued by the Secretary of the Treasury.' By further Executive Order of April 5, 1933 (No. 6102), 12 USCA  248 note, forbidding hoarding, all persons were required to deliver, on or before May 1, 1933, to stated banks, 'all gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates,' with certain exceptions, the holder to receive 'an equivalent amount of any other form of coin or currency coined or issued under the laws of the United States.' Another Order of April 20, 1933 (No. 6111), 12 USCA  95 note, contained further requirements with respect to the acquisition and export of gold and to transactions in foreign exchange.\n By section 43 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933 (48 Stat. 51 (31 USCA  821)), it was provided that the President should have authority, upon the making of prescribed findings and in the circumstances stated, 'to fix the weight of the gold dollar in grains nine tenths fine and also to fix the weight of the silver dollar in grains nine tenths fine at a definite fixed ratio in relation to the gold dollar at such amounts as he finds necessary from his investigation to stabilize domestic prices or to protect the foreign commerce against the adverse effect of depreciated foreign currencies,' and it was further provided that the 'gold dollar, the weight of which is so fixed, shall be the standard unit of value,' and that 'all forms of money ... shall be maintained at a parity with this standard,' but \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 297]\n\u00a0\n that 'in no event shall the weight of the gold dollar be fixed so as to reduce its present weight by more than 50 per centum.'\n Then followed the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933. There were further Executive Orders of August 28, 1933 (No. 6260), 12 USCA  95 note, and August 29, 1933 (No. 6261), October 25, 1933 (No. 6359), 12 USCA  248 note, and January 12 and 15, 1934 (Nos. 6556, 6560), 12 USCA  95 note, relating to the hoarding and export of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold certificates, to the sale and export of gold recovered from natural deposits, and to transactions in foreign exchange, and orders of the Secretary of the Treasury, approved by the President, on December 28, 1933, and January 15, 1934, for the delivery of gold coin, gold bullion and gold certificates to the United States Treasury.\n On January 30, 1934, the Congress passed the 'Gold Reserve Act of 1934' (48 Stat. 337) which, by section 13 (12 USCA  212) ratified and confirmed all the actions, regulations and orders taken or made by the President and the Secretary of the Treasury under the Act of March 9, 1933, or under section 43 of the Act of May 12, 1933, and, by section 12 (31 USCA  821) with respect to the authority of the President to fix the weight of the gold dollar, provided that it should not be fixed 'in any event at more than 60 per centum of its present weight.' On January 31, 1934, the President issued his proclamation declaring that he fixed 'the weight of the gold dollar to be 15 5\/21 grains nine tenths fine,' from and after that date (No. 2072), 31 USCA  821 note.\n We have not attempted to summarize all the provisions of these measures. We are not concerned with their wisdom. The question before the Court is one of power, not of policy. And that question touches the validity of these measures at but a single point; that is, in relation to the Joint Resolution denying effect to 'gold clauses' in existing contracts. The resolution must, however, be considered in its legislative setting and in the light of other measures in pari materia. \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 298]\n\u00a0\n First. The Interpretation of the Gold Clauses in Suit.-In the case of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad Company, the obligor considers the obligation to be one 'for the payment of money and not for the delivery of a specified number of grains or ounces of gold'; that it is an obligation payable in money of the United States and not less so because payment is to be made 'in a particular kind of money'; that it is not a 'commodity contract' which could be discharged by 'tender of bullion.' At the same time, the obligor contends that, while the Joint Resolution is constitutional in either event, the clause is a 'gold coin' and not a 'gold value' clause; that is, it does not imply 'a payment in the 'equivalent' of gold in case performance by payment in gold coin is impossible.' The parties, runs the argument, intended that the instrument should be negotiable and hence it should not be regarded as one 'for the payment of an indeterminate sum ascertainable only at date of payment.' And in the reference to the standard of weight and fineness, the words 'equal to' are said to be synonymous with 'of.'\n In the case of the bonds of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern Railway Company, the government urges that by providing for payment in gold coin the parties showed an intention 'to protect against depreciation of one kind of money as compared with another, as for example, paper money compared with gold, or silver compared with gold'; and, by providing that the gold coin should be of a particular standard, they attempted 'to assure against payment in coin of lesser gold content.' The clause, it is said, 'does not reveal an intention to protect against a situation where gold coin no longer circulates and all forms of money are maintained in the United States at a parity with each other'; apparently, 'the parties did not anticipate the existence of conditions making it impossible and illegal to procure gold coin with which to meet the obligations.' In view of that impossibility, asserted to exist both in fact and in law, the \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 299]\n\u00a0\n government contends that 'the present debtor would be excused, in an action on the bonds, from the obligation to pay in gold coin,' but, as only one term of the promise in the gold clause is impossible to perform and illegal,' the remainder of the obligation should stand, and thus the obligation 'becomes one to pay the stated number of dollars.'\n The bondholder in the first case, and the trustees of the mortgage in the second case, oppose such an interpretation of the gold clauses as inadequate and unreasonable. Against the contention that the agreement was to pay in gold coin if that were possible, and not otherwise, they insist that it is beyond dispute that the gold clauses were used for the very purpose of guarding against a depreciated currency. It is pointed out that the words 'gold coin of the present standard' show that the parties contemplated that, when the time came to pay, there might be gold dollars of a new standard, and, if so, that 'gold coin of the present standard' would pass from circulation; and it is taken to be admitted, by the government's argument, that, if gold coins of a lesser standard were tendered, they would not have to be accepted unless they were tendered in sufficient amount to make up the 'gold value' for which, it is said, the contract called. It is insisted that the words of the gold clause clearly show an intent 'to establish a measure or standard of value of the money to be paid if the particular kind of money specified in the clause should not be in circulation at the time of payment.' To deny the right of the bondholders to the equivalent of the gold coin promised is said to be not a construction of the gold clause, but its nullifications. \n3\n\u00a0\n\n[294 U.S. 240, 300]\n\u00a0\n The decisions of this Court relating to clauses for payment in gold did not deal with situations corresponding to those now presented. Bronson v. Rodes, 7 Wall. 229; Butler v. Horwitz, 7 Wall. 258; Dewing v. Sears, 11 Wall. 379; Trebilcock v. Wilson, 12 Wall. 687; Thompson v. Butler, \n95 U.S. 694\n; Gregory v. Morris, \n96 U.S. 619\n. See, also, The Vaughan and Telegraph, 14 Wall. 258; The Emily Souder, 17 Wall. 666. The rulings, upholding gold clauses and determining their effect, were made when gold was still in circulation and no act of the Congress prohibiting the enforcement of such clauses had been passed. In Bronson v. Rodes, supra, page 251 of 7 Wall., the Court held that the Legal Tender Acts of 1862 and 1863, apart from any question of their constitutionality, had not repealed or modified the laws for the coinage of gold and silver or the statutory provisions which made those coins a legal tender in all payments. It followed, said the Court, that 'there were two descriptions of money in use at the time the tender under consideration was made, both authorized by law, and both made legal tender in payments. The statute denomination of both descriptions was dollars; but they were essentially unlike in nature.' Accordingly, the contract of the parties for payment in one sort of dollars, which was still in lawful circulation, was sustained. The case of Trebilcock v. Wilson, supra, was decided shortly after the Legal Tender Acts had been held valid. The Court again concluded (pages 695, 696 of 12 Wall.) that those acts applied only to debts which were payable \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 301]\n\u00a0\n in money generally, and that there were, 'according to that decision, two kinds of money, essentially different in their nature, but equally lawful.' In that view, said the Court, 'contracts payable in either, or for the possession of either, must be equally lawful, and, if lawful, must be equally capable of enforcement.'\n With respect to the interpretation of the clauses then under consideration, the Court observed, in Bronson v. Rodes, supra, page 250 of 7 Wall., that 'a contract to pay a certain number of dollars in gold or silver coins is, therefore, in legal import, nothing else than an agreement to deliver a certain weight of standard gold, to be ascertained by a count of coins, each of which is certified to contain a definite proportion of that weight.' The Court thought that it was not distinguishable, in principle, 'from a contract to deliver an equal weight of bullion of equal fineness.' That observation was not necessary to the final conclusion. The decision went upon the assumption 'that engagements to pay coined dollars may be regarded as ordinary contracts to pay money rather than as contracts to deliver certain weights of standard gold.' Id. page 251 of 7 Wall.\n In Trebilcock v. Wilson, supra, where a note was payable 'in specie,' the Court said (pages 694, 695 of 12 Wall.) that the provision did not 'assimilate the note to an instrument in which the amount stated is payable in chattels; as, for example, to a contract to pay a specified sum in lumber, or in fruit, or grain'; that the terms 'in specie' were 'merely descriptive of the kind of dollars in which the note is payable, there being different kinds in circulation, recognized by law'; that they meant 'that the designated number of dollars in the note shall be paid in so many gold or silver dollars of the coinage of the United States.' And in Thompson v. Butler, supra, pages 696, 697 of 95 U.S., the Court adverted to the statement made in Bronson v. Rodes, and concluded that, 'notwithstanding this, it is a contract to pay money, and none the less so because \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 302]\n\u00a0\n it designates for payment one of the two kinds of money which the law has made a legal tender in discharge of money obligations.' Compare Gregory v. Morris, supra.\n We are of the opinion that the gold clauses now before us were not contracts for payment in gold coin as a commodity, or in bullion, but were contracts for the payment of money. The bonds were severally for the payment of $1,000. We also think that, fairly construed, these clauses were intended to afford a definite standard or measure of value, and thus to protect against a depreciation of the currency and against the discharge of the obligation by a payment of lesser value than that prescribed. When these contracts were made, they were not repugnant to any action of the Congress. In order to determine whether effect may now be given to the intention of the parties in the face of the action taken by the Congress, or the contracts may be satisfied by the payment dollar for dollar, in legal tender, as the Congress has now prescribed, it is necessary to consider (1) the power of the Congress to establish a monetary system and the necessary implications of that power; (2) the power of the Congress to invalidate the provisions of existing contracts which interfere with the exercise of its constitutional authority; and (3) whether the clauses in question do constitute such an interference as to bring them within the range of that power.\n Second. The Power of the Congress to Establish a Monetary System.-It is unnecessary to review the historic controversy as to the extent of this power, or again to go over the ground traversed by the Court in reaching the conclusion that the Congress may make Treasury notes legal tender in payment of debts previously contracted, as well as of those subsequently contracted, whether that authority be exercised in course of war or in time of \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 303]\n\u00a0\n peace. Knox v. Lee (Legal Tender Cases), 12 Wall. 457; Juilliard v. Greenman (Legal Tender Cases), \n110 \nU.S. 421\n, 4 S.Ct. 122. We need only consider certain postulates upon which that conclusion rested.\n The Constitution grants to the Congress power 'To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin.' Article 1,  8, par. 5. But the Court in the legal tender cases did not derive from that express grant alone the full authority of the Congress in relation to the currency. The Court found the source of that authority in all the related powers conferred upon the Congress and appropriate to achieve 'the great objects for which the government was framed'-'a national government, with sovereign powers.' McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 404-407; Knox v. Lee, supra, pages 532, 536 of 12 Wall.; Juilliard v. Greenman, supra, page 438 of 110 U.S., 4 S.Ct. 122, 125. The broad and comprehensive national authority over the subjects of revenue, finance, and currency is derived from the aggregate of the powers granted to the Congress, embracing the powers to lay and collect taxes, to borrow money, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several states, to coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standards of weights and measures, and the added express power 'to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution' the other enumerated powers. Juilliard v. Greenman, supra, pages 439, 440 of 110 U.S., 4 S.Ct. 122, 125.\n The Constitution 'was designed to provide the same currency, having a uniform legal value in all the States.' It was for that reason that the power to regulate the value of money was conferred upon the federal government, while the same power, as well as the power to emit bills of credit, was withdrawn from the states. The states cannot declare what shall be money, or regulate its value. Whatever power there is over the currency is vested in the Congress. Knox v. Lee, supra, page 545 of 12 Wall. Another postulate of the decision in that case is that the Congress has \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 304]\n\u00a0\n power 'to enact that the government's promises to pay money shall be, for the time being, equivalent in value to the representative of value determined by the coinage acts, or to multiples thereof.' Id., page 553 of 12 Wall. Or, as was stated in the Juilliard Case, supra, page 447 of 110 U. S., 4 S.Ct. 122, 129, the Congress is empowered 'to issue the obligations of the United States in such form, and to impress upon them such qualities as currency for the purchase of merchandise and the payment of debts, as accord with the usage of sovereign governments.' The authority to impose requirements of uniformity and parity is an essential feature of this control of the currency. The Congress is authorized to provide 'a sound and uniform currency for the country,' and to 'secure the benefit of it to the people by appropriate legislation.' Veazie Bank v. Fenno, 8 Wall. 533, 549.\n Moreover, by virtue of this national power, there attaches to the ownership of gold and silver those limitations which public policy may require by reason of their quality as legal tender and as a medium of exchange. Ling Su Fan v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 302, 310\n, 31 S.Ct. 21, 23, 30 L.R.A. (N.S.) 1176. Those limitations arise from the fact that the law 'gives to such coinage a value which does not attach as a mere consequence of intrinsic value.' Their quality as legal tender is attributed by the law, aside from their bullion value. Hence the power to coin money includes the power to forbid mutilation, melting, and exportation of gold and silver coin-'to prevent its outflow from the country of its origin.' Id., page 311 of 218 U.S., 31 S.Ct. 21, 23.\n Dealing with the specific question as to the effect of the Legal Tender Acts upon contracts made before their passage, that is, those for the payment of money generally, the Court, in the legal tender cases, recognized the possible consequences of such enactments in frustrating the expected performance of contracts-in rendering them 'fruitless, or partially fruitless.' The Court pointed out \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 305]\n\u00a0\n that the exercise of the powers of Congress may affect 'apparentobligations' of contracts in many ways. The Congress may pass bankruptcy acts. The Congress may declare war, or, even in peace, pass nonintercourse acts, or direct an embargo, which may operate seriously upon existing contracts. And the Court reasoned that, if the Legal Tender Acts 'were justly chargeable with impairing contract obligations, they would not, for that reason, be forbidden, unless a different rule is to be applied to them from that which has hitherto prevailed in the construction of other powers granted by the fundamental law.' The conclusion was that contracts must be understood as having been made in reference to the possible exercise of the rightful authority of the government, and that no obligation of a contract 'can extend to the defeat' of that authority. Knox v. Lee, supra, pages 549-551 of 12 Wall.\n On similar grounds, the Court dismissed the contention under the Fifth Amendment forbidding the taking of private property for public use without just compensation or the deprivation of it without due process of law. That provision, said the Court, referred only to a direct appropriation. A new tariff, an embargo, or a war, might bring upon individuals great losses; might, indeed, render valuable property almost valueless-might destroy the worth of contracts. 'But whoever supposed' asked the Court, 'that, because of this, a tariff could not be changed or a nonintercourse act, or embargo be enacted, or a war be declared.' The Court referred to the Act of June 28, 1834 (4 Stat. 699), by which a new regulation of the weight and value of gold coin was adopted, and about 6 per cent. was taken from the weight of each dollar. The effect of the measure was that all creditors were subjected to a corresponding loss, as the debts then due 'became solvable with six per cent. less gold than was required to pay them before.' But it had never been imagined that there was a taking of private property without compensation or without due \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 306]\n\u00a0\n process of law. The harshness of such legislation, or the hardship it may cause, afforded no reason for considering it to be unconstitutional. Id., pages 551, 552 of 12 Wall.\n The question of the validity of the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933, must be determined in the light of these settled principles.\n Third. The Power of the Congress to Invalidate the Provisions of Existing Contracts Which Interfere with the Exercise of Its Constitutional Authority.-The instant cases involve contracts between private parties, but the question necessarily relates as well to the contracts or obligations of states and municipalities, or of their political subdivisions; that is, to such engagements as are within the reach of the applicable national power. The government's own contracts-the obligations of the United States-are in a distinct category and demand separate consideration. See Perry v. United States, \n294 \nU.S. 330\n, 55 S.Ct. 432, decided this day.\n The contention is that the power of the Congress, broadly sustained by the decisions we have cited in relation to private contracts for the payment of money generally, does not extend to the striking down of express contracts for gold payments. The acts before the Court in the legal tender cases, as we have seen, were not deemed to go so far. Those acts left in circulation two kinds of money, both lawful and available, and contracts for payments in gold, one of these kinds, were not disturbed. The Court did not decide that the Congress did not have the constitutional power to invalidate existing contracts of that sort, if they stood in the way of the execution of the policy of the Congress in relation to the currency. Mr. Justice Bradley, in his concurring opinion, expressed the view that the Congress had that power and had exercised it. Knox v. Lee, supra, pages 566, 567 of 12 Wall. And, upon that ground, he dissented from the opinion of the Court in Trebilcock v. Wilson, supra, page 699 of 12 Wall., as to the \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 307]\n\u00a0\n validity of contracts for payment 'in specie.' \n4\n It is significant that Mr. Justice Bradley, referring to this difference of opinion in the legal tender cases, remarked (in his concurring opinion) that 'of course' the difference arose 'from the different construction given to the legal tender acts.' 'I do not understand,' he said, 'the majority of the court to decide that an act so drawn as to embrace, in terms, contracts payable in specie, would not be constitutional. Such a decision would completely nullify the power claimed for the government. For it would be very easy, by the use of one or two additional words, to make all contracts payable in specie.'\n Here, the Congress has enacted an express interdiction. The argument against it does not rest upon the mere fact that the legislation may cause hardship or loss. Creditors who have not stipulated for gold payments may suffer equal hardship or loss with creditors who have so stipulated. The former, admittedly, have no constitutional grievance. And, while the latter may not suffer more, the point is pressed that their express stipulations for gold payments constitute property, and that creditors who have not such stipulations are without that property right. And the contestants urge that the Congress is seeking, not to regulate the currency, but to regulate contracts, and thus has stepped beyond the power conferred.\n This argument is in the teeth of another established principle. Contracts, however express, cannot fetter the constitutional authority of the Congress. Contracts may create rights of property, but, when contracts deal with a subject-matter which lies within the control of the Con- \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 308]\n\u00a0\n gress, they have a congenital infirmity. Parties cannot remove their transactions from the reach of dominant constitutional power by making contracts about them. See Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 357\n, 28 S.Ct. 529, 14 Ann.Cas. 560.\n This principle has familiar illustration in the exercise of the power to regulate commerce. If shippers and carriers stipulate for specified rates, although the rates may be lawful when the contracts are made, if Congress through the Interstate Commerce Commission exercises its authority and prescribes different rates, the latter control and override inconsistent stipulations in contracts previously made. This is so, even if the contract be a charter granted by a state and limiting rates, or a contract between municipalities and carriers. New York v. United States, \n257 \nU.S. 591, 600\n, 601 S., 42 S.Ct. 239; United States v. Village of Hubbard, \n266 U.S. 474\n, 477, note, 45 S.Ct. 160. See, also, Armour Packing Co. v. United States, \n209 U.S. 56\n, 80-82, 28 S. Ct. 428; Union Dry Goods Co. v. Georgia Public Service Corporation, \n248 \nU.S. 372, 375\n, 39 S.Ct. 117, 9 A.L.R. 1420\n\n\n In Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, \n175 \nU.S. 211, 229\n, 230 S., 20 S.Ct. 96, 103, the Court raised the pertinent question, if certain kinds of private contracts directly limit or restrain, and hence regulate interstate commerce, why should not the power of Congress reach such contracts equally with legislation of a State to the same effect? 'What sound reason,' said the Court, 'can be given why Congress should have the power to interfere in the case of the state, and yet have none in the case of the individual? Commerce is the important subject of consideration, and anything which directly obstructs and thus regulates that commerce which is carried on among the states, whether it is state legislation or private contracts between individuals or corporations, should be subject to the power of Congress in the regulation of that commerce.' \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 309]\n\u00a0\n Applying that principle, the Court held that a contract, valid when made (in 1871) for the giving of a free pass by an interstate carrier, in consideration of a release of a claim for damages, could not be enforced after the Congress had passed the Act of June 29, 1906, 34 Stat. 584. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Company v. Mottley, \n219 \nU.S. 467\n, 31 S.Ct. 265, 270, 34 L.R.A.(N.S.) 671.5 Quoting the statement of the general principle in the legal tender cases, the Court decided that the agreement must necessarily be regarded as having been made subject to the possibility that, at some future time, the Congress 'might so exert its whole constitutional power in regulating interstate commerce as to render that agreement unenforceable, or to impair its value.' The Court considered it inconceivable that the exercise of such power 'may be hampered or restricted to any extent by contracts previously made between individuals or corporations.' 'The framers of the Constitution never intended any such state of things to exist.' Id. page 482 of 219 U.S., 31 S.Ct. 265, 270. Accordingly, it has been 'authoritatively settled' by decisions of this Court that no previous contracts or combinations can prevent the application of the Anti-Trust Acts (15 USCA  1 et seq.) to compel the discontinuance of combinations declared to be illegal. Addyston Pipe & Steel Co. v. United States, supra; United States v. Southern Pacific Company, \n259 \nU.S. 214, 234\n, 235 S., 42 S.Ct. 496. See, also, Calhoun v. Massie, \n253 \nU.S. 170, 176\n, 40 S.Ct. 474; Omnia Commercial Co. v. United States, \n261 \nU.S. 502, 509\n, 43 S.Ct. 437; Stephenson v. Binford, \n287 \nU.S. 251, 276\n, 53 S.Ct. 181, 87 A.L.R. 721.\n The principle is not limited to the incidental effect of the exercise by the Congress of its constitutional authority. There is no constitutional ground for denying to the Congress the power expressly to prohibit and invalidate contracts although previously made, and valid when made, \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 310]\n\u00a0\n when they interfere with the carrying out of the policy it is free to adopt. The exercise of this power is illustrated by the provision of section 5 of the Employers' Liability Act of 1908 (35 Stat. 65, 66 (45 USCA  55)) relating to any contract the purpose of which was to enable a common carrier to exempt itself from the liability which the act created. Such a stipulation the act explicitly declared to be void. In the Second Employers' Liability Cases (Mondou v. New York, N.H. & H.R. Co.), \n223 \nU.S. 1, 52\n, 32 S.Ct. 169, 176, 38 L.R.A.(N.S.) 44, the Court decided that, as the Congress possessed the power to impose the liability, it also possessed the power 'to insure its efficacy by prohibiting any contract, rule, regulation, or device in evasion of it.' And this prohibition the Court has held to be applicable to contracts made before the act was passed. Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington R.R. Co. v. Schubert, \n224 \nU.S. 603\n, 32 S.Ct. 589. In that case, the employee suing under the act was a member of the 'Relief Fund' of the railroad company under a contract of membership, made in 1905, for the purpose of securing certain benefits. The contract provided that an acceptance of those benefits should operate as a release of claims, and the company pleaded that acceptance as a bar to the action. The Court held that the Employers' Liability Act (45 USCA  51-59) supplied the governing rule and that the defense could not be sustained. The power of the Congress in regulating interstate commerce was not fettered by the necessity of maintaining existing arrangements and stipulations which would conflict with the execution of its policy. The reason is manifest. To subordinate the exercise of the federal authority to the continuing operation of previous contracts would be to place to this extent the regulation of interstate commerce in the hands of private individuals and to withdraw from the control of the Congress so much of the field as they might choose by 'prophetic discernment' to bring within the range of their agreements. The Constitution recognizes no such limitation. Id. pages 613, 614 of 224 U.S., 32 S.Ct. 589. See, \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 311]\n\u00a0\n also, United States v. Southern Pacific Company, supra; Sproles v. Binford, \n286 \nU.S. 374, 390\n, 391 S., 52 S.Ct. 581; Federal Radio Commission v. Nelson Brothers Bond & Mortgage Co., \n289 \nU.S. 266, 282\n, 53 S. Ct. 627.\n The same reasoning applies to the constitutional authority of the Congress to regulate the currency and to establish the monetary system of the country. If the gold clauses now before us interfere with the policy of the Congress in the exercise of that authority, they cannot stand.\n Fourth. The Effect of the Gold Clauses in Suit in Relation to the Monetary Policy Adopted by the Congress. Despite the wide range of the discussion at the bar and the earnestness with which the arguments against the validity of the Joint Resolution have been pressed, these contentions necessarily are brought, under the dominant principles to which we have referred, to a single and narrow point. That point is whether the gold clauses do constitute an actual interference with the monetary policy of the Congress in the light of its broad power to determine that policy. Whether they may be deemed to be such an interference depends upon an appraisement of economic conditions and upon determinations of questions of fact. With respect to those conditions and determinations, the Congress is entitled to its own judgment. We may inquire whether its action is arbitrary or capricious, that is, whether it has reasonable relation to a legitimate end. If it is an appropriate means to such an end, the decisions of the Congress as to the degree of the necessity for the adoption of that means, is final. McCulloch v. Maryland, supra, pages 421, 423, of 4 Wheat.: Juilliard v. Greenman, supra, page 450 of 110 U.S., 4 S. Ct. 122; Stafford v. Wallace, \n258 \nU.S. 495, 521\n, 42 S.Ct. 397, 23 A.L.R. 229; James Everard's Breweries v. Day, \n265 \nU.S. 545, 559\n, 562 S., 44 S.Ct. 628.\n The Committee on Banking and Currency of the House of Representatives stated in its report recommending \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 312]\n\u00a0\n favorable action upon the Joint Resolution (H.R. Rep. No. 169, 73d Cong. 1st Sess.):\n'The occasion for the declaration in the resolution that the gold clauses are contrary to public policy arises out of the experiences of the present emergency. These gold clauses render ineffective the power of the Government to create a currency and determine the value thereof. If the gold clause applied to a very limited number of contracts and security issues, it would be a matter of no particular consequence, but in this country virtually all obligations, almost as a matter of routine, contain the gold clause. In the light of this situation two phenomena which have developed during the present emergency make the enforcement of the gold clauses incompatible with the public interest. The first is the tendency which has developed internally to hoard gold; the second is the tendency for capital to leave the country. Under these circumstances no currency system, whether based upon gold or upon any other foundation, can meet the requirements of a situation in which many billions of dollars of securities are expressed in a particular form of the circulating medium, particularly when it is the medium upon which the entire credit and currency structure rests.'\n\n And the Joint Resolution itself recites the determination of the Congress in these words:6\n'Whereas the existing emergency has disclosed that provisions of obligations which purport to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency of the United States, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby, obstruct the power of the Congress to regulate the value of the money of the United States, and are inconsistent with the \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 313]\n\u00a0\n declared policy of the Congress to maintain at all times the equal power of every dollar, coined or issued by the United States, in the markets and in the payment of debts.'\n\n Can we say that this determination is so destitute of basis that the interdiction of the gold clauses must be deemed to be without any reasonable relation to the monetary policy adopted by the Congress?\n The Congress in the exercise of its discretion was entitled to consider the volume of obligations with gold clauses, as that fact, as the report of the House Committee observed, obviously had a bearing upon the question whether their existence constituted a substantial obstruction to the congressional policy. The estimates submitted at the bar indicate that, when the Joint Resolution was adopted, there were outstanding seventy-five billion dollars or more of such obligations, the annual interest charges on which probably amounted to between three and four billion dollars. It is apparent that, if these promises were to be taken literally, as calling for actual payment in gold coin, they would be directly opposed to the policy of Congress, as they would be calculated to increase the demand for gold, to encourage hoarding, and to stimulate attempts at exportation of gold coin. If there were no outstanding obligations with gold clauses, we suppose that no one would question the power of the Congress, in its control of the monetary system, to endeavor to conserve the gold resources of the Treasury, to insure its command of gold in order to protect and increase its reserves, and to prohibit the exportation of gold coin or its use for any purpose inconsistent with the needs of the Treasury. See Ling Su Fan v. United States, supra. And, if the Congress would have that power in the absence of gold clauses, principles beyond dispute compel the conclusion that private parties, or states or municipalities, \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 314]\n\u00a0\n by making such contracts, could not prevent or embarrass its exercise. In that view of the import of the gold clauses, their obstructive character is clear.\n But, if the clauses are treated as 'gold value' clauses, that is, as intended to set up a measure or standard of value if gold coin is not available, we think they are still hostile to the policy of the Congress, and hence subject to prohibition. It is true that, when the Joint Resolution was adopted on June 5, 1933, while gold coin had largely been withdrawn from circulation and the Treasury had declared that 'gold is not now paid, nor is it available for payment, upon public or private debts,'7 the dollar had not yet been devalued. But devaluation was in prospect and a uniform currency was intended. 8 Section 43 of the Act of May 12, 1933 ( 48 Stat. 51 (31 USCA s 821)), provided that the President should have authority, on certain conditions, to fix the weight of the gold dollar as stated, and that its weight as so fixed should be 'the standard unit of value' with which all forms of money should be maintained 'at a parity.' The weight of the gold dollar was not to be reduced by more than 50 per centum. The Gold Reserve Act of 1934 (January 30, 1934, 48 Stat. 337), provided that the President should not fix the weight of \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 315]\n\u00a0\n the gold dollar at more than 60 per cent. of its present weight. The order of the President of January 31, 1934, fixed the weight of the gold dollar at 15 5\/21 grains ninetenths fine as against the former standard of 25 8\/10 grains nine-tenths fine. If the gold clauses interfered with the congressional policy, and hence could be invalidated, there appears to be no constitutional objection to that action by the Congress in anticipation of the determination of the value of the currency. And the questions now before us must be determined in the light of that action.\n The devaluation of the dollar placed the domestic economy upon a new basis. In the currency as thus provided, states and municipalities must receive their taxes; railroads, their rates and fares; public utilities, their charges for services. The income out of which they must meet their obligations is determined by the new standard. Yet, according to the contentions before us, while that income is thus controlled by law, their indebtedness on their 'gold bonds' must be met by an amount of currency determined by the former gold standard. Their receipts, in this view, would be fixed on one basis; their interest charges, and the principal of their obligations, on another. It is common knowledge that the bonds issued by these obligors have generally contained gold clauses, and presumably they account for a large part of the outstanding obligations of that sort. It is also common knowledge that a similar situation exists with respect to numerous industrial corporations that have issued their 'gold bonds' and must now receive payments for their products in the existing currency. It requires no acute analysis or profound economic inquiry to disclose the dislocation of the domestic economy which would be caused by such a disparity of conditions in which, it is insisted, those debtors under gold clauses should be required to pay $1.69 \n\n[294 U.S. 240, 316]\n\u00a0\n in currency while respectively receiving their taxes, rates, charges, and prices on the basis of $1 of that currency.\n We are not concerned with consequences, in the sense that consequences, however serious, may excuse an invasion of constitutional right. We are concerned with the constitutional power of the Congress over the monetary system of the country and its attempted frustration. Exercising that power, the Congress has undertaken to establish a uniform currency, and parity between kinds of currency, and to make that currency, dollar for dollar, legal tender for the payment of debts. In the light of abundant experience, the Congress was entitled to choose such a uniform monetary system, and to reject a dual system, with respect to all obligations within the range of the exercise of its constitutional authority. The contention that these gold clauses are valid contracts and cannot be struck down proceeds upon the assumption that private parties, and states and municipalities, may make and enforce contracts which may limit that authority. Dismissing that untenable assumption, the facts must be faced. We think that it is clearly shown that these clauses interfere with the exertion of the power granted to the Congress, and certainly it is not established that the Congress arbitrarily or capriciously decided that such an interference existed.\n The judgment and decree, severally under review, are affirmed. \n No. 270.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Nos. 471 and 472. Decree affirmed.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS, dissenting.\n Mr. Justice VAN DEVANTER, Mr. Justice SUTHERLAND, Mr. Justice BUTLER, and I conclude that, if given effect, the enactments here challenged will bring about confiscation of property rights and repudiation of national obligations. Acquiescence in the decisions just announced is impossible; the circumstances demand statement of our views. 'To let oneself slide down the easy slope offered by the course of events and to dull one's mind against the extent of the danger, ... that is precisely to fail in one's obligation of responsibility.'\n Just men regard repudiation and spoliation of citizens by their sovereign with abhorrence; but we are asked to affirm that the Constitution has granted power to accomplish both. No definite delegation of such a power exists; and we cannot believe the farseeing framers, who labored with hope of establishing justice and securing the blessings of liberty, intended that the expected government should have authority to annihilate its own obligations and destroy the very rights which they were endeavoring to protect. Not only is there no permission for such actions; they are [316-Continued.]\ninhibited. And no plenitude of words can conform them to our charter.\n The federal government is one of delegated and limited powers which derive from the Constitution. 'It can exercise only the powers granted to it.' Powers claimed must be denied unless granted; and, as with other writings, the whole of the Constitution is for consideration when one seeks to ascertain the meaning of any part.\n By the so-called gold clause-promise to pay in 'United States gold coin of the present standard of value,' or 'of or equal to the present standard of weight and fineness'-found in very many private and public obligations, the creditor agrees to accept and the debtor undertakes to return the thing loaned or its equivalent. Thereby each secures protection, one against decrease in value of the currency, the other against an increase.\n The clause is not new or obscure or discolored by any sinister purpose. For more than 100 years our citizens have employed a like agreement. During the War between the States, its equivalent 'payable in coin' aided in surmounting financial difficulties. From the housetop men proclaimed its merits while bonds for billions were sold to support the World War. The Treaty of Versailles recognized it as appropriate and just. It appears in the obligations which have rendered possible our great undertakings-public works, railroads, buildings.\n Under the interpretation accepted here for many years, this clause expresses a definite enforceable contract. Both by statute and long use the United States have approved it. Over and over again they have enjoyed the added value which it gave to their obligations. So late as May 2, 1933, they issued to the public more than $550,000,000 of their notes, each of which carried a solemn promise to pay in standard gold coin. (Before that day this coin had in fact been withdrawn from circulation, but statutory measure of value remained the gold dollar of 25.8 grains.)\n The Permanent Court of International Justice interpreted the clause as this Court had done and upheld it. Cases of Serbian and Brazilian Loans, Publications P.C.I.J., Series A, Nos. 20, 21 (1929). It was there declared: 'The gold clause merely prevents the borrower from availing itself of a possibility of discharge of the debt in depreciated currency,' and 'The treatment of the gold clause as indicating a mere modality of payment, without reference to a gold standard of value, would be, not to construe but to destroy it.'\n In Feist v. Societe Intercommunale Belge d'Electricite, (1934) A.C. 161, the House of Lords expressed like views.\n Gregory v. Morris (1878) \n96 \nU.S. 619, 624\n, 625 S., 24 [316-Continued.]\nL.Ed. 740-last of similar causes-construed and sanctioned this stipulation. In behalf of all, Chief Justice Waite there said:\n'The obligation secured by the mortgage or lien under which Morris held was for the payment of gold coin, or, as was said in Bronson v. Rodes ( 1869) 7 Wall. 229, 'An agreement to deliver a certain weight of standard gold, to be ascertained by a count of coins, each of which is certified to contain a definite proportion of that weight,' and is not distinguishable 'From a contract to deliver an equal weight of bullion of equal fineness.' ... We think it clear that, under such circumstances, it was within the power of the court, so far as Gregory was concerned, to treat the contract as one for the delivery of so much gold bullion; and, if Morris was willing to accept a judgment which might be discharged in currency, to have his damages estimated according to the currency value of bullion.'\n\n Earlier cases-Bronson v. Rodes, 7 Wall. 229; Butler v. Horwitz, 7 Wall. 258; Dewing v. Sears, 11 Wall. 379; Trebilcock v. Wilson, 12 Wall. 687; Thompson v. Butler, \n95 U.S. 694\n-while important, need not be dissected. Gregory v. Morris is in harmony with them, and the opinion there definitely and finally stated the doctrine which we should apply.\n It is true to say that the gold clauses 'were intended to afford a definite standard or measure of value, and thus to protect against a depreciation of the currency and against the discharge of the obligation by payment of less than that prescribed.' Furthermore, they furnish means for computing the sum payable in currency if gold should become unobtainable. The borrower agrees to repay in gold coin containing 25.8 grains to the dollar; and, if this cannot be secured, the promise is to discharge the obligation by paying for each dollar loaned the currency value of that number of grains. Thus, the purpose of the parties will be carried out. Irrespective of any change in currency, the thing loaned or an equivalent will be returned-nothing more nothing less. The present currency consists of promises to pay dollars of 15 5\/21 grains; the government procures gold bullion on that basis. The calculation to determine the damages for failure to pay in gold would not be difficult. Gregory v. Morris points the way.\n Under appropriate statutes the United States for many years issued gold certificates, in the following form: 'This certifies that there have been deposited in the Treasury of The United States of America One Thousand Dollars in gold coin payable to the bearer on demand. This certificate is a legal tender in the amount thereof in payment of all debts and dues public and private.'\n The certificates here involved-series 1928-were issued under section 6, Act March 14, 1900, 31 Stat. 47, as amended. See [316-Continued.]\nUSCA, title 31,  429.1\n In view of the statutory direction that gold coin for which certificates are issued shall be held for their payment on demand 'and used for no other purpose,' it seems idle to argue (as counsel for the United States did) that other use is permissible under the ancient Act of March 3, 1863 (12 Stat. 709).\n By various orders of the President and the Treasury from April 5 to December 28, 1933, persons holding gold certificates were required to deliver them, and accept 'an equivalent amount of any form of coin or currency coined or issued under the laws of the United States designated by the Secretary of the Treasury.' Heavy penalties were provided for failure to comply. That the holder of one of these certificates was owner of an express promise by the United States to deliver gold coin of the weight and fineness established by statute when the certificate issued, or if such demand was not honored to pay the holder the value in the currency then in use, seems clear enough. This was the obvious design of the contract. The Act of March 14, 1900, 31 Stat. c. 41, pp. 45, 47,  1, and  6, as amended, in effect until January 31, 1934, provided: 'The dollar consisting of twenty-five and eight tenths grains of gold nine-tenths fine shall be the standard unit of value, and all forms of money issued or coined by the United States shall be maintained at a parity of value with this standard,' and also 'the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive deposits of gold coin with the Treasurer ... in sums of not less than $20, and to issue gold certificates therefor in denominations of not less than $10, and the coin so deposited shall be retained in the Treasury and held for the payment of such certificates on demand, and used for no other purpose.' See USCA, title 31,  314, 429. The Act of February 4, 1910, 36 Stat. c. 25, p. 192,  1 (see 31 USCA  768), directed that 'any bonds and certificates of indebtedness of the United States issued after February 4, 1910, shall be payable, principal and interest, in United States gold coin of the present standard of value.'\n By Executive Orders, Nos. 6102, 6111, April 5, and April 20, 1933 (12 USCA  95 note, 248 note), the President undertook to require owners of gold coin, gold bullion, and gold [316-Continued.]\ncertificates, to deliver them on or before May 1st to a Federal Reserve Bank, and to prohibit the exportation of gold coin, gold bullion, or gold certificates. As a consequence, the United States were off the gold standard, and their paper money began a rapid decline in the markets of the world. Gold coin, gold certificates, and gold bullion were no longer obtainable. 'Gold is not now paid nor is it available for payment upon public or private debts' was declared in Treasury statement of May 27, 1933; and this is still true. All gold coins have been melted into bars.\n The Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933, 48 Stat. c. 25, pp. 31, 52, 53, entitled 'An act to relieve the existing national economic emergency by increasing agricultural purchasing power, to raise revenue for extraordinary expenses incurred by reason of such emergency, to provide emergency relief with respect to agricultural indebtedness, to provide for the orderly liquidation of joint-stock land banks, and for other purposes' by section 43 (see 31 USCA  821) provides that 'such notes (United States notes) and all other coins and currencies heretofore or hereafter coined or issued by or under the authority of the United States shall be legal tender for all debts public and private.' Also that the President by proclamation may 'fix the weight of the gold dollar ... as he finds necessary from his investigation to stabilize domestic prices or to protect the foreign commerce against the adverse effect of depreciated foreign currencies.' And, further, 'such gold dollar, the weight of which is so fixed, shall be the standard unit of value, and all forms of money issued or coined by the United States shall be maintained at a parity with this standard and it shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to maintain such parity, but in no event shall the weight of the gold dollar be fixed so as to reduce its present weight by more than 50 per centum.'\n The Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934, 48 Stat. c. 6, pp. 337, 342 ,  12 (31 USCA  821) undertook to ratify preceding presidential orders and proclamations requiring surrender of gold, but prohibited him from establishing the weight of the gold dollar 'at more than 60 per centum of its present weight.' By proclamation, January 31, 1934 (31 USCA  821 note ), he directed that thereafter the standard should contain 15 5\/21 grains of gold, nine-tenths fine. (The weight had been 25.8 grains since 1837.) No such dollar has been coined at any time.\n On June 5, 1933, Congress passed a 'Joint Resolution to assure uniform value to the coins and currencies of the United States.' 48 Stat. c. 48, p. 112 (31 USCA  462, 463). This recited that holding and dealing in gold affect the public interest and are therefore subject to regulation; that the provisions of obligations which purport to give the obligee the right to require payment in gold coin or in any amount of money of the United States measured thereby obstruct the power of Congress to regulate the value of money, and are inconsistent [316-Continued.]\nwith the policy to maintain the equal value of every dollar coined or issued. It then declared that every provision in any obligation purporting to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold is against public policy, and directed that 'every obligation, heretofore or hereafter incurred, whether or not any such provision is contained therein or made with respect thereto, shall be discharged upon payment, dollar for dollar, in any coin or currency which at the time of payment is legal tender for public and private debts.'\n Four causes are here for decision. Two of them arise out of corporate obligations containing gold clauses-railroad bonds. One is based on a United States Fourth Liberty Loan bond of 1918, called for payment April 15, 1934, containing a promise to pay 'in United States gold coin of the present standard of value' with interest in like gold coin. Another involves gold certificates, series 1928, amounting to $106,300.\n As to the corporate bonds the defense is that the gold clause was destroyed by the Joint Resolution of June 5, 1933; and this view is sustained by the majority of the Court.\n It is insisted that the agreement, in the Liberty bond, to pay in gold, also was destroyed by the Act of June 5, 1933. This view is rejected by the majority; but they seem to conclude that, because of the action of Congress in declaring the holding of gold unlawful, no appreciable damage resulted when payment therein or the equivalent was denied.\n Concerning the gold certificates, it is ruled that, if upon presentation for redemption gold coin had been paid to the holder, as promised, he would have been required to return this to the Treasury. He could not have exported it or dealt with it. Consequently he sustained no actual damage.\n There is no challenge here of the power of Congress to adopt such proper 'Monetary Policy' as it may deem necessary in order to provide for national obligations and furnish an adequate medium of exchange for public use. The plan under review in the Legal Tender Cases was declared within the limits of the Constitution, but not without a strong dissent. The conclusions there announced are not now questioned; and any abstract discussion of congressional power over money would only tend to befog the real issue.\n The fundamental problem now presented is whether recent statutes passed by Congress in respect of money and credits were designed to attain a legitimate end. Or whether, under the guise of pursuing a monetary policy, Congress really has inaugurated a plan primarily designed to destroy private obligations, repudiate national debts, and drive into the Treasury all gold within the country is exchange for inconvertible promises to pay, of much less value. [316-Continued.]\n Considering all the circumstances, we must conclude they show that the plan disclosed is of the latter description, and its enforcement would deprive the parties before us of their rights under the Constitution. Consequently the Court should do what it can to afford adequate relief.\n What has been already said will suffice to indicate the nature of these causes, and something of our general views concerning the intricate problems presented. A detailed consideration of them would require much time and elaboration; would greatly extend this opinion. Considering also the importance of the result to legitimate commerce, it seems desirable that the Court's decision should be announced at this time. Accordingly, we will only undertake in what follows to outline with brevity our replies to the conclusions reached by the majority and to suggest some of the reasons which lend support to our position.\n The authority exercised by the President and the Treasury in demanding all gold coin, bullion, and certificates is not now challenged; neither is the right of the former to prescribe weight for the standard dollar. These things we have not considered. Plainly, however, to coin money and regulate the value thereof calls for legislative action.\n Intelligent discussion respecting dollars requires recognition of the fact that the word may refer to very different things. Formerly the standard gold dollar weighed 25.8 grains; the weight now prescribed is 15 5\/21 grains. Evidently promises to pay one or the other of these differ greatly in value, and this must be kept in mind.\n From 1792 to 1873 both the gold and silver dollar were standard and legal tender, coinage was free and unlimited. Persistent efforts were made to keep both in circulation. Because the prescribed relation between them got out of harmony with exchange values, the gold coin disappeared, and did not in fact freely circulate in this country for 30 years prior to 1834. During that time business transactions were based on silver. In 1834, desiring to restore parity and bring gold back into circulation, Congress reduced somewhat (6 per cent.) the weight of the gold coin and thus equalized the coinage and the exchange values. The silver dollar was not changed. The purpose was to restore the use of gold as currency-not to force up prices or destroy obligations. There was no apparent profit for the books of the Treasury. No injury was done to creditors; none was intended. The legislation is without special significance here. See Hepburn on Currency.\n The money under consideration in the Legal Tender Cases, decided May 1, 1871, 12 Wall. 457, and \n110 \nU.S. 421\n, 4 S.Ct. 122, were promises to pay dollars, 'bills of credit.' They were 'a pledge of the national credit,' promises 'by the government to pay dollars' 'the [316-Continued.]\nstandard of value is not changed.' The expectation, ultimately realized, was that in due time they would be redeemed in standard coin. The Court was careful to show that they were issued to meet a great emergency in time of war, when the overthrow of the government was threatened and specie payments had been suspended. Both the end in view and the means employed, the Court held were lawful. The thing actually done was the issuance of bills endowed with the quality of legal tender in order to carry on until the United States could find it possible to meet their obligations in standard coin. This they accomplished in 1879. The purpose was to meet honorable obligations-not to repudiate them.\n The opinion there rendered declares: 'The legal tender acts do not attempt to make paper a standard of value. We do not rest their validity upon the assertion that their emission is coinage, or any regulation of the value of money; nor do we assert that Congress may make anything which has no value money. What we do assert is, that Congress has power to enact that the government's promises to pay money shall be, for the time being, equivalent in value to the representative of value determined by the coinage acts, or to multiples thereof.' What was said in those causes of course must be read in the light of all the circumstances. The opinion gives no support to what has been attempted here. This Court has not heretofore ruled that Congress may require the holder of an obligation to accept payment in subsequently devalued coins, or promises by the government to pay in such coins. The legislation before us attempts this very thing. If this is permissible then a gold dollar containing one grain of gold may become the standard, all contract rights fall, and huge profits appear on the Treasury books. Instead of $2,800,000, 000 as recently reported, perhaps $20,000,000,000, maybe, enough to cancel the public debt, maybe more!\n The power to issue bills and 'regulate values' of coin cannot be so enlarged as to authorize arbitrary action, whose immediate purpose and necessary effect is destruction of individual rights. \n2\n As this Court has said a 'power to regulate is not a power to destroy.' Reagan v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., \n154 \nU.S. 362, 398\n, 14 S.Ct. 1047, 1054. The Fifth Amendment limits all governmental powers. We are dealing here with a debased standard, adopted with the definite purpose to destroy obligations. Such arbitrary and oppressive action is not within any congressional power heretofore recognized. The authority of Congress to create legal tender obligations in times of peace is derived from the power to borrow money; this cannot be extended to embrace the destruction of all\n___ 2 'It may well be doubted whether the nature of society and of government does not prescribe some limits to the legislative power; and, if any be prescribed, where are they to be found, if the property of an individual, fairly and honestly acquired, may be seized without compensation.' Chief Justice Marshall in Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch. 87, 135. [316-Continued.]\ncredits.\n There was no coin-specie-in general circulation in the United States between 1862 and 1879. Both gold and silver were treated in business as commodities. The Legal Tender Cases arose during that period.\nCorporate Bonds. The gold clauses in these bonds were valid and in entire harmony with public policy when executed. They are property. Lynch v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 571, 579\n, 54 S.Ct. 840. To destroy a validly acquired right is the taking of property. Osborn v. Nicholson, 13 Wall. 654, 662. They established a measure of value and supply a basis for recovery if broken. Their policy and purpose were stamped with affirmative approval by the government when inserted in its bonds. The clear intent of the parties was that in case the standard of 1900 should be withdrawn, and a new and less valuable one set up, the debtor could be required to pay the value of the contents of the old standard in terms of the new currency, whether coin or paper. If gold measured by prevailing currency had declined the debtor would have received the benefit. The Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12th discloses a fixed purpose to raise the nominal value of farm products by depleting the standard dollar. It authorized the President to reduce the gold in the standard, and further provided that all forms of currency shall be legal tender. The result expected to follow was increase in nominal values of commodities and depreciation of contractual obligations. The purpose of section 43 incorporated by the Senate as an amendment to the House Bill was clearly stated by the Senator who presented it. \n3\n It was the destruction of lawfully acquired rights. In the circumstances existing just after the Act of May 12th, depreciation of the standard dollar by the presidential proclamation would not have decreased the amount required to meet obligations containing gold clauses. As to them the depreciation of the standard would have caused an increase in the number of dollars of depreciated currency. General reduction of all debts could only be secured by first destroying the contracts evidenced by the gold clauses; and this the resolution of June 5th undertook to accomplish. It was aimed directly at those contracts and had no definite relation to the power to issue bills or to coin or regulate the value of money.\n[316-Continued.]\n To carry out the plan indicated as above shown in the Senate, the Gold Reserve Act followed-January 30, 1934. This inhibited the President from fixing the weight of the standard gold dollar above 60 per cent. of its then existing weight. (Authority had been given for 50 per cent. reduction by the Act of May 12th.) On January 31st he directed that the standard should contain 15 5\/21 grains of gold. If this reduction of 40 per cent. of all debts was within the power of Congress and if as a necessary means to accomplish that end, Congress had power by resolution to destroy the gold clauses, the holders of these corporate bonds are without remedy. But we must not forget that if this power exists Congress may readily destroy other obligations which present obstruction to the desired effect of further depletion. The destruction of all obligations by reducing the standard gold dollar to one grain of gold, or brass or nickel or copper or lead will become an easy possibility. Thus we reach the fundamental question which must control the result of the controversy in respect of corporate bonds. Apparently in the opinion of the majority the gold clause in the Liberty bond withstood the June 5th Resolution notwithstanding the definite purpose to destroy them. We think that in the circumstances Congress had no power to destroy the obligations of the gold clauses in private obligations. The attempt to do this was plain usurpation, arbitrary, and oppressive.\n The oft-repeated rule by which the validity of statutes must be tested is this: 'Let the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution, and all means which are appropriate which are plainly adapted to that end which are not prohibited but consistent with the letter and spirit of the Constitution are constitutional.'\n The end or objective of the Joint Resolution was not 'legitimate.' The real purpose was not 'to assure uniform value to the coins and currencies of the United States,' but to destroy certain valuable contract rights. The recitals do not harmonize with circumstances then existing. The act of 1900 which prescribed a standard dollar of 25.8 grains remained in force; but its command that 'all forms of money issued or coined by the United States shall be maintained at a parity of value with this standard' was not being obeyed. Our currency was passing at a material discount; all gold had been sequestrated; none was attainable. The resolution made no provision for restoring parity with the old standard; it established no new one.\n This resolution was not appropriate for carrying into effect any power entrusted to Congress. The gold clauses in no substantial way interfered with the power of coining money or regulating its value or providing an uniform currency. Their existence, as with many other circumstances, might have circumscribed the effect of the intended depreciation and [316-Continued.]\ndisclosed the unwisdom of it. But they did not prevent the exercise of any granted power. They were not inconsistent with any policy theretofore declared. To assert the contrary is not enough. The Court must be able to see the appropriateness of the thing done before it can be permitted to destroy lawful agreements. The purpose of a statute is not determined by mere recitals-certainly they are not conclusive evidence of the facts stated.\n Again, if effective, the direct, primary, and intended result of the resolution will be the destruction of valid rights lawfully acquired. There is no question here of the indirect effect of lawful exercise of power. And citations of opinions which upheld such indirect effects are beside the mark. This statute does not 'work harm and loss to individuals indirectly,' it destroys directly. Such interference violates the Fifth Amendment; there is no provision for compensation. If the destruction is said to be for the public benefit, proper compensation is essential; if for private benefit, the due process clause bars the way.\n Congress has power to coin money, but this cannot be exercised without the possession of metal. Can Congress authorize appropriation without compensation of the necessary gold? Congress has power to regulate commerce, to establish post roads, etc. Some approved plan may involve the use or destruction of A's land or a private way. May Congress authorize the appropriation or destruction of these things without adequate payment? Of\ncourse not. The limitations prescribed by the Constitution restrict the exercise of all power.\n Ling Su Fan v. United States, \n218 \nU.S. 302\n, 31 S.Ct. 21, 30 L.R.A.(N.S.) 1176, supports the power of the Legislature to prevent exportation of coins without compensation. But this is far from saying that the Legislature might have ordered destruction of the coins without compensating the owners or that they could have been required to deliver them up and accept whatever was offered. In United States v. Lynah, \n188 \nU.S. 445, 471\n, 23 S.Ct. 349, 357, this Court said: 'If any one proposition can be considered as settled by the decisions of this court it is that, although in the discharge of its duties the government may appropriate property, it cannot do so without being liable to the obligation cast by the 5th Amendment of paying just compensation.'\nGovernment Bonds.\n Congress may coin money; also it may borrow money. Neither power may be exercised so as to destroy the other; the two clauses must be so construed as to give effect to each. Valid contracts to repay money borrowed cannot be destroyed by exercising power under the coinage provision. The majority seem [316-Continued.]\nto hold that the Resolution of June 5th did not affect the gold clauses in bonds of the United States. Nevertheless, we are told that no damage resulted to the holder now before us through the refusal to pay one of them in gold coin of the kind designated or its equivalent. This amounts to a declaration that the government may give with one hand and take away with the other. Default is thus made both easy and safe. Congress brought about the conditions in respect of gold which existed when the obligation matured. Having made payment in this metal impossible, the government cannot defend by saying that if the obligation had been met the creditor could not have retained the gold; consequently he suffered no damage because of the nondelivery. Obligations cannot be legally avoided by prohibiting the creditor from receiving the thing promised. The promise was to pay in gold, standard of 1900, otherwise to discharge the debt by paying the value of the thing promised in currency. One of these things was not prohibited. The government may not escape the obligation of making good the loss incident to repudiation by prohibiting the holding of gold. Payment by fiat of any kind is beyond its recognized power. There would be no serious difficulty in estimating the value of 25. 8 grains of gold in the currency now in circulation. These bonds are held by men and women in many parts of the world; they have relied upon our honor. Thousands of our own citizens of every degree not doubting the good faith of their sovereign have purchased them. It will not be easy for this multitude to appraise the form of words which establishes that they have suffered no appreciable damage; but perhaps no more difficult for them than for us. And their difficulty will not be assuaged when they reflect that ready calculation of the exact loss suffered by the Philippine government moved Congress to satisfy it by appropriating, in June 1934, $23,862,750.78 to be paid out of the Treasury of the United States. \n4\n And see Act May 30, 1934, 48 Stat. 817, 834,  5, appropriating $7,438,000 to meet losses sustained by officers and employees in foreign countries due to appreciation of foreign currencies in their relation to the American dollar.\n[316-Continued.]\n These were contracts to return gold left on deposit; otherwise to pay its value in the currency. Here the gold was not returned; there arose the obligation of the government to pay its value. The Court of Claims has jurisdiction over such contracts. Congress made it impossible for the holder to receive and retain the gold promised him; the statute prohibited delivery to him. The contract being broken, the obligation was to pay in currency the value of 25.8 grains of gold for each dollar called for by the certificate. For the government to say, we have violated our contract but have escaped the consequences through our own statute, would be monstrous. In matters of contractual obligation the government cannot legislate so as to excuse itself.\n These words of Alexander Hamilton ought not to be forgotten: 'When a government enters into a contract with an individual, it deposes, as to the matter of the contract, its constitutional authority, and exchanges the character of legislator for that of a moral agent, with the same rights and obligations as an individual. Its promises may be justly considered as excepted out of its power to legislate, unless in aid of them. It is in theory impossible to reconcile the idea of a promise which obliges, with a power to make a law which can vary the effect of it.' 3 Hamilton's Works, 518, 519.\n These views have not heretofore been questioned here. In the Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700\n, 719, Chief Justice Waite, speaking for the majority, declared: 'The United States are as much bound by their contracts as are individuals. If they repudiate their obligations, it is as much repudiation, with all the wrong and reproach that term implies, as it would be if the repudiator had been a State or a municipality or a citizen. No change can be made in the title created by the grant of the lands, or in the contract for the subsidy bonds, without the consent of the corporation. All this is indisputable.'\n And in the same cause (pages 731, 732 of 99 U.S.) Mr. Justice Strong, speaking for himself, affirmed: 'It is as much beyond the power of a legislature, under any pretence, to alter a contract into which the government has entered with a private individual, as it is for any other party to a contract to change its terms without the consent of the person contracting with him. As to its contract the government in all its departments has laid aside its sovereignty, and it stands on the same footing with private contractors.'\n Can the government, obliged as though a private person to observe the terms of its contracts, destroy them by legislative changes in the currency and by statutes forbidding one to hold the thing which it has agreed to deliver? If an individual should undertake to annul or lessen his obligation by [316-Continued.]\nsecreting or manipulating his assets with the intent to place them beyond the reach of creditors, the attempt would be denounced as fraudulent, wholly ineffective.\n Counsel for the government and railway companies asserted with emphasis that incalculable financial disaster would follow refusal to uphold, as authorized by the Constitution, impairment and repudiation of private obligations and public debts. Their forecast is descredited by manifest exaggeration. But, whatever may be the situation now confronting us, it is the outcome of attempts to destroy lawful undertakings by legislative action; and this we think the Court should disapprove in no uncertain terms.\n Under the challenged statutes it is said the United States have realized profits amounting to $2,800,000,000.5 But this assumes that gain may be generated by legislative fiat. To such counterfeit profits there would be no limit; with each new debasement of the dollar they would expand. Two billions might be ballooned indefinitely-to twenty, thirty, or what you will.\n Loss of reputation for honorable dealing will bring us unending humiliation; the impending legal and moral chaos is appalling. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Joint Resolution.\n'To assure uniform value to the coins and currencies of the United States.\n\n'Whereas the holding of or dealing in gold affect the public interest, and are therefore subject to proper regulation and restriction; and\n\n'Whereas the existing emergency has disclosed that provisions of obligations which purport to give the obligee a right to require payment in gold or a particular kind of coin or currency of the United States, or in an amount in money of the United States measured thereby, obstruct the power of the Congress to regulate the value of the money of the United States, and are inconsistent with the declared policy of the Congress to maintain at all times the equal power of every dollar, coined or issued by the United States, in the markets and in the payment of debts.

Reference is also made to the construction of the gold clause in the bonds before the House of Lords in Feist, appellant, and Socie te Intercommunale Belge d'Electricite , Respondents, L.R. (1934) A.C. 161, 173, and to the decisions of the Permanent Court of International Justice in the cases of the Serbian and Brazilian loans (Publications of the Permanent Court of International Justice, Series A, Nos. 20\/21), where the bonds provided for payment in gold francs. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Mr. Justice Miller also dissented in Trebilcock v. Wilson, 12 Wall. pages 699, 700, upon the ground 'that a contract for gold dollars, in terms, was in no respect different, in legal effect, from a contract for dollars without the qualifying words, specie or gold, and that the legal tender statutes had, therefore, the same effect in both cases.' \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare New York Central & Hudson R.R.

By the Thomas amendment currency was intended to be made legal tender for all debts. However, due to the language used doubt has arisen whether it has been made legal tender for payments on gold clause obligations, public and private. This doubt should be removed. These gold clauses interfere with the power of Congress to regulate the value of the money of the United States and the enforcement of them would be inconsistent with existing legislative policy.' Sen. Rep. No. 99, 73d Cong., 1st Sess. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] In his Annual Report, 1926, 80, 81, the Secretary of the Treasury said: 'Gold and silver certificates are in fact mere 'warehouse receipts' issued by the Government in exchange for gold coin or bullion deposited in the one case, or standard silver dollars deposited in the other case, or against gold or standard silver dollars, respectively withdrawn from the general fund of the Treasury. ... Gold certificates, United States notes, Treasury notes of 1890, and Federal reserve notes are directly redeemable in gold.' In his letter with the Annual Report, for 1933, 375, he showed that on June 30, 1933, $1,230,717,109 was held in trust against gold certificates and Treasury notes of 1890.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed, when the funds therefor are made available, to establish on the books of the Treasury a credit in favor of the Treasury of the Philippine Islands for $23,862,750.78, being an amount equal to the increase in value (resulting from the reduction of the weight of the gold dollar) of the gold equivalent at the opening of business on January 31, 1934, of the balances maintained at that time in banks in the continental United States by the Government of the Philippine Islands for its gold standard fund and its Treasury certificate fund less the interest received by it on such balances. Section 2. There is hereby authorized to be appropriated, out of the receipts covered into the Treasury under section 7 of the Gold Reserve Act of 1934, by virtue of the reduction of the weight of the gold dollar by the proclamation of the President on January 31, 1934, the amount necessary to establish the credit provided for in section 1 of this Act.

This second drawer I will call the 'gold' drawer. In it is the very large sum of $2,800,000,000, representing 'profit' resulting from the change in the gold content of the dollar. Practically all of this 'profit' the Treasury holds in the form of gold and silver. The rest is in other assets.\n\n'I do not propose here to subtract this $2,800,000,000 from the net increase of $4,400,000,000 in the national debt-thereby reducing the figure to $1,600,000,000. And the reason why I do not subtract it is this: for the present this $2,800,000,000 is under lock and key. Most of it, by authority of Congress, is segregated in the so-called stabilization fund, and for the present we propose to keep it there. But I call your attention to the fact that ultimately we expect this 'profit' to flow back into the stream of our other revenues and thereby reduce the national debt.' \n\n\n\n\n\n","181":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nU.S. v. CONSTANTINE(1935)\nNo. 40\nArgued: November 14, 1935Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 288]\n\u00a0\n Gordon Dean, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Wm. S. Pritchard, of Birmingham, Ala., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In November, 1934, an information was filed in the District Court for Northern Alabama charging that on October 8, 1934, at Birmingham, Ala., the respondent conducted the business of a retail dealer in malt liquor contrary to the laws of the state, without having paid the special excise tax of $1,000 imposed by section 701 of the \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 289]\n\u00a0\n Revenue Act of 1926.1 A demurrer and a motion to quash were overruled, a plea of not guilty was entered, and a jury trial was waived. Pursuant to a stipulation of facts, the court found that for the fiscal year July 1, 1934, to June 30, 1935, the respondent registered with the collector of internal revenue as a retail liquor dealer and paid the tax of $25.00 imposed upon such dealers by Rev. St.  3244, as amended;2 on the date named in the information the respondent had a restaurant in Birmingham, where he conducted the business of a retail dealer in malt liquors containing more than one-half of one percent alcohol, which business was contrary to the laws of \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 290]\n\u00a0\n the state and of the city; and had not paid the $1,000 tax. Respondent's motion for judgment was denied, that of the United States was granted, and the respondent was sentenced. The Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the judgment3 on the ground that the section became inoperative upon the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment.\n In its petition for certiorari the United States, though admitting the absence of a conflicting decision by the Circuit Court of Appeals of any other circuit, called attention to diverse decisions in the District Courts,4 to the many other cases pending in which action is awaiting authoritative settlement of the question presented herein, to the large amount of money involved, and to the number of persons whose liability will remain uncertain until the dispute is finally settled. The question thus assumes the importance required by Rule 38 and the writ issued accordingly.\n In concluding that the law imposed a penalty in aid of the enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, and therefore fell with its repeal, the court relied upon the legislative history and administrative interpretation of section 701, and also thought such a construction necessary to avoid a serious question under article 1,  8, of the Constitution as to the uniformity of operation of the act throughout the United States. The government insists that the section was not a part of the machinery for enforcing the prohibition amendment, but a revenue measure levying an excise conformably to the Constitution. \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 291]\n\u00a0\n First. The government attacks, and the respondent supports, the conclusion of the court below that the section was adopted pursuant to the Eighteenth Amendment. We think little aid is to be had from the legislative history. On the one hand, it is said that the substance of the section was originally embodied in the Revenue Act of 1918 which became a law February 28, 1919 (40 Stat. 1057); that while under consideration by Congress in the autumn of 1918 the bill contained the section in question; and that, when enacted, it was made effective as of January 1, 1919. As the Eighteenth Amendment was not proclaimed until January 9, 1919, effective January 9, 1920, the argument is that the Act of 1918 was independent revenue legislation and no section of it could have been intended to enforce fundamental law which was to become operative long after the passage of the act. From the fact that the provision for the additional tax of $1,000 was carried forward from the Act of 1918 through those of 1921 and 1924 into that of 19265 the conclusion is drawn that the tax remained, as it was in the beginning, a means of raising revenue, and that its purpose was not altered by the existence of national prohibition when it was readopted as section 701 of the Revenue Act of 1926. Reference is also made to the fact that the section was specifically repealed by the Revenue Act of 19356 and the deduction is drawn that Congress thought it had no relation to the prohibition amendment.\n On the other hand, the respondent urges that the proclamation of the Amendment prior to the passage of the Act of 1918 made prohibition a certainty; that the tax of $1,000 laid upon violators of state liquor laws, in addition \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 292]\n\u00a0\n to the graded excises on various forms of the liquor business prescribed by Rev. St.  3244, as amended, and the retention of the $1,000 tax in the 1926 act, which discarded the many existing excises on other business, evince a purpose to prohibit rather than to tax liquor traffic violative of state laws.\n For reasons presently to be stated we find it unnecessary to decide whether the policy exhibited by the act at its inception was independent of the Eighteenth Amendment or in subvention of it.\n Second. The court below and the respondent regard the administrative construction as persuasive that the section is penal in character. After the adoption of the Revenue Act of 1926 the Treasury ruled that the so- called tax of $1,000 was a penalty. \n7\n Upon repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment the position was reversed; collectors were instructed to treat the item as a special tax; and the Department proceeded to prepare and distribute appropriate revenue stamps to be issued in token of its payment. We think the administrative practice has little bearing \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 293]\n\u00a0\n upon the question of the nature of the exaction. During the life of the Amendment collection was lawful whether the demand was for a tax or a penalty; and the classification by the administrative officers was therefore immaterial. Congress then had power, in the enforcement of prohibition, to impose penalties for violations of national prohibitory laws. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n Third. The repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment renders it necessary to determine whether the exaction is in fact a tax or a penalty. If it was laid to raise revenue its validity is beyond question notwithstanding the fact that the conduct of the business taxed was in violation of law. The United States has the power to levy excises upon occupations,9 and to classify them for this purpose; and need look only to the fact of the exercise of the occupation or calling taxed, regardless of whether such exercise is permitted or prohibited by the laws of the United States10 or by those of a state. \n11\n The burden of the tax may be imposed alike on the just and the unjust. It would be strange if one carrying on a business the subject of an excise should be able to excuse himself from payment by the plea that in carrying on the business he was violating the law. The rule has always been otherwise. The tax imposed by Rev. St.  3244, as amended, 12 affords an opposite illustration. That act imposes an excise, varying in amount, upon different forms of the liquor traffic. The respondent \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 294]\n\u00a0\n paid the annual tax of $25 thereby required, despite the fact that he was violating local law in prosecuting his business. Undoubtedly this was a true tax for which he was liable. The question is whether the exaction of $ 1,000 in addition, by reason solely of his violation of state law, is a tax or a penalty. If, as the court below thought, section 701 was part of the enforcing machinery under the Amendment, it automatically fell at the moment of repeal. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n But even though the statute was not adopted to penalize violations of the amendment, it ceased to be enforceable at the date of repeal, if, in fact, its purpose is to punish rather than to tax. The only color for the assertion of congressional power to ordain a penalty for violation of state liquor laws is the Eighteenth Amendment, which gave to the federal government power to enforce nation-wide prohibition. \n14\n That has been recalled; and the case must be decided in the light of constitutional principles which would have been applicable had the Amendment never been adopted. In the acts which have carried the provision, the item is variously denominated an occupation tax, an excise tax, and a special tax. If in reality a penalty it cannot be converted into a tax by so naming it, 15 and we must ascribe to it the character disclosed by its purpose and operation, regardless of name. \n16\n Disregarding the designation of the exaction, and viewing its substance and application, we hold that it is a penalty for the violation of state law, and as such beyond the limits of federal power. \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 295]\n\u00a0\n Since 1878, the revised statutes have classified various forms of the liquor traffic for the payment of excises differing in amount according to the nature of the business. \n17\n When the section exacting $1,000 additional from all persons engaged in the traffic in violation of state law was made a part of the revenue laws, the amount of the tax due by the respondent under Rev. St.  3244, as amended, was $25. The so-called excise of $1,000 is forty times as great. It is ten times as great as the annual tax under Rev. St.  3244, as amended, for wholesale liquor dealers and brewers, and fifty times as great as that imposed upon dealers in malt liquors. If the imposts under Rev. St.  3244, as amended, were fixed in amount in accordance with the importance of the business or supposed ability to pay, the exaction in question is highly exorbitant. This fact points in the direction of a penalty rather than a tax.\n The condition of the imposition is the commission of a crime. This, together with the amount of the tax, is again significant of penal and prohibitory intent rather than the gathering of revenue. \n18\n Where, in addition to the normal and ordinary tax fixed by law, an additional sum is to be collected by reason of conduct of the taxpayer violative of the law, and this additional sum is grossly disproportionate to the amount of the normal tax, the conclusion must be that the purpose is to impose a penalty as a deterrent and punishment of unlawful conduct. \n19\n\u00a0\n\n We conclude that the indicia which the section exhibits of an intent to prohibit and to punish violations of state law as such are too strong to be disregarded, remove all semblance of a revenue act and stamp the sum it exacts as a penalty. In this view the statute is a clear invasion of the police power, inherent in the states, reserved from \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 296]\n\u00a0\n the grant of powers to the federal government by the Constitution.\n We think the suggestion has never been made-certainly never entertained by this Court-that the United States may impose cumulative penalties above and beyond those specified by state law for infractions of the state's criminal code by its own citizens. The affirmative of such a proposition would obliterate the distinction between the delegated powers of the federal government and those reserved to the states and to their citizens. The implications from a decision sustaining such an imposition would be startling. The concession of such a power would open the door to unlimited regulation of matters of state concern by federal authority. The regulation of the conduct of its own citizens belongs to the state, not to the United States. The right to impose sanctions for violations of the state's laws inheres in the body of its citizens speaking through their representatives. So far as the reservations of the Tenth Amendment were qualified by the adoption of the Eighteenth the qualification has been abolished.\n Reference was made in the argument to decisions of this Court holding that where the power to tax is conceded the motive for the exaction may not be questioned. These are without relevance to the present case. The point here is that the exaction is in no proper sense a tax but a penalty imposed in addition to any the state may decree for the violation of a state law. The cases cited dealt with taxes concededly within the realm of the federal power of taxation. They are not authority where, as in the present instance, under the guise of a taxing act the purpose is to usurp the police powers of the state. \n20\n\u00a0\n\n[296 U.S. 287, 297]\n\u00a0\n In view of what has been said we do not consider the contention that the law is bad for want of the uniformity of operation required by article 1,  8, of the Constitution.\n The judgment is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO.\n I think the judgment should be reversed.\n Congress may reasonably have believed that, in view of the attendant risks, a business carried on illegally and furtively is likely to yield larger profits than one transacted openly by law-abiding men. Not repression, but payment commensurate with the gains is thus the animating motive. The gains in all likelihood will seldom be exhausted by a tax of $ 1,000. Congress may also have believed that the furtive character of the business would increase the difficulty and expense of the process of tax collection. The Treasury should have reimbursement for this drain on its resources. Apart from either of these beliefs, Congress may have held the view that an excise should be so distributed as to work a minimum of hardship; that an illegal and furtive business, irrespective of the wrongdoing of its proprietor, is a breeder of crimes and a refuge of criminals; and that in any wisely ordered polity, in any sound system of taxation, men engaged in such a calling will be made to contribute more heavily to the necessities of the Treasury than men engaged in a calling that is beneficent and lawful.\n Thus viewed the statute was not adopted to supplement or sanction the police powers of the states or of their political subdivisions. It was adopted for anything disclosed upon its face or otherwise, as an appropriate instrument of the fiscal policy of the nation. The business of trading in things contraband is not the same as the business of trading in legitimate articles of commerce. Clas- \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 298]\n\u00a0\n sification by Congress according to the nature of the calling affected by a tax (State Board of Tax Commissioners v. Jackson, \n283 \nU.S. 527\n, 51 S.Ct. 540, 73 A.L.R. 1464) does not cease to be permissible because the line of division between callings to be favored and those to be reproved corresponds with a division between innocence and criminality under the statutes of a state. Power is not abused because the shock of its impact is equitably distributed. The practice of medicine by an unlicensed charlatan may be taxed on a different basis from its practice by a licensed physician, irrespective of the fact that the charlatan is guilty of a crime. The practice of law by a disbarred lawyer may be taxed on a different basis from the practice of the same profession by a lawyer in good standing. With as much if not greater reason a like distinction may be drawn between the licensed and the unlicensed traffic in intoxicating liquors. The underlying principle in all these cases is as clear as it is just. A business that is a nuisance (People v. Vandewater, 250 N.Y. 83, 164 N.E. 864), like any other business that is socially undesirable, may be taxed at a higher rate than one legitimate and useful. Fox v. Standard Oil Co., \n294 \nU.S. 87, 100\n, 55 S.Ct. 333. By classifying in such a mode Congress is not punishing for a crime against another government. It is not punishing at all. It is laying an excise upon a business conducted in a particular way with notice to the taxpayer that if he embarks upon that business he will be subjected to a special burden. What he pays, if he chooses to go on, is a tax and not a penalty. Nigro v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 332, 353\n, 354 S., 48 S.Ct. 388. Cf. Life & Casualty Insurance Co. v. McCray, \n291 \nU.S. 566, 574\n, 54 S.Ct. 482.\n The judgment of the court, if I interpret the reasoning aright, does not rest upon a ruling that Congress would have gone beyond its power if the purpose that it professed was the purpose truly cherished. The judgment of the court rests upon the ruling that another purpose, not \n\n[296 U.S. 287, 299]\n\u00a0\n professed, may be read beneath the surface, and by the purpose so imputed the statute is destroyed. Thus the process of psychoanalysis has spread to unaccustomed fields. There is a wise and ancient doctrine that a court will not inquire into the motives of a legislative body or assume them to be wrongful. Fletcher v. Peck, 6 Cranch, 87, 130; Magnano Co. v. Hamilton, \n292 \nU.S. 40, 44\n, 54 S.Ct. 599. There is another wise and ancient doctrine that a court will not adjudge the invalidity of a statute except for manifest necessity. Every reasonable doubt must have been explored and extinguished before moving to that grave conclusion. Ogden v. Saunders, 12 Wheat. 213, 270. The warning sounded by this court in the Sinking Fund Cases (Union P.R. Co. v. U.S.), \n99 U.S. 700\n, 718, has lost none of its significance. 'Every possible presumption is in favor of the validity of a statute, and this continues until the contrary is shown beyond a rational doubt. One branch of the government cannot encroach on the domain of another without danger. The safety of our institutions depends in no small degree on a strict observance of this salutary rule.' I cannot rid myself of the conviction that in the imputation to the lawmakers of a purpose not professed, this salutary rule of caution is now forgotten or neglected after all the many protestations of its cogency and virtue.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice STONE join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'On and after July 1, 1926, there shall be levied, collected, and paid annually, in lieu of the tax imposed by section 701 of the Revenue Act of 1924, a special excise tax of $1,000, in the case of every person carrying on the business of a brewer, distiller, wholesale liquor dealer, retail liquor dealer, wholesale dealer in malt liquor, retail dealer in malt liquor, or manufacturer of stills, as defined in section 3244 as amended and section 3247 of the Revised Statutes, in any State, Territory, or District of the United States contrary to the laws of such State, Territory, or District, or in any place therein in which carrying on such business is prohibited by local or municipal law.

Under order of the court the government filed a bill of particulars. 4 F.Supp. 662. Defendants then moved to quash the indictment. The motion was based upon the indictment, the bill of particulars, and an affidavit of defendants' counsel. The affidavit was an argumentative review of the bill of \n\n[296 U.S. 451, 452]\n\u00a0\n particulars for the purpose of showing that in view of its statements the government would be 'unable to make a case.' The court granted the motion to quash, and the government brought this appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act. 18 U.S.C.  682, 18 U.S.C.A.  682. Defendants' motion to dismiss the appeal was postponed to the hearing on the merits.\n The District Judge rendered no opinion, but certified that his 'decision and order quashing the indictment herein were not based in any respect upon the invalidity or construction of section 215 of the Criminal Code upon which the indictment in said cause is founded.'\n We find no basis for the contention that defendants' motion to quash was in substance a 'special plea in bar' within the meaning of the Criminal Appeals Act. See United States v. Storrs, \n272 \nU.S. 652, 654\n, 47 S. Ct. 221; United States v. Murdock, \n284 \nU.S. 141, 147\n, 52 S. Ct. 63, 82 A.L.R. 1376. The motion and the affidavit in its support challenged the sufficiency of the indictment in the light of the bill of particulars. As it does not appear that the decision of the District Judge was based upon the construction or invalidity of the statute upon which the indictment is founded, and as it may well be that the decision was based upo the construction of the indictment and its insufficiency as a pleading, this court is without jurisdiction of the appeal.

Ickes, Secretary of the Interior and Federal Emergency Administrator of Public Works, caused to be commenced the construction of the Parker Dam in the main stream of the Colorado River, the thread of which for a distance of about 237 miles is the boundary between Arizona and California. The site is 150 miles below the Boulder Dam, half a mile below the place where the Williams River flows into the Colorado and ten miles north of the Colorado River Indian Reservation. Its ends rest on public lands of the United States in Arizona and California. Arizona objects to the construction of the dam, asserts that it may not lawfully be built without her consent, and threatens the use of military force to stop the work. January 14, 1935, the United States filed its bill in equity perpetually to enjoin interference by the State. On plaintiff's motion this court directed defendant to show cause why a restraining order should not issue pending the final determination of the suit. Arizona filed a return consisting of an affidavit of the governor setting forth the grounds on which the State claims the right to prevent the construction of the dam in the part of the river bed that is easterly of the thread of the stream, a motion to dismiss the bill and a supporting brief. We heard counsel on plaintiff's application for a temporary injunction and defendant's motion to dismiss.\n We come first to the question whether the complaint alleges facts sufficient to warrant an injunction against the State. The allegations will be better understood after brief reference to the Colorado River Compact1 and the Boulder Canyon Project Act, 45 Stat. 1057 (43 USCA  617 to 617t).\n The Compact was made by California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Wyoming. Arizona was \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 180]\n\u00a0\n not a party. It was made to provide an equitable apportionment of the waters of the Colorado River system among the interested States, establish relative importance of different beneficial uses and secure the development of the Colorado River basin, the storage of its waters and protection against floods. After apportionment between defined basins lying above and below Lee Ferry and a declaration that the Colorado has ceased to be navigable for commerce and that the use of its waters for purposes of navigation should be subservient to uses for domestic, agricultural, and power purposes, the Compact authorizes the waters of the system to be impounded and used for the generation of power and declares that use subservient to uses for agricultural and domestic purposes. It was approved by section 13(a) of the Boulder Canyon Project Act (43 USCA  617l, subd. (a) and, by presidential proclamation, it took effect June 25, 1929. 46 Stat. 3000. The act authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to construct a dam and incidental works in the Colorado at Boulder Canyon adequate to create a reservoir having a capacity of not less than 20,000, 000 acre feet 'and a main canal and appurtenant structures located entirely within the United States connecting the Laguna Dam, or other suitable diversion dam, which the Secretary ... is hereby authorized to construct if deemed necessary or advisable by him upon engineering or economic considerations, with the Imperial and Coachella Valleys in California.' Section 1 (43 USCA  617).2 In a suit in this Court against the Secretary of the Interior and the States which were parties, Arizona unsuccessfully sought to have ratification of the Compact decreed to be unconstitutional and to enjoin construction of the Boulder Dam and the doing \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 181]\n\u00a0\n of anything under color of that act. Arizona v. California, \n283 \nU.S. 423\n, 51 S.Ct. 522\n\n\n The bill alleges that February 10, 1933, the United States, acting through the Secretary of the Interior, entered into a contract with the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. The District agrees to pay to the United States the entire cost of the dam, assumed not to exceed $ 13,000,000. By the use of this money the United States agrees that, under the Reclamation Act, June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, and supplemental acts, particularly those of April 21, 1904, 33 Stat. 224, March 4, 1921, 41 Stat. 1404, and December 21, 1928 (The Boulder Canyon Project Act (43 USCA  617 to 617t))3 it will construct the Parker Dam. The District is to have one-half the power privilege and the right to divert specified quantities of water. The United States is to have the right to the rest of the power, to divert water, to transmit power at cost over the district's lines from Boulder to Parker, and, by means of canals, to connect Parker Dam with lands in the Colorado River Indian Reservation in Arizona and with other lands in that State and in California.\n Parker Dam will intercept waters discharged at Boulder Dam and the inflow of tributaries of the Colorado below that dam; raise the river level 72 feet and create a reservoir about 20 miles long, having capacity of 717,000 acre feet, and permit generation of approximately 85,000 horsepower of electricity. Operated with Boulder Dam, it will \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 182]\n\u00a0\n 'regulate and equate, in aid of navigation and river regulation,' the waters discharged at Boulder Dam for flood control, power generation and irrigation; allow, for generation of power, the discharge at Boulder Dam of water which otherwise would have to be retained there in storage, and also conserve the waters there discharged.\n The bill also alleges that heavy flash floods of the Williams River are a menace to the Colorado River Indian Reservation, to United States public lands and to navigation below Parker. The dam is designed to promote reclamation of the reservation lands and of public lands of the United States. The power privilege reserved by the United States is for the purpose of pumping water for irrigation of these lands.\n To disclose grounds on which the United States claims the right to construct the dam, the bill sets out that at various times Congress has made appropriations amounting in all to more than $1,359,000 for construction of irrigation and diversion works for the reservation;4 that the above mentioned Act of April 21, 1904, authorized the Secretary of the Interior to divert the waters of the Colo- \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 183]\n\u00a0\n rado and to reclaim, utilize and dispose of land in the reservation which might be made irrigable by works constructed under the Reclamation Act, and that the Boulder Canyon Project Act appropriated moneys for surveys of the Parker-Gila reclamation project which, it is said, embraces the Indian reservation and certain public lands of the United States. And it is asserted that the Parker Dam project has been included by the Administrator in the comprehensive program of public works authorized by section 202, National Industrial Recovery Act, 48 Stat. 201 (40 USCA  402 ); that, pursuant to that Act, the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army has recommended the construction and his recommendation has received the approval of the Secretary of War.\n\n 1. \nThe bill alleges that the stretch of the Colorado between Arizona and California is navigable, and the motion to dismiss is dealt with on that basis. Arizona owns the part of the river bed that is east. of the thread of the stream. New Jersey v. Delaware, \n291 U.S. 361\n, 379 et seq., 54 S.Ct. 407. Her jurisdiction in respect of the appropriation, use and distribution of an equitable share of the waters flowing therein is unaffected by the Compact or federal reclamation law. But the title of the State is held subject to the power granted to Congress by the commerce clause, United States v. Holt Bank, \n270 \nU.S. 49, 54\n, 55 S., 46 S.Ct. 197, and under that clause Congress has power to cause to be built a dam across the river in aid of navigation. The Boulder Canyon Project Act is an example of the exertion of that power. Arizona v. California, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 423, 451\n, 455 S.-457, 51 S.Ct. 522. But no Act of Congress specifically authorizes the construction of the Parker Dam. Subject to an exception with which we have no concern, section 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899, forbids the construction of any bridge, dam, dike or causeway over or in any port, roadstead, haven, harbor, canal, navigable river, or other navigable water of the United States until the consent of Congress shall have \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 184]\n\u00a0\n been obtained and until the plans shall have been submitted to and approved by the Chief of Engineers and by the Secretary of War. 33 U.S.C.  401 (33 USCA  401). And section 12, as amended, makes violations of section 9 punishable by fine or imprisonment or both and provides for the removal of unauthorized structures. 33 U.S.C.  406 (33 USCA  406). These provisions unmistakably disclose definite intention on the part of Congress effectively to safeguard rivers and other navigable waters against the unauthorized erection therein of dams or other structures for any purpose whatsoever. The plaintiff maintains that the restrictions so imposed apply only to work undertaken by private parties. But no such intention is expressed, and we are of opinion that none is implied. The measures adopted for the enforcement of the prescribed rule are in general terms and purport to be applicable to all. No valid reason has been or can be suggested why they should apply to private persons and not to federal and state officers. There is no presumption that regulatory and disciplinary measures do not extend to such officers. Taken at face value the language indicates the purpose of Congress to govern conduct of its own officers and employees as well as that of others. Donnelley v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 505, 516\n, 48 S.Ct. 400. If still in force, section 9 unquestionably makes 'consent of Congress' essential to the valid authorization of the Parker Dam. There has been no express repeal of that section and, as will presently appear, it is not inconsistent with subsequent legislation on which plaintiff relies.\n\n 2. \nPlaintiff, unable to cite any statute specifically authorizing the Secretary to construct the dam, turns to section 25 of the Act of April 21, 1904, 33 Stat. 224. That section is a part of the reclamation laws which are enacted, not under the commerce clause, art. 1,  8, cl. 3, but in the exertion of power granted by article 4,  3, cl. 2: 'The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 185]\n\u00a0\n needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States.' United States v. Hanson (C.C.A.) 167 F. 881, 883. State of Kansas v. Colorado, \n206 \nU.S. 46, 88\n, 27 S.Ct. 655 et seq. The part of section 25 relied on follows: 'That in carrying out any irrigation enterprise which may be undertaken under the provisions of the reclamation Act ... and which may make possible and provide for, in connection with the reclamation of other lands, the reclamation of all or any portion of the irrigable lands on the Yuma and Colorado River Indian reservations in California and Arizona, the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to divert the waters of the Colorado River and to reclaim, utilize, and dispose of any lands in said reservations which may be irrigable by such works in like manner as though the same were a part of the public domain.' The immediate question is whether the italicized clause can reasonably be construed as adequate to carry the burden that plaintiff would have us lay upon it. The purpose was not to prescribe or regulate the means to be employed to divert water from the Colorado but to extend the reclamation law to the Indian reservations named. It was merely to empower the Secretary, if the circumstances stated should arise, to reclaim lands in these reservations by use of water to be taken from that river. The authority granted was no more than permission to appropriate them for the purpose specified. No dam is shown to have been necessary. Water is frequently taken from streams for the purposes of irrigation without putting dams across them. Failure specifically to authorize a dam or even approximately to fix location or to require use calculated to aid navigation makes strongly against the plaintiff.\n In support of the construction for which it contends, plaintiff asserts that it was under this act that the Secretary of the Interior built the Laguna Dam across the \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 186]\n\u00a0\n Colorado. But it does not appear that either riparian State objected or that the validity of his authority has ever been drawn in question. Congress has made appropriations for the benefit of the project of which it is a part5 and so recognized and approved the building of the dam. Wisconsin v. Duluth, \n96 U.S. 379\n, 386. There has been cited no other instance of the construction, without the consent of the Congress, of a dam across a navigable interstate river. Indeed, it is not certain that that part of the Colorado was then deemed to be navigable. \n6\n We find no merit in the contention that section 25 of the Act of April 21, 1904, is the 'consent of Congress' required by section 9 of the Act of March 3, 1899. And plainly without force is the suggestion that by making appropriations for irrigation of lands in Indian reservations Congress authorized this dam.\n\n 3. \nThe clause of section 1 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act empowering the Secretary to construct a main canal connecting the Laguna Dam 'or other suitable diversion dam' with the Imperial and Coachella Valleys does not authorize the building or in any respect apply to the proposed Parker Dam. The latter is about 70 miles upstream from the Laguna and the canal proposed to be built to bring water to the valleys named. \n7\n The contract alleged to have been made by the United States and the Metropolitan Water District, a copy of which is attached to plaintiff's brief, shows that the purpose immediately to be served by the Parker Dam is to enable the United \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 187]\n\u00a0\n States in fulfillment of earlier contracts to deliver waters at that place into the aqueduct of the District. And while that instrument specifies other uses to which the United States may put the waters by means of the dam, transmission by canal to either of these valleys is not mentioned. Indeed, the plaintiff does not, and it could not reasonably, claim that section 1 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act authorizes the construction of this dam. Nor does it make any contention in respect of the allegation of the bill that section 11 of the Act (43 USCA  617j) authorizes surveys of the Parker-Gila reclamation project.\n\n 4. \nParker Dam was not approved by the President as required by section 4 of the Act of June 25, 1910, 43 U.S.C.  413 (43 USCA  413). That section declares that no irrigation project contemplated by the Reclamation Act 'shall be begun unless and until the same shall have been recommended by the Secretary of the Interior and approved by the direct order of the President of the United States.' The project in question rightly may be deemed to have been begun on the date, February 10, 1933, of the contract made by the United States and the Water District for the construction of the dam. There is no allegation that any project including the dam was ever recommended, submitted to or in any manner approved by the President. But plaintiff maintains that the approval required in the section has been given through executive action under the National Industrial Recovery Act. It relies on sections 201(a), 202, and 203 of the act (40 USCA  401(a), 402, 403), and Executive Order No. 6252 (40 USCA  414 note). The first of these authorizes the President to delegate any of his powers under title 2 of the act to such agents as he may designate. Section 202 (40 USCA  402) provides that the Administrator under the direction of the President shall prepare a comprehensive program of public works 'which shall include ... construction of river and harbor improvements: ... Provided, That no river or harbor improvements shall be carried out unless they shall have heretofore \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 188]\n\u00a0\n or hereafter been adopted by the Congress or are recommended by the Chief of Engineers. ...' Section 203 (40 USCA  403) authorizes the President 'through the Administrator ... to construct ... any public-works project included in the program prepared pursuant to section 202 (section 402).' The Executive Order (40 USCA  414 note) delegates authority to the Administrator 'to construct ... any public works project included in the program.' The contract here involved was made more than four months before the passage of that act. Plaintiff asserts that the project was included in the comprehensive program, that the Administrator commenced construction about September 10, 1934, and that on November 10 following, Arizona interfered forcibly to prevent plaintiff from doing the work. The alleged recommendation by the Chief of Engineers and approval by the Secretary of War were not made until January 5, 1935,8 nine days before plaintiff filed its bill. These facts do not constitute approval 'by direct order of the President' as required by section 4 (15 USCA  704). Plaintiff does not allege or claim that the President has directly authorized the dam or specifically empowered the Administrator to include it in the comprehensive program. We find nothing in the Recovery Act that reasonably may be held to repeal the requirement of that section. It follows that the construction of the dam has not been authorized as required by the Reclamation Law.\n\n 5. \nPlaintiff's contention that the dam is being built under authority of the Recovery Act is without force.\n The chronology just given, when taken in connection with the citations in the contract of the Acts relied on, shows the claim to be an afterthought born of the contro- \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 189]\n\u00a0\n versy disclosed by the complaint and about to be here submitted. Section 25 of the Act of April 21, 1904, does not authorize this dam. Plaintiff does not assert that it was otherwise adopted by Congress. It therefore remains only to consider whether the dam was recommended by the Chief of Engineers within the meaning of the proviso of section 202. When the Recovery Act was passed, the phrases 'adopted by the Congress' and 'recommended by the Chief of Engineer,' when used in acts of Congress relating to river and harbor improvements, had well-understood and definite technical meanings. The statutes, at least in the 40 years next preceding the passage of the Recovery Act, disclose: It has been the general, if not indeed the uniform, practice of Congress specifically to authorize all river and harbor improvements carried out by the United States,9 and to base its action upon the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers. \n10\n That officer \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 190]\n\u00a0\n makes such recommendation only after preliminary examinations followed by surveys. \n11\n Congress expressly directs the making of these examinations and surveys12 and prohibits any which it has not authorized. \n13\n\u00a0\n\n[295 U.S. 174, 191]\n\u00a0\n 'As a general rule where the legislation dealing with a particular subject consists of a system of related general provisions indicative of a settled policy, new enactments of a fragmentary nature on that subject are to be taken as intended to fit into the existing system and to be carried into effect conformably to it, excepting as a different purpose is clearly shown.' United States v. Jefferson Electric Co., \n291 \nU.S. 386, 396\n, 54 S. Ct. 443, 447. In the light of that rule it is clear the general language of the Recovery Act on which plaintiff relies does not evidence intention on the part of Congress to change its well established policy. In respect of the required recommendation by the Chief of Engineers there is no inconsistency between the proviso and the statutes upon which rests the practice of his office. The Recovery Act may, and therefore it must, be read in harmony with the purposes evidenced by the provisions of the Rivers and Harbors Acts to which reference has been made. When so read the proviso requires that the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers be based on examinations, surveys and reports made in pursuance of these Acts and submitted to the Congress for its consideration when determining whether the project should be undertaken. The only change effected by the Recovery Act is that the improvement may be made if either 'adopted by the Congress' or 'recommended by the Chief of Engineers' whereas the prior practice required not only recommendation by the Chief of Engineers but also adoption by Congress; that is, the Recovery Act amounts merely to the adoption of projects that have been here- \n\n[295 U.S. 174, 192]\n\u00a0\n tofore or hereafter may be recommended to Congress by the Chief of Engineers under the established practice. \n14\n\u00a0\n\n In accordance with definite policy long pursued by it, the Congress has committed to the Secretary of War and Chief of Engineers all investigations, surveys and work in aid of navigation. The Recovery Act discloses no intention to require that the Chief of Engineers' recommendations in respect of proposed improvements shall be made to the Administrator instead of to the Congress. The provisions of the Act brought forward by plaintiff make no such change. Plainly they are not sufficient to empower the Administrator to initiate preliminary examinations and surveys or to determine whether the Parker Dam or any work in aid of navigation shall be undertaken.\n It is not shown that Congress ever directed a preliminary examination or survey by the Chief of Engineers of any project that includes this dam. This is a condition precedent to the recommendation required by the proviso. Failure to allege compliance warrants the conclusion that the recommendation relied upon lacks the support of examination and survey by army officers and review by the board of engineer officers required by law.\n\n 6. \nAs the complaint fails to show that the construction of the dam is authorized, there is no ground for the granting of an injunction against the State, and therefore the complaint must be dismissed.\n It is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Printed in California Statutes, 1929, c. 1, p. 1,  1. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] By sections 12 and 14 of the Boulder Canyon Project Act (43 USCA  617k, 617m), the Reclamation Law is defined to mean the Act of June 17, 1902, 32 Stat. 388, and acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, including the Boulder Canyon Project Act. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Other amendatory and supplemental acts are: Acts of February 25, 1905, 33 Stat. 814; March 3, 1905, 33 Stat. 1032 (43 USCA  393); April 16, 1906, 34 Stat. 116; June 12, 1906, 34 Stat. 259 (43 USCA  391); June 27, 1906, 34 Stat. 519; June 11, 1910, 36 Stat. 465 (43 USCA  564, 565); June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 835; Feb. 21, 1911, 36 Stat. 925 (43 USCA  523 to 525); Feb. 24, 1911, 36 Stat. 930 (43 USCA  522); Aug. 13, 1914, 38 Stat. 686; June 12, 1917, 40 Stat. 149; Oct. 2, 1917,  10, 40 Stat. 300 ( 30 USCA  149); Feb. 25, 1920,  35, 41 Stat. 450 (30 USCA  191); May 20, 1920, 41 Stat. 605 (43 USCA  375); June 10, 1920,  17, 41 Stat. 1072 (16 USCA  810); Dec. 5, 1924,  4, 43 Stat. 701; June 6, 1930, 46 Stat. 522 ( 43 USCA  401). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Act of March 2, 1867, 14 Stat. 514, appropriated $50,000 'For expense of collecting and locating the Colorado River Indians in Arizona, on a reservation set apart for them by' section 1, Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 559, 'including the expense of constructing a canal for irrigating said reservation.'

It also fails to give the date of the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers and approval by the Secretary of War. A copy of the certificate attached to the complaint furnishes that date, January 5, 1935. \n\n[\nFootnote 9\n] The Rivers and Harbors Acts prior to that of September 22, 1922, authorized surveys and improvements and made appropriations. A typical provision was: 'That the following sums ... are hereby appropriated ... to be expended under the direction of the Secretary of War and the supervision of the Chief of Engineers, for the construction, completion, repair, and preservation of the public works hereinafter named. ...' Act of August 8, 1917, 40 Stat. 250. The Act of September 22, 1922, omitted appropriations and adopted specified improvements: 'That the following works of improvement are hereby adopted and authorized, to be prosecuted under the direction of the Secretary of War and supervision of the Chief of Engineers, in accordance with the plans recommended in the reports hereinafter designated. ...' 42 Stat. 1038.

Rep. No. 795, 57th Cong., 1st session, p. 3), Congress created in his office a Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors,  3, Act of June 13, 1902, 32 Stat. 372. Subsequent legislation in respect of this Board, material here, is found in section 3, Act of June 25, 1910, 36 Stat. 668, 669; sections 3 and 4, Act of March 4, 1913, 37 Stat. 825; section 2, June 5, 1920, 41 Stat. 1010; section 9, September 22, 1922, 42 Stat. 1043, 33 U.S.C.,  541, 542, 545, 546, 547, 568 (33 USCA  541, 542, 545, 546, 547, 568).\n Preliminary examinations are first made, unless Congress expressly directs a survey and estimate, and if, upon such examination, the improvement is not thought advisable, no further action may be taken unless Congress so directs. 33 U.S.C.  545 (33 USCA  545). The subsequent detailed survey report is made by the district engineer, it is reviewed by the division engineer, by the Board of Engineers for Rivers and Harbors and finally by the Chief of Engineers who submits to Congress a report containing information of a character specified by the above statutes, together with his recommendation. As shown in footnote 10, a congressional committee may not consider a project with a view to its adoption if five years have elapsed since submission of a report on a survey. See 79 Cong. Rec., p. 5439, et seq. 1922 Report of Chief of Engineers, pp. 99, 100. \n[\nFootnote 12\n] Since September 22, 1922, the Acts authorizing preliminary examinations and surveys employ the following language: 'The Secretary of War is hereby authorized and directed to cause preliminary examinations and surveys to be made at the following-named localities. ...'

Section 12, Act of September 22, 1922, 42 Stat. 1043. Typical language in the Acts appropriating for rivers and harbors is: 'That no funds shall be expended for any preliminary examination, survey, project, or estimate not authorized by law.'

STATE OF OREGON(1935)\nNo. 13\nArgued: March 12, 1935Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 1, 3]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Crawford Biggs, Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., Chas. M. Blackmar, of Kansas City, Mo., and R. S. Collins, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Messrs. L. A. Liljeqvist, of Coquille, Or., and I. H. Van Winkle, of Salem, Or., for defendant.\n\n\n[295 U.S. 1, 5]\n\u00a0\n\n -Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an original suit brought by the United States against the state of Oregon to quiet title to 81,786 acres of unsurveyed lands in Harney county, Or. The lands lie within a meander line 105.36 miles in length. The line was surveyed principally by John H. Neal in 1895-1896, and approved by the Commissioner of the Land Office in 1897; the remainder has since been surveyed, and has been approved by the Commissioner. The meander line purports to mark the boundaries of lands underlying five bodies of water at the ordinary or mean high-water mark. They are Lake Malheur (47,670 acres), Mud Lake (1,466 acres), Harney Lake (29,562 acres), the Narrows (296 acres, connecting Lake Malheur with Mud Lake), and the Sand Reef (2,792 acres, connecting Mud Lake with Harney Lake). The five bodies of water extend from the extreme end of Lake Malheur on the east to the westerly side of Harney Lake, a distance of approximately thirty miles. Lake Malheur is shown by maps in evidence to be 16.66 miles in length and more than 6 miles in width. Mud Lake is a small body of water, a little over a mile in diameter. Harney Lake is similarly shown to be 8.57 miles long and approximately 5 miles wide. \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 6]\n\u00a0\n The principal source of inflow to Lake Malheur, at all the times material to the present controversy, has been from the Silvies river on the north and the Donner und Blitzen river on the south. The source of inflow to Harney Lake is from Lake Malheur through the Narrows, thence through Mud Lake and the Sand Reef. Some water also flows into Harney Lake on the north from Silver Creek, a mountain stream, which is dry for part of the year. Harney Lake has no outlet.\n By Executive Order of August 18, 1908, all of the land claimed by the United States in this suit was set apart as a bird reserve, known as the Lake Malheur Reservation, and has since been administered as such by the United States Bureau of Biological Survey, under the direction of the Department of Agriculture.\n The state of Oregon was admitted to the Union on February 14, 1859 ( 11 Stat. 383). At that date the area within the meander line was a part of the public domain of the United States. No part of it has ever been disposed of, in terms, by any grant of the United States. Decision of the principal issues raised by the pleadings and proof turns on the question whether the area involved underlay navigable waters at the time of the admission of Oregon to statehood. If the waters were navigable in fact, title passed to the state upon her admission to the Union. Shively v. Bowlby, \n152 U.S. 1\n, 26-31, 14 S.Ct. 548; Scott v. Lattig, \n227 \nU.S. 229, 242\n, 243 S., 33 S.Ct. 242, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 107; State of Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 583\n, 591 S., 42 S.Ct. 406. United States v. State of Utah, \n283 \nU.S. 64, 75\n, 51 S.Ct. 438. If the waters were nonnavigable, our decision must then turn on the question whether the title of the United States to the lands in question, or part of them, has passed to the state. This is asserted to be a consequence of the United States having parted with title to the uplands bordering on the meander line, by patents to private grantees, and by statutory grant to the state of school and indemnity lands in the act admitting Oregon to statehood. See United States v. Morrison, \n240 \nU.S. 192\n, 36 S.Ct. 326. The state contends \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 7]\n\u00a0\n that the common-law rule, applied by this Court in Hardin v. Jordan, \n140 \nU.S. 371\n, 11 S.Ct. 808, that a conveyance of land bounded upon the waters of a nonnavigable lake carries by implications to the center of the lake, does not obtain in Oregon, especially in the case of lakes of the size of Malheur and Harney. It insists that grants by the United States of lands within the state, like those of a private individual, are to be construed in accordance with state law, and that by the common and statute law of Oregon a conveyance of the uplands bordering on a nonnavigable lake, by the owner of the lake bed to any grantee, vests title to the bed in the state. Other questions of minor importance will be considered as it is found necessary to deal with them in the course of the opinion.\n The issues raised by the pleadings were referred to a special master, with the powers of a master in chancery, to take the evidence and report his findings of fact and conclusions of law, and to make recommendations to this Court for a decree. After hearing and considering voluminous testimony he has rendered his report, with findings of fact and conclusions of law and a proposed form of decree. He found that none of the waters within the meander line was navigable in fact and concluded that the state of Oregon had acquired no right, title, or interest in any part of the land lying within the meander line, save such as is incidental to the ownership of land acquired by it from patentees of the United States, fronting a distance of 159.67 chains on the meander line on either side of the westerly portion of the Narrows, designated on maps in evidence as Subdivision B (between the bridge and Mud Lake), and such as is incidental to its ownership of uplands acquired from grantees of the United States by patents bounding the granted lands upon the meander line fronting on the easterly side of Mud Lake, a distance of 72.31 chains. See Hardin v. Jordan, supra.\n With reference to the land within the meander boundaries of Subdivision B of the Narrows, he found that the \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 8]\n\u00a0\n United States, prior to the commencement of suit, had disposed of all its interest in the uplands bordering on the meander line on both sides, to patentees and as indemnity lands under the school land grant to Oregon. He also found that the Narrows had the character of a nonnavigable stream, and concluded that the United States had retained no interest in the land within the meander line boundary, since Rev. St.  2476 (43 USCA  931), applicable to grants of the United States, provides: '... In all cases where the opposite banks of any streams not navigable belong to different persons, the stream and the bed thereof shall become common to both.'\n The master accordingly recommended a decree adjudging that the state is owner in fee simple of the land lying within the meander line of Subdivision B of the Narrows, incidental to its ownership of patented uplands bordering on the meander line, and to a portion of the bed of Mud Lake fronting the riparian or littoral patented land of the state on Mud Lake, aggregating 8.99 per cent. of the total lake bed. The percentage was derived by determining the proportion which the length of the state's boundary on the meander line bears to the total meander line of the lake. It was further recommended that the state be adjudged to have no other right, title, or interest in any of the lands in suit.\n He also made the following findings which have a bearing on the title of the United States to land within the meander line boundary of each of the five bodies of water.\n Lake Malheur. He found that the United States, before suit, had disposed of 79.80 per cent. of the total frontage of the upland bordering on the meander line of Lake Malheur and had retained upland fronting on the meander line to the extent of the remaining 29.20 per cent. Of the 79. 80 per cent. disposed of, 1.34 per cent. was school lands, granted to Oregon and sold by it to private grantees, and 4.80 per cent. was indemnity land, listed to and similarly sold by the state \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 9]\n\u00a0\n before action was brought. The remaining 73.66 per cent. had been patented directly to private grantees. As none of the owners of these lands is a party to the present suit, the master made no recommendation for a decree as to their interests in the land within the meander line.\n The Narrows. As to subdivision A, the master found that the lands bordering on both sides comprised patented and indemnity lands which had been conveyed to individual owners, and that, as the Narrows is a nonnavigable stream, the United States, by virtue of Rev. St.  2476 (43 USCA  931), retained no interest in the land within the meander line, except in so far as it may have an easement through the entire division for the flow of water from Lake Malheur.\n Mud Lake. The master found that the United States had retained no upland fronting on the meander line boundary. All except that now vested in Oregon, already referred to as having a frontage of 72.31 chains on the meander line boundary, is vested in private owners. Neither party has taken any exception to the findings, and, as the private owners are not parties to the present suit, the master made no recommendation for a decree with respect to their title or interest in the land within the meander boundary.\n The Sand Reef. The master found that the United States, at the commencement of the suit, had retained uplands having 84.92 per cent. of the total frontage on the meander line boundary of the Sand Reef. Of the frontage disposed of, 4.90 per cent. is that acquired by individuals and the remaining 10.18 per cent. is school land acquired by Oregon. The claim of the state that it has title to the adjacent lands within the meander line, as incident to its ownership of the upland, was rejected by the special master because the survey of the uplands was approved subsequent to the Executive Order of August 18, 1908, setting aside the area in question as the Lake Malheur Reservation. Although the state has excepted to this finding, because the Proclamation antedated the effective date of the Migra- \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 10]\n\u00a0\n tory Bird Treaty Act, approved July 3, 1918, c. 128, 40 Stat. 755 (16 USCA  703 et seq.), we conclude that the master's determination was correct. See United States v. Midwest Oil Co., \n236 U.S. 459\n, 469-475, 35 S.Ct. 309; United States v. Morrison, \n240 \nU.S. 192, 210\n, 36 S.Ct. 326; see, also, the Act for the Protection of Game Birds of June 28, 1906, c. 3565, 34 Stat. 536 (see 18 USCA  145 and note).\n Harney Lake. The master found that at the time of commencement of the suit the United States had retained uplands bordering on 87.91 per cent. of the meander line boundary of Harney Lake and that it had disposed of lands having a frontage of 12.09 per cent. Of this, 1.10 per cent. represents the frontage of land patented to a private individual. The remaining 10.99 per cent represents frontage of school lands, of which those having a frontage of 5.87 per cent. were acquired by Oregon upon surveys approved after the Executive Order of August 18, 1908. For reasons already stated, we conclude that the master correctly determined that the state acquired no interest in the lands within the meander line upon this frontage, as incident to its ownership of the upland.\n The master found that the remaining school lands, having a frontage of 5.12 per cent., passed to Oregon under a survey approved before the Executive Order, but he rejected the claim of Oregon to any interest in the adjacent land within the meander line. This was done because he thought the rule of Hardin v. Jordan, supra, was not applicable to school and indemnity lands surveyed to the border of nonnavigable waters, and because the state had claimed and received lieu lands elsewhere for a deficiency in granted school lands, which deficiency lay within the meander line. We do not pass upon the first ground, but agree that the acceptance by the state of lands elsewhere, in lieu of lands lying within the meander line adjacent to the granted uplands, was such a practical construction of the boundary, and necessarily involved such a relinquishment of any interest in the \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 11]\n\u00a0\n adjacent lands as an incident to the grant of uplands, as to preclude the assertion of that claim here.\n The master accordingly concluded that the United States retained the entire interest in the area within the meander line of Harney Lake, except such interest as was acquired by the individual patentee of upland. As he was not a party to the suit, the master made no recommendation with respect to a decree as to his interest.\n Stable Lands within the Meander Line. The Special Master found that there were stable lands, consisting of islands and promontories within the meander line, aggregating 9,328.8 acres at the mean water surface elevation of 4,093 feet above sea level, the title to which he found to be in the United States. \n 1\n\u00a0\n\n The exceptions filed to the master's report raise further issues with respect to the following findings, among others:\n\n\n (1)\n That the waters under which the lands in question lay were not navigable in fact on February 14, 1859, the date of admission of Oregon to statehood.\n\n\n (2)\n That there were on that date stable lands constituting islands and promontories within the meander line. \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 12]\n\u00a0\n (3) That the meander line as surveyed by J. H. Neal, 1895-1896, and approved in 1897, was and is a correct line.\n\n\n (4)\n That it is unnecessary to make any finding with respect to relicted lands within the meander line boundary, since such findings would affect only the title to upland owners not parties to the suit.\n\n\n (5)\n That the grants made by the United States to patentees of lands bordering upon the meander line boundary were comparable to those involved in Hardin v. Jordan, supra.\n The state of Oregon has excepted to findings 1 and 2, and to the master's failure to find that there were no relicted lands within the meander line boundary, and the United States has excepted to findings 3 and 5; its exceptions being intended to confine the decision to the issues between the United States and the state of Oregon and to eliminate consideration of questions affecting the rights of the upland patentee proprietors and settlers who are not parties to the suit.\n In the view we take of the issues which are decisive of the present controversy between the United States and Oregon, it is unnecessary to determine the rights in the disputed area of the owners, other than Oregon, of uplands bordering on the meander line boundary, whether their claims are based upon reliction or the acquisition of an interest as an incident to the grants by the United States of uplands bordering the meander line. Nor is it necessary to determine whether any part of the meander line is correct upon which the lands of such upland owners border. As they are not parties, their rights cannot be affected by any decree to be entered in the present suit. Priest v. Board of Trustees of Town of Las Vegas, \n232 \nU.S. 604\n, 34 S.Ct. 443. Adjudication of their rights, as will be later pointed out, is not prerequisite to maintenance of the present suit or to entry of an appropriate decree. \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 13]\n\u00a0\n It is also unnecessary to consider in detail the state's exceptions to the findings that there are stable lands within the disputed area. Even if such lands are not fast lands, because, as the state maintains, the mean surface water elevation is higher than 4,093 feet, as found by the master, the claim of the United States that it has title to them will be controlled by our conclusions as to its title to lands within the meander line in which the master has found the state to have no title or interest.\n Neither the government nor the state challenges the findings of the master that Oregon has title to a part of the land lying within the meander line of Mud Lake, and to the land within the meander line boundary of Subdivision B of the Narrows. We accordingly accept those findings as correct. We have already resolved against the state the contentions that it has acquired and retains any right or interest, in the land lying within the meander line of any of the other divisions, as an incident to ownership of the uplands bordering on the meander line.\n Such being the state of the case, the contentions of the state are reduced to three, which are those mainly relied upon in brief and argument. They are: (I) that the waters lying within the meander line boundary were and are navigable in fact. If not, it is then urged that the government is impaled on one of the two horns of a dilemma; either (II) under the doctrine of Hardin v. Jordan, supra, title to the land underlying the water passed to the upland proprietors by virtue of the grants by the United States of uplands bordering on the meander line, in which case the United States, which must maintain its suit to quiet title by the strength of its own title rather than by the weakness of the defendant's, is not entitled to the relief which it seeks; or (III) the United States, by its conveyance of the uplands, has transferred to Oregon its title to adjacent lands within the meander line, by operation of the common and statute \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 14]\n\u00a0\n law of the state, to which all conveyances of land within the state are subject.\n We therefore pass directly to a consideration of these principal issues of the case.\n I. Navigability.\n Dominion over navigable waters and property in the soil under them are so identified with the sovereign power of government that a presumption against their separation from sovereignty must be indulged, in construing either grants by the sovereign of the lands to be held in private ownership or transfer of sovereignty itself. See Com. of Massachusetts v. State of New York, \n271 \nU.S. 65, 89\n, 46 S.Ct. 357. For that reason, upon the admission of a state to the Union, the title of the United States to lands underlying navigable waters within the state passes to it, as incident to the transfer to the state of local sovereignty, and is subject only to the paramount power of the United States to control such waters for purposes of navigation in interstate and foreign commerce. But if the waters are not navigable in fact, the title of the United States to land underlying them remains unaffected by the creation of the new state. See United States v. State of Utah, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 64, 75\n, 51 S.Ct. 438; State of Oklahoma v. Texas, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 583\n, 591 S., 42 S.Ct. 406. Since the effect upon the title to such lands is the result of federal action in admitting a state to the Union, the question, whether the waters within the state under which the lands lie are navigable or nonnavigable, is a federal, not a local, one. It is, therefore, to be determined according to the law and usages recognized and applied in the federal courts, even though, as in the present case, the waters are not capable of use for navigation in interstate or foreign commerce. United States v. Holt State Bank, \n270 \nU.S. 49, 55\n, 56 S., 46 S.Ct. 197; United States v. State of Utah, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 64, 75\n, 51 S.Ct. 438; Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 87\n, 43 S.Ct. 60. \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 15]\n\u00a0\n The special master based his conclusion that the waters within the meander line boundary were not navigable in fact on the date of the admission of Oregon to the Union, or afterward, on his finding of fact that: 'Neither trade nor travel did then or at any time since has or could or can move over said Divisions, or any of them, in their natural or ordinary conditions according to the customary modes of trade or travel over water; nor was any of them on February 14, 1859, nor has any of them since been used or susceptible of being used in the natural or ordinary condition of any of them as permanent or other highways or channels for useful or other commerce.'\n It is not denied that this finding embodies the appropriate tests of navigability as laid down by the decisions of this Court. See United States v. Holt State Bank, supra, \n270 \nU.S. 49, 56\n, 46 S.Ct. 197; United States v. State of Utah, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 64, 76\n, 51 S.Ct. 438; Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, supra, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 86\n, 43 S.Ct. 60; State of Oklahoma v. Texas, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 586\n, 42 S.Ct. 406; Economy Light & Power Co. v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 113, 123\n, 41 S.Ct. 409; United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., \n174 \nU.S. 690, 698\n, 19 S.Ct. 770; The Daniel Ball, 10 Wall. 557, 563. The only attack upon it is that it is not adequately supported by the evidence.\n The finding, as the master's report shows in detail, is rested upon his observations, made in the course of a personal inspection of the disputed area, and a careful consideration of the voluminous testimony of 143 witnesses. He made subsidiary findings with respect to (1) the physical condition, present and past, of the several bodies of water with respect to their depth, their channels or waterways capable of use in navigation, and the presence within them of vegetation, all of which affect their use and the access to them for purposes of navigation, and (2) their actual use, past and present, with special reference to (a) trapping of fur-bearing animals and (b) boating. \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 16]\n\u00a0\n Physical Condition. The special master inspected Lake Malheur Reservation on or about November 1, 1931, accompanied by counsel and engineers representing the parties. He found that the entire area was then dry, and showed no signs in the soil of ever having been under water, except that water one to two inches in depth was found in Harney Lake, and about 400 acres in Lake Malheur was covered by water of negligible depth, and was surrounded by about 1,000 acres of mud. This 1,400 acre area lay in the more southerly part of the lake. The surface elevation above sea level of the 1,400 acres varied from 4,090 to 4,092 feet, which was below the average elevation of the meander line, fixed in the findings at 4,093 feet.\n These data as to the condition of the area then, which are not directly challenged and are abundantly supported by the testimony, indicate clearly enough that all five divisions are shallow bodies of water which, with the exception of Lake Malheur, disappear completely or become negligible during a dry season. The five divisions are shown to lie in a flat plateau and their basins or beds to be so shallow and unprotected by banks that variations in the amount of water flowing into them produce large variations in the area covered by water, but relatively slight variations in depth. The entire area is shown to be an 'evaporation pan' for the Harney county water basin, with an average annual evaporation of forty inches. The master found that, except in years of abundant rainfall and favorable runoff, the water is not available to maintain an average water surface elevation of much above 4,093 feet.\n Contour maps of Lake Malheur, where conditions admittedly are the most favorable for navigation, show that nearly half its area, with water surface standing at 4,093 feet, would be covered with water two feet or less in depth, and less than one-fourth of its area with water \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 17]\n\u00a0\n between three and four feet in depth. \n2\n The areas which would be covered by water of depth sufficient to float boats are shown not to be continuous enough to afford channels or waterways capable of use in navigation. At a surface elevation of 4,093 feet the water is so shallow for long distances from the meander line as to preclude passage over it by boats and with the water reduced to lower levels by seasonal evaporation the same area becomes mud or dry land. With a reduction of only one foot in water surface elevation, approximately 11,716 acres, otherwise covered by water, becomes mud or dry land, and other marked changes in the distribution of depths are produced. With the reduction in water surface attending the usual dry season of the summer, much of the area is made up of small lakes or ponds, separated by mud or dry land.\n There has been no survey of Harney Lake, but contour maps of the other divisions show similar conditions, though less favorable to navigability. The evidence establishes that Harney Lake is even more shallow and is without banks on its westerly end. Its waters are alkaline, and almost without vegetation. Its water area at the time of trial was approximately 2,000 acres, having a depth of from one to two inches. The depths have been \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 18]\n\u00a0\n variable, but the lake has not been shown at any time to have had a depth exceeding three feet. The evidence establishes that it has no stable or constant stand of water, and that large variations in the water area occur with seasonal and climatic changes.\n All the other divisions are shown to be covered in substantial measure by tules, which ordinarily grow only in depths of five feet or less, and to be filled in the shallower portions with growths of vegetation of a character and extent such as to make navigation difficult, even though there were channels or waterways otherwise capable of use for that purpose. The presence of dead sagebrush and greasewood in all three lakes, in considerable areas generally covered by water, indicates that the land has been dry for substantial periods.\n Scientific and historical evidence in great volume support the conclusion that the physical condition of the bodies of water within the area has not varied substantially, so as to affect the possibility of their use in navigation, since the admission or Oregon to the Union. This is established by early maps and reports; a study of tree rings, indicating past climatic conditions, particularly the amount of annual rainfall; and the presence in all divisions, except Harney Lake, of underlying beds of peat varying from twelve to thirty inches in depth and tending to establish shallow water conditions, and the presence of vegetation, over a long period. The conclusion must be that at the time of admission to statehood the bodies of water within the meander line were shallow, with average surface water not much above 4,093 feet, with the water of all except Harney Lake substantially filled with tules and other types of water vegetation, so as to give them largely the character of swamps, with irregularly located but connected areas of shallow open water of variable depths. \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 19]\n\u00a0\n The conclusion of the special master, that only under exceptional conditions does the water surface rise above 4,093 feet, is challenged by the state. The finding is based in part upon an elaborate study and report of water conditions in the Harney county water basin, prepared by Jessup, a government engineer, showing that 'in order to maintain a mean average elevation of this lake surface (Lake Malheur) much above 4,093 feet would require more water than has ever been available.' In support of Oregon's exception to the master's finding, it relies upon two independent private surveys, the results of which did not differ materially from those tendered by the government, and the evidence of numerous witnesses who testified that at one time or another during the past 45 years they had seen the water at points which, if their estimates and recollections are correct, would establish a water surface elevation above 4,093 feet. Their testimony, aside from its often vague and untrustworthy character because based on estimates and unaided recollections over long periods of time, as well as that of the surveys referred to, tended at most to show that in exceptional conditions of flood the water surface rose somewhat above the elevation of the meander line. There is abundant scientific evidence, and the testimony of contemporary observers, that for considerable parts of each year, and except in unusual conditions of flood, the water falls substantially below that elevation. There is no convincing evidence that the special master erred in his conclusion that the mean water surface elevation is not much above that point.\n The master also found against the contention of Oregon, set up by its amended answer, that the water surface elevation had been materially lessened by diversion of water from the Silvies and Conner und Blitzen rivers, for purposes of irrigation. The record affords no sub- \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 20]\n\u00a0\n stantial support for this contention. The voluminous scientific evidence must be accepted as establishing that any diversion, which could reasonably be assumed to take place by reason of irrigation, is too small in comparison with the area affected to produce any variation in depth of water sufficient to affect navigability. At a surface elevation of 4,092 feet the three lakes are connected and the flow of water required to raise water surface an additional foot, when allowance is made for increased evaporation, would considerably exceed any estimated amount of water artificially diverted.\n Nor does the evidence support the contention of Oregon that the navigability of Lake Malheur and Mud Lake is affected by the breaking of a channel through the Sand Reef, and the resulting connection with Harney Lake, which is said materially to have lowered the surface of the waters in the two upper lakes. The special master found that the gap, about 45 feet wide, which was broken through the top of Sand Reef by flood water in 1881, has had no such effect. In this he is supported by the scientific evidence based upon the contour maps of the region, and the annual inflow of water into Lake Malheur, and the outflow through the Sand Reef to Harney Lake. There is no outflow in some years. The evidence shows that with the Sand Reef closed the depth of water in Malheur and Mud Lakes would be increased by only a few tenths of a foot.\n Trapping. The state places much reliance on the large amount of testimony relating to the trapping of fur-bearing animals, principally muskrats, in the contested area. The evidence shows that, at times subsequent to 1890, a large number of animals were trapped in the tule areas, some in fall and spring, but principally in the winter months. Most of this evidence has no bearing on navigability, for, with a few exceptions, the trappers appear \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 21]\n\u00a0\n to have waded or walked. See Toledo Liberal Shooting Co. v. Erie Shooting Club, 90 F. 680, 682 (C.C.A.6th). Before 1908 only three trappers are shown to have used boats. Later, one trapper is shown to have used a rowboat and another to have used both a rowboat and a motorboat. Of the four witnesses who had used boats in connection with trapping, three referred to use of homemade boats of three or four to six inches draft, one in the fall of 1883 and following years, another in 1894-1895, and another subsequent to 1909. All wore gummed boots and found it necessary, in the use of the boats, to get out and pull them over shallow points in the lake where the depths were from one to four inches. Another, who used a boat in which he had installed a small motor, stated that the propeller sometimes struck bottom, when it would be necessary to pole the boat off, and that it was often stalled by the tangling of the 'weedless' propeller in the vegetation of the lake.\n Boating. The special master found that the boating which took place in the area involved had no commercial aspects and was of such a character as to be no indication of navigability; that it was only such as might reasonably be expected to occur in a swampy area of the character and magnitude described. The issue of navigability was chiefly concerned with Lake Malheur, but the findings were made with respect to the entire area.\n Numerous witnesses who had lived in the vicinity for many years had never used a boat and had never, or rarely, seen one on the lake. Most of the evidence of boating related to the use of boats by trappers, to which reference has already been made, any by duck hunters in the spring and fall of the year. The boats were all of light draft, those most in use being canvas canoes or homemade rowboats, drawing between one and six inches of water. The record is replete with evidence showing \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 22]\n\u00a0\n that many difficulties were customarily encountered in the use of boats. It was usual to drag them many yards, sometimes several hundred, from the fast land before they would float. Once embarked they encountered tules, often six feet or more in height, and much other water vegetation, impenetrable at many points, but through which there was a labyrinth of channels leading to no definite or certain destination. Hunters, in many instances, found it necessary to flag or otherwise mark the course in order to insure a convenient and safe route for return. The boats were often propelled by poling them through the tules and over the shallow places, or by getting out and pulling them.\n Only four motorboats appear ever to have been used, and then only to a very limited extent, when conditions were favorable, in the more open water in the southeasterly part of Lake Malheur. This could ordinarily be reached by motorboat only by passing through a considerable distance of relatively shallow water in the region of the Blitzen river. One operator of a motorboat was often marooned by shallow water and took with him a small canoe as a means of proceeding when the motorboat was grounded. He had never found the boat useful because of the weeds and the shallowness of the water. The others had the same difficulties. Two stated that they could only use the boats during high water in spring and early summer. One of them, the reserve protector, a resident since 1909, had patrolled Lake Malheur in his boat in high water, but the greater portion of his patrolling was not by boat. The fourth person who had used a motorboat had often found it necessary to get out and pull the boat over shoals in one to four inches of water.\n The evidence of any use of boats in the other divisions was much more meager and still less indicative of the possibility of navigation. There is a single instance of bringing a small quantity of hay by rowboat from one \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 23]\n\u00a0\n of the small islands in Lake Malheur, but there is no other evidence of transportation of any commodity, beyond that already indicated.\n The evidence, taken as a whole, clearly establishes the flat topography of the disputed area, the shallow water without defined banks, ice bound from three to four months of the year, the separation of areas covered by water of sufficient depth to float boats, the presence of tules and other forms of water vegetation, a dry season every year, and frequent dry years during which Mud and Harney Lakes are almost entirely without water, and Lake Malheur is reduced to a relatively few acres of disconnected ponds surrounded by mud. These conditions preclude the use for navigation of the area in question, in its natural and ordinary condition, according to the customary modes of trade or travel over water, and establish an absence of that capacity for general and common usefulness for purposes of trade and commerce which is essential to navigability. See United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., supra, \n174 \nU.S. 690, 698\n, 19 S.Ct. 770. At most, the evidence shows such an occasional use of boats, sporadic and ineffective, as has been observed on lakes, streams, or ponds large enough to float a boat, but which nevertheless were held to lack navigable capacity. See United States v. Rio Grande Dam & Irrigation Co., supra, \n174 \nU.S. 690, 699\n, 19 S. Ct. 770; The Montello, 20 Wall. 430, 442; Leovy v. United States, \n177 \nU.S. 621, 627\n, 633 S., 20 S.Ct. 797; North American Dredging Co. v. Mintzer, 245 F. 297 (C.C.A.9th); Toledo Liberal Shooting Co. v. Erie Shooting Club, supra, 90 F. 680, 682; Harrison v. Fite, 148 F. 781, 786 (C.C.A.8th).\n It is not without significance that the disputed area has been treated as nonnavigable both by the Secretary of the Interior and the Oregon courts. The Secretary, in Lake Malheur, 19 L.D. 439, December 3, 1894, described Lake Malheur as 'nonnavigable,' and in Lake Malheur, 16 L. D. 256, March 3, 1893, and in Pacific Live Stock Co. v. Armack, 30 L.D. 521, March 11, 1901, as 'little more than \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 24]\n\u00a0\n a swamp or marsh,' and again as a 'vast marsh or tule swamp with comparatively little open water.' The Oregon Supreme Court, in cases involving the correctness of the present or previous meander lines, has repeatedly recognized that Lake Malheur is nonnavigable. See French Glenn Live Stock Co. v. Springer, 35 Or. 312, 323, 58 P. 102 (1899); Id., \n185 \nU.S. 47, 53\n, 22 S.Ct. 563; Cawlfield v. Smyth, 69 Or. 41, 42, 138 P. 227 (1914); Bailey v. Malheur & H. L. Irrigation Co., 36 Or. 54, 55, 57 P. 910 (1899); In re Rights to Use of Waters of Silvies River, 115 Or. 27, 34, 237 P. 322 (1925).\n II. Right of the United States to Maintain the Suit.\n Oregon contends that the state has never adopted the rule of Hardin v. Jordan, supra, and that in any case the rule has never been applied by this Court and, further, is not applicable to lakes the size of Malheur and Harney. See Stewart v. Turney, 237 N.Y. 117, 123, 142 N.E. 437, 31 A.L. R. 960; Granger v. City of Canandaigua, 257 N.Y. 126, 130, 177 N.E. 394; Richardson v. Sims, 118 Miss. 728, 80 So. 4; Boardman v. Scott, 102 Ga. 404, 406-419, 30 S.E. 982, 51 L.R.A. 178. But if applied, and the upland proprietors whose grants are bounded by the meander line are held to take to the center of the lakes, then it is insisted that the United States, which must prevail upon the strength of its own title rather than the weakness of that of the state, cannot maintain the present suit to quiet title with respect to any part of the beds of the lakes thus shown to belong to the upland proprietors.\n A bill to quiet title may not be defeated by showing that the plaintiff's interest, otherwise sufficient to support the bill, is subject to possibly superior rights in third persons not parties to the suit. Van Wyck v. Knevals, \n106 \nU.S. 360, 368\n, 369 S., 1 S.Ct. 336; Lane v. Watts, \n234 \nU.S. 525, 541\n, 34 S.Ct. 965; Id., \n235 \nU.S. 17, 23\n, 35 S.Ct. 3; see, also, Gridley v. Wynant, 23 How. 500, 503; Clipper Mining Co. v. Eli Mining & Land Co., 194 \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 25]\n\u00a0\n U.S. 220, 223, 234, 24 S.Ct. 632. It is enough that the interest asserted by the plaintiff in possession of land is superior to that of those who are parties defendant. Before Oregon was admitted to statehood, the United States is shown to have acquired title which it has never in terms conveyed away. Its possession and claim of title have ever since continued. The Executive Order setting aside the area in question as a bird reservation was an assertion of title and possession. Following the order, as the master found, the United States, through representatives of the Department of Agriculture, particularly a resident protector or warden, has taken active control of all the lands within the meander line. In the exercise of that control it has excluded hunters, erected posts marking the limits of the reservation, posted notices advising all persons of the existence of the reservation and warning them to refrain from hunting on it. This possession of the United States, under color and claim of title, is not shown to have been disputed or interfered with. As it is sufficient to preclude any action at law in the nature of ejectment, it is an adequate basis for relief in equity to remove the cloud created by the assertion of any inferior title of the state. Wehrman v. Conklin, \n155 \nU.S. 314, 325\n, 15 S.Ct. 129; Allen v. Hanks, \n136 \nU.S. 300, 311\n, 10 S.Ct. 961; see Sharon v. Tucker, \n144 U.S. 533\n, 543-548, 12 S.Ct. 720; Lancaster v. Kathleen Oil Co., \n241 \nU.S. 551, 555\n, 36 S.Ct. 711. There is no course of legal procedure by which a title to land can be adjudicated as good against all the world. It is therefore unnecessary to determine whether the rule of Hardin v. Jordan, supra, applies to grants of upland fronting on Lake Malheur and Harney Lake, or what interests, if any, have been acquired in the disputed area by any of the upland owners, other than Oregon. The United States is entitled to relief so far as it is able to show that Oregon is without any right or title on the basis of which it would be entitled to disturb the possession of the United States. \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 26]\n\u00a0\n III. Oregon's Claim of Title to the Lake Beds in Consequence of Grants of Uplands by the United States.\n This claim is based upon the assumption, which for present purposes we also make, that the rule of Hardin v. Jordan, supra, does not obtain in Oregon, and that accordingly the ownership of upland proprietors does not extend within the meander line boundary, and also upon the statute of Oregon effective February 25, 1921 (chapter 280, p. 521, Laws of 1921). This legislation (section 1) declares that lakes within the state which have been meandered by United States surveys are navigable public waters of the state, and that 'the title to the bed and land thereunder, including the shore or space between ordinary high and low water marks' not previously granted by the state 'is hereby declared to be in the state of Oregon, and the state of Oregon hereby asserts and declares its sovereignty over the same and its ownership thereof.' The contention is that, upon grant of the uplands by the United States, whether to the state or others, title to the adjacent lake beds vested in the state by operation of the statute.\n It is insisted that after statehood local law controls the disposition of the title to lands retained by the United States underlying nonnavigable waters within the state, and that the effect, upon the title to such lands, of the conveyances of the adjacent upland by the United States is to be determined by reference to state laws. In support of this proposition, reliance is placed upon language in the opinion in Hardin v.

Texas, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 594\n, 595 S., 42 S.Ct. 406, 414, that the disposition of such lands is a matter of the intention of the grantor, the United States, and, 'if its intention be not otherwise shown, it will be taken to have assented that its conveyance should be construed and given effect in this particular according to the law of the state in which the land lies.' This was the effect of the decisions in Hardin v. Jordan, supra, Mitchell v. Smale, \n140 \nU.S. 406\n, 11 S.Ct. 819, and Kean v. Calumet Canal & Imp. Co., \n190 \nU.S. 452\n, 23 S.Ct. 651, in which conveyances bounded upon the waters of a nonnavigable lake were, when construed in accordance with local law, held impliedly to convey to the middle of the lake.\n The rule that title to lands underlying navigable waters presumptively passes to the state upon admission to the Union has already been noted. Com. of Massachusetts v. State of New York, supra, \n271 \nU.S. 65, 89\n, 46 S.Ct. 357; see Scott v. Lattig, supra, \n227 \nU.S. 229, 242\n, 243 S., 33 S.Ct. 242, 44 L.R.A.(N.S.) 107. But in no case has this Court held that a state could deprive the United States of its title to land under nonnavigable waters without its consent, or that a grant of uplands to private individuals, which does not in terms or by implication include the adjacent land under water, nevertheless operates to pass it to the state. Whether, on any theory, such a result could be upheld was a question expressly reserved in Hardin v. Shedd, \n190 \nU.S. 508, 519\n, 23 S.Ct. 685; Whitaker v. McBride, \n179 \nU.S. 510, 515\n, 25 S.Ct. 530; Marshall Dental Mfg. Co. v. Iowa, \n226 \nU.S. 460, 462\n, 33 S.Ct. 168. In none of these cases were the parties necessary for the determination of that question before the Court.\n The laws of the United States alone control the disposition of title to its lands. The states are powerless to place \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 28]\n\u00a0\n any limitation or restriction on that control. Wilcox v. Jackson, 13 Pet. 498, 516, 517; Gibson v. Chouteau, 13 Wall. 92, 99; see Brewer-Elliott Oil & Gas Co. v. United States, supra, \n260 \nU.S. 77, 88\n, 43 S.Ct. 60; United States v. State of Utah, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 64, 75\n, 51 S.Ct. 438. The construction of grants by the United States is a federal not a state question, Packer v. Bird, \n137 \nU.S. 661, 669\n, 670 S., 11 S.Ct. 210; French-Glenn Live Stock Co. v. Springer, \n185 \nU.S. 47, 54\n, 22 S.Ct. 563; Chapman & Dewey Lumber Co. v. St. Francis Levee District, \n232 \nU.S. 186, 196\n, 34 S.Ct. 297, and involves the consideration of state questions only in so far as it may be determined as a matter of federal law that the United States has impliedly adopted and assented to a state rule of construction as applicable to its conveyances. See State of Oklahoma v. Texas, supra, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 594\n, 595 S., 42 S.Ct. 406; Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 404\n, 37 S.Ct. 387. In construing a conveyance by the United States of land within a state, the settled and reasonable rule of construction of the state affords an obvious guide in determining what impliedly passes to the grantee as an incident to land expressly granted. But no such question is presented here, for there is no basis for implying any intention to convey title to the state.\n The state, in making its present contention, does not claim as a grantee designated or named in any grant of the United States. It points to no rule ever recognized or declared by the courts of the state that a grant to individual upland proprietors impliedly grants to the state the adjacent land under water. \n3\n The only support for its claim is the statute of 1921, adopted subsequent to \n\n[295 U.S. 1, 29]\n\u00a0\n every grant of the United States involved in the present case. The case is not one of the reasonable construction of grants of the United States, but the attempted forfeiture to the state by legislative fiat of lands which, so far as they have not passed to the individual upland proprietors, remain the property of the United States. Such action by the state can no more affect the title of the United States than can the similar legislative pronouncements that streams within a state are navigable which this court has found to be nonnavigable. See State of Oklahoma v. Texas, supra; United States v. State of Utah, supra, \n283 \nU.S. 64, 75\n, 51 S.Ct. 438; United States v.

Knowlton, of Washington, D.C., for the United States and the Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. Harold N. McLaughlin, of Cleveland, Ohio, for appellants Johnston and others.\n Messrs. Jacob Aronson, of New York City, and Nye F. Morehouse, of Chicago, Ill., for appellees.\n\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a direct appeal from the decree of the federal court for Northern Ohio, setting aside an order, under the Boiler Inspection Act, entered by the Interstate Commerce Commission on January 5, 1933\n\n\n At the date of the order there were in use in the United States about 31,597 steam locomotives equipped with hand reverse gear and 28,925 equipped with power reverse gear. \n1\n Prior to the order, Rule 157, which prescribes the \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 456]\n\u00a0\n reverse gear on locomotives, left it optional with railroads to equip them with either hand operated or power operated reverse gear. \n2\n The order amended that rule so as to require the railroads to equip 'with a suitable type of power operated reverse gear' all steam locomotives built on or after April 1, 1933; and similarly to equip, 'the first time they are given repairs defined by the United States Railroad Administration as Class 3, or heavier,' all steam locomotives then in road service 'which weigh on driving wheels 150,000 pounds or more,' and all then used in switching service 'which weigh on driving wheels 130,000 pounds or more.' The order required that, in any event, all such steam locomotives be so equipped before January 1, 1937; and that 'air operated reverse gear ( including thus power gear already installed) shall have a suitable steam connection' so arranged 'that in case of air failure steam may be quickly used to operate the re- \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 457]\n\u00a0\n verse gear.' A. Johnston v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 190 I.C.C. 351.\n The order of the Commission was entered on a complaint of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen. The complaint alleged, in substance, that, while power reverse gear is a suitable, safe, and practical device, manually operated reverse gear is inherently unsafe and unsuitable in principle and design, that it subjects employees and the traveling public to unnecessary peril, and that the use of locomotives equipped with hand reverse gears violates the Boiler Inspection Act. The complaint prayed that the Commission prescribe rules requiring that all steam locomotives be equipped 'with power reverse gear, or other devices adequate to protect the employees upon said locomotives from unnecessary peril to life or limb, as provided in section 2' of the act.\n Practically all the railroads of the United States were made respondents. They challenged in their answers the jurisdiction of the Commission on the grounds that the procedure was unauthorized and that a power reverse gear was not a safety device or appliance within the meaning of section 2 of the Boiler Inspection Act, as amended (45 USCA  23); denied the essential allegations of the complaint; and, as additional reason for refusing its prayer, set up the impaired financial condition of the carriers. These issues were referred for hearing to an examiner. Fifty- five days were devoted to the taking of testimony. The witnesses numbered 337. Their testimony covered 6,491 pages. There were introduced, in addition, 109 exhibits, many of them voluminous. The proposed report of the examiner occupies 40 pages of the printed record in this Court, and the railroads' exceptions to it 60 pages. The exceptions were heard by a Division of the Commission consisting of three \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 458]\n\u00a0\n members; and reargument before the whole Commission was denied.\n This suit to set aside the order was brought by Baltimore & Ohio Railroad and other carriers, suing on behalf of themselves and substantially all the other railroads. The original defendant was the United States. The Commission, Grand Chief Johnson of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and President Robertson of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen are defendants by intervention. The case was heard by the District Court, three judges sitting, on a transcript of the record before the Commission. The railroads again contended that the Commission lacked authority to entertain the complaint. They insisted also that the order was void for lack of essential findings of fact. These objections were overruled. But the court, citing among others, the Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258\n, 44 S.Ct. 317, and United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry. Co., \n265 \nU.S. 274\n, 44 S.Ct. 565, set the order aside, on the ground that the Commission had acted arbitrarily, in failing to give consideration and legal effect to pertinent uncontradicted facts having a controlling bearing upon the issues, and in disregarding undisputed evidence. (D.C.) 5 F.Supp. 929. An appeal to this Court by all the defendants was allowed. The appellants contended that the action of the District Court constituted substitution of its judgment for that of the Commission. The argument here was devoted, in large part, to the consideration of the findings of the lower court charging disregard by the Commission of the evidence before it. For reasons which will be stated later, we have no occasion to enter upon that inquiry.\n First. The Commission clearly has authority, in an appropriate proceeding, to forbid the use of a locomotive equipped with a manually operated reverse gear if, by reason thereof, the engine is rendered unsafe or subjects employees of the railroad or others to 'unnecessary peril \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 459]\n\u00a0\n to life or limb.' The substitution of power operated reverse gear for manually operated reverse gear might conceivably be found necessary to promote safety, even if it did so only indirectly by preventing the impairment of the health of engineers through excessive exertion or fatigue. To require the installation of power operated reverse gear is, in its nature, within the scope of the authority delegated to the Commission. For 'the power delegated to the Commission by the Boiler Inspection Act as amended is a general one. \n3\n It extends to the design, the construction, and the material of every part of the locomotive and tender and of all appurtenances.' Napier v. Atlantic Coast Line, \n272 \nU.S. 605, 611\n, 47 S.Ct. 207, 209.\n Second. The railroads contend that, in the proceeding under review, the Commission lacks authority to make any change of the existing rule concerning reverse gears; that authority to initiate changes in existing rules was denied to it; that the rules governing boilers and their appurtenances approved June 2, 1911, and the additional ones governing locomotives, tenders, and appurtenances, approved October 11, 1915, cannot be changed except upon application of the carriers or with their consent. The argument is that the Boiler Inspection Act is an independent and complete piece of legislation, and thus the Commission is denied in respect to locomotives those general powers which it exercises in other connections; that by the original act of 1911 the right to initiate rules was by section 5 (45 USCA  28) conferred not upon the Commission, but upon the several railroads and, only to the extent that one or more of the carriers failed to act within three months, upon the chief inspector; that the Commission's power of requiring modifications was limited to the rules originally filed; that, in respect to subsequent changes therein, \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 460]\n\u00a0\n its sole function is that of approval or disapproval of the carriers' proposals; and that the Commission's only other authority in respect to locomotives is that, conferred by section 6 (45 USCA  29), of reviewing the action of the chief inspector in declaring individual locomotives unfit for service.\n To hold that the authority of the Commission is thus limited would defeat, in large measure, the purpose of the legislation, and would be inconsistent with long-established practice. Congress imposed the strictly administrative duties, in the main, upon the chief inspector. But it specifically directed, in section 6, that the 'first duty (of the district inspectors) shall be to see that the carriers make inspections in accordance with the rules and regulations established or approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission.' Upon the Commission, were conferred, besides some strictly administrative powers, both quasi legislative and quasi judicial functions. The latter it was authorized to exercise only in the appellate capacity of reviewing, under section 6, orders of the chief inspector declaring an individual locomotive unserviceable. Its legislative power was to be exercised in the making of rules. Section 5 of the original act (36 Stat. 914) provided that 'each carrier subject to this Act shall file its rules and instructions for the inspection of locomotive boilers with the chief inspector within three months after the approval of this Act, and after hearing and approval by the Interstate Commerce Commission, such rules and instructions, with such modifications as the commission requires, shall become obligatory upon such carrier.' When this act was passed, in 1911, there were doubtless already in force on each railroad some rules established by the carrier. And likewise, in 1915 and in 1924, when the scope of the act was extended, there were doubtless in force on each railroad rules established by the carrier governing parts, appurtenances, or engines, not falling within the field covered by the previously existing legislation. Naturally those carrier \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 461]\n\u00a0\n rules would be the starting point in the Commission's rule making; and naturally it would be much influenced, as well as instructed, by the chief inspector's proposals or recommendations. But the responsibility for rules adequate to insure safety was imposed by Congress upon the Commission; and, to discharge that duty, it was essential that the Commission also should possess the initiative in rule making. To this end, it was granted the power, not only of disapproving proposed rules, but also of requiring modifications of those in force. The power so conferred may obviously be exercised, as was done here, on complaint of the brotherhoods representing employees directly affected.\n In the Napier Case, the question directly before the Court was not the authority of the Commission to initiate rules. It was the validity of state laws and rules prescribing specific safety devices on locomotives. But the objection now raised by the railroads was discussed by counsel and was considered by the Court. The validity of the state laws and regulations was challenged on the ground that the Boiler Inspection Act had occupied the field; and, as the question whether it had done so was one of statutory construction, the provisions of the act were necessarily examined. The conclusion that the Commission possesses the authority to make rules on its own initiative, or upon complaint, was the basis of the decision there made. See pages 611-613, of 272 U.S., 47 S.Ct. 207, 209. Referring to the argument of the states 'that the authority delegated to the Commission does not extend to ordering the use or installation of equipment of any kind, Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521\n, 45 S.Ct. 169,' we said: 'The duty of the Commission is not merely to inspect. It is also to prescribe the rules and regulations by which fitness for service shall be determined. Unless these rules and regulations are complied with, the engine is not 'in proper condition' for operation. Thus the Commission \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 462]\n\u00a0\n sets the standard. By setting the standard it imposes requirements. The power to require specific devices was exercised before the amendment of 1915, and has been extensively exercised since.' In closing the opinion, we added: 'If the protection now afforded by the Commission's rules is deemed inadequate, application for relief must be made to it. The Commission's power is ample.'\n In the Napier Case this Court listed in the margin 18 rules which had, before 1925, been amended by order of the Commission. \n4\n Acting upon the suggestion there made by this Court, the state authorities and the Brotherhoods applied to the Commission for relief in proceedings similar to those here under review, and rules were prescribed by it. All the railroads either conceded its authority to do so or acquiesced in its final orders. Cab Curtain Case, 142 I.C.C. 199, 201; Fire Door Case, 151 I. C.C. 448, 450. Compare Rules for Testing Other than Steam Power Locomotives, 122 I.C.C. 414; Staten Island Rapid Transit Ry. Co. v. Public Service Commission (D.C.) 16 F.(2d) 313.\n Third. The railroads contend that to support the order certain basic findings are essential, that these were not made, and that hence the order is void. This contention is in our opinion sound. The act does not confer upon the Commission legislative authority to require the adoption on locomotives of such devices as, in its discretion, it may from time to time deem desirable. The operation of an engine, however equipped, involves some 'danger to life or limb.' At common law the carriers were 'free to determine how their boilers should be kept \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 463]\n\u00a0\n in proper condition for use without unnecessary danger.' Baltimore & Ohio R.R. Co. v. Groeger, \n266 \nU.S. 521, 529\n, 45 S.Ct. 169, 172. And the act conferred authority to prescribe by rule specific devices, or changes in the equipment, only where there are required to remove 'unnecessary peril to life or limb.' The power to make the determination whether the proposed device or change is so required, vests in the Commission. But its finding to that effect is essential to the existence of authority to promulgate the rule; and, as Congress has made affirmative orders of the Commission subject to judicial review, Chicago Junction Case, \n264 U.S. 258\n, 263-265, 44 S.Ct. 317,5 the order may be set aside unless it appears that the basic finding was made. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194\n, 51 S.Ct. 119, 125.\n The primary question of fact presented for determination was, as the report of the Commission states, 'whether the use of locomotives equipped with hand reverse gear, as compared with power reverse gear, causes unnecessary peril to life or limb.' The report discusses at some length the alleged advantages and disadvantages of the two classes of reverse gear and the expense which the proposed change would entail, and concludes with 'findings' that to a certain extent the change should be made. \n6\n But whether the use of any or all types of \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 464]\n\u00a0\n steam locomotives 'equipped with hand reverse gear as compared with power reverse gear causes unnecessary peril to life or limb' is left entirely to inference. This complete absence of 'the basic or essential findings required to support the Commission's order' renders it void. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n, 51 S.Ct. 119. Compare Wichita Railroad & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Comm., \n260 \nU.S. 48, 58\n, 59 S., 43 S.Ct. 51; Mahler v. Eby, \n264 \nU.S. 32, 44\n, 45 S.,7 44 S. Ct. 283.\n In the Florida Case the legal distinction was pointed out between what may be termed quasi jurisdictional findings, there held to be indispensable, and the 'complete statement of the grounds of the Commission's determination' which was declared in Beaumont, Sour Lake & Western Ry. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74, 86\n, 51 S.Ct. 1, to be desirable for a proper consideration of the case in the courts. The lack of such a complete statement, while always regrettable, because unnecessarily increasing the labor of \n\n[293 U.S. 454, 465]\n\u00a0\n the reviewing court (compare Virginian Ry. v. United States, \n272 \nU.S. 658, 675\n, 47 S.Ct. 222), is not fatal to the validity of the order. It is true that formal and precise findings are not required, under section 14(1) of the Interstate Commerce Act (49 USCA  14(1), which declares that the report 'shall state the conclusions of the commission, together with its decision.' \n8\n Compare Manufacturers' Ry. Co. v. United States, \n246 \nU.S. 457, 487\n, 38 S.Ct. 383; Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R.R., \n236 \nU.S. 412, 428\n, 35 S.Ct. 328, Ann. Cas. 1916B, 691, P.U.R. 1915D, 1072. That provision relieves the Commission from making comprehensive findings of fact similar to those required by Equity Rule 70 1\/2 (28 USCA  723). But section 14(1) does not remove the necessity of making, where orders are subject to judicial review, quasi jurisdictional findings essential to their constitutional or statutory validity. \n9\n\u00a0\n\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] As described in the carriers' bill: 'The reversing gear, or 'reverse gear' as it is usually called, of a steam locomotive is the mechanism which controls the position and movement of the locomotive valve gear and valves which admit steam in the cylinders, and it is by means of this mechanism that the direction of movement of the locomotive is controlled, and the proper and economical use of steam is accomplished. Two general classes of reverse gears are in use, viz.: (1) Manually operated reverse gears which depend upon the use of muscular force of the engineer and the force exerted by the counter-balancing weights and springs, for their operation; and (2) power reverse gears which supplement the above mentioned forces with an auxiliary mechanism which, in normal operation, brings the force of compressed air into play, so that less muscular effort is normally required to be put forth by the engineer in using this type of gear. The engineer operates either class of gear by means of either a lever or handwheel (used with screw type of gear) located near his seat-box in the locomotive cab.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] Rule 157: 'Reversing Gear.-Reversing gear, reverse levers, and quadrants shall be maintained in a safe and suitable condition for service. Reverse lever latch shall be so arranged that it can be easily disengaged, and provided with a spring which will keep it firmly seated in quadrant. Proper counter balance shall be provided for the valve gear.' \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] February 17, 1911, c. 103,  2, 36 Stat. 913, amended March 4, 1915, c. 169,  1, 38 Stat. 1192, June 7, 1924, c. 355,  2, 43 Stat. 659 (45 USCA  23). \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] The railroads state that the Commission's orders disclose that 'a considerable number' of the changes were brought about as a result of conferences between the chief inspector and committees representing all the railroads, or upon requests of representatives of the carriers, which modifications were agreed to by the representatives of the employees interested and by the chief inspector. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Compare United States v. Atlanta, B. & C.R.

Upon complaint by competing \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 501]\n\u00a0\n railroads and producers in Illinois, the Interstate Commerce Commission suspended the proposed tariffs and afterwards annulled them. 197 I.C.C. 245; 200 I.C.C. 609. A District Court of three judges has perpetually enjoined the enforcement of the order of the commission, thereby reinstating the tariffs established by the carrier. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co. v. U.S., 8 F.Supp. 970. The case is here upon appeal. Judicial Code,  210, 28 U.S.C.  47a (28 USCA  47a).\n The rates in controversy affect the transportation of coal from groups of mines in Indiana known as the Brazil-Clinton and the Linton- Sullivan origin groups to Rockford and Freeport, Ill., and certain intermediate points. Up to the effective date of the new schedule the rate to Rockford and Freeport from the Brazil-Clinton group had been $1.87 per ton, and from the Linton-Sullivan group $1.92. The proposed change called for a reduction of 17 cents, with the result that the rates between the points mentioned became $1.70 and $1.75, respectively. Reductions ranging from 4 to 10 cents were proposed for other destinations nearer to the point of origin.\n In its transportation of bituminous coal the Milwaukee is in competition with lines in Illinois, Indiana, and Western Kentucky. We direct our attention first to the situation in Illinois, confining ourselves to facts that have been found by the commission. For many years there was a parity of rates between the Springfield group in Illinois and the Brazil-Clinton group in Indiana. There was also a customary differential for Illinois groups farther south than Springfield as well as for other groups in Western Kentucky. For example, the rate from Springfield to Rockford was 30 cents less than from mines in Southern Illinois. On August 20, 1930, these relations were broken by an order of the Illinois Commerce Commission reducing intrastate rates in Illinois 17 cents a ton. Rates from Springfield to Rockford which had been $1.87 became $1.70; those from Southern Illinois, previously $2.17, be \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 502]\n\u00a0\n came $2. Upon the publication of these reductions, Milwaukee complained of them to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and asked that they be canceled, 49 U.S.C.  13 (49 USCA  13). It insisted that the lower schedule would result in undue and unreasonable advantage to persons and localities in intrastate commerce and in undue and unreasonable discrimination against those in interstate commerce. The commission rendered its decision in March, 1932. It allowed the contested rates to stand in so far as the points of destination were Rockford and Freeport, though it found discrimination, and ordered an increase of 5 cents a ton, upon shipments to Chicago. Intrastate Rates on Bituminous Coal in Illinois, 182 I.C.C. 537. In respect of the Rockford-Freeport traffic, it held that the intrastate rates might reasonably be higher, but that the like was true of the rates to the same points from the groups in Indiana. Id., 182 I.C.C. 537, at page 549, 550: 'The principal competition of the Illinois producers at these destinations comes from Indiana, and we find no sufficient justification for requiring any of the Illinois rates to these points to be increased until the low rates from Indiana referred to have been placed upon a level more nearly commensurate with the general level of rates in this territory.' In brief, the ruling was that the Interstate Commerce Commission would keep its hands off until the rates of interstate competitors had been placed upon a sounder basis. It would not stabilize rates at the then prevailing levels when the rate structure as a whole was in need of readjustment and revision. A refusal to interfere with one of the terms of a proportion is very different from an approval of the proportion as a continuing condition. Restraints were not imposed upon the lines in Illinois, but equally they were not imposed upon those in Indiana. The decision was not a mandate to the carriers to preserve undisturbed an existing relation between rates; the decision was a refusal by the commission to compel an increase of the rates on \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 503]\n\u00a0\n one side of the relation. Those on the other side were subject to change at the instance of the carriers affected to the same extent as they had been before. The forces of competition were left to do their work.\n From the situation in Illinois we turn to that in Indiana and Kentucky. Again we confine ourselves to the report unless testimony is mentioned. Six carriers in addition to Milwaukee are in competition for the carriage of coal from groups in Indiana to points in Northern Illinois. These lines are the means of transportation for the product of the coal mines at Princeton and Booneville. They compete also to a slight extent for the carriage of coal from the Brazil and Linton groups, though the testimony is that their traffic from those points is only 1 per cent. or less, as compared with 99 per cent. belonging to Milwaukee. For all these Indiana routes, group rates have been maintained for many years as the outcome of agreement among the carriers concerned. Rates from Linton- Sullivan were 5 cents higher than from Brazil-Clinton, those from Princeton 7 cents higher than from Linton-Sullivan, and those from Booneville 10 cents higher than from Princeton. If Milwaukee is upheld in the reduction of its own schedule from Brazil and Linton northward, there is likely to be an attempt by other Indiana carriers to make proportionate reductions from points along their lines.\n The change of rates in Illinois had repercussions also upon tariffs in Kentucky. As far back as 1927, the commission fixed a differential of 35 cents in favor of the roads from the Western Kentucky mines as compared with those from the mines in Southern illinois. Illinois-Indiana Coal Cases, 128 I.C.C. 265; West Kentucky Coal Bureau v. Illinois Central R. Co ., 172 I.C.C. 279. Upon the lowering of intrastate rates for Illinois carriers, the Western Kentucky carriers restored the pre-existing relation between themselves and their Illinois competitors by reducing their own rates to the extent of the established differ- \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 504]\n\u00a0\n ential. The commission made an order approving the reduction.\n With these changes in the rates in Illinois and Kentucky, there remained only the rates from the groups in Indiana that were out of line with the proportion maintained for many years. To restore that proportion Milwaukee filed a new schedule whereby the rates from Brazil-Clinton to Rockford and Free-port were again placed at a parity with those from Springfield to the same places, the rates from Linton-Sullivan being correspondingly adjusted. This is the schedule that has been disapproved by the commission. Two reports were filed, one in November, 1933, the other in April, 1934. The first, which came from a division of the commission, was confirmed by the entire body upon denying a petition for rehearing. Suit for an injunction was promptly started by the carrier. Two days before the day appointed for the hearing, the commission of its own motion reopened the proceeding, and thereafter filed a second report, amplifying the first one. Following that report the suit was brought to trial upon supplemental pleadings. The carrier took the position (1) that the order of the commission was not supported by the finding; and (2) that irrespective of the findings it was not supported by the evidence. The District Court gave a decree for the complainant upon the second ground, without passing upon the first. Upon appeal to this court by the commission and by intervening railroads, the appellees (the Milwaukee and intervening coal producers) renew the grounds of challenge put forward at the trial.\n This court has held that an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission is void unless supported by findings of the basic or quasi jurisdictional facts conditioning its power. Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n, 51 S.Ct. 119, 125; United States v. Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. (January 7, 1935) \n293 \nU.S. 454\n, 55 S.Ct. 268. \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 505]\n\u00a0\n 'In the absence of such findings, we are not called upon to examine the evidence in order to resolve opposing contentions as to what it shows or to spell out and state such conclusions of fact as it may permit.' Florida v. United States, supra. Orderly review requires that this objection being basic and jurisdictional be disposed of at the beginning.\n The jurisdiction of the commission to cancel the proposed schedule was invoked by the protesting carriers and producers under two sections of the statute, subdivisions 1 and 7 of section 15 and subdivision 2 of section 15a (49 USCA  15(1, 7), 15a(2). Section 15 (subdivisions 1 and 7) is to the effect that the commission shall have power to determine the just and reasonable rate when a rate in force or proposed is found to be unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or otherwise unlawful. Section 15a(2) is to the effect that in the exercise of this power to establish just and reasonable rates the commission shall give due consideration, among other factors, 'to the need, in the public interest, of adequate and efficient railway transportation service at the lowest cost consistent with the furnishing of such service; and to the need of revenues sufficient to enable the carriers, under honest, economical, and efficient management, to provide such service.'\n The second report of the commission is a long and discursive narrative. Two paragraphs at the end give the key to its meaning:\n'We find that the proposed rates if permitted to become effective would lead to a disruption of the rate structure on coal in the Indiana and related areas, thus impairing the revenue of the carriers serving those areas and their ability to provide the adequate and efficient transportation service contemplated by section 15a of the act; that they would cause a disruption of the individual groups from which the rates are proposed; and that they would \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 506]\n\u00a0\n cause a disruption of the long-standing rate relation existing for competitive purposes, between the several Indiana groups.\n\n'We find that the proposed rates would be unreasonable and in violation of sections 1(5) (which denounces unreasonable charges) and 15a( 2) of the act (49 USCA  1(5), 15a(2)) (which has been summarized above).'\n\n The statement in the second of these paragraphs that the proposed rates would be 'unreasonable' must be read in the light of the report as a whole, and then apprears as a conclusion insufficient as a finding unless supported by facts more particularly stated. Cf. Florida v. United States, supra, \n282 U.S. 194\n, at page 213, 51 S.Ct. 119; Southern Pacific Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n219 \nU.S. 433, 449\n, 31 S.Ct. 288. There is no suggestion in the report that the rates have been so reduced as to be less than compensatory. True they do not reach the maxima beyond which charges are excessive. On the other hand, they do not pass the minima beyond which charges are too low. A zone of reasonableness exists between maxima and minima within which a carrier is ordinarily free to adjust its charges for itself. Texas & Pacific R. Co. v. United States, \n289 \nU.S. 627, 636\n, 53 S.Ct. 768; United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., \n263 \nU.S. 515, 522\n, 44 S.Ct. 179, 192. We lay to one side cases of discrimination or preference or rivalry so keen as to be a menace to the steady and efficient service called for by the statute. Interstate Commerce Act,  15a (49 USCA  15a). Those tendencies excluded, 'a carrier is entitled to initiate rates and, in this connection, to adopt such policy of rate-making as to it seems wise.' United States v. Illinois Central R. Co., supra.\n Subjected to these tests, the finding by the commission that the new rates are unreasonable is seen to be nothing more than a deduction from the paragraph immediately preceding, wherein we learn that the schedule, if put into effect, will disrupt the rate structure in Indiana and re- \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 507]\n\u00a0\n lated areas and disturb groupings and differentials maintained for many years. This brings us to the question whether such disruption and disturbance may be deemed a sufficient reason for taking from a carrier the privilege of reaching out for a larger share of the business of transportation and initiating its own schedule to help it in the struggle. For an answer to that question, other facts, exhibited with greater particularity in other parts of the report, must be brought forward and considered. Those affecting the Indiana groups may conveniently be stated first; those affecting groups in Illinois afterwards.\n Every change of a rate schedule, either voluntary or involuntary, is a disruption protanto of the rate structure theretofore prevailing. Plainly such a disruption without more is no sufficient reason for prohibiting a change. The Indiana carriers by long continued co-operation have maintained a fixed schedule of differentials between mines in the southern group (Princeton and Booneville) and mines farther to the north. There is not a fact stated in the report to indicate that it will be unjust or impracticable to apply the new Milwaukee rates to the other lines in Indiana after increasing them by the differentials hitherto prevailing. There is not a fact to indicate that the rates so reduced will be less than compensatory or that capacity for service to the public will be impaired or put in jeopardy. 'The raising of rates does not necessarily increase revenue. It may in particular localities reduce revenue instead of increasing it, by discouraging patronage.' Florida v. United States, supra, \n282 U.S. 194\n, at page 214, 51 S.Ct. 119, 125. As applied to the Indiana groups, the broad conclusions of the report, when related to the supporting findings, amount to this and nothing more, that the new schedule for Milwaukee is likely to be followed by new schedules maintaining the same ratio for other lines in Indiana. Even if the outcome for those lines is a diminution of the profits (the return being none the less compensatory), this without more \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 508]\n\u00a0\n does not make it wrongful for Milwaukee to restore the long standing parity between Brazil and Springfield. At the very least, the findings should inform us, if only approximately, of the extent of the expected loss; they should make it clear whether the impairment of revenues will be trivial or substantial, for only thus can the impairment be related to capacity for service. Cf. Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1, 9\n, 54 S.Ct. 603. Nothing of the kind is shown. The schedules are to be congealed as they exist, because if not congealed they will be fluid, fluidity is change, and change has the potency, if not the promise, of disturbance. As to conditions in Indians, this and hardly more is the teaching of the report.\n We pass to the relation between the Indiana groups and those in Illinois. As we have seen, parity of rates had been maintained for many years between Indiana lines transporting coal from Brazil-Clinton to Northern Illinois and Illinois lines transporting coal from Springfield. There was no complaint by the commission during those years that the relation was unfair. There was no holding to that effect when orders of the state commission prescribing lower rates in Illinois were kept in operation against the protest of Milwaukee. Intrastate Rates on Bituminous Coal between Points in Illinois, supra. The significance of that decision has been considered already in the course of this opinion. As we have striven to make clear, the commission did not rule that the effect of the new rates was to establish a fair relation, still less the only fair one, between Illinois and Indiana, a relation to be maintained as something fixed and constant. The findings then made are repeated by quotation in the report in this proceeding without comment or explanation that would give them another meaning. If the schedule in controversy is to be rejected as oppressive or unreasonable, the grounds for the rejection must be looked for somewhere else than in the earlier decision. \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 509]\n\u00a0\n We are warned by the new report, however, that a change once permitted has a tendency to spread. The acceptance of the new schedule for Milwaukee will lead, it is said, to requests for proportionate reductions by other lines in Indiana, and this in turn to new reductions by lines in Illinois and even in Kentucky, the outcome being characterized in the argument of counsel, though not in the report, as a rate war between the roads. The threat of such a war may be a reason for rejecting a new schedule if the rate relation previously existing is a fair one, or even, we may assume, if the commission is without power to avert the reprisals and thereby nullify the threat. Neither of these conditions is satisfied in this case. The commission does not hold that the existing rate relation is intrinsically sound and fair. On the contrary, it expressly concedes that the rate situation as between the Illinois and Indiana groups may be in need of correction, though it expresses the belief that this should not be done in any piecemeal fashion. \n1\n The point of the decision is not that present rates are sound, but that they must be maintained, even if unsound, for fear of a rate war which might spread beyond control. The danger is illusory. The whole situation is subject to the power of the commission, which may keep the changes within bounds. If Illinois lines attempt to lower their rates again, a proceeding will be available to maintain a fair relation. If the lines in Kentucky, operating in interstate commerce, apply for new reductions, the supersivory power of the commission will subject them to the rule of reason. But other remedies even more plainly adequate are at hand in case of need. Under section 15 of the statute, the commission of its own motion may conduct a comprehensive inquiry into the rates of all the lines within the area of controversy, may fix the fair relation between one line and another, \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 510]\n\u00a0\n and may build the structure of the rates accordingly. Florida v. United States, \n292 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 603; United States v. Louisiana, \n290 \nU.S. 70\n, 54 S.Ct. 23.\n In the light of these considerations, it is not the Milwaukee that is subject to the reproach of dealing with the matter piecemeal. All that the Milwaukee has done is to initiate a schedule which must be upheld as lawful unless adequate reasons are presented for setting it aside. Cf. Anchor Coal Co. v. United States (D.C.) 25 F.(2d) 462; Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe R. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 768, 773\n, 49 S.Ct. 494. The reproach of piecemeal action is incurred by the commission, which has not adjudged the fairness of the relation now subsisting between Illinois and Indiana rates, which has not questioned its own capacity to prevent unjust reprisals, which has put off to an indefinite future the remodeling of the rate structure for all the carriers affected, and which has left this particular carrier helpless in the interval. In brief, a schedule of lowered tariffs has been canceled though the facts that control the validity of the reduction have yet to be determined. This was not a full discharge by the commission of an immediate responsibility. It was inaction and postponement. Responsibility was shifted from the shoulders of the present to the shoulders of the days to come.\n We would not be understood as saying that there do not lurk in this report phrases or sentences suggestive of a different meaning. One gains at places the impression that the commission looked upon the proposed reduction as something more than a disruptive tendency; that it found unfairness in the old relation of parity between Brazil and Springfield; and that the new schedule in its judgment would confirm Milwaukee in the enjoyment of an undue proportion of the traffic. The difficulty is that it has not said so with the simplicity and clearness through which a halting impression ripens into reasonable certitude. In the end we are left to spell out, to argue, to choose between \n\n[294 U.S. 499, 511]\n\u00a0\n conflicting inferences. Something more precise is requisite in the quasi jurisdictional findings of an administrative agency. Beaumont, S.L. & W.R. Co. v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 74, 86\n, 51 S.Ct. 1; Florida v. United States, \n282 \nU.S. 194, 215\n, 51 S.Ct. 119. We must know what a decision means before the duty becomes ours to say whether it is right or wrong.\n The decree should be affirmed, and it is so ordered. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] See the last two paragraphs of the first report by Division No. 2, which the second report has readopted and confirmed. \n\n\n\n\n","188":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nUNITED STATES v.

The tribe obtained a judgment and we granted a petition by the United States for certiorari. The suit was brought in 1926 under the act of May 24, 1924, c. 181, 43 Stat. 139, which declares: 'That jurisdiction be, and is hereby, conferred upon the Court of Claims, notwithstanding the lapse of time or statutes of limitation, to hear, examine, and adjudicate and render judgment in any and all legal and equitable claims arising under or growing out of any treaty or agreement between the United States and the Creek Indian Nation or Tribe, or arising under or growing out of any Act of Congress in relation to Indian affairs, which said Creek Nation or Tribe may have against the United States, which claims have not heretofore been determined and adjudicated on their merits by the Court of Claims or the Supreme Court of the United States.' Section 1.\n In the course of the suit the United States set up certain cross- demands and recovered judgment thereon; but the judgment on the tribe's claim is all that is challenged now.\n The principal facts relating to that claim were conceded below, as shown by the court's opinion and findings, and stand unquestioned here.\n Under a treaty of 18331 the United States granted to the Creek Tribe, by a patent conveying a fee simple, a large tract of land in Indian Territory, now Oklahoma. By a treaty of 18662 the Creeks ceded to the United States the westerly half of that tract, but expressly re- \n\n[295 U.S. 103, 106]\n\u00a0\n tained the easterly half; and the United States stipulated it would cause a north and south line separating the ceded from the unceded lands to be surveyed under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and guaranteed to the Creeks quiet possession of their unceded lands.\n In 1871, one Bardwell, acting under the direction of the Commissioner of Indian affairs, surveyed the divisional line. A controversy soon arose as to whether the line was surveyed too far to the east, and thereby encroached on unceded lands of the Creeks; but that controversy, if not terminated before, was put to rest and the line effectively recognized by an agreement made between the Creek Tribe and the United States in 1889,3 wherein the tribe's ownership of the lands east of that line was expressly recognized.\n In 1867,4 the United States entered into a treaty with the Sac and Fox Indians under which it assigned to them a tract of land within the area ceded by the Creeks, and immediately west of the area retained by them.\n In 1872, one Darling, a surveyor acting for the government, surveyed the Sac and Fox tract and erroneously extended his lines and closing corners eastward into the unceded Creek lands in disregard of the Bardwell dividing line. Darling's survey was approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office in 1873; and as a result of this survey and its approval a strip of Creek lands between the Bardwell line and Darling's easterly closing corners, aggregating 5,575.57 acres, was erroneously included within the Sac and Fox tract as officially surveyed and platted, and thereafter was occupied by the Sac and Fox. In 1875, one Hackbusch, a government surveyor, subdivided the sections in the Sac and Fox lands into 40-acre tracts, and followed Darling's lines into the unceded \n\n[295 U.S. 103, 107]\n\u00a0\n Creek lands, thereby perpetuating Darling's error. Hackbusch's survey, like that of Darling, was approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office.\n By an agreement ratified in the Act of February 13, 1891,5 the Sac and Fox ceded to the United States the tract assigned to them under the treaty of 1867. In the agreement the United States stipulated it would make allotments in severalty to the Sac and Fox Indians out of lands within their cession; and the ratifying act required that these allotments be made and that the remaining lands be opened to settlement as public lands and sold to settlers at a stated price per acre, which was to be turned into the Treasury as public money.\n In carrying that act into effect the Indian and land bureaus of the United States erroneously treated the strip of unceded Creek lands between Bardwell's line on the west and Darling's closing corners on the east as part of the Sac and Fox cession, and accordingly allotted and patented part of the strip to Sac and Fox Indians, by way of fulfilling the government's obligation to them; sold and patented other lands therein to settlers; and turned the purchase price received from such sales into the Treasury as public money. These disposals included nearly all of the 5,575. 57 acres in the strip, and the grantees have since been holding the same adversely to the Creek Tribe.\n In the court below, as its opinion shows, the parties were agreed that the lands in the strip were unceded Creek lands; and that as to such of them as were disposed of under the act of 1891 the Creek tribe is 'entitled to compensation.' But the parties were not agreed respecting the time as of which the value should be ascertained. The tribe contended for the value in 1926, when the suit was brought; while the government stood for the value at the time of the appropriation, which it insisted was in 1873, \n\n[295 U.S. 103, 108]\n\u00a0\n when Darling's erroneous survey was approved by the Commissioner of the General Land Office, or, in the alternative, at the time the lands were disposed of under the act of 1891\n\n\n The court below held the tribe entitled to the value of the lands, ruled the value at the time of suit should be allowed, found the value at that time was $30 an acre, and gave judgment accordingly. There was no finding of the value at either of the times named in the government's contention; but it is inferable from the record that the value was less at those times than when the suit was begun.\n\n 1. \nCounsel for the government, assuming that the present claim is merely for damages arising out of errors on the part of administrative officers, contend that it does not come within the terms of the jurisdictional act-'any and all legal and equitable claims arising under or growing out of any treaty or agreement between the United States and the Creek Indian Nation or Tribe, or arising under or growing out of any Act of Congress in relation to Indian affairs, which said Creek Nation or Tribe may have against the United States.' We think the contention is not tenable.\n Counsel's assumption ignores several elements of the claim, such as the treaties of 1833 and 1866 and the acts of Congress of 1889 and 1891. It also neglects matters reflecting a confirmation of the acts of the administrative officers, such as the receipt by the United States of direct and material benefits from their acts and its retention of the benefits with knowledge of all the facts.\n While the jurisdictional act is couched in general terms, there can be little doubt when it is read in the light of the circumstances leading to its passage that it is intended to include the present claim. The congressional committees on whose recommendation the act was passed were in possession of all data bearing on the claim. The facts \n\n[295 U.S. 103, 109]\n\u00a0\n had been laid before them in letters from the Secretary of the Interior, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, and the Commissioner of the General Land Office. \n6\n In the letters these officers, besides reciting the facts in detail, expressed their own conclusions in the matter, which were to the effect that the settlers and allottees had acquired and improved the lands in good faith, and therefore deserved consideration; that the Creek tribe was 'entitled to compensation' for the lands 'lost' by it through what had been done; that the unfortunate situation 'grew out of errors of representatives of the government,' which made it reasonable to expect the government to bear the expense of an adjustment; and that there was need for legislation under which the matter could be examined and brought to an equitable and final solution. In view of this portrayal of the matter by the officers specially charged with the administration of Indian and public-land affairs, and the subsequent action of the committees in effecting the passage of the jurisdictional act, we regard it as reasonably manifest that the act is intended to provide for the adjudication of the present claim. The concessions made in the court below by those who were there representing the government show rather plainly that they so understood the act.\n\n 2. \nA question is raised as to whether there was an appropriation or taking of the lands by the United States.\n The Creek Tribe had a fee-simple title, not the usual Indian right of occupancy with the fee in the United States. That title was acquired and held under treaties, in one of which the United States guaranteed to the tribe quiet possession. The tribe was a dependent Indian community under the guardianship of the United States, and therefore its property and affairs were subject to the control and management of that government. But this \n\n[295 U.S. 103, 110]\n\u00a0\n power to control and manage was not absolute. While extending to all appropriate measures for protecting and advancing the tribe, it was subject to limitations inhering in such a guardianship and to pertinent constitutional restrictions. It did not enable the United States to give the tribal lands to others, or to appropriate them to its own purposes, without rendering, or assuming an obligation to render, just compensation for them; for that 'would not be an exercise of guardianship, but an act of confiscation.' Lane v. Pueblo of Santa Rosa, \n249 \nU.S. 110, 113\n, 39 S.Ct. 185, 186; Cherokee Nation v. Hitchcock, \n187 \nU.S. 294, 307\n, 308 S., 23 S.Ct. 115.\n Such was the situation when the lands in question were disposed of under the act of 1891. The disposals were made on behalf of the United States by officers to whom it had committed the administration of that act, and were consummated by the issue of patents signed by the President.\n True, the tribe, if free and prepared to proceed in its own behalf, might have successfully assailed the disposals; but it was not in a position where it could be expected to assume that burden. It was in a state of tutelage and entitled to rely on the United States, its guardian, for needed protection of its interests. Plainly the United States would have been entitled to a cancellation of the disposals had it instituted suits for that purpose. \n7\n But, although having full knowledge of the facts, it made no effort in that direction. On the contrary, it permitted the disposals to stand-not improbably because of the unhappy situation in which the other course would leave the allottees and settlers. In this way the United States in effect confirmed the disposals; and it emphasized the confirmation by retaining, with such full knowledge, all the benefits it has received from them. \n\n[295 U.S. 103, 111]\n\u00a0\n We conclude that the lands were appropriated by the United States in circumstances which involved an implied undertaking by it to make just compensation to the tribe. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n\n 3. \nPlainly the appropriation was not in 1873, when Darling's survey was approved by the Commissioner of the General Land office. That survey did not effect any change in the existing ownership; nor was it intended to do so. The most that can be said of it is that it was done erroneously and, in the absence of correction, might lead to further error.\n But not so of the disposals under the act of 1891. They were intended from their inception to effect a change of ownership and were consummated by the issue of patents, the most accredited type of conveyance known to our law. True, they rested on anerroneous application of the act of 1891 to the Creek lands in the strip; but, as that application was confirmed by the United States, the matter stands as if the act had distinctly directed the disposals. It was through them that the lands were taken; so the compensation should be based on the value at that time, and not, as ruled below, on the value when the suit was begun.\n But the just compensation to be awarded now should not be confined to the value of the lands at the time of the taking but should include such addition thereto as may be required to produce the present full equivalent of that value paid contemporaneously with the taking. \n9\n Interest at a reasonable rate is a suitable measure by which to ascertain the amount to be added. \n10\n The treaty \n\n[295 U.S. 103, 112]\n\u00a0\n of 1866, the act of 1889 and other statutes show that 5 per cent. per annum is a reasonable rate as between the parties here. \n11\n\u00a0\n\n It follows that the judgment must be reversed, with directions for such further proceedings as may be necessary to bring the award of compensation into conformity with this opinion.\n Judgment reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n295 \nU.S. 769\n, 55 S.Ct. 911, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Treaty of February 14, 1833, arts. 2 and 3, 7 Stat. 417, 418. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] Treaty of June 14, 1866, arts. 3 and 8, 14 Stat. 785, 786, 788. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] Act March 1, 1889, c. 317, 25 Stat. 757, 758. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] Treaty of February 18, 1867, art. 6, 15 Stat. 495, 496. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Chapter 165, 26 Stat. 749, 750. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] Senate Report No. 2561, p. 54, 59th Cong., 1st Sess., and papers named in letter of Secretary of the Interior. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] United States v.

HASTINGS(1935)\nNo. 22\nArgued: November 12, 1935Decided: December 9, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 188, 190]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Homer S. Cummings, Atty. Gen., and Joseph B. Keenan, Asst. Atty. Gen., for the United States.\n Mr. James M. Beck, of Washington, D.C., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Chief Justice HUGHES delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Defendant was indicted in the District Court of the United States for violation of the United States Warehouse Act, 7 U.S.C.  270 (7 USCA  270 ). The indictment contained three counts, each charging the 'removal and stealing' of a numbered bale of cotton from a licensed warehouse contrary to the statute and regulations. \n1\n A demurrer was \n\n[296 U.S. 188, 191]\n\u00a0\n sustained and the government brings this appeal under the Criminal Appeals Act. 18 U.S.C.  682 (18 USCA  682).\n The penal provision of the statute, so far as pertinent here, is as follows:\n'Every person who shall ... remove from a licensed warehouse contrary to this chapter or the regulations promulgated thereunder, any agricultural products stored or to be stored in such warehouse, and for which licensed receipts have been or are to be issued, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be fined not more than $10,000, or double the value of the products involved if such double value exceeds $10,000, or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both, in the discretion of the court.'\n\n The District Judge certified his grounds for sustaining the demurrer as follows:\n'(1) That said indictment fails to charge any offense against the laws of the United States.\n\n'(2) That the indictment fails to charge that the cotton alleged to have been removed and stolen was the property of any person.\n\n'(3) That the indictment fails to allege the name of the owner of said cotton, and does not charge any intent to defraud the owner thereof.\n\n'(4) That the indictment does not allege the value of the cotton alleged to have been removed and stolen, or that the cotton was of any value.\n\n'(5) That section 270, title 7, of the United States Code, being the section under which the indictment is drawn, is unconstitutional, in that, Congress is without authority under the Constitution to make it an offense \n\n[296 U.S. 188, 192]\n\u00a0\n against the laws of the United States to remove agricultural products from a Federal licensed warehouse as alleged in the indictment.'\n\n\n 1. \nThe juridiction of this Court. If the first four grounds of the decision, as stated in the certificate of the District Judge, are to be taken as wholly independent of the questions of the construction and validity of the United States Warehouse Act, those grouns may not be challenged on this appeal. The statute conferring jurisdiction on appeal by the government in criminal prosecutions confines that jurisdiction to cases where the decision of the District Court, on demurrer, motion to quash, or in arrest of judgment, 'is based upon the invalidity, or construction of the statute upon which the indictment is founded,' or where the District Court has sustained 'a special plea in bar, when the defendant has not been put in jeopardy.' 18 U.S.C.  682 (18 USCA  682). The proposal to confer a broader jurisdiction was considered by the Congress and rejected. \n2\n Thus the construction of the indictment and its sufficiency merely as a pleading, as distinguished from the construction of the statute, are questions for the District Court. We must accept the construction of the indictment as that court gives it. And where that court has rested its decision upon the invalidity or construction of the statute which underlies the indictment, this Court will not go beyond those grounds and consider other objections to the indictment. United States v. Keitel, \n211 \nU.S. 370, 397\n, 398 S., 29 S.Ct. 123; United States v. Miller, \n223 \nU.S. 599, 602\n, 32 S.Ct. 323; United States v. Carter, \n231 \nU.S. 492, 493\n, 34 S.Ct. 173; United States v. Moist, \n231 \nU.S. 701, 702\n, 34 S.Ct. 255; United States v. Colgate & Co., \n250 \nU.S. 300, 301\n, 302 S., 39 S.Ct. 465, 7 A.L.R. 443; United States v. A. Schrader's Son, \n252 \nU.S. 85, 98\n, 40 S.Ct. 251; United States v. Yuginovich, \n256 \nU.S. 450, 461\n, 41 S.Ct. 551\n\n\n\n\n[296 U.S. 188, 193]\n\u00a0\n A distinct question is presented where the District Court has not placed its decision solely upon the invalidity or construction of the statute, but has also sustained the demurrer or granted the motion to quash the indictment upon wholly independent grounds of insufficiency. In such a case the judgment of the District Court would remain in effect, and the defendant would go free of the indictment, whatever views we might express upon appeal as to the construction or validity of the statute. We could not reverse the judgment upon questions not before us. An indictment not merely attacked, but found to be invalid on grounds not open here, would be made the vehicle of an effort to obtain from this Court an expression of an abstract opinion, which might or might not fit a subsequent prosecution of the same defendant or others, but would not determine the instant case. Review of a judgment which we cannot disturb, because it rests adequately upon a basis not subject to our examination, would be an anomaly.\n An analogous situation is found in cases where the jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked on writs of error or appeals from judgments of state courts, and it appears that, notwithstanding the existence of a federal question, and its consideration and determination by the state court, the judgment rests upon a non-federal ground adequate to support it and hence would not be affected by a decision by this Court of the federal question. In such cases, we refuse review. While the earlier practice was to affirm the judgment without considering the federal question, the later practice has been to dismiss the writ of error or appeal.

Ohio (Nov. 11, 1935), \n296 \nU.S. 546\n, 56 S.Ct. 174.\n It was in the light of the considerations governing the exercise of the judicial power that the Criminal Appeals Act was enacted and appeals by the government were subjected to the prescribed limitations. United States v. Evans, \n213 \nU.S. 297, 300\n, 29 S.Ct. 507. We think that the provision which limits the government's appeal to those cases where the decision or judgment of the District Court is 'based' upon the invalidity or construction of the statute should be taken to refer to cases where that determination, and not a wholly independent grounds, is the foundation of the judgment. If the judgment is independently based, and in that respect is not open to correction or reversal, we are of the opinion that this Court should not entertain the government's appeal. To the extent that the opinion in the case of United States v. Stevenson, \n215 \nU.S. 190, 195\n, 30 S.Ct. 35, states a contrary view, it is disapproved.\n Are the first four grounds stated by the District Judge independent of the construction of the statute? The first ground may fairly be regarded as not a distinct ground, or a finding of the insufficiency of the indictment as a mere matter of pleading, but as intended to be an introduction to the specifications which follow and to be read in their light. Treating the first ground in this sense, and as merely preliminary, we turn to the specifications in the second, third, and fourth grounds, which clearly involve the construction of the act. That is, they go upon the view that the ingredients of the statutory offense are similar to those of common-law larceny and that to establish the offense it must be alleged and proved that the cotton in question was the property of a person named, was removed with intent to defraud the owner, and had value. It is the contention of the government that this is an unwarranted construction and that the \n\n[296 U.S. 188, 195]\n\u00a0\n words of the statute, which do not contain such requirements, are fully descriptive of the statutory offense.\n In his fifth ground, the District Judge expressly deals with the constitutionality of the provision, holding that Congress is without authority 'to make it an offense against the laws of the United States to remove agricultural products from a federal licensed warehouse as alleged in the indictment.' The concluding words challenge attention to the absence from the indictment of an allegation that the cotton was stored for interstate or foreign commerce. The statement of the District Judge may be taken to be a construction of the indictment as charging simply the removal of the cotton from a federal licensed warehouse which had issued a receipt, without alleging that the cotton was stored for interstate or foreign commerce and that the receipt was issued accordingly. We are not at liberty to construe the indictment otherwise. While in this view, the present appeal does not bring up the questions broadly discussed at the bar as to products stored for interstate or foreign commerce-questions which must await a different and appropriate record-the appeal does present a narrower but still important question as to the scope of the penal provision. That is, whether Congress sought to exert and, if so, could validly exert, such a measure of control over warehouses operating under federal licenses, as to penalize the removal of products deposited in such warehouses, and receipted for, regardless of the purpose, or the nature of the commerce, for which the deposit was made.\n We have jurisdiction to determine these questions of construction and validity.\n\n 2. \nThe construction of the statute. To construe the penal provision, we turn to its context, to the statutory definition of the terms it employs, and to the purpose thus disclosed. \n\n[296 U.S. 188, 196]\n\u00a0\n The act3 defines the term 'warehouse' as 'every building, structure, or other protected inclosure in which any agricultural product is or may be stored for interstate or foreign commerce, or, if located within any place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, in which any agricultural product is or may be stored.' 7 U.S.C.  242 (7 USCA  242). The Secretary of Agriculture is authorized to make investigations and classifications, to issue licenses, and to prescribe the duties of licensed warehousemen, who must give bond for the faithful performance of their obligations. Id.,  243-247 (7 USCA  243-247). The Secretary is also authorized to issue licenses to competent persons to inspect, sample, classify, and weigh agricultural products stored or to be stored in licensed warehouses, and to give certificates accordingly. Id.,  252 (7 USCA  252). Those conducting licensed warehouses are required to receive for storage, within their capacity, agricultural products of the kind customarily stored by them if such products are tendered 'in a suitable condition for warehousing' and 'in the usual manner' according to the ordinary course of business, 'without making any discrimination between persons desiring to avail themselves of warehouse facilities.' Id.,  254 ( 7 USCA  254). Persons who deposit agricultural products for storage in licensed warehouses are to be deemed to have made the deposit subject to the statute and the regulations it authorizes. Id.,  255 (7 USCA  255). It is then provided that 'any fungible agricultural product stored for interstate or foreign commerce, or in any place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States' in a licensed warehouse must be inspected and graded by a person licensed for that purpose. Id.,  256 (7 USCA  256).\n The following provision for the issue of warehouse receipts is of special importance: \n\n[296 U.S. 188, 197]\n\u00a0\n 'For all agricultural products stored for interstate or foreign commerce, or in any place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, in a warehouse licensed under this chapter original receipts shall be issued by the warehouseman conducting the same, but no receipt shall be issued except for agricultural products actually stored in the warehouse at the time of the issuance thereof.' Id.,  259 (7 USCA  259).\n The next section prescribes the contents of receipts which may be taken to refer to the receipts required by the provision above quoted. Id .,  260 (7 USCA  260).\n In the original act of 1916 it was provided that nothing therein should 'be construed to conflict with, or to authorize any conflict with, or in any way to impair or limit the effect or operation of the laws of any State relating to warehouses, warehousemen, weighers, graders, or classifiers,' but the Secretary of Agriculture was authorized 'to co- operate' with state officials and 'through such co-operation to secure the enforcement' of the provisions of the act. Act of August 11, 1916, p. C,  29, 39 Stat. 490. This section was amended in 1931, so as to provide for co-operation with state officials in the 'discretion' of the Secretary, and with the addition that 'the power, jurisdiction, and authority' conferred upon the Secretary should be 'exclusive with respect to all persons securing a license,' so long as the license remains in effect. Act of March 2, 1931, 46 Stat. 1465, 7 U.S.C.  269 (7 USCA  269).\n Then follows the provision prescribing penalties for the forging, altering, counterfeiting, etc., of licenses, the issue of false or fraudulent receipts, and the conversion or the unauthorized removal from a licensed warehouse of agricultural products for which 'licensed receipts' have been or are to be issued. Id.,  270 (7 USCA  270).\n The instant case relates to cotton, and the government emphasizes the salient facts as to the customary move- \n\n[296 U.S. 188, 198]\n\u00a0\n ment and marketing of cotton. But the act is not limited to cotton. Originally, the act defined 'agricultural products' as embracing 'cotton, wool, grains, tobacco, and flaxseed. \n4\n By regulations under the act, as amended, it has been extended to a variety of products. \n5\n The act is not limited to one section of the country, or to particular market conditions, but applies generally to warehouses for these varied commodities. The government points to the permissive character of the statute which, it is said, should have 'great weight in determining whether Congress has encroached upon the powers of the States.' And Congress could not fail to have in mind that there were warehouses in many states, operating under state laws and serving local demands in intrastate transactions; receiving for storage and issuing receipts for agricultural products in connection with enterprises and trade that are entirely local.\n It would need stronger evidence than this act affords to justify the conclusion that Congress intended that warehousemen, in taking advantage of the federal statute and in issuing warehouse receipts as required by its terms, should submit to federal control the deposit of products and the issue of warehouse receipts in the course of their local business where the products were not stored for interstate or foreign commerce. Despite the broad language of certain sections of the act, we think that ( aside from places within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States) the limitation to storage for interstate or foreign commerce is dominant. We have observed how specific is this limitation in the provision requiring the issue of warehouse receipts. To repeat, the requirement \n\n[296 U.S. 188, 199]\n\u00a0\n is that receipts shall be issued 'for all agricultural products stored for interstate or foreign commerce, or in any place under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States,' in a warehouse licensed under the act. Section 259. The amendment of 1931, with respect to conflict with the operation of state laws, does not militate against this limitation, for while the amendment asserts the exclusive authority of the Secretary of Agriculture, it has relation to the authority conferred by the act, and the definition in the original act of the warehouses which may be licensed and the provision of section 259 as to the products for which warehouse receipts are to be issued, were left unchanged by the amendment.\n The penal section under which the indictment is laid defines the offense as not simply the unauthorized removal of agricultural products from a 'licensed warehouse,' but the removal of products 'for which licensed receipts have been or are to be issued.' Section 270. We think that the term 'licensed receipts' refers to those prescribed by the statute as above stated.\n We agree with the government that the penal section is fully descriptive of the statutory offense and does not require that a charge of violation should contain allegations such as would be appropriate in the case of common law larceny. But the statute does require that in order to make out a violation through the unauthorized removal of agricultural products, it is not enough that the removal should be from a licensed warehouse, or that a receipt has been given by the warehouseman, but the removal must also be of products for which 'licensed receipts' have been or are to be issued. That is, it is an essential ingredient of the offense that the products have been stored for interstate or foreign commerce, or in a place subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States, and that warehouse receipts have been or are to be issued for such storage. \n\n[296 U.S. 188, 200]\n\u00a0\n 3. As we conclude that the Congress has not attempted to punish the removal of products not stored for interstate or foreign commerce (when the place of storage is not within the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States), we need not consider the constitutional objections to such an effort. And as we do not have before us the case of a removal of products stored for interstate or foreign commerce, and for which receipts have been given accordingly, we express no opinion as to the extent of the power of the Congress in that relation.\n Because of the absence from the charge of an essential element of the offense as defined in the statute, the District Court did not err in sustaining the demurrer.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] The charge in the first count (the other counts being similar) was that defendant (and another) 'did knowingly, willfully, and unlawfully and without any authority of law, remove and steal from and out of the warehouse of the Federal Compress and Warehouse Company, Clarksdale, Mississippi, being the warehouse of said Federal Compress and Warehouse Company known and designated Plant No. 2, said warehouse being then and there a duly licensed warehouse under and pursuant to the provisions of the United States Warehouse Act, certain agricultural products then and there stored and on storage in said warehouses, to wit: a certain bale of cotton identified on the records of said warehouse as bale of cotton number 407784, for which said bale of cotton a licensed warehouse receipt had theretofore been issued by said Federal Compress and Warehouse Company, the removal and stealing of said cotton from said licensed warehouse being then and there contrary to and in violation of the said United States Warehouse Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, contrary to the form of the statute in such case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the United States.' \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] H.R.

The vessel, however, was not returned by the owner, either then or at any other time, to the custody of the collector. Accordingly, on July 19, 1933, the United States of America filed its complaint against principal and surety to recover upon the bond, claiming $1,100, the value of the vessel, with interest from the date of the breach of the condition. A motion to dismiss the complaint was made in April, 1934, the defendants contending that through the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment on December 5, 1933, liability on the bond had ended. The motion was granted by the District Court, 6 F.Supp. 839, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, 73 F.(2d) 265. A writ of certiorari brings the case here. \n294 \nU.S. 704\n, 55 S.Ct. 546, 79 L.Ed. --.\n Penalties and forfeitures imposed by the National Prohibition Act for offenses committed within the territorial limits of a state fell with the adoption of the Twenty-First Amendment. United States v. Chambers, \n291 \nU.S. 217\n, 54 S.Ct. 434, 89 A.L.R. 1510. Our holding to that effect was confined to criminal liabilities, and had its genesis in an ancient rule. On the other hand, contractual liabilities connected with the act continued to be enforceable with undiminished obligation, unless conditioned by their tenor, either expressly or otherwise, upon forfeitures or penalties frustrated by the amendment. The courts below have held that liability upon the bond in suit was conditioned by implication upon the possibility in law of subjecting the delinquent vessel to forfeiture and sale, and that the possibility must be unbroken down to the recovery of judgment against the delinquent obligors. In opposition to that holding the government contends that the bond is a contract to be enforced according to its terms; that liability became complete upon the breach of the express condition for the return of the delinquent vessel; and that the liability thus perfected was not extinguished or diminished by the \n\n[295 U.S. 480, 484]\n\u00a0\n loss of penal sanctions. We think the government is right.\n By the provisions of the Prohibition Act, an officer who seizes a vessel or other conveyance transporting intoxicating liquors must deliver it to the owner upon the execution of 'a good and valid bond, with sufficient sureties, in a sum double the value of the property,' to be approved by the officer and to be 'conditioned to return said property to the custody of said officer on the day of trial to abide the judgment of the court.' National Prohibition Act, c. 85, 41 Stat. 305, 315, tit. 2,  26, 27 U.S.C.  40 (27 USCA  40). No other condition is expressed in the statute. No other, we think, is to be implied. One of the essentials of jurisdiction in rem is that the thing shall be 'actually or constructively within the reach of the Court.' The Brig Ann, 9 Cranch, 289, 291; and see Miller v. United States, 11 Wall. 268, 294; Strong v. United States (C.C.A.) 46 F.(2d) 257, 260, 79 A.L.R. 150. If the defendants had lived up to the requirements of the bond, the court would have been in a position after the plea of guilty by the crew to proceed against the vessel forthwith and in a summary way. The Harbour Trader (C.C. A.) 42 F.(2d) 858. Without the presence of the vessel that opportunity would be lost. To give assurance that it would not be lost, the bond was exacted by the statute and delivered by the owner. In the face of all this the argument is pressed that delay has extinguished the remedy on the bond by putting an end to the possibility of going against the boat. Thus the obligation is destroyed by force of the very contingency against which it was designed to give protection. We find no adequate reason for thus rewarding an offender. If the condition had not been broken, the government would have received the value of the vessel, or at least that result would have ensued for anything to the contrary shown in this record. Principal and surety covenanted that in \n\n[295 U.S. 480, 485]\n\u00a0\n the event of such a default the bond should become payable according to its terms. They must be held to their engagement. Cf. United States v. John Barth Co., \n279 \nU.S. 370\n, 49 S.Ct. 366; Gulf States Steel Co. v. United States, \n287 \nU.S. 32\n, 53 S.Ct. 69, 77 L.Ed 150; United States v. Hodson, 10 Wall. 395, 409; Daniels v. Tearney, \n102 U.S. 415\n.\n We have said that the bond may not be read by a process of construction as subject to conditions not expressed upon its face. In saying that we have no thought to pass upon the quantum of a recovery thereunder. There are decisions of other courts to the effect that the bond is one of indemnity, so that only the damages actually suffered by the omission to produce the boat for surrender at the appointed time will be owing upon default. See United States v. Warnell (C.C.A.) 67 F.(2d) 831, 832; United States v. Randall (C.C.A.) 58 F.(2d) 193, 194; cf. United States v. Zerbey, \n271 \nU.S. 332, 340\n, 46 S.Ct. 532. If that is so, there is always the possibility of proving in mitigation or defense that the boat and those in charge of her were innocent, and hence there was no loss. We leave those questions open. It is one thing to show that, if the boat and been on hand at the appointed time, no benefit to the government would have resulted from her presence. Cf. Taylor v. Traintor, 16 Wall. 366, 369. It is quite another thing to show that there was damage at the date of breach, and damage for which the government would have a remedy if the boat had been produced, but that, owing to changed circumstances, it would be useless to produce her now. Neither in the bond nor in the statute is there a disclosure of a willingness that the principal shall be thus permitted to take advantage of his wrong.\n We are told that the bond is only a substitute for the vessel, and hence is not enforceable, unless there could be a decree in rem if the vessel were in court to-day. To speak of the bond as such a substitute is only a half truth. Un- \n\n[295 U.S. 480, 486]\n\u00a0\n doubtedly the reason for the exaction of the bond was to put the government in as good a position as it would have occupied if the res had been present at the time of the criminal trial, but this is far from saying that liability was meant to be conditioned upon control of the res thereafter as a continuing possibility. A bond such as this one has very little analogy to a form of bond common in the admiralty whereby the stipulators become bound to 'pay the amount awarded by the final decree.' Cf. The Belgenland, \n108 \nU.S. 153\n, 2 S.Ct. 383; The City of Norwich, \n118 \nU.S. 468, 489\n, 6 S.Ct. 1150. Upon a bond so conditioned, the liability of the stipulators is inchoate until perfected by a decree for the disposition of the res or of the proceeds of the bond accepted as a substitute. Here, on the contrary, the remedy is at law by an action on a contract, and not in rem or quasi in rem as if a suit had been brought in admiralty or in equity. The existence or nonexistence of a cause of action at law growing out of a civil liability having its origin in contract is commonly dependent upon the state of facts existing when the action was begun. There is nothing to bring this case within any recognized exception.\n Both sides make much of the analogy supplied by the responsibility of bail. The analogy exists, though it is far from being complete. Its implications give support on the whole to the position of the government. At common-law bail might be exonerated as of right by the surrender of their principal if their liability had not yet been 'fixed.' There was much learned disquisition as to the time when that event occurred. To avoid confusion of thought, a distinction must be drawn between civil and criminal cases, for the function of bail in each is essentially diverse. United States v. Ryder, \n110 \nU.S. 729, 736\n, 4 S.Ct. 196.\n The rule in civil cases was that bail were not liable until a return of non est inventus to a ca. sa. against the \n\n[295 U.S. 480, 487]\n\u00a0\n principal. Cholmley v. Veal, 6 Mod. 304; Bernard v. McKenna, 3 Fed.Cas. 277, No. 1,348; Pearsall v. Lawrence, 3 Johns. (N.Y.) 514; 1 Tidd's Practice, 237, 238.2 Upon such return liability was fixed, but not definitively and beyond remission. A first writ of scire facias must have issued, and in certain contingencies an alias writ, before the bail were to be cast in judgment. Kirk v. United States (C.C.A.) 137 F. 753, 755; Feeter v. McCombs, 1 Wend.(N.Y.) 19; Cumming v. Eden, 1 Cow.(N.Y.) 70; 2 Tidd's Practice, 1038, 1039, 1040. By the indulgence of the court they might surrender the principal until the return day of the last writ, after which their liability became definitive and absolute. Mannin v. Partridge, 14 East, 599, 600; Beers v. Haughton, 9 Pet. 329, 358. But remission of liability, even within those limits, was matter of indulgence only. 1 Tidd's Practice, 238, 239; 2 Id. 1044. 'To many purposes, the bail is considered as fixed, by the return of the ca. sa.' Marshall, C.J., in Davidson v. Taylor, 12 Wheat. 604. If surrender was allowable thereafter, the privilege was given 'as matter of favor, and not as matter pleadable in bar.' Ibid. The court would exercise a sound discretion. Morsell v. Hall, 13 How, 212, 215. Accordingly, the practice was to treat the liability as absolute if the situation had so changed that the bail were no longer able to make an effectual surrender, as where before the return of the scire facias the principal had died. 'All the cases agree, that after the bail are fixed, de jure, they take the risk of the death of the principal. ... The time which is allowed the bail, ex gratia, is at their peril, and they must surrender.' Kent, C.J., in Olcott v. Lilly, 4 Johns.(N.Y.) 407, 408. 'In such a case, the bail is considered as fixed by the \n\n[295 U.S. 480, 488]\n\u00a0\n return of the ca. sa., and his (the principal's) death afterwards, and before the return of the scire facias, does not entitle the bail to an exoneretur.' Davidson v. Taylor, supra. Cf. United States v. Costello (C.C. A.) 47 F.(2d) 684, 686; Detroit Fidelity & Surety Co. v. United States (C. C.A.) 59 F.(2d) 565, 568; 2 Tidd's Practice, 1044. To follow this analogy through in its application to the case at hand: The respondents are no longer able by a surrender of the vessel to neutralize the consequences flowing from their default. Surrender after condition broken was never a strict defense. It has ceased in the present circumstances to commend the offenders to favor and indulgence. The forfeiture must stand.\n If from civil cases we pass to criminal, the argument from analogy becomes even weaker for the respondents, and stronger for the government. No longer is there need for a return to a ca. sa. The bail are bound at once upon the principal's default. 'If the condition of the bail bond is broken by the failure of the principal to appear, the sureties become the absolute debtors of the United States for the amount of the penalty.' United States v. Zarafonitis (C.C.A.) 150 F. 97, 99, 10 Ann.Cas. 290; United States v. Van Fossen, 28 Fed.Cas. 357, at page 358, No. 16,607; 607; People v. Anable, 7 Hill (N.Y.) 33. Collection may be enforced either by scire facias in the court which has possession of the record or by an ordinary suit in any other court of competent jurisdiction. United States v. Zarafonitis, supra; cf. Davis v. Packard, 7 Pet. 276, 285. True, an appeal ad misericordiam may result, as with civil bail, in a remission of the penalty. This power of remission has been exercised from distant times both in the English courts (King v. Tomb, 10 Mod. 278; In re Pellow, 13 Price 299) and here. United States v. Kelleher (C.C.A.) 57 F.( 2d) 684, 84 A.L.R. 14. For the courts of the United States it is now regulated by statute. Rev. St.  1020, 18 U.S.C.  601, 18 USCA  601. One of the prescribed \n\n[295 U.S. 480, 489]\n\u00a0\n conditions is that a trial can still be had. This appears from the statute which is quoted in the margin. \n3\n The trial, of course, must be a reality, not the shadow of a name. At best, remission of the forfeiture is granted as an act of grace. The remedy for that reason is by motion or petition, not by answer and a plea in bar. Detroit Fidelity & Surety Co. v. United States, supra, 59 F.(2d) 565, at page 568; United States v. Costello, supra; Southern Surety Co. v. United States (C.C.A.) 23 F.(2d) 55; United States v. Dunbar (C.C.A.) 83 F. 151; Hardy v. United States (C.C.A.) 71 F. 158. The respondents do not appeal for grace, if it be assumed that grace has any place in the enforcement of such a liability as theirs. They defend upon the ground that the obligation is extinguished.\n The point is faintly made that the government was at fault in failing to bring suit more promptly after the breach of the condition. The complaint was filed in July, 1933, while the Prohibition Act (27 USCA  1 et seq.) was still in force. Laches within the term of the statute of limitations is no defense at law. Cross v. Allen, \n141 \nU.S. 528, 537\n, 12 S. Ct. 67; Sprigg v. Bank of Mt. Pleasant, 14 Pet. 201, 207. Least of all is it a defense to an action by the sovereign. United States v. Kirkpatrick, 9 Wheat. 720, 735, 736; Dox v. Postmaster General, 1 Pet. 318, 325.\n The judgment is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 'Know all men by these presents, that I, James A.

MULLIGAN(1935)\nNo. 569\nArgued: April 2, 1935Decided: May 13, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 396, 397]\n\u00a0\n Mr. David P. Siegel, of New York City, for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Angus D. MacLean, Asst. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondents.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Petitioner by writ of habeas corpus in the District Court for Southern New York sought to test the validity of his \n\n[295 U.S. 396, 398]\n\u00a0\n commitment by a United States Commissioner in proceedings for removal under R.S.  1014, 18 U.S.C.  591 (18 USCA  591). After hearing upon the transcript of the proceedings before the Commissioner, the District Court dismissed the writ. The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed. 73 F.(2d) 274, 275. The questions presented are: Whether, as the Circuit Court of Appeals held, review of the Commissioner's decision ends when the court is assured that he has honestly considered all the evidence presented to him? Is the evidence sufficient to warrant petitioner's removal? Should the Commissioner's findings be set aside for error in the admission of evidence?\n Petitioner and six others were indicted in the Southern District of Florida for conspiracy, 18 U.S.C.  88 (18 USCA  88), to misapply, and for the misapplication of, funds of a bank in violation of 12 U.S.C.  592 ( 12 USCA  592). Overt acts alleged against him are that, under the name of Arthur Starke, he registered at a Jacksonville Beach hotel and rented a safe deposit box at a St. Augustine bank. He was found in the Southern District of New York, and complaint was made to a Commissioner in that district praying his arrest and removal for trial. He was brought before the Commissioner and, at the hearing that followed, the United States produced a certified copy of the indictment and called witnesses whose testimony tended to prove that petitioner committed the overt acts and that on one occasion when he visited the safe deposit box a codefendant, Goldberg, was with him.\n Petitioner admitted the overt acts. But he said he had no connection with the conspiracy and did not know any of the persons accused. He went to Florida to engage in business with one Finberg, who died before the hearing, and for that purpose brought a large sum of money for the safe- keeping of which he hired the box. He assumed the false name at Finberg's suggestion in order to keep secret their connection. He had never been convicted of crime. \n\n[295 U.S. 396, 399]\n\u00a0\n It was stipulated that, if called as witnesses, certain persons acquainted with petitioner would testify that his reputation for honesty and veracity was excellent. He introduced depositions of five persons implicated, three of whom were codefendants. They testified that they did not know petitioner or have any knowledge of his participation in the offenses charged. Two of them, professing to know all who were involved, definitely asserted that petitioner was not one of them. The other three did not know all the conspirators. Goldberg refused to depose; the other two defendants did not testify. The government called a special agent of the Department of Justice as a witness in rebuttal. The Commissioner, notwithstanding objection that it was incompetent, received his testimony to the effect that both before and after giving their depositions two of the deponents, who had sworn that they did not know petitioner, had said that they did know him and that he had participated in the crimes. The Commissioner found that there was probable cause to believe that petitioner had committed the offenses and held him to await the action of the District Judge.\n Removal from one federal district to another under section 1014, R.S. ( 18 USCA  591)1 is unlike extradition or interstate rendition, in \n\n[295 U.S. 396, 400]\n\u00a0\n that the protection owed by a sovereign to those within its territory is not involved. Beavers v. Henkel, \n194 \nU.S. 73, 82\n, 83 S., 24 S.Ct. 605. A person accused by indictment and found within the district where he is wanted is not entitled to a hearing in advance of trial. Beavers v. Henkel, supra, \n194 \nU.S. 73, 84\n, 24 S.Ct. 605. The statute gives such a right to one otherwise accused. There is no constitutional right to a hearing in advance of removal. Undoubtedly, Congress has power to direct that accused persons be taken, immediately and without hearing, before the court for trial. United States ex rel. Hughes v. Gault, \n271 \nU.S. 142, 149\n, 152 S., 46 S.Ct. 459. But, as otherwise hardship and injustice might result, it has given a right to examination and hearing. Beavers v. Henkel, supra, \n194 \nU.S. 73, 83\n, 24 S. Ct. 605; Tinsley v. Treat, \n205 \nU.S. 20, 29\n, 27 S.Ct. 430; United States ex rel. Hughes v. Gault, supra. In removal proceedings, the case of an indicted person is to be distinguished from that of one accused only by complaint filed with the Commissioner. Identity being shown or admitted, the indictment without more prima facie requires the order of removal. Greene v. Henkel, \n183 \nU.S. 249, 262\n, 22 S. Ct. 218; Benson v. Henkel, \n198 U.S. 1\n, 10-12, 25 S.Ct. 569; Hyde v. Shine, \n199 \nU.S. 62, 84\n, 25 S.Ct. 760; Haas v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 481\n, 30 S.Ct. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112. Evidence is required to support the allegations of the complaint.\n It may not with perfect accuracy be said, as in some removal decisions it has been said or implied, that the indictment is evidence of the facts that it alleges. But it fulfills the constitutional requirement ( Amendment 5), establishes probable cause (Amendment 4), and is itself authority to bring the accused to trial. In the absence of evidence requiring a finding that there is no ground for the prosecution, the government is entitled to an order for \n\n[295 U.S. 396, 401]\n\u00a0\n removal. Beavers v. Haubert, \n198 \nU.S. 77, 90\n, 25 S.Ct. 573; Price v. Henkel, \n216 \nU.S. 488, 493\n, 30 S.Ct. 257. Cf. South Carolina v. Bailey, \n289 \nU.S. 412, 420\n, 53 S.Ct. 667. The indictment is not conclusive, for under section 1014 the petitioner has the right to introduce evidence in opposition to the showing made against him. Tinsley v. Treat, supra, \n205 \nU.S. 20, 32\n, 27 S.Ct. 430. But as the order of removal adjudges nothing affecting the merits of the case and amounts to no more than a finding that the accused may be brought to trial, the Commissioner is without power to rule on disputed questions of law whether they relate to the sufficiency of the indictment or the validity of the statute on which the charge is based. Henry v. Henkel, \n235 \nU.S. 219, 229\n, 35 S.Ct. 54; Stallings v. Splain, \n253 \nU.S. 339, 344\n, 345 S., 40 S.Ct. 537; Morse v. United States, \n267 \nU.S. 80, 83\n, 45 S.Ct. 209. And for like reasons he may not decide controverted or doubtful issues of fact. Rodman v. Pothier, \n264 \nU.S. 399, 402\n, 44 S.Ct. 360. In view of the delays and obstructions that it is possible for persons accused to obtain and interpose by misuse of the right to be heard before removal (cf. Salinger v. Loisel, \n265 \nU.S. 224, 238\n, 44 S.Ct. 519), section 1014 is to be construed quite favorably to the government's applications (Benson v. Henkel, supra, \n198 \nU.S. 1, 15\n, 25 S.Ct. 569; Haas v. Henkel, supra, \n216 \nU.S. 462, 475\n, 30 S.Ct. 249, 17 Ann. Cas. 1112).\n The application for the writ of habeas corpus alleges that the evidence adduced by petitioner overwhelmingly established his innocence, completely destroyed the presumption of probable cause emanating from the indictment, and established the lack of probable cause to believe him guilty. By reference, it includes a transcript of the evidence and asserts that the finding and order of the Commissioner are contrary to law. Respondent's return puts in issue these allegations. The question so raised is whether petitioner is unlawfully deprived of his liberty. He was entitled to introduce evidence to prove the absence of probable cause and to have the Commis- \n\n[295 U.S. 396, 402]\n\u00a0\n sioner judicially to consider it. We have held that exclusion of competent evidence is a denial of right given by section 1014. Tinsley v. Treat, supra. Equally repugnant to the statute is refusal to consider evidence in favor of the accused. Arbitrary or capricious appraisal of evidence or disregard of facts indubitably established is in legal effect failure to consider, the equivalent of the exclusion that we have condemned, and denial of the right to be heard before removal.\n The lower courts were successively called on to decide on the merits of petitioner's claim. A memorandum opinion of the District Court shows that it considered the evidence in detail and found that the Commissioner's decision would have been amply justified even if he had not admitted the impeaching testimony introduced by the government in rebuttal. The Circuit Court of Appeals following its earlier decision, United States ex rel. Scharlon v. Pulver, 54 F.(2d) 261, declined to examine the evidence upon the ground that 'our review of his (the commissioner's) decision ends as soon as we are assured that he has honestly considered all the evidence presented to him. No matter how flagrantly mistaken he may be in the result, a court will go no further.' We disapprove that declaration. By the appeal that court was called on to examine the evidence and to decide whether it was sufficient to require a finding that there was no substantial ground for bringing the petitioner to trial on any charge specified in the indictment.\n We find that the evidence fails by far to measure up to that standard, and approve the decision of the District Court.

SPAULDING(1935)\nNo. 161\nArgued: November 15, 1934Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n\n\n[293 U.S. 498, 499]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Will G. Beardslee, of Washington, D.C., for the United States.\n Mr. Warren E. Miller, of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n In September, 1917, respondent, then 24 years old, enlisted in the United States Navy. He was successively commissioned ensign and lieutenant and became an air pilot. He was honorably discharged June 30, 1922. While in the service he obtained a policy of war risk insurance which lapsed November 30, 1923. He brought this suit March 15, 1932, in the federal District Court for Northern Florida to recover the amounts payable under \n\n[293 U.S. 498, 500]\n\u00a0\n the policy for total permanent disability alleged to have resulted from kidney disease and injuries received in an airplane crash occurring while the policy was in force. At the close of all the evidence, the United States moved for a directed verdict. The motion was denied, the jury found for respondent, and the court gave him judgment which was affirmed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 68 F.(2d) 656.\n The policy covers total permanent disability, whatever its cause, occurring before the lapse. The evidence was not confined to that period, for respondent's subsequent condition is pertinent to the extent that it tends to show whether he became totally and permanently disabled before the lapse. Lumbra v. United States, \n290 \nU.S. 551, 560\n, 54 S.Ct. 272. The United States maintains that the evidence was not sufficient to sustain the verdict. And that is the sole question presented for our consideration.\n The material substance of the evidence follows.\n In the latter part of 1919, respondent first had kidney trouble. According to the naval medical records, he was sick four times from what was finally diagnosed as a kidney stone. These illnesses were in June and September, 1920, and in January and August, 1921; their duration in all was about six weeks; while they lasted urinalyses sometimes disclosed albumin, casts, and corpuscles in varying quantities. Some time after the last attack, the stone was removed. November 14, 1921, respondent's upper and lower jaws were fractured in the airplane crash. He was in the naval hospital until February, 1922. He testified that he continuously had kidney trouble and severe pains in the head and back. When discharged, the only defect noted was that his teeth did not occlude properly. Due to that, he had gastritis February 28. Urinalysis then disclosed very few blood cells, occasional pus cells, but no albumin or casts. The gastritis disappeared. In May following his teeth were treated for the malocclu- \n\n[293 U.S. 498, 501]\n\u00a0\n sion. Respondent testified that he was then suffering kidney pains and that his left antrum was much swollen. A civilian, Dr. Quina, treated the antrum.\n May 31, respondent went again to the hospital. He then stated that two years earlier he had suffered acute illness following exposure in wet and cold, had not felt well since, and for the last month had been treated for kidney trouble. The diagnosis then made was 'nephritis chronic parenchymatous.' June 26, 1922, he was examined for discharge from the service. The medical officers noted their opinion that the nephritis was due to toxic materials absorbed from the antrum and that infection of the antrum resulted from injuries sustained in the airplane crash. He was found 'not physically qualified for active duty in the Navy by reason of the following physical defects which are of a more or less temporary nature: Infection of left antrum and malocclusion of the teeth.' And on that day he certified that he had the following disabilities entitling him to compensation under the War Risk Insurance Act (40 Stat. 398): Infection of the left antrum, malocclusion of the teeth, stomach trouble, and heart murmur. He made no claim that he had become totally and permanently disabled or that he was entitled to the amounts that under the policy are payable therefor.\n Respondent did nothing from the time he was discharged until February, 1923. He testified that during that period he was ill and under the care of doctors who forbade work. When he finally did work, it was against their orders and to support his family. From February, 1923, until April, 1924, he took vocational training. During that time his policy lapsed. He quit before completion of the course because, as he says, he was no better and thought outdoor work would be good for him. Then for more than a year he was employed as an automobile salesman. Much riding over rough roads aggravated his condition and prevented continuous work. He was paid \n\n[293 U.S. 498, 502]\n\u00a0\n a salary of $125 per month for a part of the time and commissions for the remainder.\n Commencing about September 1, 1925, respondent for seven months was employed as superintendent of construction of roads and ditches at a salary of $300 per month. He next worked for an electric company during four years and two months until September, 1930. For the first five or six months he was a salesman and earned commissions amounting to about $500. He then became superintendent of electrical work at a salary of $200 per month. Except for six or seven weeks in another year and three months in 1930, he received salary for every month, though not able to work full time. He was discharged because he could not put in full time. Two fellow employees testified that he was ill and at home three or four days a month. That was his last employment.\n An official record put in evidence by him shows that in July, 1924, he was given a special physical examination to test his qualifications for flying. It indicates recovery from the airplane crash, heart and blood pressure normal, no recurrence of kidney trouble. As a result of the examination, he was officially certified to have no defects and to be qualified for flying duty as a pilot.\n Commencing in 1923, while the policy was still in force respondent was treated by Dr. Quina, to whom he went daily during the first year and three or four times weekly during the next two. His condition did not improve, and, because of inability to pay the doctor, he discontinued. For a few years prior to the trial he has been going to doctors for sinus treatment as often as every other day. October 31, 1928, the Veterans' Bureau examined him, apparently in connection with his application to reinstate his insurance. He was classified as a poor risk: 'This man has a chronic nephritis. Hypertension. Urine shows occasional hyaline casts and a few red blood cells.' In March, 1930, he entered a veterans' hospital at Washing- \n\n[293 U.S. 498, 503]\n\u00a0\n ton, where he remained about six weeks. The diagnoses were albuminaria, nephritis diffuse mild, moderate hypertension. It was found that no hospitalization was necessary. Dr. Fowler, a consultant in urology, found the right kidney out of position and suggested surgery. June 1, 1931, respondent went to a naval hospital for treatment of the infected antrum, and remained there until July 7. It was found that his blood pressure and heart were normal. He had moderate hydronephrosis of the right kidney and a kink in the upper half of the right ureter. Urinalysis was negative.\n Respondent called Dr. Quina, Dr. Bryan, and Dr. Pierpont.\n Dr. Quina had treated respondent for the antrum infection for several years after the latter's discharge from the Navy. He testified that the antrum infection was incurable and that during the period of treatment respondent had nephritis caused by the infection; that it did not improve; that respondent had impaired his health by working; and that 'in my opinion at the time I first examined him and since that time he has not been capable of continuously carrying on a substantially gainful occupation without injury to his health.' The doctor thought that under proper treatment respondent could live a long time. 'I would put him in bed and keep him there. If he engages in any work it will make him die a little bit sooner.' Although the witness did not testify to any change in respondent's condition, he said: 'If a man had mild nephritis in 1923 and in 1932 has diagnosis of mild nephritis ... his condition is much worse now than it was then because he still has a breaking down of the kidneys.'\n Dr. Bryan commenced to treat respondent in July, 1929, and at that time found chronic nephritis. He expressed the opinion that the disease existed in 1923. An examination a year before the trial indicated respondent had not improved. Absolute rest was the treatment for his con- \n\n[293 U.S. 498, 504]\n\u00a0\n dition, any work physical or mental would impair his health, and 'if he continuously engages in any kind of work he is going to limit his days on this earth. ... If a man has mild nephritis in 1923 and actually works for seven years and quits work in 1930 and then in 1932 still has a diagnosis of only mild nephritis I would say that he had injured himself, for a man with that type of disease would injury his health by doing any kind of work. By working he has made it worse; he might have recovered. I would ... say he was totally and permanently disabled. I don't know about his disability from an occupational standpoint.'\n Dr. Pierpont never treated respondent, but examined him three times shortly before the trial. He found chronic nephritis, a bad heart, and high blood pressure. On the history of the case, he expressed opinion that respondent's ailments dated back to 1922 or 1923. He said: 'I would prescribe absolute rest. ... If plaintiff engaged in work it ... would impair his health. From my examination I would say that the plaintiff is not able to continuously engage in any substantially gainful occupation without impairment to his health. ... If I had a patient who had an inception or beginning of that disease in 1923 and ... had actually worked for a period of seven years continuously and then quit work for two years and then in 1932 still had virtually the same condition he had in the beginning, I would say that the disease is progressive, that the work would make his condition worse.'\n The terms of the contract of insurance are in accordance with section 400, art. IV, Act of October 6, 1917, 40 Stat. 409, and extend only to death and total permanent disability occurring while it is in force whether during or after termination of the service of the insured. The policy does not cover total temporary disability or partial permanent disability, and does not authorize or permit any payment for physical or mental impairment that is less than 'total \n\n[293 U.S. 498, 505]\n\u00a0\n permanent disability.' Periods of total temporary disability, though likely to recur at intervals, do not constitute the disability covered by the policy, for 'permanent' means that which is continuing as contrasted with that which is 'temporary.' The fact that one has done some work after the lapse of his policy is not of itself sufficient to defeat his claim of total permanent disability. He may have worked when really unable and at the risk of endangering his health or life. It may not be assumed that occasional work for short periods by one generally disabled because of impairment of mind or body does as a matter of law negative total permanent disability. But it is plain that work done may be such as conclusively to negative total permanent disability at an earlier time. Lumbra v. United States, supra, page 558 of 290 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 292, 275, et seq.\n After considerate examination of the record, we are of opinion that the evidence and all inferences that justifiably may be drawn from it do not constitute sufficient basis for a verdict for respondent, and that therefore the trial judge should have directed the jury to find for the United States. Gunning v. Cooley, \n281 \nU.S. 90, 93\n, 50 S.Ct. 231; Stevens v. The White City, \n285 \nU.S. 195, 203\n, 204 S., 52 S.Ct. 347.\n It is shown that since a time prior to the lapse of the policy respondent had incurable infection of an antrum, malocclusion of teeth, and chronic nephritis that caused illness and impaired his physical and mental powers to such an extent that generally he was partially disabled and at times, and during periods of substantial duration, totally disabled. In 1924 he was found fit for service as an air pilot. During the larger part of more than eight years between the lapse of his policy and the commencement of this suit he was able to and actually did work and earn substantial compensation. In view of these facts, his testimony that under stress of need he worked when not able cannot be given weight, for he is not entitled to recover on the policy unless he became totally disabled \n\n[293 U.S. 498, 506]\n\u00a0\n before its lapse and thereafter remained in that condition. If not totally disabled when found fit for air service and while performing work admittedly done, total disability occurring while the policy was in force was temporary and not permanent. The fact that, notwithstanding his need of money for the support of his family and himself, he failed for nearly nine years to sue for the insurance money now claimed strongly suggests that he had not suffered total permanent disability covered by the policy. Lumbra v. United States, supra page 560 of 290 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 272, 276. And that suggestion is emphasized by the fact that in 1928 he procured examination for reinstatement of his insurance. The opinions of respondent's medical witnesses that work impaired his health and tended to shorten his life had no substantial bearing upon the question whether total disability while the policy was in force continued during the subsequent years. As against the facts directly and conclusively established, this opinion evidence furnishes no basis for opposing inferences.\n The medical opinions that respondent became totally and permanently disabled before his policy lapsed are without weight. Clearly the experts failed to give proper weight to his fitness for naval air service or to the work he performed, and misinterpreted 'total permanent disability' as used in the policy and statute authorizing the insurance. Moreover, that question is not to be resolved by opinion evidence. It was the ultimate issue to be decided by the jury upon all the evidence in obedience to the judge's instructions as to the meaning of the crucial phrase and other questions of law. The experts ought not to have been asked or allowed to state their conclusions on the whole case. Milwaukee, etc., Railway Co. v. Kellogg, \n94 U.S. 469\n, 472; Schmieder v. Barney, \n113 \nU.S. 645, 648\n, 5 S.Ct. 624; Fireman's Ins. Co. v. J. H. Mohlman Co. ( C.C.A.) 91 F. 85, 88; Mullins Lumber Co. v.

Lederer (C.C.A.) 263 F. 672, 676.\n There is nothing in the record that at all impairs the significance of the finding that in 1924 respondent was fit for service as an air pilot or of the work he performed after the lapse of the policy. These facts conclusively establish that he did not become totally and permanently disabled before his policy lapsed. Lumbra v. United States, supra; Falbo v.

STATE OF OREGON(1935)\nNo. 13\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1935\n\n\n Decree.\n This cause came on to be heard by this Court upon the exceptions of the parties to the report of the special master.\n For the purpose of carrying into effect the conclusions of the Court as stated in its opinion, dated April 1, 1935, \n295 \nU.S. 1\n, 55 S.Ct. 610, 79 L.Ed. --, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed as follows:\n\n 1. \nAt the time of the admission of the state of Oregon into the Union, February 14, 1859 (11 Stat. 383), the United States of America was the owner in fee and entitled to the possession of 81,786 acres, more or less of unsurveyed land lying within the meander line boundary as more specifically described in paragraph 13 of this decree, and divided for the purposes of this case into five divisions: (1) Lake Malheur; (2) Narrows; ( 3) Mud Lake; (4) Sand Reef; and (5) Harney Lake, and of all the surrounding region for many miles.\n\n 2. \nNo part of the 81,786 acres within the meander line boundary constituted navigable waters on February 14, 1859, and the title and interest in no part passed from the United States of America to the state of Oregon upon her admission into the Union.\n\n 3. \nThe United States of America has never in terms conveyed or otherwise disposed of any part of the area lying within the meander line boundary, except such disposition, as may have resulted (as matter of law) from its patents, grants, and listings of land bordering on the meander line boundary but not lying within it. \n\n[295 U.S. 701, 702]\n\u00a0\n 4. The state of Oregon is the owner of upland having a frontage of 159.67 chains along the meander line in subdivision B of the Narrows Division (between the bridge and Mud Lake Division). 70.52 chains of this frontage are on the north boundary and 89.15 chains on the south boundary. The frontage of the state of Oregon on subdivision B of the Narrows Division constitutes 86.85 per cent. of the total frontage of 183.85 chains in that subdivision. The state of Oregon is the owner in fee simple absolute of the bed of subdivision B of the Narrows Division extending to the center line thereof and lying opposite and adjacent to her upland frontage (including stable lands, if any, lying within this area), subject to any rights with respect to ditches and canals retained by the United States by its patents of the upland, and subject to any easement for the flowage of water through the Narrows from the Malheur Division to the Mud Lake Division.\n\n 5. \nThe United States of America has no right, title, or interest in the area known as the 'Narrows Division' (R.S.  2476 (43 USCA  931)), except the rights with respect to ditches and canals, if any, retained by its patents of adjacent uplands, and any easement for the flowage of water from the Malheur Division to the Mud Lake Division through the Narrows Division.\n\n 6. \nThe United States of America is forever enjoined from asserting any estate, right, title, or interest in or against the estates, rights, titles, and interests owned and held by the state of Oregon in the Narrows Division, as determined in paragraph 4 of this decree.\n\n 7. \nThe state of Oregon is the owner of upland having a frontage of 72. 31 chains along the meander line in Mud Lake Division, which constitutes 8. 96 per cent. of the total frontage of 806.94 chains on that division. In accordance with the findings of the special master, to which no exception is taken, it is decreed that the state of Oregon is the owner of a ratable portion of the bed of Mud Lake Division to \n\n[295 U.S. 701, 703]\n\u00a0\n the extent of 8.96 per cent. of said bed (as 72.31 chains bears to 806.94 chains), allowing for equitable considerations which may affect this ratio, subject to any rights with respect to ditches and canals retained by the United States by its patents of the uplands on Mud Lake Division, and subject to any easement for the flowage of water from the Narrows Division to the Sand Reef Division.\n\n 8. \nThe United States of America is forever enjoined from asserting any estate, right, title, or interest in or against the estates, rights, titles, and interests owned and held by the state of Oregon in the Mud Lake Division, as determined in paragraph 7 of this decree.\n\n 9. \nThe surveys, as school lands, of lots 1, 2, 3, Sec. 36, T. 26 S., R. 30 E. (north of Lake Malheur), in the Sand Reef Division; lot 4 of this Sec. 36, and lots 1, 2, 3, and 4 of Sec. 36, T. 27 S., R. 29 1\/2 E. in the Harney Lake Division, were approved subsequent to the establishment of the Lake Malheur Reservation by Executive Order No. 929, dated August 18, 1908, which appropriated these lots as a part of the Reservation, and no title or interest in them passed to the state of Oregon. Section 36, T. 26 S., R. 29 E., lying on the meander line boundary of Harney Lake, was surveyed as school lands, and the survey approved, prior to the establishment of the Lake Malheur Reservation. The state of Oregon claimed and received lieu lands elsewhere for a deficiency in this section, equivalent to the part thereof which lay within the meander line boundary, and it has no interest in the area within the meander line as an incident to its ownership of these uplands.\n 10. The state of Oregon has no right, title, or interest in or to any part of the area within the meander line boundary, including all stable lands above the water surface elevation of 4,093 feet above sea level, except as determined in paragraphs 4 and 7 of this decree.\n 11. Except as determined in paragraphs 4 and 7 of this decree, the United States of America is the owner in fee \n\n[295 U.S. 701, 704]\n\u00a0\n simple absolute, and entitled to the possession, of all the area within the meander line boundary, but not including such parts, if any, as may have been, as matter of law, transferred by the United States of America by reason of and as an incident to patents of uplands bordering on the meander line boundary. As neither the patentees nor their successors in interest (except in so far as the state of Oregon is a successor in interest of some of the patentees) are parties to this suit, no determination is now made in respect of the rights, titles, and interests, if any, acquired by the patentees in the areas within the meander line boundary.\n 12. The state of Oregon is forever enjoined from asserting any estate, right, title, or interest in or to any of the area within the meander line boundary, except the estates, rights, titles and interests determined in paragraphs 5 and 8 of this decree not to be owned by the United States.\n 13. The area within the meander line boundary comprises 81,786 acres, more or less, of unsurveyed lands in Harney county, Or., divided into five divisions, shown in Appendix 2 of the special master's report, volume 2, pages 7 to 25, inclusive, and here described by metes and bounds as follows:\nLake Malheur Division (47,670.40 acres, more or less):\n Begin at a point on the Neal survey line of October, 1895, N. 88 W. 54.00 chs. from the N.E. corner of lot 9, Sec. 25, T. 26 S., R. 30 E., W.M .

STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA(1935)\nNo. 17\nArgued: May 2, 1935Decided: May 20, 1935\n\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 463, 465]\n\u00a0\n Mr. Homer A. Holt, of Charleston, W. Va., for defendant State of West Virginia.\n Messrs. Edward W. Knight and Robert S. Spilman, both of Charleston, W. Va., for defendants Electro Metallurgical Co. and others.\n\n\n[295 U.S. 463, 467]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice STONE delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is an original suit in equity, brought by the United States, in which relief by injunction is sought against the defendants, the state of West Virginia, Union Carbide & Carbon Corporation, a New York corporation, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Electro Metallurgical Company and New- Kanawha Power Company, West Virginia corporations. The questions now presented are raised by separate motions, one by the state of West Virginia, the other by the corporate defendants, to dismiss the bill of complaint on the grounds that it does not state any justicable controversy between the United States and the state of West Virginia, and that it appears upon the face of the bill of complaint that this Court has no original jurisdiction of the suit against the defendants or any of them.\n The bill of complaint, filed January 14, 1935, contains allegations which so far as now relevant, may be detailed as follows: The New river flows northwesterly across the state of West Virginia and near the center of the state joins the Gauley river to form the Kanawha river, which flows thence to the state boundary and into the Ohio river. The New and Kanawha rivers are one continuous interstate stream, which throughout its course constitutes navigable waters of the United States. There are many locations for damsites on the rivers; four dams have been constructed on the New river at points in Virginia and West Virginia, and a fifth at Hawks Nest, W. Va., upon which the present litigation centers, \n\n[295 U.S. 463, 468]\n\u00a0\n is now approaching completion. The United States has constructed ten dams on the Kanawha river for the purpose of improving navigation, and is now engaged in construction work on two additional dams on the Kanawha river immediately below the Hawks Nest project, and has in contemplation the construction of a large reservoir at Bluestone, W. Va., on the New river above the Hawks Nest project, for purposes of flood control, production of power, and in aid of navigation. It is alleged that the New and Kanawha rivers throughout West Virginia constitute a continuous stream which was in its natural condition and still is susceptible of navigation, and is a highway capable of being improved and used for purposes of interstate and foreign commerce; that any obstructions to its navigability will be removed or overcome by improvements initiated by the United States and now in operation or in the course of construction; that the Hawks Nest project will seriously obstruct navigation in the New and Kanawha rivers, by producing fluctuations in the flow of New river; and that, upon the filing by New-Kanawha Power Company of a declaration of intention to construct the dam, pursuant to section 23 of the Federal Water Power Act, chapter 285, 41 Stat. 1063, 1075,  23, 30, 16 U.S.C.  791, 817 (16 USCA  791, 817), the Federal Power Commission determined that the proposed Hawks Nest dam would affect the interests of interstate commerce, and that under the act the dam could not lawfully be built without a license from the Commission.\n It is further alleged that the defendant New-Kanawha Power Company has obtained from the Public Service Commission of West Virginia a license or permit to construct the dam at Hawks Nest for power purposes. This permit was later transferred to the defendant Electro Metallurgical Company; and the corporate defendants, acting under the state license, are now engaged in the construction of the dam. It is alleged that its construc- \n\n[295 U.S. 463, 469]\n\u00a0\n tion is in violation of the Act of Congress of March 3, 1899, c. 425,  9, 30 Stat. 1121, 1151, 33 U.S.C.  401 (33 USCA  401), and the Federal Water Power Act, in that the plans for the project have not received the consent of Congress or the approval of the Chief of Engineers of the United States Army and the Secretary of War, and the defendants have received no license for the project from the Federal Power Commission.\n The allegations with respect to the state of West Virginia are that the state challenges and denies the claim of the United States that the New river is a navigable stream; that the state asserts a right superior to that of the United States to license the use of the New and Kanawha rivers for the production and sale of hydroelectric power, and denies the right of the Federal Power Commission to require a license for the construction and operation of the Hawks Nest project by the corporate defendants; and that the state asserts that, in so far as the Federal Water Power Act purports to confer upon the Federal Power Commission authority to license the project or to control the use of the river by the corporate defendants, the act is an invasion of the sovereign rights of the state and a violation of the Constitution of the United States. The bill further elaborates, in great detail and particularity, but does not enlarge, these basic allegations.\n It prays an injunction restraining the corporate defendants from constructing or operating the Hawks Nest project without a license from the Federal Power Commission. It also asks an adjudication that the New river is navigable waters of the United States and that the United States has the right to construct and operate, and to license others to construct and operate, dams and connected hydroelectric plants on the New and Kanawha rivers. We are asked to declare that any right of the state of West Virginia to license the construction and operation of dams upon the rivers, or to sell or to license \n\n[295 U.S. 463, 470]\n\u00a0\n others to sell power generated at such dams, is subject to the rights of the United States, and to enjoin the state from asserting any right, title, or interest in any dam, or hydroelectric plant in connection with it, or in the production and sale of hydroelectric power on the New and Kanawha rivers, superior or adverse to that of the United States, and from in any manner disturbing or interfering with the possession, use, and enjoyment of such right by the United States.\n It can no longer be doubted that the original jurisdiction given to this Court by section 2, art. 3 of the Constitution, in cases 'in which a state shall be a party,' includes cases brought by the United States against a state. United States v. Texas, \n143 \nU.S. 621\n, 12 S.Ct. 488; United States v. Michigan, \n190 \nU.S. 379, 396\n, 23 S.Ct. 742; Oklahoma v. Texas, \n252 \nU.S. 372\n, 40 S.Ct. 353; Id., \n258 \nU.S. 574, 581\n, 42 S.Ct. 406; United States v. State of Minnesota, \n270 \nU.S. 181, 195\n, 46 S.Ct. 298; United States v. State of Utah, \n283 \nU.S. 64\n, 51 S.Ct. 438; compare Florida v. Georgia, 17 How. 478, 494; United States v. North Carolina, \n136 \nU.S. 211\n, 10 S.Ct. 920. But the original jurisdiction thus conferred is only of those cases within the judicial power of the United States which, under the first clause of section 2, art. 3 of the Constitution, extends 'to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and ... to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party ...' Com. of Massachusetts v. Mellon, \n262 U.S. 447\n, 480-485, 43 S.Ct. 597; see State of Wisconsin v. Pelican Insurance Co., \n127 \nU.S. 265, 289\n, 8 S.Ct. 1370. Our original jurisdiction does not include suits of the United States against persons or corporations alone (see In re Barry, 2 How. 65; Louisiana v. Texas, \n176 \nU.S. 1, 16\n, 20 S.Ct. 251; Baltimore & O.R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n215 \nU.S. 216, 224\n, 30 S.Ct. 86; State of Oklahoma v. Texas, \n258 \nU.S. 574, 581\n, 42 S.Ct. 406), nor is it enough to sustain the jurisdiction in such a case that a state has been made a party defendant. The bill of complaint must also present a \n\n[295 U.S. 463, 471]\n\u00a0\n 'case' or 'controversy' to which the state is a party, and which is within the judicial power granted by the judiciary article of the Constitution.\n Hence we pass directly to the question whether the bill of complaint presents a case or controversy between the United States and the state of West Virginia within the judicial power. The answer is unaffected by the fact, set forth in the bill of complaint, that the state, on its application to intervene in a suit, since discontinued, brought by the United States, in the District Court for West Virginia to restrain the corporate defendants from constructing the dam, asserted its interest as a state in the development of power under state license at the Hawks Nest dam, particularly in the license fees and taxes to be derived from the project. The details of the attempted intervention at most serve only to support the allegations of the bill, that the state has asserted the right, through a license of the Hawks Nest project, to control the use of the rivers for power purposes.\n At the outset, it should be noted that the bill in the present suit neither asks the protection nor alleges the invasion of any property right. It asserts no title in the United States to the bed of the stream, which might afford a basis for a suit to remove a could on title, as in United States v. State of Utah, supra, and United States v. State of Oregon, \n295 \nU.S. 1\n, 55 S.Ct. 610, 79 L.Ed. --, decided April 1, 1935. It alleges that the United States has built dams on the Kanawha river below the Hawks Nest project, and has acquired lands in pursuance of its plans for flood control, improvement of navigation, and the generation and sale of hydroelectric power on both rivers. But there is no allegation of any interference by the state, actual or threatened, with any of the land or property thus acquired.\n The only right or interest asserted in behalf of the United States is its authority under the Constitution to \n\n[295 U.S. 463, 472]\n\u00a0\n control navigable waters, and particularly the right to exercise that authority through the Federal Power Commission. Since that authority is predicated upon the single fact, fully alleged in the bill and admitted by the motions to dismiss, that the rivers are navigable waters of the United States, the power of the United States to control navigation, and to prevent interference with it, by the construction of a dam except in conformity to the statutes of the United States, must be taken to be conceded. See State of New Jersey v. Sargent, \n269 \nU.S. 328, 337\n, 46 S.Ct. 122. But the bill alleges no act or threat of interference by the state with the navigable capacity of the rivers, or with the exercise of the authority claimed by the United States or in behalf of the Federal Power Commission. It alleges only that the state has assented to the construction of the dam by its formal permit, under which the corporate defendants are acting. There is no allegation that the state is participating or aiding in any way in the construction of the dam or in any interference with navigation; or that it is exercising any control over the corporate defendants in the construction of the dam; or that it has directed the construction of the dam in an unlawful manner, or without a license from the Federal Power Commission; or has issued any permit which is incompatible with the Federal Water Power Act; or, indeed, that the state proposes to grant other licenses, or to take any other action in the future.\n Section 28 of the Water Power Act of West Virginia, chapter 17 of the Acts of 1915, which gives to the state Public Service Commission its authority, provides that: 'Nothing contained in this act shall be construed to interfere with the exercise of jurisdiction by the government of the United States over navigable streams.' The bill seeks an injunction, against the corporate defendants, restraining only the construction of the dam without a \n\n[295 U.S. 463, 473]\n\u00a0\n license from the Federal Power Commission. But section 9(b) of the Federal Water Power Act (16 USCA  802(b) requires that every applicant for a license shall present 'satisfactory evidence that the applicant has complied with the requirements of the laws of the State or States within which the proposed project is to be located with respect to bed and banks and to the appropriation, diversion, and use of water for power purposes and with respect to the right to engage in the business of developing, transmitting, and distributing power. ...' The mere grant of the state license, which the Federal Water Power Act makes prerequisite to the application for the federal license, cannot be said to involve any infringement of the federal authority. It does not appear that the state has done more.\n We any assume, for present purposes, that the United States as sovereign has a sufficient interest in the maintenance of its control over navigable waters, and in the enforcement of the Federal Water Power Act, to enable it to maintain a suit in equity to restrain threatened unlawful invasions of its authority (see State of Kansas v. Colorado, \n185 \nU.S. 125\n, 22 S.Ct. 552; State of Georgia v. Tennessee Copper Co., \n206 \nU.S. 230, 237\n, 27 S.Ct. 618, 11 Ann.Cas. 488; Marshall Dental Manufacturing Co. v. State of Iowa, \n226 \nU.S. 460, 462\n, 33 S.Ct. 168; State of Missouri v. Holland, \n252 \nU.S. 416, 431\n, 40 S.Ct. 382, 11 A.L.R. 984; see Hudson County Water Co. v. McCarter, \n209 \nU.S. 349, 355\n, 28 S.Ct. 529, 14 Ann.Cas. 560), and that a cause of action within the jurisdiction of a federal District Court is stated against the corporate defendants who are alleged to be engaged in building an obstruction in navigable waters of the United States.\n But there is presented here, as respects the state, no case of an actual or threatened interference with the authority of the United States. At most, the bill states a difference of opinion between the officials of the two governments, whether the rivers are navigable and, consequently, whether there is power and authority in the \n\n[295 U.S. 463, 474]\n\u00a0\n federal government to control their navigation, and particularly to prevent or control the construction of the Hawks Nest dam, and hence whether a license of the Federal Power Commission is prerequisite to its construction. There is no support for the contention that the judicial power extends to the adjudication of such differences of opinion. Only when they become the subject of controversy in the constitutional sense are they susceptible of judicial determination. See Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, \n288 \nU.S. 249, 259\n, 53 S.Ct. 345, 87 A.L.R. 1191. Until the right asserted is threatened with invasion by acts of the state, which serve both to define the controversy and to establish its existence in the judicial sense, there is no question presented which is justiciable by a federal court. See Fairchild v. Hughes, \n258 \nU.S. 126, 129\n, 130 S., 42 S.Ct. 274; State ex rel. Texas v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n258 \nU.S. 158, 162\n, 42 S.Ct. 261; Com. of Massachusetts v. Mellon, supra, \n262 U.S. 447\n, 483-485, 43 S. Ct. 597; State of New Jersey v. Sargent, supra, \n269 \nU.S. 328, 339\n, 340 S., 46 S.Ct. 122.\n General allegations that the state challenges the claim of the United States that the rivers are navigable, and asserts a right superior to that of the United States to license their use for power production, raise an issue too vague and ill-defined to admit of judicial determination. They afford no basis for an injunction perpetually restraining the state from asserting any interest superior or adverse to that of the United States in any dam on the rivers, or in hydroelectric plants in connection with them, or int he production and sale of hydroelectric power. The bill fails to disclose any existing controversy within the range of judicial power. See State of New Jersey v. Sargent, supra, \n269 \nU.S. 328, 339\n, 340 S., 46 S.Ct. 122.\n The government places its chief reliance upon the decision in United States v. State of Utah, supra, in which this Court took original jurisdiction of a suit, brought by the United States against the state, to quiet title to the bed of the \n\n[295 U.S. 463, 475]\n\u00a0\n Colorado river. But the issue presented by adverse claims of title to identified land is a case or controversy traditionally within the jurisdiction of courts of equity. Such an issue does not want in definition. The public assertion of the adverse claim by a defendant out of possession is itself an invasion of the property interest asserted by the plaintiff, against which equity alone can afford protection. See United States v. Oregon, supra. A different issue, in point of definition of threatened injury and imminence of the controversy, is presented by rival claims of sovereign power made by the national and a state government. The sovereign rights of the United States to control navigation are not invaded or even threatened by mere assertions. It is, in this respect, in a position different from that of a property owner, who because of the adverse claims to ownership can neither sell his property nor be assured of continued possession. The control of navigation by the United States may be threatened by the imminent construction of the dam, but not by permission to construct it.\n No effort is made by the government to sustain the bill under the Declaratory Judgment Act of June 14, 1934, c. 512, 48 Stat. 955 (28 USCA  400). It is enough that that act is applicable only 'in cases of actual controversy.' It does not purport to alter the character of the controversies which are the subject of the judicial power under the Constitution. See Nashville, Chattanooga & St. Louis R. Co. v. Wallace, supra.\n Since there is no justiciable controversy between the United States and the state of West Virginia, the cause is not within the original jurisdiction of this Court, and must be dismissed.\n It is so ordered.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS is of opinion that the United States should be granted leave to amend its bill. \n\n\n\n","195":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVAN WART v. COMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE(1935)\nNo. 95\nArgued: November 13, 1934Decided: April 29, 1935\n\n\n\n Mr. Frederick R. Gibbs, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner. \n\n[295 U.S. 112, 113]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General and Mr. Angus D. MacLean, Asst. Sol. Gen., of Washington, D.C., for respondent.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The sole question for determination is whether an attorney's fee paid by the guardian for conducting litiga- \n\n[295 U.S. 112, 114]\n\u00a0\n tion to secure income for his ward was a business expense within section 214(a)(1), Revenue Act 1924 (26 USCA  955(a)(1) and therefore deductible from the minor's gross income. The facts, as stated by the court below (C. C.A.) 69 F.(2d) 299, were these:\n'Catherine L. Van Wart, a minor, was the beneficiary of a trust created by the will of her grandfather, Jenkins Jones, deceased. Dr. Roy M. Van Wart, Catherine's father, with whom she resided in Orleans parish, La., after being confirmed by order of the district court for that parish in accordance with the laws of Louisiana as her natural tutor or guardian, and after duly qualifying as such, demanded of the trustees under the will that they pay over to him the accrued income of the trust created in favor of his ward. The trustees, claiming, among other things, the right to keep possession of the accumulations of such income until Catherine should become of age, when they conceded she would be entitled to the corpus as well as all accumulated income, declined to comply with that demand. Thereupon suit was brought in the name of the minor, by her father as next friend, in the federal court for the district in West Virginia in which the testator was residing at the time of his death, against the trustees to compel distribution of the income involved in accordance with the guardian's previous demand. That suit finally was decided in favor of the plaintiff, it being held that the guardian was entitled to receive from the trustees his ward's accumulated income and future income as it annually accrued. Van Wart v. Jones (C.C.A.) 295 F. 287. Accordingly, in 1924 the trustees paid over to Dr. Van Wart as guardian the accumulated income of $160,000 and current income of $80,000; and Dr. Van Wart, acting as guardian and by authority of the court of his appointment, paid out of the funds so received by him a fee of $30,000 to the attorneys who brought the suit for their services in the litigation. In the income tax return for 1924, which was \n\n[295 U.S. 112, 115]\n\u00a0\n filed by the guardian on behalf of his ward, a deduction of the attorneys' fee was claimed.'\n\n Pertinent provisions of the Revenue Act of 1924 are in the margin. \n*\n\u00a0\n\n The Board of Tax Appeals held the attorney's fee was deductible as an ordinary and necessary expense in carrying on business. Section 214(a)(1), 26 USCA  955(a)(1). The Commissioner claimed it was personal expense of the minor taxpayer, excluded from deduction by section 215(a)(1), 26 USCA  956(a)(1), and the court below upheld this view. It declined to follow Commissioner v. Wurts-Dundas, Circuit Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, 54 F.(2d) 515. Because of this conflict the cause is here.\n We agree with the conclusion that the ward, not the guardian, was the taxpayer. The return was filed by him in her behalf; the taxable income was hers, not his. The \n\n[295 U.S. 112, 116]\n\u00a0\n attorney's fee arose out of litigation conducted in the name of the ward. It was paid for her benefit out of her income.\n In freuler v. Helvering, \n291 \nU.S. 35, 44\n, 54 S.Ct. 308, 311, we said: 'The whole of a minor's income received by his guardian is taxable to the minor irrespective of its accumulation in the guardian's hands, distribution to the minor or payment for his support or education . ... Either the minor or his guardian must make the return, but in either case it embraces all the income and is the minor's individual return, not that of the guardian or the trust.'\n The ward was not engaged in any business. So far as appears, the same thing is true of the guardian. See Kornhauser v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 145\n, 48 S.Ct. 219; Commissioner v. Field (C.C.A.) 42 F.(2d) 820; Hutchings v.

Snow, \n294 \nU.S. 1\n, 55 S.Ct. 279, decided this day, certiorari was granted, \n293 \nU.S. 537\n, 55 S.Ct. 78, 79 L.Ed. --, to review a decree of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, 70 F.(2d) 457, which affirmed the decree of the District Court, and held valid and infringed the first claim of the Smith patent, No. 1, 262,860, of April 16, 1918, for an improved apparatus and method for the incubation of eggs.\n The issues here, as in the Snow Case, are the scope of claim 1 and its infringement as righty construed. For reasons stated at length in the opinion in the Snow Case, our decision as to the scope of the claim is the same as in that case. Petitioner argues that the claim, if thus broadly construed, is invalid, as an attempt to patent the function performed by the petitioner's incubator. See Risdon Iron & Locomotive Works v. Medart, \n158 \nU.S. 68, 77\n, 15 S.Ct. 745. It is said also that the function of the machine involves merely the application of the natural law that heat units flow from warm to cooler objects placed in proximity. But the function which a machine performs, here the hatching of eggs, is to be distinguished from the means by which that performance is secured. It is true that Smith made use of the difference in temperature of \n\n[294 U.S. 20, 22]\n\u00a0\n eggs in different stages of incubation, and the flow of heat units from one to the other, in achieving the desired result. He did this by arrangement of the eggs in staged incubation and applying to them a current of heated air under the conditions specified in claim 1. By the use of materials in a particular manner, he secured the performance of the function by a means which had never occurred in nature and had not been anticipated by the prior art; this is a patentable method or process. Corning v. Burden, 15 How. 252, 267, 268; Risdon Iron & Locomotive Works v. Medart, supra, page 77 of 158 U.S., 15 S.Ct. 745; Cochrane v. Deener, \n94 U.S. 780\n, 788. A method, which may be patented irrespective of the particular form of the mechanism which may be availed of for carrying it into operation, is not to be rejected as 'functional' merely because the specifications show a machine capable of using it. Expanded Metal Co. v. Bradford, \n214 U.S. 366\n, 382-386, 29 S.Ct. 652; Cochrane v. Deener, supra, 787, 788 of 94 U.S.. Cf. Holland Furniture Co. v. Perkins Glue Co., \n277 \nU.S. 245, 255\n, 256 S., 48 S.Ct. 474.\n Petitioner's incubator differs only in unimportant mechanical details from the infringing machine in the Snow case. In it the eggs are set in staged incubation, at different levels, but in no particular order. They are subjected to circulation of heated air, set in motion by fans, which carries heat units from the warmer to the cooler eggs and maintains the air throughout the chamber at substantially uniform temperature. There is a fresh air intake behind the fans and openings in the ceiling for the exit of foul air. There is no central corridor; the tiers of egg trays being placed in or near the center of the chamber. There are no curtains or similar means of guiding the air currents set in motion by the fans. Two fans are placed on the side wall at the back of the chamber. They turn continuously, and are so constructed and operated as to propel currents of air, which proceed along the sides and the ceiling and floor of the chamber to the front wall, where \n\n[294 U.S. 20, 23]\n\u00a0\n they are deflected in the direction of the fans and there 'drawn' toward them through the central part of the chamber. Less than 1 per cent. of the air passes out through the foul air exits in the course of making the described circuits, so that there is circulation and recirculation of the air within the chamber. The evidence supports the finding of the special master and of the two courts below that the currents of air set in motion by the fans flow continuously along defined paths.\n The petitioner's machine thus employs every essential of the patented method as it is defined by claim 1. Petitioner does not avoid infringement of respondent's method patent merely by employing it in a machine of different structure than respondent's, whether more or less efficiently. Winans v.

PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION(1935)\nNo. 212\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n Commission \n294 U.S. 63\n (1935) ]\n\n\n[294 U.S. 63, 65]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Edmond W. Hebel, of Indianapolis, Ind., Harry O. Bentley, of Lima, Ohio, and Charles C. Marshall, of Columbus, Ohio, for appellant.\n Messrs. John W. Bricker and Donald C. Power, both of Columbus, Ohio, for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The appellant, West Ohio Gas Company, supplies gas to the inhabitants of the city of Lima, Ohio, and to neighboring communities, part of what it sells being artificial gas manufactured by itself and part natural gas bought from another company which is wholly independent.\n On March 19, 1928, the municipal authorities of the city of Lima passed an ordinance, effective April 19, prescribing the maximum price to be charged for gas to consumers within the city during a period of five years. The rates were to be as follows: For the first 1,000 cubic feet of gas, 90 cents per month; for the next 3,000 cubic \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 66]\n\u00a0\n feet per month, 80 cents per m.c.f.; for the next 6,000, 75 cents per m.c. f.; and for all over 10,000 per month, 55 cents per m.c.f. This was  sharp reduction of the rates previously charged, which were $1.25 for the first 400 cubic feet; $1.05 for the next 9,600 cubic feet; $1 for the next 15,000; and for all over 25,000, 75 cents per m.c.f.\n In adherence to the Ohio statutes (Ohio General Code,  614-44 et seq .), the company filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, protesting against the ordinance, praying that the commission fix a fair and reasonable schedule, electing, as it might, to charge in the meantime the rates previously in force, and giving bond for the return of the excess, if any. The hearings before the commission began in July, 1928, and ended in July, 1932. While the proceeding was pending, there was a final order of valuation, made in January, 1932, whereby the value of the property in Lima, used and useful for the business, was fixed at $1,901, 696.26 as of March 31, 1928, approximately the date of the adoption of the ordinance. There being no appeal from that order within the time prescribed by law, it became binding on the company, as well as on the commission, though the valuation was less than the company had urged. 128 Ohio St. 301, 311, 191 N.E. 105. The rate base being thus established, what was next to be ascertained was the amount of the operating expenses as compared with the gross income, after which a conclusion could be drawn as to the rates that would be necessary for a fair return on the investment. An order entered by the commission on March 10, 1933, adjudged the rates under the ordinance to be insufficient and unjust. It substituted rates averaging about 13 1\/2 per cent. less than those that the company had been charging: For 400 cubic feet or less per month, $1; for the next 9,600, 95 cents per m.c.f.; for anything in excess of 10,000 cubic feet per month, 75 \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 67]\n\u00a0\n cents per m.c.f., with penalties to be charged if payment was delayed. The rates so fixed were to be retroactive as of the effective date of the ordinance, April 19, 1928, from which time they were to remain in force for a term of five years, and the difference between their yield and the amount collected by the company was to be refunded to consumers. A motion for a rehearing having been denied, the company filed a petition in error with the Supreme Court of Ohio, invoking the protection of the Fourteenth Amendment. The order of the commission was affirmed (128 Ohio St. 301, 191 N.E. 105), and the case is here upon appeal.\n The commission made its order, as it has informed us by an amended opinion, in the belief that the new rates would yield a return of 6.65 per cent. on the value of the property included in the base. Its estimate was wide of the mark as a result of mathematical errors, and this on the assumption that its rulings as to the items of operating expenses to be allowed or disallowed were correct in fact and law. Even on that assumption, the average net income during the four years of the ordinance period for which figures were available was $109,414, which upon a rate base of $1,901,696 is equivalent to an average return of about 5.75 per cent. This is now admitted by counsel for the commission, and must be accepted as a datum. What is still to be determined is whether the rate of return has been further overestimated to the point of confiscation through error in the rejection of charges upon income.\n\n 1. \nThe company made claim to an allowance for 'unaccounted for gas,' which is gas lost as a result of leakage, condensation, expansion, or contraction. There is no dispute that a certain loss through these causes is unavoidable, no matter how carefully the business is conducted. Cf. Consolidated Gas Co. v. Newton (D.C.) 267 F. 231, 244; Brooklyn Union Gas Co. v. Prendergast (D.C.) 7 F.(2d) 628, 652, 671. The company, basing its claim upon its \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 68]\n\u00a0\n proved experience, reported the average loss as 9 per cent. per annum. The commission fixed the allowance at 7 per cent., thereby reducing the operating expenses by $3,800 a year. In making this reduction, it did not deny that the loss had been suffered to the extent stated by the company. The presumption of correctness that gives aid in controversies of this order to the books of public service corporations (Consolidated Gas Co. v. Newton, supra, at page 242 of 267 F.; Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., \n258 \nU.S. 165, 176\n, 42 S.Ct. 264) was confirmed in this instance by what amounts to a finding of regularity. Accepting the loss as proved, the commission refused to allow it for more than 7 per cent. upon the ground that with proper care of the system the loss would have been less. A public utility will not be permitted to include negligent or wasteful losses among its operating charges. The waste or negligence, however, must be established by evidence of one kind or another, either direct or circumstantial. In all the pages of this record, there is neither a word nor a circumstance to charge the management with fault. Cf. Ohio Utilities Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, \n267 \nU.S. 359, 363\n, 45 S.Ct. 259. There is not even the shadow of a warning to the company that fault was imputed and that it must give evidence of care. Without anything to suggest that there was such an issue in the case, the commission struck off 2 per cent.: it might with as much reason have struck off 4 or 6. This was wholly arbitrary. Ohio Utilities Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, supra.\n Under the statutes of Ohio no provision is made for a review of the order of the commission by a separate or independent suit. The sole method of review is by petition in error to the Ohio Supreme Court, which considers both the law and the facts. Dayton P. & L. Co. v. P.U. Commission of Ohio, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 302\n, 54 S.Ct. 647; Hocking Valley Ry. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, 100 Ohio St. 321, 326, 327, 126 N.E. 397. To make such review adequate \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 69]\n\u00a0\n the record must exhibit in some way the facts relied upon by the court to repel unimpeached evidence submitted for the company. If that were not so, a complainant would be helpless, for the inference would always be possible that the court and the commission had drawn upon undisclosed sources of information unavailable to others. A hearing is not judicial, at least in any adequate sense, unless the evidence can be known.\n\n 2. \nThe company made claim to an allowance of 'distribution expenses' incurred in the superintendence of distribution, in work on the premises of customers incidental to the service, in the change of meters used to measure the gas sold, and in the maintenance of local mains and equipment. There is no denial, even now, that these expenses were incurred as claimed. There was no challenge upon the trial to the practice of the company whereby moneys spent in Lima, the territorial unit affected by the ordinance, were allocated to that city, and not to territory beyond. The case was tried on the assumption that the practice was acceptable and was so submitted for decision. Eight months later, on the eve of a determination, the commission conceived the thought that distribution costs in Lima should be borne also by consumers in outlying communities ( including the city of Kenton) served by the same company, which would mean, of course, that like expenses in the other communities must be borne by residents of Lima. Up to that stage the data were lacking for a division on that basis. Accordingly, by an order made ex parte on March 8, 1933, without the appellant's knowledge, the commission directed of its own motion that the annual reports for the years 1928 to 1931, inclusive, be introduced in evidence and made a part of the record. On the basis of these reports it ascertained the average distribution expense per customer for all the eleven communities served by the appellant, multiplied this average by the number \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 70]\n\u00a0\n of customers in Lima, and thus arrived at the share to be allocated to that city in the determination of the local rates. By that mode of apportionment, the operating expenses were reduced to the extent of $6,200 annually.\n We do not now decide that there would be a denial of due process through the spread of distributing costs over the total area of service, if the new method of allocation had been adopted after timely notice to the company and then consistently applied. This court does not sit as a board of revision with power to review the action of administrative agencies upon grounds unrelated to the maintenance of constitutional immunities. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission of California, \n289 \nU.S. 287\n, 53 S.Ct. 637. Our inquiry in rate cases coming here from the state courts is whether the action of the state officials in the totality of its consequences is consistent with the enjoyment by the regulated utility of a revenue something higher than the line of confiscation. If this level is attained, and attained with suitable opportunity through evidence and argument (Southern Ry. Co. v. Virginia, \n290 \nU.S. 190\n, 54 S.Ct. 148) to challenge the result, there is no denial of due process, though the proceeding is shot through with irregularity or error. But the weakness of the case for the appellee is that the fundamentals of a fair hearing were not conceded to the company. Opportunity did not exist to supplement or explain the annual reports as to the distribution of the expenses in the neighboring communities, nor did opportunity exist to bring the rates outside of Lima into harmony with the exigencies of a new method of allocation adopted without warning.\n The need for such an opportunity is brought into clear relief by the record in No. 213, a case submitted along with this one, and within the range of our judicial notice, \n294 \nU.S. 79\n, 55 S.Ct. 324. Butler v. Eaton, \n141 \nU.S. 240, 243\n, 244 S., 11 S.Ct. 985; Aspen Mining & Smelting Co. v. Billings, \n150 \nU.S. 31, 38\n, 14 S.Ct. 4; Bienville \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 71]\n\u00a0\n Water Supply Co. v. Mobile, \n186 \nU.S. 212, 217\n, 22 S.Ct. 820; Fritzlen v. Boatmen's Bank, \n212 \nU.S. 364, 370\n, 29 S.Ct. 366. The subject-matter of that case was the rate schedule for the city of Kenton, served with gas by the appellant. In Kenton, unlike Lima, a spread of distribution costs over the whole area of service would have been favorable to the appellant and unfavorable to customers. Strange to say the commission, though prescribing the larger area for Lima, adopted the smaller one for Kenton, and this by a decision rendered the same day. An injustice so obvious may not be suffered to prevail. The commission by its counsel suggests as an excuse that a division on a different basis was not requested by the company. There was no reason to request it, for the record as made up when the case was finally submitted did not contain the necessary data for a spread over a larger area, nor was there any hint by the commission that such a division was in view. Manifestly, whatever territorial unit is adopted must be made use of consistently, and regardless of the consequences. If a different course were to be followed, there would be less than full requital after all the communities affected had contributed their quotas.\n To resume: division on one basis in Lima and on another basis in Kenton, all without notice to the company that the spread was to be altered and new evidence received, was an exercise of arbitrary power, at variance with 'the rudiments of fair play' (Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Polt, \n232 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 34 S.Ct. 301) long known to our law. The Fourteenth Amendment condemns such methods and defeats them.\n\n 3. \nThe company made claim to commercial expenses incurred in reading the meters of the customers, keeping their accounts, and sending out and collecting bills. The commission treated these items the same way that it treated the expenses of distribution, and spread them over the whole territory instead of confining them to Lima. The result was a reduction of operating expenses \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 72]\n\u00a0\n to the extent of $1,085.25 yearly. For reasons already stated, the reduction may not stand.\n\n 4. \nThe company made claim to expenses incurred in procuring new business or in the endeavor to procure it, such expenses amounting on the average to $12,000 a year. The commission did not question the fact of payment, but cut down the allowance to $5,000 a year on the ground that anything more was unnecessary and wasteful. The criticism has no basis in evidence, either direct or circumstantial. Good faith is to be presumed on the part of the managers of a business. State of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 289 S., 43 S.Ct. 544, 31 A.L.R. 807. In the absence of a showing of ineffficiency or improvidence, a court will not substitute its judgment for theirs as to the measure of a prudent outlay. Banton v. Belt Line Railway Corporation, \n268 \nU.S. 413, 421\n, 45 S.Ct. 534; Brooklyn Borough Gas Co. v. Prendergast (D.C.) 16 F.(2d) 615, 623; New York & Richmond Gas Co. v. Prendergast (D.C.) 10 F.(2d) 167, 181. The suggestion is made that there is no evidence of competition. We take judicial notice of the fact that gas is in competition with other forms of fuel, such as oil and electricity. A business never stands still. It either grows or decays. Within the limits of reason, advertising or development expenses to foster normal growth are legitimate charges upon income for rate purposes as for others. Consolidated Gas Co. v. Newton, supra, at page 253 of 267 F. When a business disintegrates, there is damage to the stockholders, but damage also to the customers in the cost or quality of service.\n\n 5. \nThe company made claim to an allowance of the expenses of the rate litigation amounting in all to about $30,000, to be spread in equal parts over a term of five years, the duration of the ordinance. No part of these expenses has been allowed, though apparently both commission and court intended to allow them, spreading them, however, over a term of six years instead of five. 'It \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 73]\n\u00a0\n must be conceded,' said the court, 'that the gas company is entitled to a fair and reasonable allowance for rate case expenses.' This is followed by the statement that if the spread be six years (instead of five), and $5, 100 be allowed for each of those years 'as contended by the commission,' the rate fixed by the order will give an adequate return. True there is also the statement that the commission would have been warranted in ignoring this item altogether 'in the absence of proof that the gas company's book figures represented an amount that was fair and reasonable.' Even in that remark the implication is obvious that this is not what the commission did. Moreover, there is nothing in the record justifying an inference that the figures were erroneous or the payments improvident. Consol. Gas Co. v. Newton, supra, at page 242 of 267 F.; Newton v. Consol. Gas Co., supra, at page 176 of 258 U.S., 42 S.Ct. 264. The course of the trial exhibits very clearly the understanding of the parties that expenditures shown by the books would be deemed to have been made in good faith and with reasonable judgment unless evidence was at hand overcoming the presumption. In the absence of any challenge of their necessity or fairness, we must view them as they were accepted by the triers of the facts.\n Thus viewing them, we think they must be included among the costs of operation in the computation of a fair return. The company had complained to the commission that an ordinance regulating its rates was in contravention of the statutes of the state and of the Constitution of the nation. In that complaint it prevailed. The charges of engineers and counsel, incurred in defense of its security and perhaps its very life, were as appropriate and even necessary as expenses could well be.\n A different case would be here if the company's complaint had been unfounded, or if the cost of the proceeding had been swollen by untenable objections. There is neither evidence nor even claim that the conduct of the company's representatives was open to that reproach. \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 74]\n\u00a0\n The statute laid a duty on the commission, when it found the ordinance unjust, to prescribe its own schedule. The one it adopted, though higher than the one condemned, did not satisfy the company, but there was nothing unreasonable or obstructive in laying before the commission whatever data might be helpful to that body in reaching a considered judgment. Indeed, we shall be brought to the conclusion, if we analyze the record, that the two phases of the controversy were substantially coincident. Everything relevant to the schedule adopted by the commission was relevant also to an inquiry into the fairness of the ordinance.\n In this matter of rate case expenses, we must distinguish between the function of a court and that of a commission. A court passing upon a challenge to the validity of statutory rates does not determine the rates to be adopted as a substitute. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission of Kentucky, \n290 \nU.S. 264, 271\n, 272 S., 54 S.Ct. 154; Newton v. Consolidated Gas Co., supra. If the rates are inadequate to the point of confiscation, the complainant has no need, it is said, to count upon the expenses of the lawsuit; if they are not already inadequate, the lawsuit cannot make them so. Cf. Columbus Gas & Fuel Co. v. City of Columbus (D.C.) 17 F.(2d) 630, 640. An argument to that effect runs through some of the decisions, though we are not required now either to accept or to reject it. But the case is different where a commission, after setting a schedule of rates aside, is empowered to substitute another to take effect by retroaction and cover the same years. In determining what the substitute shall be, the commission must give heed to all legitimate expenses that will be charges upon income during the term of regulation, and in such a reckoning the expenses of the controversy engendered by the ordinance must have a place like any others. Denver Union Stock Yard Co. v. United States (D.C.) 57 F.(2d) 735, 753, 754; New York & Richmond Gas Co. v. Prendergast, supra, at pages 181, 182 of 10 F.(2d); \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 75]\n\u00a0\n Monroe Gaslight Co. v. Michigan Public Utilities Commission (D.C.) 11 F.( 2d) 319, 325.\n There are suggestions in the books that the cost of litigation is to be reckoned as an extraordinary expense and so a charge upon capital rather than a charge upon income to be paid out of the revenues of one year or of many. Cf. New York & Queens Gas Co. v. Newton (D.C.) 269 F. 277, 290; Reno P., L. & W. Co. v. Public Service Commission (D.C.) 298 F. 790, 801; contra, New York & Richmond Gas Co. v. Prendergast, supra, at pages 181, 182 of 10 F.(2d); Mobile Gas Co. v. Patterson (D.C.) 293 F. 208, 224. There is no need to consider what practice is to be followed where the rate is prescribed for a period of indefinite duration, though there would seem to be little difficulty in amortizing the charge over a reasonable term. Cf. New York & Richmond Gas Co. v. Prendergast, supra. In the case at hand, the period of duration has been definitely fixed, and the charge upon the income can be distributed accordingly.\n We conclude that an addition of $5,100 must be made to the yearly operating expenses as the cost of proceedings necessary to keep the business going. Cf. Kornhauser v. United States, \n276 \nU.S. 145\n, 48 S.Ct. 219. The company makes no point as to the ruling of the commission that the cost should be spread over six years instead of five, and we follow that concession.\n\n 6. \nThe items enumerated in subdivisions 1 to 5 of this opinion amount altogether to $23,185.25 annually. Added to the operating charges they reduce the net income from $109,414 to $86,228.75, or about 4.53 per cent. upon the rate base of $1,901,696. This is too low a rate to satisfy the requirements of the Constitution when applied to a corporation engaged in the sale of gas during the years 1928 to 1931, two at least of the four years being before the days of the depression. Los Angeles Gas & Electric Co. v. Railroad Commission of California, supra, at pages 319, 320 of 289 U.S., 53 S.Ct. 637; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 76]\n\u00a0\n Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 311\n, 54 S.Ct. 647; State of Missouri ex rel. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission, supra, at page 288 of 262 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 544; Ohio Utilities Co. v. Public Utilities Comm. of Ohio, supra, at page 364 of 267 U.S., 45 S.Ct. 259.\n Counsel for the commission argues that disbursements for charitable and other gifts, allowed by the commission, ought in law to have been excluded. This may well be, but the record is too meagre to enable us to ascertain with certainty the reasons for the payments. Cf. Old Mission Portland Cement Co. v. Helvering (Dec. 3, 1934) \n293 \nU.S. 289\n, 55 S.Ct. 158; In re Southern California Edison Co., P.U.R. 1924C, 1, at pages 32, 33. We do not feel at liberty to eliminate them upon inconclusive testimony when court and commission have treated them as proper. If, however, all were to be dropped, the increment to the rate would be only about one-tenth of one per cent. The change would be too small to induce a different conclusion.\n Counsel also argues that the rate base, though fixed by the commission in January, 1932, was determined as of March, 1928, when the ordinance was passed, and we are reminded that since that time there has been a marked decline of values, at least during the later years of the period affected. How great the decline has been we cannot learn with any accuracy from the record now before us. The value fixed by the commission was adopted as the base on which to estimate the rate of return at the beginning of the period, but also at the end. The company acquiesced, believing that the valuation would be effective during every portion of the term, and abandoned the appeal it might otherwise have taken. Under the statutes of Ohio the 'sum so fixed must be regarded as a valuation binding upon the gas company and the city alike, and is the rate base.' 128 Ohio St. 301, 191 N.E. 105, 109. No other sum was considered by the commission, or deemed to be properly before it. No other sum was subject to consideration upon the petition in error to \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 77]\n\u00a0\n the court. To put into the case now an issue heretofore kept out of it and thereby reach another value would be a denial of a full and fair hearing by the tribunals of the state, a denial forbidden by the Constitution of the nation. If the appellee may be heard to say that during some part of the term the valuation was too high, the company must be free to urge that at other times it was too low. Upon the record now submitted to us no such issue is involved. To bring it into the case at all there is need of a new hearing with a new reckoning of the rate base, unhampered by restrictions to any single point of time. Only in that way can review be full and fair.\n\n 7. \nThe company makes the claim that it has received an inadequate allowance to the extent of $28,021.40 for depreciation reserve, and that it should have been permitted to amortize the value of a transmission main extending from Lima to fields of natural gas, thereby adding $22,935.97 to its operating charges.\n We have considered these objections, and are unable to uphold them.\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nREVERSED.\n\n Mr. Justice STONE (concurring).\n As there was a denial of due process by the commission in arbitrarily reducing the allowance for 'unaccounted for gas,' and in failing to apply consistently either of the two methods of allocation of distribution and commercial expenses adopted in the two cases submitted to us, I concur in the judgment of the Court that the case must be remanded for further proceedings. But with two of the conclusions in the opinion I am unable to agree.\n\n 1. \nI think that the petitioner has failed to sustain the burden, which rests upon it in a confiscation case from \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 78]\n\u00a0\n a state court as well as from any other, to show that the item of expense for 'new business' was a proper charge against gross income. The property for which constitutional protection is invoked is that 'used and useful in the public service,' not the enlarged business of the future which petitioner hopes to obtain through the present expenditure of money. I know of no constitutional principle upon which this expenditure must be taken from the pockets of the patrons of the present business, any more than the cost of future service lines required to carry on the new business. The record does not suggest that the expenditure for new business was necessary to prevent shrinkage of the present business, and the petitioner has failed to show that the charge is not a capital charge, which it appears on its face to be. If the action of the commission with respect to this item alone were sustained, the rate of return, as found by this court, would be increased to 4.91 per cent.\n\n 2. \nI am not prepared to say that petitioner sustains the burden of showing confiscation, by showing a rate of return even as low as 4.91 per cent. where it is upon reproduction value determined as of March 31, 1928. We judicially know, and cannot ignore, the large declines in price levels and the earnings of capital which have taken place since that date. The period for which the ordinance fixed the rate extends from April 19, 1928, to April 19, 1933. At least three of the five years are those of declining prices and diminishing capital returns. Since the commission's order was based on known income for four of the five years, the possibly lowered revenues of the fifth year cannot be taken to off-set the effect of the declining prices and capital returns. The record gives no hint of what the rate base would be were it ascertained for the entire period. While the commission and the Ohio courts are bound to adopt a rate base determined as of the beginning of the ordinance period, this does not relieve the com- \n\n[294 U.S. 63, 79]\n\u00a0\n pany of the burden of showing that the value of the property for the entire period is such that the net return under the commission's rates would have been so low as to confiscate its property. See Los Angeles Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 266, 304\n, 53 S.Ct. 637. No contention is made that the Ohio procedure precludes such proof or that it prevented petitioner from showing facts which would establish confiscation. \n\n\n\n","199":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEST OHIO GAS CO. v. PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION(1935)\nNo. 213\nArgued: Decided: January 7, 1935\n\n\n\n Messrs. Edmond W. Hebel, of Indianapolis, Ind., Harry O. Bentley, of Lima, Ohio, and Charles C. Marshall, of Columbus, Ohio, for appellant.\n Messrs. John W. Bricker and Donald C. Power, both of Columbus, Ohio, for appellee. \n\n[294 U.S. 79, 80]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n The rates to be charged by the appellant in Kenton, Ohio, are the subject-matter of this controversy.\n An ordinance adopted by the city council of Kenton on July 16, 1929, effective on August 16, prescribed a schedule of rates within the city for a period of two years. The appellant, West Ohio Gas Company, filed a complaint with the Public Utilities Commission, maintaining its existing schedule for the time being and giving bond as it had done in the Lima Case (West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Comm.) (No. 212), \n294 \nU.S. 63\n, 55 S.Ct. 316, for the return of the excess, if any. The commission fixed the value of the property in Kenton for the purpose of a rate base at $189,856.56. The company acquiesced in the valuation, which for the purpose of this review must be accepted as correct. Thereafter, on March 10, 1933, the commission made a final order determining the ordinance schedule to be unjust and unreasonable, and establishing a new schedule, which was to be effective during the period of the ordinance ( August 16, 1929, to August 16, 1931) and a year and a half afterwards (i.e ., till February 16, 1933). Collections during the course of the proceeding in excess of the new rates were to be refunded to consumers. A motion for a rehearing having been denied, the company filed a petition in error with the Supreme Court of Ohio, asserting that the order of the commission was in contravention of the limitations of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed, writing a single opinion here and in the Lima Case. 128 Ohio St. 301, 191 N.E. 105. An appeal to this court followed.\n The intention of the commission was to establish a schedule of charges that would enable the appellant to receive a return of 6 per cent. upon the value of the Kenton property. To accomplish that result there was need of \n\n[294 U.S. 79, 81]\n\u00a0\n a net income of $11,391.39. As the result of mathematical errors, the commission arrived at the conclusion that income in that amount had been earned in 1929, the year chosen as a standard. In fact the rate of return for that year was only 4.92 per cent., even if all contested rulings in respect of points of law are assumed to be correct.\n Errors of computation such as these are far from exhausting the list of defects in these proceedings. There are others more clearly vital. To ascertain the gross income and the operating expenses the commission confined itself to the business in 1929, predicting on that basis the income and expenses to be looked for in the years to follow. Besides the figures for 1929, there was evidence, full and unchallenged, as to the actual revenue and outlay for 1930 and 1931. The commission refused to give any heed to that evidence in fixing the new rates. It did this in the face of a petition for rehearing which sharply brought to its attention the effect of such exclusion. If heed had been given to the later years, the return for 1930 would have been seen to be 4.23 per cent., and for 1931 only 3.68 per cent., all this, moreover, on the assumption that further error was not committed in the classification or disallowance of operating charges. If such error existed, the return would be even lower.\n We think the adoption of a single year as an exclusive test or standard imposed upon the company an arbitrary restriction in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment and of 'the rudiments of fair play' made necessary thereby. West Ohio Gas Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio (appeal No. 1), \n294 \nU.S. 63\n, 55 S.Ct. 316, decided herewith; Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul R. Co. v. Polt, \n232 \nU.S. 165, 168\n, 34 S.Ct. 301. The earnings of the later years were exhibited in the record and told their own tale as to the possibilities of profit. To shut one's eyes to them altogether, to exclude them from the reckoning, is as much \n\n[294 U.S. 79, 82]\n\u00a0\n arbitrary action as to build a schedule upon guesswork with evidence available. There are times, to be sure, when resort to prophecy becomes inevitable in default of methods more precise. At such times, 'an honest and intelligent forecast of probable future values, made upon a view of all the relevant circumstances' (Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, \n262 \nU.S. 276, 288\n, 43 S.Ct. 544, 546, 31 A.L.R. 807; Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corp. v. Railroad Commission of California, \n289 \nU.S. 287, 311\n, 53 S.Ct. 637), is the only organon at hand, and hence the only one to be employed in order to make the hearing fair. But prophecy, however honest, is generally a poor substitute for experience. 'Estimates for tomorrow cannot ignore prices of to-day.' Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission of Missouri, supra, at page 288 of 262 U.S., 43 S.Ct. 544, 546. We have said of an attempt by a utility to give prophecy the first place and experience the second that 'elaborate calculations which are at war with realities are of no avail.' Lindheimer v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n292 \nU.S. 151, 164\n, 54 S.Ct. 658, 663. We say the same of a like attempt by officers of government prescribing rates to be effective in years when experience has spoken. A forecast gives us one rate. A survey gives another. To prefer the forecast to the survey is an arbitrary judgment.\n In the light of this conclusion we find it needless to dwell upon more particular objections affecting the classification and disallowance of payments which, in the view of the appellant, are charges upon the expenses of operation. For the most part the objections are similar to those considered in No. 212, decided herewith. What has been said in that case will guide the commissioin and the state court in the event of a rehearing.\n We are not unmindful of the argument urged by counsel for the commission that the effect of lower prices may be to swell the volume of the business, and by thus in \n\n[294 U.S. 79, 83]\n\u00a0\n creasing revenues enhance the ultimate return. Upon the record as it comes to us, this is guesswork, and no more. There has been no attempt to measure the possible enhancement by appeal to the experience of other companies similarly situated or by any other line of proof. Present confiscation is not atoned for by merely holding out the hope of a better life to come.\n The decree is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","200":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWEST v. CHESAPEAKE & POTOMAC TELEPHONE CO. OF BALTIMORE CITY(1935)\nNo. 648\nArgued: Decided: June 3, 1935\n\n\n\n Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the District of Maryland.[ West v. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. of Baltimore City \n295 U.S. 662\n (1935) ]\n\n\n[295 U.S. 662, 664]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. Richard F. Cleveland and John Henry Lewin, both of Baltimore, Md., for appellants.\n Mr. Charles McHenry Howard, of Baltimore, Md., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Early in 1933 the Public Service Commission of Maryland undertook an investigation of the rates and charges of the Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Company of Baltimore, and after extended hearings entered an order \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 665]\n\u00a0\n November 28, 1933, directing the company to put into effect January 1, 1934, reductions in its rates, sufficient to diminish annual net income by $ 1,000,000. The company filed a bill in the District Court for temporary and final injunction; the application for interlocutory relief was heard by a court of three judges. A stipulation was made that the cause should be treated as upon final hearing and a decree was entered enjoining enforcement of the order. \n1\n This appeal challenges the court's action.\n The commission determined the value of the property at December 31, 1932, as $32,621,190; estimated the net revenue for 1934 at $3,353,793; allowed for reasonable return 6 per cent. on value ($1,957,271), which the estimated revenue would exceed by $1,396,522. In view of the rise of the general price level during 1933, however, the commission required a reduction of but $1,000,000. In computing net income the commission accepted all the company's figures for current expense, except the annual allowance for depreciation; the amount claimed on this head being $2,173, 000, and the sum allowed $1,720,724. The company insisted on a 7 1\/2 per cent. return.\n The controversy in the District Court revolved around three matters- value, annual depreciation expense, and rate of return. The court found the value of the property to be $39,541,921, the necessary depreciation expense $2,000,000, the probable net return under the commission's order $ 1,742,005, or at the rate of 4 1\/2 per cent., as against 6 per cent., which the court held was the limit below which the return could not be reduced without confiscation. \n2\n\u00a0\n\n All of the figures stated embrace both intrastate and interstate business, but the parties stipulated that in respect of value, expense, and income, the former repre- \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 666]\n\u00a0\n sented 85 per cent. and the latter 15 per cent. of the total. As the commission dealt with the property as a whole, the parties, their witnesses, and the District Court found it convenient to do so, having in mind the fact that in the final result only 85 per cent. of the amounts involved reflected intrastate business and the commission's order must be limited accordingly. For similar reasons, and with a similar reservation, we shall pursue the same course. For the purposes of this proceeding the commission's order, therefore, is to be considered as requiring a diminution of income from intrastate operations by $850,000, rather than $ 1,000,000.\n In 1916 the commission valued the property and prescribed rates. In 1923 the company applied for an increase, the commission after a hearing fixed value at approximately book cost, and refused to permit the rates to be raised. The District Court, pursuant to a bill filed by the company, found the actual value exceeded book value by some $6,000,000, and enjoined the commission from enforcing the current rates. \n3\n The commission acquiesced in the decision and passed an order adopting the court's finding of value and establishing new rates. So matters stood until the initiation of the present investigation.\n The company's books accurately show installations and retirements of plant and from them historical cost is ascertained to be $50,025,278 as of December 31, 1933, with a depreciation reserve of $11,483,357. The commission made no appraisal of the physical plant and property, but attempted to determine present value by translating the dollar value of the plant as it was found by the District Court in the earlier case at December 31, 1923, plus net additions in dollar value in each subsequent year, into an equivalent of dollar value at December 31, 1932\n\n\n\n\n[295 U.S. 662, 667]\n\u00a0\n Its theory was this: Value signifies in rate regulation the investment in dollars on which a utility is entitled to earn. The dollars when invested were free units of exchange value having an earning significance then and now only because they are such units of exchange. When invested they represented in the plant so many poles, miles of wires, and other items of equipment; on the other hand, the same dollar units then represented certain quantities of government bonds, apartment houses, automobiles, food and services, etc. The dollars invested in the company's plant had no value unless they were exchangeable for other requirements and desires of the stockholders, and the corresponding requirements and desires of all persons who use the dollar as a measure of value. Thus a regulating body, in finding value, must find a number of universal units of earning power and purchasing power; that is, exchangeable dollars invested in place of present exchangeable dollars. How shall the relation be ascertained?\n The commission thought it found the answer in commodity indices, prepared to show price trends. It selected sixteen of these, one covering as many as 784 commodities, falling into different classes, and weighted for averaging; others much less comprehensive; and its witness calculated by the use of each index the reduction in value of the company's assets considered as a conglomerate mass of dollar value from 1923, or subsequent date of acquisition, to 1932. As might be expected the results varied widely. The lowest value found by the use of any index was $24,983,624; the highest $36,056,408, 48 per cent. higher. The commission then weighted these sixteen indices upon a principle not disclosed, giving them weights of from one to four, and thus got a divisor of thirty-one for the total obtained by adding the weighted results of all. This gave what the commission styled its 'fair value index,' which it applied to the 1923 value of \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 668]\n\u00a0\n the property then owned and to cost of all net additions in subsequent years, to obtain value as of 1932. The result after adding some $660,000 for working capital, was a rate base of $32,621,190. The company submitted proof of estimated reproduction cost and accrued depreciation. The commission examined and criticized this evidence, but none was offered in opposition, and the valuation was based squarely on the figures obtained by the use of its index.\n In the District Court the company offered evidence of historical cost and estimates of reproduction cost less depreciation; the commission relied solely upon the figure resulting from trending the dollar value of plant owned in 1923 and cost of net additions subsequently made. The court held the indices used inappropriate for determining present value and discarded them. It purported to consider both book cost and reproduction cost; but, in fact, as plainly appears from the opinion,4 derived present value by the use of two figures only-book cost as at December 31, 1933 ($ 50,025,278), less the entire depreciation reserve shown by the books ($11, 483,357)-and thus fixed value at $38,541,921. To this it added $1,000,000, for working capital (instead of $660,000 allowed by the commission), giving a rate base of $39,541,921. Annual depreciation expense was raised from $1,352,284 as determined by the commission to $2,000,000. The appellants charge that in all these respects the court's action was arbitrary and cannot stand. We are not satisfied with the methods pursued either by the court or the commission.\n First. The commission took the value of the physical plant in 1923 ( exclusive of the then depreciation reserve), $35,147,912, and trended it to $23,689,693 as of 1932. It took annual net additions to plant ( exclusive of depreciation reserves) and similarly trended them. This gave \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 669]\n\u00a0\n plant value exclusive of the plant represented in the depreciation reserve. It took the depreciation reserve as at 1923 (invested in plant) and the yearly net additions to the reserve and trended each figure to 1932 value. In this way it reduced the book reserve which, at cost, stood at $10,405, 147, to $7,318,086, and deducted the latter from total plant value. A table found in the commission's report showing the operation in detail is copied in the margin. \n5\n\u00a0\n\n This method is inappropriate for obtaining the value of a going telephone plant. An obvious objection is that the indices which are its basis were not prepared as an aid to the appraisal of property. They were intended merely to\n\n[]\n Value found by Court, as of Dec. 21, 1923 $36,122,912 Less Working Capital 975,000 ___ Depreciation Reserve\n Depreciated Value of Property, as of December 31, 1932 $ 32,610,327 Add Working Capital 737,000 ___\n $33,347,327 Deduct Pleasant Street Property 137,496 ___\n ( ) Indicates Subtraction. $33,209,831 ___\n Rate Base $33,210,000 ___\n Value of Property-December 31, 1932. less Working Capital $32,610, 327 Deduct average increase in Depreciation Reserve less average increase in Fixed Capital 650,000 ___\n $31,960,327 Add Allowance for Working Capital 600,863 ___\n Average Value of Rate Base for 1933 $32,621,190\n 5 Of the twenty-four structural property accounts of the O'Fallon Railroad, seventeen were trended from 1914 prices by the use of the wholesale price index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one by the National Industrial Conference Board's index of average hourly earnings on railways, and four by the use of an index of railway equipment prepared by the 'President's Conference Committee of Federal Valuation,' and two were continued at cost. None of the accounts was adjusted to current price levels by direct estimates or by direct pricing of the equipment, much of which was equipment purchased second-hand and long in service. \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 670]\n\u00a0\n indicate price trends. Indeed the record shows that one index used by the commission and given a weight of 3-that of the Interstate Commerce Commission-bears a notation that it should not be used 'in the determination of unit reproduction costs' upon individual properties. Doubtless the authors of the other indices would have issued a similar warning, if they had supposed any one would attempt such a use.\n Again, the wide variation of results of the employment of different indices, already mentioned, impugns their accuracy as implements of appraisal. Sensible of this discrepancy, the commission attempted a rule of thumb corrective, by weighting the several indices upon a principle known only to itself, and thus rendered its process of valuation even more dubious and obscure. The possible factors of error are increased by the use of some indices such as that constructed by the commission's witness upon Western Electric prices. The evidence is that these apply to about 25 per cent. of the company's purchases; that during the period of rising prices, 1924-1929, they rose more slowly than prices of other commodities and manufactured articles; that though in 1930 other prices fell, Western Electric's were raised an average of 10 per cent. In constructing an index from these prices, the \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 671]\n\u00a0\n witness disregarded the increase during the period 1930-1932. The commission gave the index a weight of 3 and applied it to all purchases of the company, although confessedly it was applicable to only one-fourth of them.\n The established principle is that as the due process clauses ( Amendments 5 and 14) safeguard private property against a taking for public use without just compensation, neither Nation nor State may require the use of privately owned property without just compensation. When the property itself is taken by the exertion of the power of eminent domain, just compensation is its value at the time of the taking. So, where by legislation prescribing rates or charges the use of the property is taken, just compensation assured by these constitutional provisions is a reasonable rate of return upon that value. \n6\n To an extent value must be a matter of sound judgment, involving fact data. To substitute for such factors as historical cost and cost of reproduction, a 'translator' \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 672]\n\u00a0\n of dollar value obtained by the use of price trend indices, serves only to confuse the problem and to increase its difficulty, and may well lead to results anything but accurate and fair. This is not to suggest that price trends are to be disregarded; quite the contrary is true. And evidence of such trends is to be considered with all other relevant factors. St. Louis & O'Fallon R. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461, 485\n, 49 S.Ct. 384; Clark's Ferry Bridge Co. v. Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania, \n291 \nU.S. 227, 236\n, 54 S.Ct. 427.\n A more fundamental defect in the commission's method is that the result is affected by sudden shifts in price level. It is true that any just valuation must take into account changes in the level of prices. \n7\n We have therefore held that where the present value of property devoted to the public service is in excess of original cost, the utility company is not limited to a return on cost. Conversely, if the plant has depreciated in value, the public should not be bound to allow a return measured by investment. Of course the amount of that investment is to be considered along with appraisal of the property as presently existing, in order to arrive at a fair conclusion as to present value, for actual cost, reproduction cost and all other elements affecting value are to be given their proper weight in the final conclusion. \n8\n\u00a0\n\n But it is to be remembered that such a property as that here under consideration is a great integrated aggregate of many and diverse elements; is not primarily intended for sale in the market, but for devotion to the public use now and for the indefinite future; and has, so far as its market value is concerned, no real resemblance to a bushel of wheat or a ton of iron. While, therefore, the owner of such a property must assume and may not pass on to the pub- \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 673]\n\u00a0\n lic the risk involved in a general decline in values, and may have the advantage also of a general rise in such values, it would not only be unfair but impracticable to adjust the value and the consequent rate of return to sudden fluctuations in the price level. For in its essence this is the sort of aggregate whose value is not fairly or accurately reflected by such abrupt alterations in the market. A public service corporation ought not, therefore, in a rate proceeding, to be permitted to claim to the last dollar an increased value consequent upon a sudden and precipitate rise in spot prices of material or labor. No more ought the value attributable to its property to be depressed by a similar sudden decline in the price level. The present case affords an excellent example. As shown by the commission's exhibits, the price trend was gradually ascending from 1923 to 1929. It then suffered a precipitate decline so that at December, 1932, the date of the commission's valuation, it was at the nadir. Since then it has made a sharp recovery. The commission recognized this. Its report and order were made November 28, 1933. At that time the price level, as shown by the all-commodities index of the United States Department of Labor, had arisen 13.1 per cent. over that of December 31, 1932. For this reason the commission, instead of cutting the net income of the company $1,396,000, allowed what has been called a 'spread' or 'cushion' of $396,000, by ordering a reduction of $1,000,000. The price level has since continued to rise. By the application of the same index a valuation would have been obtained at December 31, 1934, of $ 38,390,922, and at February, 1935, of.$39,691,038, or more than $1,000,000 greater than the amount fixed by the court as of December 31, 1933. It thus appears that the so-called spread or cushion has already been absorbed if judgment is to be based on rapid rise in spot commodity prices. What the commission in effect did was to take the temporary low level of December, 1932, \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 674]\n\u00a0\n and apply this low level for the indefinite future in ascertaining the so- called fair value of the company's plant and property. The experience of the two years which have elapsed since the commission's order clearly indicates the impropriety of the use of its method in the appraisal of a property such as that of this company.\n We agree, therefore, with the view of the District Court, that the method was inapt and improper, is not calculated to obtain a fair or accurate result, and should not be employed in the valuation of utility plants for rate making purposes. As that court observed, it is not the function of a tribunal inquiring into the question of confiscation to set aside the legislative finding for mere errors of procedure. The duty of a court is merely to ascertain whether the legislative process has resulted in confiscation. In Los Angeles Gas & Electric Corporation v. Railroad Commission, supra, this Court said: 'The legislative discretion implied in the rate-making power necessarily extends to the entire legislative process, embracing the method used in reaching the legislative determination as well as that determination itself. We are not concerned with either, so long as constitutional limitations are not transgressed. When the legislative method is disclosed, it may have a definite bearing upon the validity of the result reached, but the judicial function does not go beyond the decision of the constitutional question. That question is whether the rates as fixed are confiscatory.' \n289 U.S. 287\n, page 304, 53 S.Ct. 637, 643.\n The language was used in respect of the claim that values of various elements had been ignored by the commission. It was found, however, that though error might have been committed in respect of the items specified, other allowances neutralized the possible error. See, also, Dayton P. & L. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, 292 U.S. \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 675]\n\u00a0\n 290, 306, 54 S.Ct. 647. Nothing said in either of these cases justifies the claim that this court has departed from the principles announced in earlier cases as to the value upon which a utility is entitled to earn a reasonable return or the character of evidence relevant to that issue. It is apparent from what has been said that here the entire method of the commission was erroneous and its use necessarily involved unjust and inaccurate results. In such a case it is not the function of a court, upon a claim of confiscation, to make a new valuation upon some different theory in an effort to sustain a procedure which is fundamentally faulty.\n The principle applicable in circumstances such as this record discloses was announced in Northern Pacific Railway Company v. Department of Public Works of State of Washington, \n268 \nU.S. 39\n, 45 S.Ct. 412. There a state commission set out to determine rates for intrastate transportation of logs in carloads. The carriers introduced evidence that existing rates did not yield any return on the property employed or defray the operating costs of the traffic and its proportionate taxes. The commission, without introducing evidence in contradiction of the proof submitted by the carriers as to actual operating costs, entered an order lowering the rates on the basis of a composite figure obtained largely from data in the reports submitted by the carriers and their exhibits in the proceeding, representing the weighted average operating cost per thousand gross-ton miles of all revenue freight transported on the carriers' systems, including main line and branch line freight, interstate and intrastate, carload and less than carload. The supreme court of the state sustained the order, and this court reversed, holding that the error in the method pursued was fundamental and amounted to a denial of due process. It was said (\n268 U.S. 39\n, page 43, 45 S.Ct. 412, 413):\n'A precise issue was the cost on each railroad of transporting logs in carload lots in Western Washington, the \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 676]\n\u00a0\n average haul on each system being not more than 32 miles. In using the above composite figure in the determination of this issue the department necessarily ignored, in the first place, the differences in the average unit cost on the several systems, and then the differences on each in the cost incident to the different classes of traffic and articles of merchandise, and to the widely varying conditions under which the transportation is conducted. In this unit cost figure no account is taken of the differences in unit cost dependent, among other things, upon differences in the length of haul, in the character of the commodity, in the configuration of the county, in the density of the traffic, in the daily loaded car movement, in the extent of the empty car movement, in the nature of the equipment employed, in the extent to which the equipment is used, and in the expenditures required for its maintenance. Main line and branch line freight, interstate and intrastate, car load and less than car load, are counted alike. The department's error was fundamental in its nature. The use of this factor in computing the operating costs of the log traffic vitiated the whole process of reasoning by which the department reached its conclusion. ...\n\n'But where rates found by a regulatory body to be compensatory are attacked as being confiscatory, courts may inquire into the method by which its conclusion was reached. An order based upon a finding made without evidence (The Chicago Junction Case, \n264 \nU.S. 258, 263\n, 44 S.Ct. 317), or upon a finding made upon evidence which clearly does not support it (Interstate Commerce Commission v. Union Pacific R.R., \n222 \nU.S. 541, 547\n, 32 S.Ct. 108), is an arbitrary act against which courts afford relief. The error under discussion was of this character. It was a denial of due process.'\n\n To the same effect, see Chicago, M. & St. P. Ry. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission, \n274 \nU.S. 344, 351\n, 47 S.Ct. 604. \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 677]\n\u00a0\n There is a suggestion in the report to the effect that the commissioner's method was agreed to by both parties. \n9\n We find, however, in the District Court's opinion, a statement that the use of index figures was the subject of contest. \n10\n We think the apparent contradiction is explained by reference to the record, which discloses the company used price relation to obtain the present value of certain property, but separated from other sorts each kind of property so treated. This is comparable to the practice of the Interstate Commerce Commission in translating the value of specific railroad property, e.g., steel rails, by the use of the differential between the per ton price in 1914, the date of original appraisal, and the price prevailing at a later date. 11 In this sense the company employed price indices; but it is plain that such a use of relation of values of specific articles as of two given dates is quite distinct from the application of general commodity indices to a conglomerate of assets constituting an utility plant. Much is made of the fact that in the suit brought by the company in 1923 the District Court applied a price index to cost, and thus determined the then value of the property. But this fact cannot justify the application of the same procedure here, in the face of the challenge of its propriety. In the present case the company did not put into evidence any such price indices as \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 678]\n\u00a0\n were used by the commission but on the contrary offered evidence to show that the use of them as a sole criterion of value would be improper.\n Second. As already stated, the District Court condemned the method pursued by the commission, and adopted one of its own. This consisted in deducting the company's depreciation reserve from book cost and adding to the difference an allowance for working capital. It is true that the court discussed the company's evidence as to cost of reproduction new, less depreciation, but did so only to indicate its disapproval of certain large amounts embodied in the total claimed and to reconcile the figures with its own estimate. A careful reading of the opinion leaves no doubt that all other measures of value were discarded in favor of cost less depreciation reserve.\n It is clear that in a period of low prices costs incurred when the price level was much higher are not a safe guide in appraising present value. The court so conceded. The depreciation reserve was built up on the straight line theory. 12 The company asserted that the amount of the reserve did not represent observed and accrued depreciation at the date of valuation,13 as much of the total consisted of funds provided in anticipation of future depreciation and obsolescence. The court agreed and further found that on account of decreased demand for service, with consequent diminishment of obsolescence, the percentage of reserve had in recent years sharply increased. The question of going value was the subject of controversy. The court recognized that this element must be considered, but refused to make any separate allowance for it. \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 679]\n\u00a0\n What the court did in fact was this: It found that book cost less actual accrued depreciation would probably give too high a figure. It sought to correct the probable error by deducting from cost the entire depreciation reserve, though conceding this exceeded actual depreciation. It felt that this large deduction would also redress any excess of cost over present value; and finally it said the result of its method would be appropriate to allow for going value.\n Two quotations from the opinion will illustrate the basis of the court's action.\n'We are not unmindful that at the present time the depreciation reserve is slightly higher than normal and to the extent that it is, it is unfavorable to the company in the final result. ... But this disadvantage to the company is, we think, offset by allowing it the full of its actual costs despite the generally lower trend of prices.'14\n\n'All relevant facts considered, we are of the opinion that a fair allowance for going value is made when we value the telephone property as a whole as a going concern at its actual book costs less full depreciation.' 15\n\n The opinion in essence consists of the conclusion that, all the circumstances considered, it will be fair to appraise the property at cost less depreciation reserve. This rough and ready approximation of value is as arbitrary as that of the commission, for it is unsupported by findings based upon evidence.\n Third. For the reasons stated we cannot sustain the District Court's valuation. We have shown that the commission's order violates the principle of due process, as the measure of value adopted is inadmissible. It is not our function, and was not the function of the court below, to do the work of the commission by determining a rate \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 680]\n\u00a0\n base upon correct principles. The District Court, upon finding that the commission reached its conclusions as to fair value from data which furnished no legal support, should have enjoined enforcement of the rate order. The court's action was therefore right, regardless of the method it pursued in reaching the decision that the order was confiscatory.\n The grounds upon which we decide the case render it unnecessary for us to consider the appellants' challenge of rulings of the District Court respecting working capital and annual depreciation allowance, or to discuss the rate of return to which the company is entitled in view of the agreement of the court and the commission upon this point.\n The decree is affirmed.\n Mr. Justice STONE.\n I think the decree should be reversed.\n The suit is in equity, brought in a Federal District Court to set aside the legislative action of the state in prescribing telephone rates through the agency of its public service commission. The sole issue raised by the pleadings, and the only one presented to us and to the court below, is whether there is confiscation of appellee's property by reduction of its rates. It is not within the province of the federal courts to prescribe rates or to revise rates fixed by state authority, unless property is taken without due process in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. v. Railroad Commission, \n290 \nU.S. 264, 271\n, 272 S., 54 S.Ct. 154. This Court, in setting aside the order of the commission and leaving the old rates in force, does not pass upon that issue. It does not hold that the rate fixed by the commission will confiscate appellee's property, nor does it agree with the determination of the District Court below that it will. \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 681]\n\u00a0\n For it is declared that the District Court has not followed the rules sanctioned by this Court for determining the fair value of the property of a public service company and, in consequence, its conclusion that there has been confiscation must be rejected. But, notwithstanding the errors of the District Court, this Court upholds its decree. The order of the commission is thus set aside, upon a ground not raised upon the record or considered by the court below. This is done not because the rate is confiscatory, but because the method by which the commission arrived at its conclusion, which is now pronounced 'inapt' and 'erroneous,' is declared to be unconstitutional.\n The Fourteenth Amendment is thus said to be infringed, not because the appellee has been deprived of any substantive right, but because the commission's action is deemed a denial of due process in the procedural sense. But not even the procedure is condemned because it lacks those essential qualities of fairness and justice which are all the Fourteenth Amendment has hitherto been supposed to exact of bodies exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions. The commission has punctiliously adhered to a procedure which acts only after notice and hears before it condemns. Hurtado v. California, \n110 \nU.S. 516, 535\n, 536 S., 4 S.Ct. 292; Holden v. Hardy, \n169 U.S. 366\n, 389-391, 18 S.Ct. 383; cf. Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Minnesota, \n134 \nU.S. 418, 457\n, 10 S.Ct. 462; Interstate Commerce Commission v. Louisville & Nashville R. Co., \n227 \nU.S. 88, 91\n, 33 S.Ct. 185. The sole transgression, for which its painstaking work is set at naught, is that, in the exercise of the administrative judgment of this body 'informed by experience' and 'appointed by law' to deal with the very problem now presented, see Illinois Central R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission, \n206 \nU.S. 441, 454\n, 27 S.Ct. 700, it has relied upon a study of the historical cost and ascertained value of appellee's plant in the light of price indices, showing declines in prices, in arriving at the present fair value of the property, a procedure on which this \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 682]\n\u00a0\n Court has hitherto set the seal of its approval. Clark's Ferry Bridge Co. v. Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania, \n291 \nU.S. 227, 236\n, 54 S.Ct. 427. See, also, St. Louis & O'Fallon R. Co. v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 461\n, 49 S.Ct. 384.\n In this state of the record it is unnecessary to consider whether the appellee has sustained the burden placed upon it of establishing confiscation, or to demonstrate, as I think may be done, that the facts found by the court below, and on which it acted, fall far short of showing that appellee's property is in any danger of confiscation. It is enough to point out that this Court has rejected the conclusions of the District Court because it used book value as a measure of present fair value in times of falling prices, and that even with its findings of fair value, probable earnings and rate of depreciation, the District Court found that the rate of return would be approximately 4 1\/2 per cent. on the property of one of the most stable of public utilities. If adjustment be made for a plainly excessive depreciation allowance, the rate of return on the court's figures would be raised to 5.10 per cent. \n1\n The company supported its claim of confiscation by no evidence of the cur- \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 683]\n\u00a0\n rent yields of comparable investments and by no evidence of the rate of return generally obtaining in the money market. \n2\n The general conditions of the money market and the rate of return on invested capital may have a controlling influence in determining the issue of confiscation. Bluefield Water Works Co. v. Public Service Commission of State of West Virginia, \n262 \nU.S. 679, 693\n, 43 S.Ct. 675; United Railways v. West, \n280 \nU.S. 234, 249\n, 50 S.Ct. 123. There is at least grave doubt whether a return of 4 1\/2 per cent. is so out of line with the current yield on invested capital as to be deemed confiscatory. This doubt, if accepted principles be applied, must be resolved against the company, which has offered no evidence by which the doubt could be removed. Twenty- five years ago, in times far more prosperous than these, this Court unanimously declined to take judicial notice that an estimated net return of 4 per cent. would be confiscatory. Knoxville v. Water Company, \n212 \nU.S. 1, 17\n, 29 S.Ct. 148.\n In determining whether the procedure of the commission involves any denial of federal right, open to review by collateral attack in the federal courts, it is important to consider a little more closely the nature of its 'error.' In 1925 the fair value of respondent's property as of 1923 was judicially determined by a Federal District Court of three judges, in a suit brought to set aside the commission's determination. Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. of Baltimore City v. Whitman (D.C.) 3 F.( 2d) 938. The commission had found the fair value of the property to be $24, 350,000, about $1,500,000 more than net historical cost. The court \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 684]\n\u00a0\n found the fair value to be $29,500,000, an increase of 21 per cent. over the commission's valuation and of 29 per cent. over cost. The court arrived at the increase by precisely the same basic method which the commission employed in the present case,3 except that the commission has applied it here with far greater care and thoroughness.\n With this history before it the commission, in its report in the present case, states: 'Both the Company and the Commission realized that to attempt to find the present day fair value of the Company's property by the usual method of taking an inventory of all items of property owned by the Company and pricing out those items at present day prices would not only take at least two years of constant work but would cost the Company not less than $300,000 and cost the State a very substantial sum. It was agreed that index numbers should be used in arriving at present day costs.' It is of no importance that the 'agreement' to which the commission refers was not formally spread upon the record, for the record itself shows that no objection was made to the introduction in evidence of the price indices offered both by the commission and by appellee, and that no effort was made by either party to prove the value of appellee's property by engineers' appraisals of the whole property, or by estimates of present value based on expert observation or knowledge of the entire property. By common consent the case was tried before the commission on the theory that present fair value for rate making purposes could be arrived at with substantial accuracy by the application of price indices to the 1923 value as it had been judicially ascertained, and to the cost of subsequent an- \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 685]\n\u00a0\n nual additions to the property after deducting accrued depreciation.\n The commission did not adopt any single index. It prepared its own index for translating book value into present fair value, on the basis on an elaborate study of price indices of recognized merit. \n4\n The result of this study it adopted and applied as more trustworthy than the index prepared by appellee, the salient features of which will presently be considered. \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 686]\n\u00a0\n The commission did not refuse to receive or to consider any of the evidence presented. Its decision and order were based upon an examination, commendable for thoroughness and skill, of all the evidence. Its error, if error there was, did not consist in receiving and considering the evidence submitted of indices showing changes in commodity and other prices. It would have been error for the commission not to have considered it. In St. Louis & O'Fallon R. Co. v. United States, supra, this Court set aside a recapture order of the Interstate Commerce Commission on the sole ground that the commission had failed to consider evidence before it tending to show that the reproduction cost of the structural property of the railroad was greater than original cost. The only evidence of this character disclosed by the record consisted of index figures showing the comparative price levels of labor and materials for 1914 and each of the subsequent recapture years. \n5\n The valuation of the property by the commission was set aside by this Court on the ground that the commission \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 687]\n\u00a0\n had failed to consider the evidence of increased value over cost. In Clark's Ferry Bridge Co. v. Public Service Commission of Pennsylvania, supra, \n291 U.S. 227\n, at page 236, 54 S.Ct. 427, this Court held that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in sustaining the action of a state commission, rightly rejected engineers' appraisals and estimates of value in favor of a lower valuation by the commission based on cost and a study of charts showing the price trends of labor and materials from 1924 to 1930 inclusive. In affirming the judgment of the state court, this Court expressly approved this method of arriving at fair value, although it was less meticulously and carefully applied than by the commission in this case, and held that the evidence of cost and of price trends, of the same character as those on which the commission acted here, outweighed engineering appraisals of the whole property, which the appellee here did not choose to offer.\n The extent of the commission's error thus appears to be that in considering all the evidence before it, in the manner approved by the Clark's Ferry Bridge Co. Case, supra, it thought that the 1923 value of the appellee's plant and equipment, and actual cost of subsequent additions, reasonably adjusted so as to conform to generally recognized changes in the prices of labor and materials, as shown by reliable price indices, would afford a better guide to present fair value than the evidence offered by the company. The results thus obtained were checked against current wage scales in construction industries in Baltimore and vicinity, and against the prices of specific commodities entering into the construction of telephone equipment. The company's evidence consisted of its own price index, derived by appraising samples of its property, ranging from 1 per cent. to 20 per cent. of the total property of each type, and assuming similar appraisals for each intervening year since 1923. Its index was based in substantial part on monopoly prices charged appellee for equipment purchased from its affiliate, the Western Elec- \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 688]\n\u00a0\n tric Company, which is subject to the same corporate control as appellee, and on its own labor costs for construction work as shown by its books at a time when it was engaged in no important construction. The Western Electric Company is shown to have increased its prices of equipment 10.2 per cent. in November, 1930, at the very time when prices of commodities and similar manufactures were declining. This increase is reflected in the index used by the company. Upon all the evidence, the commission concluded that appellee did not sustain the burden resting on it, see Western Distributing Co. v. Public Service Commission of Kansas, \n285 \nU.S. 119, 124\n, 52 S.Ct. 283; Smith v. Illinois Bell Telephone Co., \n282 \nU.S. 133, 153\n, 51 S.Ct. 65; Dayton Power & Light Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Ohio, \n292 \nU.S. 290, 308\n, 54 S.Ct. 647, of showing the reasonableness of the prices paid by it to its affiliate. The labor costs of the small amount of construction work carried on by the company were shown to be materially higher than those prevailing in the construction trades in Baltimore and vicinity. In 1930 ( the date chosen by the company) they were about 147 per cent. of their 1923 level, while in December, 1932 (the valuation date), Baltimore wages generally were about 87 per cent. of that level. It is unnecessary to discuss other defects of appellee's proof so extreme as to discredit it. \n6\n Its reliance here upon its own proof is at most perfunctory. It seeks only to sustain the conclusions of the court below, which this Court rejects.\n Public utility commissions, like other quasi-judicial and judicial bodies, must try cases on the evidence before them. \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 689]\n\u00a0\n No basis has been suggested for declaring that the work of the commission must be rejected because of its reliance upon evidence which it was bound to consider, unless we are also prepared to say that its result was wrong. If we are unable on any ground to find that confiscation will occur, I cannot say that actual cost or ascertained value of the structural equipment of the telephone company, trended in accordance with reliable price indices, is any less trust-worthy evidence of present fair value than the more customary engineers' appraisals and estimates, which appellee did not think it worth while to offer, or that, in any case, such a determination infringes any constitutional immunity.\n In assuming the task of determining judicially the present fair replacement value of the vast properties of public utilities, courts have been projected into the most speculative undertaking imposed upon them in the entire history of English jurisprudence. Precluded from consideration of the unregulated earning capacity of the utility, they must find the present theoretical value of a complex property, built up by gradual accretions through long periods of years. Such a property has no market value, because there is no market in which it is bought and sold. Market value would not be acceptable, in any event, because it would plainly be determined by estimates of future regulated earnings. Estimates of its value, including the items of 'overheads' and 'going concern value,' cannot be tested by any actual sale or by the actual present cost of constructing and assembling the property under competitive conditions. Public utility properties are not thus created full fledged at a single stroke. If it were to be presently rebuilt in its entirety, in all probability it would not be constructed in its present form. When we arrive at a theoretical value based upon such uncertain and fugitive data we gain at best only an illusory certainty. No court can evolve from its inner consciousness \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 690]\n\u00a0\n the answer to the question whether the illusion of certainty will invariably be better supported by a study of the actual cost of the property adjusted to price trends, or by a study of the estimates of engineers based upon data which never have existed and never will. The value of such a study is a question of fact in each case, to be ascertained like any other in the light of the record, and with some regard to the expert knowledge and experience of the commission which, in the present case, are obviously great.\n It is said that the price indices 'were not prepared as an aid to the appraisal of property,' that 'they were intended merely to indicate price trends,' a suggestion that seems to assume that known price trends are irrelevant to the determination of the present fair value of property whose cost is known. It is also said that the 'wide variation of results of the employment of different indices ... impugns their accuracy as implements of appraisal.' The use of a single price index to the exclusion of all others, it is true, might well produce as inaccurate a result as if a single engineer's estimate were used to the exclusion of all others, and without test of its verity. But the record affords striking evidence of the accuracy of the composite index translators prepared and used by the commission, quite apart from the relatively close agreement in the results obtained by the individual indices. From 1923 until 1930, when the Western Electric Company raised its prices, the commission's index translator accurately reflected the changes in price actually paid by appellee for its purchased equipment, and the commission and company indices were in close conformity. Eliminating these price changes and the excessive labor costs appearing in the company's own index, the resulting present fair value of appellee's equipment did not differ substantially from the commission's valuation of it. So far as the results of the use of standard price indices are impugned by their variation, an examination of the present record will dis- \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 691]\n\u00a0\n close that the results obtained by the application of price indices to the historical cost of plant are far less variable than engineers' valuations and in general are probably more trustworthy. \n7\n To speak of either class of evidence as so accurate as to require a commission as a matter of law to accept it, or so inaccurate as to require the rejection of a valuation based upon it, is to attribute to the valua- \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 692]\n\u00a0\n tion process a possibility of accuracy and certainty wholly fictitious. Present fair value at best is but an estimate. Historical cost appropriately adjusted by reasonable recognition of price trends appears to be quite as common sense a method of arrival at a present theoretical value as any other. For a period of twenty years or more of rising prices, commissions and courts, including this one, have regarded price variations as persuasive evidence that present fair value was more than cost. I see no reason for concluding that they are of less weight in times of declining prices.\n If I am mistaken in this view, it does not follow that a like error of judgment by a state commission is a violation of the Constitution, and that a federal court can rightly set aside its order, even though there is no confiscation. It is true that in Northern Pacific Railway Co. v. Department of Public Works of State of Washington, \n268 \nU.S. 39\n, 45 S.Ct. 412, this Court, in holding invalid an order arbitrarily lowering rates which the only evidence of probative value showed were already confiscatory, criticized the method adopted by the commission and characterized its action as a denial of due process. But the Court was careful to point out (\n268 U.S. 39\n, page 44, 45 S.Ct. 412, 414) that: 'The mere admission by an administrative tribunal of matter which under the rules of evidence applicable to judicial proceedings would be deemed incompetent (United States v. Abilene & Southern Ry., \n265 \nU.S. 274, 288\n, 44 S.Ct. 565), or mere error in reasoning upon evidence introduced, does not invalidate an order.' And in Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. Co. v. Public Utilities Commission of Idaho, \n274 \nU.S. 344, 351\n, 47 S.Ct. 604, where this Court set aside the rate fixed by a state commission as confiscatory, the method of valuation pursued by the commission was characterized as erroneous and open to review by this Court, as of course it is when the validity of the result is the subject of inquiry. But in no case hitherto has this \n\n[295 U.S. 662, 693]\n\u00a0\n Court assumed to set aside a rate fixed by a state commission, not found to be confiscatory, merely for what it conceived to be an erroneous method of valuation. If such an error in the deliberations of a state tribunal is a violation of the Constitution, I should think that every error of a state court would present a federal question reviewable here. It would seem that doubts, if any, as to the scope of our review of the action of a state commission in a case like the present, had been put at rest by our decision, two terms ago, in Los Angeles Gas Corp. v. Railroad Commission, \n289 \nU.S. 287\n, 53 S.Ct. 637. There the commission made its valuation on the basis of prudent investment, a method repeatedly repudiated by this Court. It was argued that the erroneous method pursued by the commission vitiated its order, whether confiscatory or not. The Court emphatically repudiated that argument, saying (\n289 U.S. 287\n, pages 304, 305, 53 S.Ct. 637, 643): 'We do not sit as a board of revision, but to enforce constitutional rights. San Diego Land & Town Co. v. Jasper, \n189 \nU.S. 439, 446\n, 23 S.Ct. 571. The legislative discretion implied in the rate-making power necessarily extends to the entire legislative process, embracing the method used in reaching the legislative determination as well as that determination itself. We are not concerned with either, so long as constitutional limitations are not transgressed. When the legislative method is disclosed, it may have a definite bearing upon the validity of the result reached, but the judicial function does not go beyond the decision of the constitutional question. That question is whether the rates as fixed are confiscatory. And upon that question the complainant has the burden of proof, and the Court may not interfere with the exercise of the state's authority unless confiscation is clearly established.' Such should be our decision now.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS and Mr. Justice CARDOZO join in this opinion. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] Chesapeake & Potomac Telephone Co. of Baltimore City v.

The commission's conclusion was reached upon the ground that the abrupt cessation of expansion of the telephone business had greatly reduced the need for retiring property because inadequate to care for increased business. The district court conceded that the 1933 allowance at the 4.38 per cent. charged by the company was at least $1,250,000 higher than was necessary to maintain the customary 20 per cent. depreciation reserve against plant in service. The court nevertheless rejected the estimate of the commission on the ground that 'too much reliance must not be placed upon the experience of a single year.' It thus concluded that a federal court may declare a rate order confiscatory because it differs with the commission's predictions of future trends in the telephone business. It would seem hardly within the range of judicial omniscience to establish confiscation by overriding the commission's determination that the telephone business is not likely markedly to expand in the near future. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] The commission introduced evidence that in 1932, 53.0 per cent. of 296 corporations, listed on the New York Stock Exchange and chosen at random, suffered a net loss, and that 65.9 per cent. earned less than 4 per cent. on their invested capital; 22.9 per cent. of the railroads listed on the Exchange suffered a net loss, and 89.6 per cent. earned less than 4 per cent. on their invested capital. Baltimore savings banks paid 3 per cent. in 1933; in December, 1933, prime commercial paper brought 1 1\/2 per cent.; call loans averaged 0.94 per cent.; United States Treasury Notes averaged 0.29 per cent. and Treasury Bonds 3.62 per cent. \n\n[\nFootnote 3\n] While not undertaking to declare the method universally applicable, it increased historical cost by an amount corresponding to the changes in the index of wholesale prices prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\n[\nFootnote 4\n] Sixteen price indices were used by the commission. Five of them related to commodity prices, and included the comprehensive and reliable index of wholesale prices prepared by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Five indices of construction costs were included, prepared by trade journals and concerns allied with the construction industry. Two indices of the price of building materials were used. An index of general consumers' purchasing power, issued by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, was added. A painstakingly prepared index of Baltimore wages was included in order to insure adequate representation of labor costs. To guard against any peculiarity in the price trends of telephone property, two specialized indices were also taken into consideration. One was the Interstate Commerce Commission index of telephone and telegraph property owned by railroads. That the Interstate Commerce Commission stated that 'the indices represent territorial index factors and are not applicable for use in the determination of unit reproduction costs upon individual roads' does not lessen the value of the index as one element of the valuation or as a check on the results reached by other indices. Finally, an index based upon Western Electric prices for telephone equipment and apparatus was used (after elimination of a price rise in 1930, found by the commission to be artificial). This index is incontrovertibly applicable to 25 per cent. of the company property. It is not to be wholly rejected because it is not a perfect and a certain measure of the whole property.\n These results were averaged. Since some of the indices were more accurate than others, and since some were more directly applicable to telephone property, they were assigned greater weights. It is clear that these were the considerations which influenced the commission's judgment as to the appropriate weighting. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' wholesale price index received a weight of four; the Interstate Commerce Commission index of telephone and telegraph property and the index based on Western Electric prices each received a weight of three; all the other indices were given a weight of one to two. The results of the highest and lowest of the indices differed from the commission average only by 10.6 per cent. and 23.4 per cent. respectively. Eleven of the sixteen indices separately considered gave results ranging between $30,000,000 and $34,600,000. There is plainly a rather close clustering about the average of $32,610,327 found by the commission. \n\n[\nFootnote 5\n] Of the twenty-four structural property accounts of the O'Fallon Railroad, seventeen were trended from 1914 prices by the use of the wholesale price index of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one by the National Industrial Conference Board's index of average hourly earnings on railways, and four by the use of an index of railway equipment prepared by the \"President's Conference Committee of Federal Valuation,\" and two were continued at cost. None of the accounts was adjusted to current price levels by direct estimates or by direct pricing of the equipment, much of which was equipment purchased second-hand and long in service. \n\n[\nFootnote 6\n] In appellee's proof overhead during construction cost was estimated at 19 per cent. of the 'directly distributed cost.' Accrued depreciation was based on physical impairment rather than reduction in value and the element of obsolescence was ignored. 'Going value' amounting to 10.7 per cent. of the swollen valuation thus obtained was added, with no showing of necessity of any additional or independent allowance for going value. \n\n[\nFootnote 7\n] The lowest result obtained by the commission in the use of the sixteen classes of price indices was 76.6 per cent. of the commission's valuation. The highest was 110.6 per cent. Against these differences of only 23.4 per cent. and 10.6 per cent., the record shows that in rate cases before the Maryland Public Service Commission, the company valuations based on engineering appraisals had exceeded the commission's similar valuations by amounts ranging from 25.0 per cent. to 59.4 per cent. The average was 41.3 per cent. Most of the rate cases reported in the 1931 and 1932 Public Utility Reports were examined. In the 1931 reports the company valuations similarly exceeded commission valuations by amounts ranging from 2.1 per cent. to 71.2 per cent. The average was 28.9 per cent. In the 1932 reports the company valuations exceeded commission valuations by amounts ranging from 7.7 per cent. to 135.4 per cent. The average was 57.4 per cent.\n An example of the variation in results obtained by an engineering appraisal of telephone property is found in the record in New York Telephone Company v. Prendergast (D.C.) 36 F.(2d) 54. The minority report of the Commission on Revision of the New York State Public Service Commission Law (1930) at page 266, summarizes the different estimates of fair value as of July 1, 1926, as follows:\n Increase over the Commission Valuation Valuation.

Sargent, her son, and a third person not connected with the family. Contemporaneously the trustees executed a declaration of trust by the terms of which they were to pay one-half the net income to Mrs. Sargent during her life and the other half until her death, and after that event the whole, in equal shares, to such of her three children as should be living at the time of each payment, and to the appointees of any deceased child, and, in default of appointment, to the living issue of a deceased child. The trust was to terminate upon the death of the last survivor of the settlor and her three children, and thereupon the corpus was to be divided in specified shares amongst the issue, next of kin, or appointees of the children. Each child was given a general power of appointment by will over one-third of the principal. Mrs. Sargent died January 22, 1931, leaving her three children to survive her. Her will was probated, and the respondents are her executors. The declaration of trust contains a power to terminate, in these words: \n\n[296 U.S. 98, 100]\n\u00a0\n 'This trust may be terminated at any time either as to the whole or as to any part of the property held in trust hereunder, by the person or persons who shall then be trustees hereunder, such termination to be evidenced by a written declaration signed, sealed and acknowledged by them and duly recorded in the Registry of Deeds for the County of Suffolk, setting forth specifically the property as to which such termination is to take effect, and in that event the trusts declared hereunder shall as to such property be at an end and such property shall be paid over and conveyed, free and discharged of all trusts, to the said Adelaide J. Sargent, if she be then living, and if she be not then living one share shall be paid over and conveyed to each of her children who shall then be living, and a like share shall be paid over and conveyed to the appointees by will of each of her children who shall then have died making such appointment, or failing such appointment, to the issue of such deceased child then living, such issue taking by right of representation.'\n No power was reserved by Mr. Sargent to modify the terms of the trust, and the recited power was never exercised.\n The agreement directed that if any trustee should die, resign, or be unable to act, a successor should be appointed by the surviving trustees by a written instrument approved by the then living children of Mrs. Sargent. In 1920 the settlor resigned as trustee and a daughter was appointed to fill the vacancy. After serving for one year she resigned, and Mrs. Sargent was appointed to fill the vacancy thus occasioned, and continued as a trustee until her death. The decedent's son, who was a trustee, had a vested interest in an undivided share of the income and a power to appoint by will his share of the income and one-third of the corpus.\n The Commissioner of Internal Revenue ruled that the value of the trust principal should be included in the gross \n\n[296 U.S. 98, 101]\n\u00a0\n estate. The respondents paid the tax under protest and filed a claim for refund, which the Commissioner rejected. They brought suit in the District Court, which held the transfer did not come within section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, 26 USCA  1094(c), as one made in contemplation of death, and was not taxable under section 302(d).1 The court also ruled that to impose an excise tax on the transfer by a statute enacted after the transfer was complete would constitute a taking of property without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment.\n The petitioner appealed from a judgment in favor of the respondents, and the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the power in question was not a power to alter, amend, or revoke within the meaning of section 302(d).2\n As in No. 14, the declaration of trust in this case, technically speaking, contained no power to revoke, amend, or alter the trust. What the instrument did was to make it possible for the trustees acting jointly to terminate the trust at any time. The petitioner insists that as Mrs. Sargent was one of the trustees named in the declaration the power to terminate, which he views as the equivalent of a power to alter, amend, or revoke, was, strictly speaking, lodged in the settlor and two other persons. He says, therefore, that these facts make the transaction taxable under section 302(d) (26 USCA  1094(d). The respondents reply that if the section be strictly construed it applies only to a transfer where the enjoyment thereof is subject to a power to 'alter, amend or revoke,' and that the instant transfer was subject to no such power, but to a power to terminate. The circumstances about to be mentioned render it unnecessary to consider either contention.\n Mrs. Sargent resigned as a trustee in 1920 and was succeeded by her daughter, one of the beneficiaries. When, \n\n[296 U.S. 98, 102]\n\u00a0\n a year later, the daughter resigned a new trustee could be appointed only by the written nomination of the two remaining trustees with the approval of all the beneficiaries of the trust. By such concerted action Mrs. Sargent was again appointed a trustee. She then acquired any power for the future to participate in a termination of the trust solely by virtue of the action of the other trustees and the beneficiaries, and not in any sense by virtue of any power reserved to herself as settlor in the original declaration of trust. We think, therefore, that neither technically nor in substance does the power to terminate as it existed from 1921 to the date of Mrs. Sargent's death fall within section 302(d).\n What had been said in No. 14 requires a ruling that the section, if held to apply to this transfer, offends the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.\n Judgment affirmed.\n Mr. Justice BRANDEIS, Mr. Justice STONE, and Mr. Justice CARDOZO concur in the result. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 8 F.Supp. 995. \n[\nFootnote 2\n] 75 F.(2d) 35. \n\n\n\n\n","203":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILBER NAT. BANK OF ONEONTA, N.Y. v. UNITED STATES(1935)\nNo. 210\nArgued: December 7, 1934Decided: February 4, 1935\n\n\n\n Mr. William Wolff Smith, of Washington, D.C., for petitioner.\n The Attorney General and Will G. Beardslee, of Washington, D.C.\n\n Mr. Justice McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n July 1, 1927, James Patrick Mahar applied to the United States Veterans' Bureau for reinstatement of $5,000 insurance upon his life, and with the application \n\n[294 U.S. 120, 121]\n\u00a0\n sent check for $13.90. The allocation of this sum then suggested by him gives no indication that he thought it sufficient to meet any premium due after August 1st.\n September 19th, a policy in the usual form issued and was delivered. It showed payment of the monthly premium-$3.95-due July 1st, and that like payment would be necessary on the first of each succeeding month. Also:\n'... This policy takes effect on the first day of July, nineteen hundred and twenty-seven. ...'\n\n'Premiums are due and payable monthly in advance' and 'if any premium be not paid when due, this policy shall cease and become void ...,' but that 'a grace of thirty-one days without interest will be allowed during which time the policy will remain in force. ... This policy, if it has not been surrendered for a cash value, may be reinstated at any time after lapse upon evidence of the insurability of the insured satisfactory to the Director of the United States Veterans' Bureau, and upon the payment of all premiums in arrears, with interest from their several due dates at the rate of five per centum per annum, and the payment or reinstatement of any indebtedness which existed at the time of such default, with policy loan interest.'\n\n A letter dated July 29th, acknowledging receipt of the check which accompanied the application, contained the following clause:\n'Important.-Insurance under the application evidenced by the above remittance shall be effective subject to the World War Veterans' Act, 1924, and Regulations. ...'\n\n Neither this letter nor any other notice informed the assured how the $ 13.90 had been allocated, but under the statute and regulations it sufficed to pay prescribed charges, and two premiums on the $5,000 policy- July 1st and August 1st; also $2.65 for credit on the premium due September 1st. \n\n[294 U.S. 120, 122]\n\u00a0\n Two remittances of $3.95 by or for the assured were made to the Bureau November 2d and December 20th, respectively. These were retained, but were not acknowledged until after the assured's death. After issuance of the policy, no notice was given the assured concerning payment of premiums, default, or that the policy had lapsed or was about to do so. Apparently the only communications sent prior to his death were the receipt of July 29th, and the policy, delivered September 19th.\n Nothing indicates that the Bureau ordinarily sent notices concerning premiums or lapses. We are referred to no statute or regulation which required such a notice. No officer of the Bureau is shown to have had power to reinstate lapsed policies without evidence of insurability.\n Mahar became totally incapacitated October 17th, but the Bureau had no notice of this fact. He died the 24th of December. Payment under the policy was refused upon the ground that it had lapsed because of failure to pay the premium due September 1st. The grace period ended October 2d.\n Petitioner, as administrator of the estate, brought this action in the District Court, Northern District, New York (section 445, c. 10, tit. 38, USCA). It alleged issuance of the policy, that all matured premiums upon the policy had been duly paid, and asked recovery.\n According to the provisions of the policy it expired October 2d. But petitioner claimed, and the District Court ruled, that because the Bureau failed to give notice concerning allocation of the sum forwarded July 1st, failed to give notice of the due dates of the premium or that the policy had or was about to lapse, and retained the two payments of $3.95 each, the United States were estopped to deny liability. It said:\n'If the defendant was a private insurance company, I would have no hesitancy in declaring it estopped from \n\n[294 U.S. 120, 123]\n\u00a0\n claiming the policy had lapsed for non-payment of premium. ... The same principle should be applied against the defendant in this case. 'When the United States went into the insurance business, issued policies in familiar form, and provided that, in the case of disagreement, it might be sued, it must be assumed to have accepted the ordinary incidents of suits in such business.\"\n\n Judgment for the petitioner was reversed. The Circuit Court of Appeals (69 F. (2d) 526, 527) held:\n'The conditions of the policy relating to premium payments were not met by a payment of the premium due September 1, 1927, and the insurance policy therefore expired counting in the grace period on October 2, 1927, unless there was a waiver by the appellee. The claim that there was such a waiver cannot be sustained. ... The law does not permit waiving statutory requirements by the acts of employees of the government. The failure to pay the premiums prior to October 2 resulted in a lapse of the policy which may not now be held to be waived by the conduct of the government's employees.'\n\n The cause is here by certiorari granted upon an application which asserts that the questions presented are: First, whether the United States are engaged in the life and disability insurance business, and obligated to observe the same rules in respect of notices, applying premiums, and obeying customs that are applicable to competing commercial companies, and, second, whether the United States, in the circumstances shown, are bound by the acts of their agents like other insurance companies and estopped to deny payments because of such acts.\n Undoubtedly, the general rule is that the United States are neither bound nor estopped by the acts of their officers and agents in entering into an agreement or arrangement to do or cause to be done what the law does not sanction or permit. Also, those dealing with an agent of the United \n\n[294 U.S. 120, 124]\n\u00a0\n States must be held to have had notice of the limitation of his authority. Utah Power & Light Co. v. United States, \n243 \nU.S. 389, 409\n, 37 S.Ct. 387; Sutton v. United States, \n256 \nU.S. 575, 579\n, 41 S.Ct. 563, 19 A.L.R. 403.\n How far, if at all, these general rules are subject to modification where the United States enter into transactions commercial in nature ( Cooke v. United States, \n91 U.S. 389\n, 399; White v. United States, \n270 \nU.S. 175, 180\n, 46 S.Ct. 274) we need not now inquire. The circumstances presented by this record do not show that the assured was deceived or misled to his detriment, or that he had adequate reason to suppose his contract would not be enforced or that the forfeiture provided for by the policy could be waived. New York Life Insurance Co. v. Eggleston, \n96 U.S. 572\n; Phoenix Mut. Life Insurance Co. v. Doster, \n106 \nU.S. 30\n, 1 S.Ct. 18. The grounds upon which estoppel or waiver are ordinarily predicated are not shown to exist.\n The statutes and regulations which govern the War Risk Insurance Bureau we must assume are known by those who deal with it. When issuing a policy, the Bureau, so far as shown, did not ordinarily notify the assured of the allocation of the cash payment; there was no custom to give notice of defaults. Here the insured had no right to expect such notices. His policy finally lapsed October 2d. After that, no officer of the Bureau had authority to reinstate it without proof of insurability. The policy so declared.\n The assured's health began to decline in September, and on October 17th he was permanently and totally disabled, but no notice of this was given. Payments of November 2d and December 20th were sent when this disability existed. They were received by the Bureau when ignorant of the true situation, and at a time when reinstatement by affirmative action was inadmissible.\n Nothing indicates intention by any officer or agent to vary the contract; and we find nothing done or omitted \n\n[294 U.S. 120, 125]\n\u00a0\n from which the assured or his representatives could reasonably imply such purpose or intent. The claim of estoppel or waiver is not supported by the facts shown and the questioned judgment must be affirmed.\n Affirmed. \n\n\n\n","204":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILOIL CORPORATION v. COMMONWEALTH(1935)\nNo. 439\nArgued: January 14, 1935Decided: February 4, 1935\n\n\n\n Appeal from the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of pennsylvania. \n\n[294 U.S. 169, 170]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. J. Smith Christy and A. Leo Weil, both of Pittsburgh, Pa., for appellant.\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 169, 171]\n\u00a0\n Mr. John Y. Scott, of Harrisburg, Pa., for appellee.\n\n\n\n[294 U.S. 169, 172]\n\u00a0\n\n Mr. Justice BUTLER delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This case, coming before the court of common pleas of Dauphin county upon the appeal of the company from determinations of state taxing authorities, is an action by the commonwealth against appellant to recover a tax under section 4 of the Liquid Fuels Tax Act of 1931, P.L. 149 (72 PS Pa.  2611d). By that act a tax of 3 cents a gallon is imposed 'upon all liquid fuels used or sold and delivered by distributors within this Commonwealth,' and distributors are made liable for the payment of the tax. They may add the amount of the tax to the price, and are required on all delivery slips or bills to 'state the rate of the tax separately from the price of the liquid fuels.' Section 5 (72 PS Pa.  2611e). Appellant maintained below and it insists here that, construed to impose the tax in question, the statute is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Federal Constitution (article 1,  8, cl. 3). The trial court held otherwise and gave judgment for the amount claimed. The Supreme Court affirmed. 316 Pa. 33, 173 A. 404.\n Appellant, a Pennsylvania corporation having its principal place of business in Pittsburgh, sells liquid fuels at wholesale and is a distributor as defined by the act. The \n\n[294 U.S. 169, 173]\n\u00a0\n tax in controversy was laid at 3 cents per gallon upon the contents of 13 tank cars sold and delivered by it. All were ordered through its agent in Philadelphia for delivery to purchasers at that city or at Essington, Pa. The orders specified a price per gallon 'f.o.b. Wilmington, Del., plus 3 tax,' and were subject to, and received, appellant's approval at its office in Pittsburgh. The purchasers were not licensed or taxable as distributors. All fuels delivered under these contracts were obtained from Crane Hook Company of Wilmington, Del., and on the order of appellant were shipped by rail from there to the purchasers in Philadelphia or Essington. Each car moved on a bill of lading in which the appellant was consignor and the purchaser was consignee; the place of shipment indicated was Wilmington and the place of destination was consignee's private siding in Philadelphia or Essington. Appellant prepared and sent to the buyer an invoice covering each shipment showing the price as stated in the order.\n The inference that might be drawn from the f.o.b. order, the billing and straight bill of lading that the parties intended delivery to purchaser at place of shipment is negatived by other circumstances. The contracts were executory and related to unascertained goods. Section 19, rule 4(2), Act of May 19, 1915, P.L. 543, 548 (69 PS Pa.  143, rule 4, subd. 2). It does not appear that when they were made appellant had any fuels of the kinds covered or that those to be delivered were then in existence. There was no selection of goods by purchasers. Appellant was not required by the contracts to obtain the fuels at Wilmington but was free to effect performance by shipping from any place within or without Pennsylvania. It is the practice in appellant's business to sell f.o.b. at a specified place in order to fix the price and such billing may be merely price fixing and not an indication of the source or place \n\n[294 U.S. 169, 174]\n\u00a0\n of shipment. The reference to the tax in the orders and invoices would have been unnecessary if delivery were not to be made in Pennsylvania, for if made at Wilmington the transactions would not have been within the provision of the taxing act. Upon these considerations, the state Supreme Court held that the liquid fuels in question were by appellant 'sold and delivered' to purchasers in Pennsylvania. And see Dannemiller v. Kirkpatrick, 201 Pa. 218, 224, 50 A. 928; Frank Pure Food Co. v. Dodson, 281 Pa. 125, 126 A. 243; Charles E. Hires Co. v. Stromeyer, 65 Pa.Super. 241, 243. The ruling is not challenged by appellant and is binding upon it here.\n These contracts did not require or necessarily involve transportation across the state boundary. The precise question is whether the mere fact that appellant caused the fuels to be shipped from Delaware for delivery in tank cars-deemed original packages (Askren v. Continental Oil Co., \n252 \nU.S. 444, 449\n, 40 S.Ct. 355)-on purchasers' sidings as agreed makes imposition of the tax repugnant to the commerce clause. There is nothing to indicate legislative purpose to discriminate against liquid fuels brought into Pennsylvania to be delivered in fulfillment of sales contracts or there to be used or sold. The commerce clause does not prevent taxation of goods by the state in which they are found merely because brought from another state, for that would unduly trammel state power of taxation and produce gross inequality and injustice. Woodruff v. Parham, 8 Wall. 123, 137. The limitation appellant puts on section 4 would operate to the extent of 3 cents a gallon in favor of liquid fuels delivered, as in this case, from a place in another state against those delivered in Pennsylvania from sources in that commonwealth over routes wholly therein. And, if that section may not be constitutionally construed to tax the shipments here in question, then equally free from the burden must be \n\n[294 U.S. 169, 175]\n\u00a0\n liquid fuel transported by rail or truck from Pennsylvania sources to places of delivery in that state over any route not wholly therein.\n Our decisions show that, if goods carried from one state have reached destination in another where they are held in original packages for sale, the latter has power without discrimination to tax them as it does other property within its jurisdiction. Woodruff v. Parham, supra; Brown v. Houston, \n114 \nU.S. 622, 632\n, 5 S.Ct. 1091; American Steel & Wire Co. v. Speed, \n192 U.S. 500\n, 519-522, 24 S.Ct. 365; Sonneborn Bros. v. Cureton, \n262 \nU.S. 506\n, 43 S.Ct. 643. And as that rule applies whether the burden falls directly or indirectly ( Banker Bros. v. Pennsylvania, \n222 \nU.S. 210\n, 32 S.Ct. 38), it is not material whether the tax is upon the sale and delivery or upon the property. Admittedly the sales contracts were made in Pennsylvania. Deliveries to purchasers at destination were made in accordance with the terms of the sales. As interstate transportation was not required or contemplated, it may be deemed as merely incidental. Cf. Moore v. N.Y. Cotton Exchange, \n270 \nU.S. 593, 604\n, 46 S.Ct. 367, 45 A.L.R. 1370; Ware & Leland v. Mobile County, \n209 \nU.S. 405, 412\n, 413 S., 28 S.Ct. 526, 14 Ann.Cas. 1031. The act lays no burden on interstate commerce as such and, if any can be said to result from the imposition, it is indirect and precisely as that which would have resulted if deliveries had been made exclusively by intrastate transportation from Pennsylvania sources. We need not consider whether deliveries to purchasers ended the interstate commerce involved including all incidents that in other connections might constitute an essential part of that which is covered by the commerce clause. Cf. Fed. Trade Com. v. Pac. Paper Trade Ass'n, \n273 \nU.S. 52, 63\n, 47 S.Ct. 255. Upon the principle applied here recently in Minnesota v. Biasius, \n290 \nU.S. 1\n, 54 S.Ct. 34, the liquid fuels were taxable in Pennsylvania.\n Affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote *\n] Rehearing denied \n294 \nU.S. 733\n, 55 S.Ct. 543, 79 L.Ed. --. \n\n\n\n\n","205":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWILSHIRE OIL CO. v.

Murphey, both of Los Angeles, Cal., for Wilshire Oil Co. \n\n[295 U.S. 100, 101]\n\u00a0\n The Attorney General, for the United States.\n\n PER CURIAM.\n The Circuit Court of Appeals has certified to this Court the following questions:\n'(1) Are the standards controlling the production of petroleum in the United States, which production affects (a) interstate commerce in petroleum, and (b) the national security and defense by prevention of waste of the natural resources of petroleum essential for the creation of power in the instruments used in such defense and in maintaining such security, sufficiently stated in the National Industrial Recovery Act to constitute legislation as a basis for the administrative regulation of such production?\n\n'(2) Does the attempted creation of a code of fair competition for the petroleum industry under the provisions of section 3 of title 1 of the National Industrial Recovery Act (15 USCA  703) which code establishes definite and appropriate standards for the regulation of production of petroleum affecting interstate commerce and for preventing its waste as a natural resource contributing to the national defense and security, and authorizes administrative orders limiting the production of the individual producers to an amount less than they otherwise would be entitled to produce, constitute the exercise of a legislative function which the Congress cannot delegate?'\n\n The certificate, dated April 5, 1935, states that certain corporations engaged in the production of petroleum in California have appealed from an order of the District Court granting a preliminary injunction restraining them from producing crude petroleum from their respective wells in excess of amounts allocated by quotas and operating schedules ordered by the Administrator of the Code \n\n[295 U.S. 100, 102]\n\u00a0\n of Fair Competition for the Petroleum Industry. This Court, by its order of April 9, 1935, afforded opportunity to counsel to file briefs upon the question whether the described appeal presents any question other than whether the District Court committed an abuse of discretion in granting an interlocutory injunction, referring to State of Alabama v. United States, \n279 \nU.S. 229\n, 49 S.Ct. 266, and other decisions of this Court. Counsel for the respective parties have filed briefs accordingly.\n Meanwhile the Circuit Court of Appeals has amended its certificate so as to state that the appealing defendants had moved in the District Court to dismiss the bill of complaint upon the ground that it failed to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and had filed an answer reserving that question; that the motion to dismiss was denied and exception reserved at the same time that the order for injunction was granted; that on the hearing in the District Court the question whether the creation of the Petroleum Code by the Executive constituted an exercise of an unlawful delegation of legislative power had been argued and that the contention of the appellants had been overruled. In that view the amended certificate submits that the certified questions are addressed to a power of the Court of Appeals on an appeal from the interlocutory order to decide the question as to the total absence of a cause of action.\n This Court is of opinion that, apart from the objectionable form of the certified questions, which are not aptly or definitely phrased, the question before the Court of Appeals upon the appeal from the interlocutory order is whether the District Court abused its discretion in granting an interlocutory injunction; that the Court of Appeals is not bound to decide, upon the allegations of the bill, an important constitutional question, as to which the Court of Appeals is in doubt, in advance of an appropriate determination by the District Court of the facts \n\n[295 U.S. 100, 103]\n\u00a0\n of the case to which the challenged statute is sought to be applied.\n Nor should this Court undertake to determine the constitutional validity of the statute upon such questions as those which have been certified. If this Court were to deal with the case in its present stage, it would be necessary to order up the entire record, so that the allegatiions of the bill, and the case as presented to the District Court, could be properly considered. That course would merely bring before this Court the interlocutory order and would result in unnecessary delay in the final determination of the cause. The certificate is therefore dismissed.\n Dismissed. \n\n\n\n","206":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nWORTHEN v. KAVANAUGH(1935)\nNo. 556\nArgued: March 7, 1935Decided: April 1, 1935\n\n\n\n Supreme Court looks to laws in force at making of contract to determine obligation thereof (Const. art. 1,  10). \n\n[295 U.S. 56, 57]\n\u00a0\n Messrs. A. W. Dobyns and G. B. Rose, both of Little Rock, Ark., for appellants.\n Mr. John W. Newman, of Little Rock, Ark., for appellee.\n\n Mr. Justice CARDOZO delivered the opinion of the Court.\n Municipal improvement districts organized under the laws of Arkansas are empowered to issue bonds and to mortgage benefit assessments as security therefor. Street Improvement District, No. 513, of Little Rock, Ark., acted under the power thus conferred. On July 1, 1930, it issued bonds, payable to bearer, in the amount of $31,000, and made a mortgage to a firm of bankers as trustee for the bondholders. Accompanying the mortgage was a copy of the assessment of benefits stating in detail the amount of benefits assessed against each piece of property within the improvement district. Some of the bonds were in default on January 1, 1934, for nonpayment of principal and interest. This suit was brought by the trustee and also by representative bondholders to foreclose the assessments upon the lots of delinquent owners and for other relief. The right to maintain the suit is undisputed. The controversy hinges upon the terms of the decree.\n At the execution of the bonds and mortgages, the statutes of Arkansas contained provisions well planned to make these benefit assessments an acceptable security. Under the statutes then in force, lot owners had thirty days for payment of assessments, the time to run from the date of a notice required to be published by the collector. Crawford & Moses' Digest ,  5671. If payment was not made within that time, the collector was \n\n[295 U.S. 56, 58]\n\u00a0\n to add a penalty of 20 per cent., and make immediate return of delinquents to the Board of Commissioners. Section 5673. The duty was then imposed upon the Commissioners to bring foreclosure suits at once. Section 5674. In case of personal service, the defendant was to be required to appear and respond within five days after service. Section 5678. The decree when granted was to add to the assessment the 20 per cent. penalty, costs, and attorneys' fees. Section 5678. In case of constructive service, publication was to becompleted within fifteen days, the cause was to be made ready for hearing within fifteen days thereafter, and a decree was to be rendered as in case of actual service. Section 5679. If the sum adjudged was not paid within ten days, the property was to be sold upon twenty days' notice. Section 5684. The property owner was given time to redeem upon payment of the purchase price, with interest at 10 per cent. if the land had a rental value, and if it had none, then with interest at 20 per cent. Section 5644. The time for redemption was either two years or five; there being uncertainty in that respect as to the meaning of the statute. In any event, the purchaser was to be let into possession at once upon the approval of the sale, and was not to be accountable for rents upon redemption. Section 5642. If there was an appeal from the decree, the Supreme Court was to advance the cause upon its docket, and give a hearing and decision at as early a date as practicable. Section 5686. The transcript was to be filed in the office of the clerk within twenty days after the rendering of the decree appealed from (section 5687), and no appeal was to be prosecuted if that condition was not fulfilled. Section 5689\n\n\n In March, 1933, the Legislature of Arkansas passed three acts (Nos. 278, 252, and 129, pp. 868, 790, 375), which made over the whole plan to enforce the payment of assessments. Under Act No. 278, the time for payment after notice was enlarged from thirty days to ninety; the penalty was \n\n[295 U.S. 56, 59]\n\u00a0\n reduced from 20 per cent. to 3 per cent.; the return of the delinquent list, which till then had to be made forthwith, was to be withheld for another ninety days; the time to appear and answer after personal service, which had formerly been five days, was changed to six months; if service was constructive, there was to be publication for six months (instead of fifteen days), and another six months was to elapse before the cause was to be heard. The decree when rendered was to give still another twelve months for payment (instead of ten days as theretofore) and an additional six months after the new default before the property could be sold. There were to be no costs or attorneys' fees, and only a 3 per cent. penalty. There was also a repeal of the provisions for the expediting of appeals. Under Act No. 252, the time for redemption was fixed at four years from the sale, and the rate of interest (formerly 10 per cent. or 20 per cent.) was reduced to 6 per cent., the statute reciting that the law previously in force did not provide an adequate period of redemption from land sales for delinquent taxes in municipal improvement districts. Finally, under Act No. 129, there was a repeal of section 5642, under which a purchaser had been given the right to go into possession during the term allowed for redemption and to hold such possession without accountability for rents. Coupled with the repeal was the declaration of an emergency, which was stated to endanger the peace, health, and safety of a multitude of citizens.\n Upon the hearing of the foreclosure suit the trustee and the bondholders contested the validity of these statutory changes, and demanded a decree in accordance with the law theretofore in force. The changes were attacked as an unconstitutional impairment of the obligation of contract (United States Constitution, art. 1,  10), as well as upon other grounds. The validity of the new acts was upheld by the Chancery Court, and thereafter on appeal by the Supreme Court of the state. 75 \n\n[295 U.S. 56, 60]\n\u00a0\n S.W.(2d) 62. Cf. Sewer Improvement District, No. 1, of Wynne v. Delinquent Lands, 188 Ark. 738, 68 S.W.(2d) 80. Three judges dissented. The case is here upon appeal. Judicial Code,  237, 28 U.S.C.  344 (28 USCA  344).\n To know the obligation of a contract we look to the laws in force at its making. Sturges v. Crowninshield, 4 Wheat. 122, 197; Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, \n290 \nU.S. 398, 429\n, 54 S.Ct. 231, 88 A.L.R. 1481. In the books there is much talk about distinctions between changes of the substance of the contract and changes of the remedy. Von Hoffman v. City of Quincy, 4 Wall. 535; Louisiana ex rel. Ranger v. New Orleans, \n102 U.S. 203\n; Barnitz v. Beverly, \n163 \nU.S. 118\n, 16 S.Ct. 1042; cf. Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, supra, at pages 429, 434 of 290 U.S., 54 S.Ct. 231, where the cases are assembled. The dividing line is at times obscure. There is no need for the purposes of this case to plot it on the legal map. Not even changes of the remedy may be pressed so far as to cut down the security of a mortgage without moderation or reason or in a spirit of oppression. Even when the public welfare is invoked as an excuse, these bounds must be respected. W. B. Worthen Co. v. Thomas, \n292 \nU.S. 426, 433\n, 54 S.Ct. 816, 93 A.L.R. 173, distinguishing Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, supra. We state the outermost limits only. In stating them we do not exclude the possibility that the bounds are even narrower. The case does not call for definition more precise. A catalogue of the changes imposed upon this mortgage must lead to the conviction that the framers of the amendments have put restraint aside. With studied indifference to the interests of the mortgagee or to his appropriate protection they have taken from the mortgage the quality of an acceptable investment for a rational investor.\n Under the statutes in force at the making of the contract, the property owner was spurred by every motive of self-interest to pay his assessments if he could, and to pay them without delay. Under the present statutes he \n\n[295 U.S. 56, 61]\n\u00a0\n has every incentive to refuse to pay a dollar, either for interest or for principal. The interval between default in payment and a sale in the foreclosure suit was approximately sixty-five days under the practice formerly prevailing, unless there was service by publication or unless a defense was interposed, in which events the time would be a little longer. The interval between default and sale under the amendatory acts is at least two and a half years, and may be a good deal more. The earlier statutes imposed a penalty of 20 per cent. as well as costs and attorneys' fees. The later ones drop the provision for costs and attorneys' fees, and reduce the penalty to 3 per cent. The changes do not end, however, with the rendition of the judgment and the sale thereunder. Under the earlier law the purchaser, who was likely to be the plaintiff mortgagee, could go into possession upon the confirmation of the sale, and keep the rents and profits during the years allowable for redemption. Today this privilege is withdrawn, and for another four years the possession of the delinquent owner is unaffected by the sale. A minimum of six and a half years is thus the total period during which the holder of the mortgage is without an effective remedy. There is no enforceable obligation in the interval to pay installments of the principal or even the accruing coupons. The case is not one in which the chancellor has intervened, either with or without the permission of a statute, to halt the oppressive enforcement of a mortgage by putting off the day of sale or entry for a reasonable time upon compliance by the debtor with reasonable conditions. Relief is not conditioned upon payment of interest and taxes or the rental value of the premises. The case is one of postponement for a term of many years with undisturbed possession for the debtor and without a dollar for the creditor. There is not even a requirement that the debtor shall satisfy the court of his inability to pay. \n\n[295 U.S. 56, 62]\n\u00a0\n Whether one or more of the changes effected by these statutes would be reasonable and valid if separated from the others, there is no occasion to consider. A state is free to regulate the procedure in its courts even with reference to contracts already made (Bronson v. Kinzie, 1 How. 311), and moderate extensions of the time for pleading or for trial will ordinarily fall within the power so reserved. A different situation is presented when extensions are so piled up as to make the remedy a shadow. Penniman's Case, \n103 U.S. 714\n, 720; Oshkosh Waterworks Co. v. Oshkosh, \n187 \nU.S. 437\n, 23 S.Ct. 234; Henley v. Myers, \n215 \nU.S. 373, 385\n, 30 S.Ct. 148; National Surety Co. v. Architectural Decorating Co., \n226 \nU.S. 276\n, 33 S.Ct. 17. What controls our judgment at such times is the underlying reality rather than the form or label. The changes of remedy now challenged as invalid are to be viewed in combination, with the cumulative significance that each imparts to all. So viewed they are seen to be an oppressive and unnecessary destruction of nearly all the incidents that give attractiveness and value to collateral security.\n The point is made in the opinion of the court below that the amendment denying to a purchaser the privilege of possession during the period for redemption does not modify the power of the chancellor to appoint a receiver of the rents during the pendency of a suit if the value of the property is so low as to make the security precarious. This is small comfort for an investor who has put his money into a mortgage in the expectation of receiving a return on his investment. If the value of the property is less than the assessment, a receiver will hold the rents to apply upon the judgment in the event of a deficiency, and will not presently disburse them except for necessary expenses. Booth v. Clark, 17 How. 322, 331; Davis v. Gray, 16 Wall. 203, 218; Grant v. Phoenix Insurance Co., \n106 \nU.S. 429, 431\n, 1 S.Ct. 414; Freedman's Saving & \n\n[295 U.S. 56, 63]\n\u00a0\n Trust Co. v. Shepherd, \n127 \nU.S. 494\n, 8 S.Ct. 1250; Union Nat. Bank of Chicago v. Kansas City Bank, \n136 \nU.S. 223, 236\n, 10 S.Ct. 1013; Porter v. Sabin, \n149 \nU.S. 473, 479\n, 13 S.Ct. 1008. If the value of the property is greater than the assessment, the delinquent owner will keep the rents, for there will then be no receiver; and the mortgagee must wait until the period for redemption has expired. Active bidding at the sale is made virtually impossible. The buyer, almost of necessity, will be the mortgagee himself, who may offset the price against the debt. Strangers will not bid when four years must go by before they can be let into possession and have a return on what they pay.\n Upholders of the challenged acts appeal to the authority of Home Building & Loan Association v. Blaisdell, supra, the case of the Minnesota moratorium. There for a maximum term of two years, but in no event beyond the then existing emergency, a court was empowered, if there was a proper showing of necessity, to stay the foreclosure of a mortgage, but only upon prescribed conditions. 'The mortgagor during the extended period is not ousted from possession, but he must pay the rental value of the premises as ascertained in judicial proceedings and this amount is applied to the carrying of the property and to interest upon the indebtedness.' \n290 U.S. 398\n, at page 445, 54 S.Ct. 231, 243, 88 A.L.R. 1481. None of these restrictions, nor anything approaching them, is present in this case. There has been not even an attempt to assimilate what was done by this decree to the discretionary action of a chancellor in subjecting an equitable remedy to an equitable condition. Not Blaisdell's Case, but Worthen's (W. B. Worthen Co. v. Thomas, supra), supplies the applicable rule.\n The decree is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n Reversed. \n\n\n\n","207":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nYOUNGSTOWN SHEET & TUBE CO. v. UNITED STATES(1935)\nNo. 552\nArgued: April 30, 1935Decided: May 20, 1935\n\n\n\n On Appeal from the District Court of the United States for the Northern District of Ohio.\n Messrs. Frederick H. Wood, of New York City, and August G. Gutheim, of Washington, D.C., for appellants.\n The Attorney General and Mr. Daniel W. Knowlton, of Washington, D.C., \n\n[295 U.S. 476, 477]\n\u00a0\n for appellees the United States and Interstate Commerce Commission.\n Mr. John J. Fitzpatrick, of Baltimore, Md., for appellees railroad interveners.\n Mr. Alexander M. Bull, of Washington, D.C., for appellees trustees of the Consolidated Coal Co., debtor.\n\n Mr. Justice ROBERTS delivered the opinion of the Court.\n This is a suit for the annulment of an order of the Interstate Commerce Commission fixing minimum rates on ex-river coal from Ohio river points to destinations in Northern Ohio. The District Court entered a decree of dismissal. \n1\n The appellants attack the rate order as based upon matters the Commission had no authority to consider and as unsupported by evidence. The appellees opposed these charges and add that the appellants have no standing to maintain the suit.\n Improvement of navigation on the Ohio river and its tributaries has recently made possible shipment of coal in barges from mines at or near the streams to river destinations for use there or for transshipment by rail to inland points. Previously these mines, with others in the same producing territory, were dependent upon the railroads, and a system of rate relationships had been built up as between the producing localities.\n In anticipation of shipment of coal from river points, the rail carriers filed schedules proposing a proportional rate of $1.02 on carloads from Conway and Colona, points on the Ohio, effective May 15, 1929. The Commis-Ohio, \n\n[295 U.S. 476, 478]\n\u00a0\n effective May 15, 1929. The Commission suspended them, and instituted an investigation. It found the proposed rate unreasonable, and declared a reasonable maximum would be 77 cents; but contented itself with ordering the scheduled rate of $1.02 canceled, and did not require that a maximum rate of 77 cents be adopted. 2 Subsequently the Commission held an investigatioin respecting proposed schedules of rates on exriver coal from points farther down the Ohio river to Canton, Massillon, Cleveland, Lorain, and South Lorain, Ohio. It canceled these and found lower rates would be reasonable, but did not prescribe them. 3 Upon the carriers' compliance with the views of the Commission, by the establishment of the suggested rates, tonnage began to move in quantity. Meantime the Ohio Public Utilities Commission permitted and authorized reductions in intrastate coal rates, with the result that the Interstate Commerce Commission instituted a thirteenth section proceeding, found the interstate rail rates from the Pittsburg and Connellsville districts to Northeastern Ohio destinations reasonable, and required the restoration of the old intrastate rates to avoid discrimination against interstate commerce. \n4\n While that proceeding was pending, certain carriers prayed a rehearing of the two ex-river cases above mentioned. This was granted, the cases consolidated, further evidence received and an order made in which the rate from Colona and Conway to Youngstown was fixed at not less than 90 cents, that from the lower river points to Canton and Massillon at not less than $1.20, and to Cleveland and Lorain at not less than $1.45.5 \n\n[295 U.S. 476, 479]\n\u00a0\n The Commission finds: These prescribed minima are reasonable; lower rates would create undue discrimination against shippers in origin districts who cannot use the water-rail route, and would tend to disrupt the rate structure, and to destroy the proper differentials between various producing districts on shipments to Ohio destinations. These findings have ample support in the evidence.\n\n 1. \nThe appellants were entitled to bring and maintain this suit to set aside the order. \n6\n They were parties to the proceeding before the Commission, had a pecuniary interest in the rates and were affected by the order. The authorities cited by the appellees are to be distinguished on the ground that the plaintiffs either had no legal interest or capacity to sue or failed to allege that the rates under attack were unreasonable or discriminated against them.' \n7\n\u00a0\n\n\n 2. \nThe appellants' principal complaint is that the Commission raised the permissible minimum rate to prevent disruption of the existing rate structure and relationship of rates for carriage from various producting regions to Ohio destinations, and that an order grounded upon any such consideration is unauthorized and violates the principle announced in United States v. Chicago, M., St. P. & P.R. Co., \n294 \nU.S. 499\n, 55 S.Ct. 462 (Oct. T. 1934). The position is not well taken. This record exhibits a situation quite distinct from that \n\n[295 U.S. 476, 480]\n\u00a0\n disclosed in the cited case. In the first place the Commission here found the required minimum reasonable; in the second place, it had, after full investigation in this and the Ohio case8 held the existing rate structure- built upon certain reasonable key or controlling rates by application of proper differentials-just and reasonable, and the ex-river rates here in issue, in contrast, too low. Comparisons of other rates in the same or adjacent territory, while not a conclusive test of reasonableness of a rate under investigation, have probative value. \n9\n There was much other evidence bearing upon the character of the service and cost. The order of the Commission was based primarily upon the reasonableness of the minimum prescribed. The existing rate structure furnished support for the finding of reasonableness.\n\n 3. \nThere is no merit in the contention that the order was a section three order and invalid for failure to afford the carriers an alternative of raising the contested rate or lowering others to remove discrimination. It is true the Commission found prejudice to shippers all rail, but in essence the order entered was a section fifteen order and not one made under section three. \n10\n\u00a0\n\n Decree affirmed. \n\nFootnotes\n\n[\nFootnote 1\n] 7 F.Supp. 33. \n\n[\nFootnote 2\n] 163 I.C.C. 3. \n[\nFootnote 3\n] 185 I.C.C. 211. \n[\nFootnote 4\n] 192 I.C.C. 413.
