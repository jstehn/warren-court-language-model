States Supreme Court\nMCLANE CO., INC. v. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION(2017)\nNo. 15-1248\nArgued: February 21, 2017Decided: April 3, 2017\n\n\nDamiana Ochoa worked for eight years in a physically demanding job for petitioner McLane Co., a supply-chain services company.  McLane requires employees in those positions--both new employees and those returning from medical leave--to take a physical evaluation.  When Ochoa returned from three months of maternity leave, she failed the evaluation three times and was fired.  She then filed a sex discrimination charge under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The Equal Employment Opportunity (EEOC) began an investigation, but McLane declined its request for so-called \"pedigree information\": names, Social Security numbers, addresses, and telephone numbers of employees asked to take the evaluation.  After the EEOC expanded the investigation's scope both geographically (to cover McLane's national operations) and substantively (to investigate possible age discrimination), it issued subpoenas, as authorized by 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-9, requesting pedigree information relating to its new investigation.  When McLane refused to provide the information, the EEOC filed two actions in Federal District Court--one arising out of Ochoa's charge and one arising out of the EEOC's own age-discrimination charge--seeking enforcement of its subpoenas.  The District Judge declined to enforce the subpoenas, finding that the pedigree information was not relevant to the charges, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  Reviewing the District Court's decision to quash the subpoena de\u00a0novo, the court concluded that the lower court erred in finding the pedigree information irrelevant.  \nHeld:\u00a0A district court's decision whether to enforce or quash an EEOC subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, not de novo.  Pp.\u00a06-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Both factors that this Court examines when considering whether such decision should be subject to searching or deferential appellate review point toward abuse-of-discretion review.  First, the longstanding practice of the courts of appeals is to review a district court's decision to enforce or quash an administrative subpoena for abuse of discretion.  Title VII confers on the EEOC the same authority to issue subpoenas that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) confers on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  During the three decades between the NLRA's enactment and the incorporation of its subpoena-enforcement provisions into Title VII, every Circuit to consider the question had held that a district court's decision on enforcement of an NLRB subpoena is subject to abuse-of-discretion review.  Congress amended Title VII to authorize EEOC subpoenas against this uniform backdrop of deferential appellate review, and today, nearly every Court of Appeals reviews a district court's decision whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena for abuse of discretion.  This \"long history of appellate practice,\" Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.\u00a0S. 552, 558, carries significant persuasive weight.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, basic principles of institutional capacity counsel in favor of deferential review.  In most cases, the district court's enforcement decision will turn either on whether the evidence sought is relevant to the specific charge or whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome in light of the circumstances.  Both of these tasks are well suited to a district judge's expertise.  The first requires the district court to evaluate the relationship between the particular materials sought and the particular matter under investigation--an analysis \"variable in relation to the nature, purposes and scope of the inquiry.\"  Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.\u00a0S. 186, 209.  And whether a subpoena is overly burdensome turns on the nature of the materials sought and the difficulty the employer will face in producing them--\"\u00a0'fact-intensive, close calls'\u00a0\" better suited to resolution by the district court than the court of appeals.  Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.\u00a0S. 384, 404.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other functional considerations also show the appropriateness of abuse-of-discretion review.  For one, the district courts' considerable experience in making similar decisions in other contexts, see Buford v. United States, 532 U.\u00a0S. 59, 66, gives them the \"institutional advantag[e],\" id., at 64, that comes with greater experience.  Deferential review also \"streamline[s] the litigation process by freeing appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence and reconsidering facts already weighed and considered by the district court,\" Cooter & Gell, 496 U.\u00a0S., at 404, something particularly important in a proceeding designed only to facilitate the EEOC's investigation.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Court-appointed amicus' arguments in support of de\u00a0novo review are not persuasive.  Amicus claims that the district court's primary task is to test a subpoena's legal sufficiency and thus requires no exercise of discretion. But that characterization is not inconsistent with abuse-of-discretion review, which may be employed to insulate the trial judge's decision from appellate review for the same kind of functional concerns that underpin the Court's conclusion that abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also unlikely that affording deferential review to a district court's subpoena decision would clash with Court of Appeals decisions that instructed district courts to defer to the EEOC's determination about the relevance of evidence to the charge at issue.  Such decisions are better read as resting on the established rule that the term \"relevant\" be understood \"generously\" to permit the EEOC \"access to virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer.\"  EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U.\u00a0S. 54, 68-69.  Nor do the constitutional underpinnings of the Shell Oil standard require a different result.  While this Court has described a subpoena as a \"\u00a0'constructive' search,\" Oklahoma Press, 327 U.\u00a0S., at 202, and implied that the Fourth Amendment is the source of the requirement that a subpoena not be \"too indefinite,\" United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.\u00a0S. 632, 652, not every decision touching on the Fourth Amendment is subject to searching review.  See, e.g., United States v. Nixon, 418 U.\u00a0S. 683, 702.  Cf.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[April 3, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 permits the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) to issue a subpoena to obtain evidence from an employer that is relevant to a pending investigation.  The statute authorizes a district court to issue an order enforcing such a subpoena.  The question presented here is whether a court of appeals should review a district court's decision to enforce or quash an EEOC subpoena de\u00a0novo or for abuse of discretion.  This decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\"  \u00a7703(a), 78 Stat. 255, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-2(a).  The statute entrusts the enforcement of that prohibition to the EEOC.  See \u00a72000e-5(a); EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U.\u00a0S. 54, 61-62 (1984).  The EEOC's responsibilities \"are triggered by the filing of a specific sworn charge of discrimination,\" University of Pa. v. EEOC, 493 U.\u00a0S. 182, 190 (1990), which can be filed either by the person alleging discrimination or by the EEOC itself, see \u00a72000e-5(b).  When it receives a charge, the EEOC must first notify the employer, ibid., and must then investigate \"to determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that the charge is true,\" University of Pa., 493 U.\u00a0S., at 190 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case is about one of the tools the EEOC has at its disposal in conducting its investigation: a subpoena.  In order \"[t]o enable the [EEOC] to make informed decisions at each stage of the enforcement process,\" Title VII \"confers a broad right of access to relevant evidence.\"  Id., at 191.  It provides that the EEOC \"shall .\u00a0.\u00a0. have access to, for the purposes of examination, .\u00a0.\u00a0. any evidence of any person being investigated or proceeded against that relates to unlawful employment practices covered by\" Title VII and \"is relevant to the charge under investigation.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-8(a).  And the statute enables the EEOC to obtain that evidence by \"authoriz[ing] [it] to issue a subpoena and to seek an order enforcing [the subpoena].\"  University of Pa., 493 U.\u00a0S., at 191; see \u00a72000e-9.1  Under that authority, the EEOC may issue \"subp[o]enas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses or the production of any evidence.\"  29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7161(1).  An employer may petition the EEOC to revoke the subpoena, see ibid., but if the EEOC rejects the petition and the employer still \"refuse[s] to obey [the] subp[o]ena,\" the EEOC may ask a district court to issue an order enforcing it, see \u00a7161(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A district court's role in an EEOC subpoena enforcement proceeding, we have twice explained, is a straightforward one.  See University of Pa., 493 U.\u00a0S., at 191; Shell Oil, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 72, n. 26.  A district court is not to use an enforcement proceeding as an opportunity to test the strength of the underlying complaint.  Ibid.  Rather, a district court should \"\u00a0'satisfy itself that the charge is valid and that the material requested is \"relevant\" to the charge.'\u00a0\"  University of Pa., 493 U.\u00a0S., at 191.  It should do so cognizant of the \"generou[s]\" construction that courts have given the term \"relevant.\"  Shell Oil, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 68-69 (\"virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer\").  If the charge is proper and the material requested is relevant, the district court should enforce the subpoena unless the employer establishes that the subpoena is \"too indefinite,\" has been issued for an \"illegitimate purpose,\" or is unduly burdensome.  Id., at 72, n. 26.  See United States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.\u00a0S. 632, 652-653 (1950) (\"The gist of the protection is in the requirement .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the disclosure sought shall not be unreasonable\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case arises out of a Title VII suit filed by a woman named Damiana Ochoa.  Ochoa worked for eight years as a \"cigarette selector\" for petitioner McLane Co., a supply-chain services company.  According to McLane, the job is a demanding one: Cigarette selectors work in distribution centers, where they are required to lift, pack, and move large bins containing products.  McLane requires employees taking physically demanding jobs--both new employees and employees returning from medical leave--to take a physical evaluation.  According to McLane, the evaluation \"tests .\u00a0.\u00a0. range of motion, resistance, and speed\" and \"is designed, administered, and validated by a third party.\"  Brief for Petitioner 6.  In 2007, Ochoa took three months of maternity leave.  When she attempted to return to work, McLane asked her to take the evaluation.  Ochoa attempted to pass the evaluation three times, but failed.  McLane fired her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ochoa filed a charge of discrimination, alleging (among other things) that she had been fired on the basis of her gender.  The EEOC began an investigation, and--at its request--McLane provided it with basic information about the evaluation, as well as a list of anonymous employees that McLane had asked to take the evaluation.  McLane's list included each employee's gender, role at the company, and evaluation score, as well as the reason each employee had been asked to take the evaluation.  But the company refused to provide what the parties call \"pedigree information\": the names, Social Security numbers, last known addresses, and telephone numbers of the employees who had been asked to take the evaluation.  Upon learning that McLane used the evaluation nationwide, the EEOC expanded the scope of its investigation, both geographi-cally (to focus on McLane's nationwide operations) and substantively (to investigate whether McLane had discriminated against its employees on the basis of age).  It issued subpoenas requesting pedigree information as it related to its new investigation.  But McLane refused to provide the pedigree information, and so the EEOC filed two actions in Federal District Court--one arising out of Ochoa's charge and one arising out of a separate age-discrimination charge the EEOC itself had filed--seeking enforcement of its subpoenas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The enforcement actions were assigned to the same District Judge, who, after a hearing, declined to enforce the subpoenas to the extent that they sought the pedigree information.  See EEOC v. McLane Co., 2012 WL 1132758, *5 (D Ariz., Apr. 4, 2012) (age discrimination charge); Civ. No. 12-2469 (D Ariz., Nov. 19, 2012), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28-30 (Title VII charge).2  In the District Court's view, the pedigree information was not \"relevant\" to the charges because \"\u00a0'an individual's name, or even an interview he or she could provide if contacted, simply could not shed light on whether the [evaluation] represents a tool of .\u00a0.\u00a0. discrimination.'\u00a0\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 29 (quoting 2012 WL 1132758, at *5; some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit reversed.  See 804 F.\u00a03d 1051 (2015).  Consistent with Circuit precedent, the panel reviewed the District Court's decision to quash the subpoena de\u00a0novo, and concluded that the District Court had erred in finding the pedigree information irrelevant.  Id., at 1057.  But the panel questioned in a footnote why de\u00a0novo review applied, observing that its sister Circuits \"appear[ed] to review issues related to enforcement of administrative subpoenas for abuse of discretion.\"  Id., at 1056, n.\u00a03; see infra, at 7 (reviewing Court of Appeals authority).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court granted certiorari to resolve the disagreement between the Courts of Appeals over the appropriate standard of review for the decision whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  Because the United States agrees with McLane that such a decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, Stephen B. Kinnard was appointed as amicus curiae to defend the judgment below.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  He has ably discharged his duties.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When considering whether a district court's decision should be subject to searching or deferential appellate review--at least absent \"explicit statutory command\"--we traditionally look to two factors.  Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.\u00a0S. 552, 558 (1988).  First, we ask whether the \"history of appellate practice\" yields an answer.  Ibid.  Second, at least where \"neither a clear statutory prescription nor a historical tradition exists,\" we ask whether, \"\u00a0'as a matter of the sound administration of justice, one judicial actor is better positioned than another to decide the issue in question.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 558, 559-560 (quoting Miller v. Fenton, 474 U.\u00a0S. 104, 114 (1985)).  Both factors point toward abuse-of-discretion review here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the longstanding practice of the courts of appeals in reviewing a district court's decision to enforce or quash an administrative subpoena is to review that decision for abuse of discretion.  That practice predates even Title VII itself.  As noted, Title VII confers on the EEOC the same authority to issue subpoenas that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) confers on the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).  See n.\u00a01, supra.  During the three decades between the enactment of the NLRA and the incorporation of the NLRA's subpoena-enforcement provisions into Title VII, every Circuit to consider the question had held that a district court's decision whether to enforce an NLRB subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.  See NLRB v. Consolidated Vacuum Corp., 395 F.\u00a02d 416, 419-420 (CA2 1968); NLRB v. Friedman, 352 F.\u00a02d 545, 547 (CA3 1965); NLRB v. Northern Trust Co., 148 F.\u00a02d 24, 29 (CA7 1945); Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. NLRB, 122 F.\u00a02d 450, 453-454 (CA6 1941).  By the time Congress amended Title VII to authorize EEOC subpoenas in 1972, it did so against this uniform backdrop of deferential appellate review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, nearly as uniformly, the Courts of Appeals apply the same deferential review to a district court's decision as to whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena.  Almost every Court of Appeals reviews such a decision for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., EEOC v. Kronos Inc., 620 F.\u00a03d 287, 295-296 (CA3 2010); EEOC v. Randstad, 685 F.\u00a03d 433, 442 (CA4 2012); EEOC v. Roadway Express, Inc., 261 F.\u00a03d 634, 638 (CA6 2001); EEOC v. United Air Lines, Inc., 287 F. 3d 643, 649 (CA7 2002); EEOC v. Technocrest Systems, Inc., 448 F.\u00a03d 1035, 1038 (CA8 2006); EEOC v. Dillon Companies, Inc., 310 F.\u00a03d 1271, 1274 (CA10 2002); EEOC v. Royal Caribbean Cruises, Ltd., 771 F.\u00a03d 757, 760 (CA11 2014) (per curiam).  As Judge Watford--writing for the panel below--recognized, the Ninth Circuit alone applies a more searching form of review.  See 804 F.\u00a03d, at 1056, n.\u00a03 (\"Why we review questions of relevance and undue burden de\u00a0novo is unclear\"); see also EPA v. Alyeska Pipeline Serv. Co., 836 F.\u00a02d 443, 445-446 (CA9 1988) (holding that de\u00a0novo review applies).  To be sure, the inquiry into the appropriate standard of review cannot be resolved by a head-counting exercise.  But the \"long history of appellate practice\" here, Pierce, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 558, carries significant persuasive weight.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, basic principles of institutional capacity counsel in favor of deferential review.  The decision whether to enforce an EEOC subpoena is a case-specific one that turns not on \"a neat set of legal rules,\" Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.\u00a0S. 213, 232 (1983), but instead on the application of broad standards to \"multifarious, fleeting, special, narrow facts that utterly resist generalization,\" Pierce, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 561-562 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the mine run of cases, the district court's decision whether to enforce a subpoena will turn either on whether the evidence sought is relevant to the specific charge before it or whether the subpoena is unduly burdensome in light of the circumstances.  Both tasks are well suited to a district judge's expertise.  The decision whether evidence sought is relevant requires the district court to evaluate the relationship between the particular materials sought and the particular matter under investigation--an analysis \"variable in relation to the nature, purposes and scope of the inquiry.\"  Oklahoma Press Publishing Co. v. Walling, 327 U.\u00a0S. 186, 209 (1946).  Similarly, the decision whether a subpoena is overly burdensome turns on the nature of the materials sought and the difficulty the employer will face in producing them.  These inquiries are \"generally not amenable to broad per\u00a0se rules,\" Sprint\/United Management Co. v. Mendelsohn, 552 U.\u00a0S. 379, 387 (2008); rather, they are the kind of \"fact-intensive, close calls\" better suited to resolution by the district court than the court of appeals, Cooter & Gell v. Hartmarx Corp., 496 U.\u00a0S. 384, 404 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other functional considerations also show that abuse-of-discretion review is appropriate here.  For one, district courts have considerable experience in other contexts making decisions similar--though not identical--to those they must make in this one.  See Buford v. United States, 532 U.\u00a0S. 59, 66 (2001) (\"[T]he comparatively greater expertise\" of the district court may counsel in favor of deferential review).  District courts decide, for instance, whether evidence is relevant at trial, Fed. Rule Evid. 401; whether pretrial criminal subpoenas are unreasonable in scope, Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(c)(2); and more.  These decisions are not the same as the decisions a district court must make in enforcing an administrative subpoena.  But they are similar enough to give the district court the \"institutional advantag[e],\" Buford, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 64, that comes with greater experience.  For another, as we noted in Cooter & Gell, deferential review \"streamline[s] the litigation process by freeing appellate courts from the duty of reweighing evidence and reconsidering facts already weighed and considered by the district court,\" 496 U.\u00a0S., at 404--a particularly important consideration in a \"satellite\" proceeding like this one, ibid., designed only to facilitate the EEOC's investigation.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amicus' arguments to the contrary have aided our consideration of this case.  But they do not persuade us that de\u00a0novo review is appropriate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amicus' central argument is that the decision whether a subpoena should be enforced does not require the exercise of discretion on the part of the district court, and so it should not be reviewed for abuse of discretion.  On amicus' view, the district court's primary role is to test the legal sufficiency of the subpoena, not to weigh whether it should be enforced as a substantive matter.  Cf. Shell Oil, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 72, n. 26 (rejecting the argument that the district court should assess the validity of the underlying claim in a proceeding to enforce a subpoena).  Even accepting amicus' view of the district court's task, however, this understanding of abuse-of-discretion review is too narrow.  As commentators have observed, abuse-of-discretion review is employed not only where a decisionmaker has \"a wide range of choice as to what he decides, free from the constraints which characteristically attach whenever legal rules enter the decision[making] process\"; it is also employed where the trial judge's decision is given \"an unusual amount of insulation from appellate revision\" for functional reasons.  Rosenberg, Judicial Discretion of the Trial Court, Viewed From Above, 22 Syracuse L.\u00a0Rev. 635, 637 (1971); see also 22 C. Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a75166.1 (2d ed. 2012).  And as we have explained, it is in large part due to functional concerns that we conclude the district court's decision should be reviewed for abuse of discretion.  Even if the district court's decision can be characterized in the way that amicus suggests, that characterization would not be inconsistent with abuse-of-discretion review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor are we persuaded by amicus' remaining arguments.  Amicus argues that affording deferential review to a district court's decision would clash with Court of Appeals decisions instructing district courts to defer themselves to the EEOC's determination that evidence is relevant to the charge at issue.  See Director, Office of Thrift Supervision, v. Vinson & Elkins, LLP, 124 F.\u00a03d 1304, 1307 (CADC 1997) (district courts should defer to agency appraisals of relevance unless they are \"obviously wrong\"); EEOC v. Lockheed Martin Corp., Aero & Naval Systems, 116 F.\u00a03d 110, 113 (CA4 1997) (same).  In amicus' view, it is \"analytically impossible\" for the court of appeals to defer to the district court if the district court must itself defer to the agency.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29.  We think the better reading of those cases is that they rest on the established rule that the term \"relevant\" be understood \"generously\" to permit the EEOC \"access to virtually any material that might cast light on the allegations against the employer.\"  Shell Oil, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 68-69.  A district court deciding whether evidence is \"relevant\" under Title VII need not defer to the EEOC's decision on that score; it must simply answer the question cognizant of the agency's broad authority to seek and obtain evidence.  Because the statute does not set up any scheme of double deference, amicus' arguments as to the infirmities of such a scheme are misplaced.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor do we agree that, as amicus suggests, the constitutional underpinnings of the Shell Oil standard require a different result.  To be sure, we have described a subpoena as a \"\u00a0'constructive' search,\" Oklahoma Press, 327 U.\u00a0S., at 202, and implied that the Fourth Amendment is the source of the requirement that a subpoena not be \"too indefinite,\" Morton Salt, 338 U.\u00a0S., at 652.  But not every decision that touches on the Fourth Amendment is subject to searching review.  Subpoenas in a wide variety of other contexts also implicate the privacy interests protected by the Fourth Amendment, but courts routinely review the enforcement of such subpoenas for abuse of discretion.  See, e.g., United States v. Nixon, 418 U.\u00a0S. 683, 702 (1974) (pretrial subpoenas duces tecum); In\u00a0re Grand Jury Subpoena, 696 F.\u00a03d 428, 432 (CA5 2012) (grand jury subpoenas); In\u00a0re Grand Jury Proceedings, 616 F.\u00a03d 1186, 1201 (CA10 2010) (same).  And this Court has emphasized that courts should pay \"great deference\" to a magistrate judge's determination of probable cause, Gates, 462 U.\u00a0S., at 236 (internal quotation marks omitted)--a decision more akin to a district court's preenforcement review of a subpoena than the warrantless searches and seizures we considered in Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 690 (1996), on which amicus places great weight.  The constitutional pedigree of Shell Oil does not change our view of the correct standard of review.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, a district court's decision to enforce an EEOC subpoena should be reviewed for abuse of discretion, not de\u00a0novo.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States also argues that the judgment below can be affirmed because it is clear that the District Court abused its discretion.  But \"we are a court of review, not of first view,\" Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005), and the Court of Appeals has not had the chance to review the District Court's decision under the appropriate standard.  That task is for the Court of Appeals in the first instance.  As part of its analysis, the Court of Appeals may also consider, as and to the extent it deems appropriate, any arguments made by McLane regarding the burdens imposed by the subpoena.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is hereby vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nOpinion of Ginsburg, J.\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1248\nMcLANE COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER v. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[April 3, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I agree with the Court that \"abuse of discretion\" is generally the proper review standard for district court decisions reviewing agency subpoenas, I would nevertheless affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment in this case.  As the Court of Appeals explained, the District Court's refusal to enforce the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) subpoena for pedigree information rested on a legal error.  Lower court resolution of a question of law is ordinarily reviewable de\u00a0novo on appeal.  Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, and n.\u00a02 (2014) (slip op., at 4, and n.\u00a02).  According to the District Court, it was not yet \"necessary [for the EEOC] to seek such information.\"  2012 WL 5868959, *6 (D Ariz., Nov. 19, 2012).  As the Ninth Circuit correctly conveyed, however: \"The EEOC does not have to show a 'particularized necessity of access, beyond a showing of mere relevance,' to obtain evidence.\"  804 F.\u00a03d 1051, 1057 (2015) (quoting University of Pa. v. EEOC, 493 U.\u00a0S. 182, 188 (1990)).  Because the District Court erred as a matter of law in demanding that the EEOC show more than relevance in order to gain enforcement of its subpoena, I would not disturb the Court of Appeals' judgment. \n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The statute does so by conferring on the EEOC the same authority given to the National Labor Relations Board to conduct investigations.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-9 (\"For the purpose of all .\u00a0.\u00a0. investigations conducted by the Commission .\u00a0.\u00a0. section 161 of title 29 shall apply\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0The District Court also refused to enforce the subpoena to the extent that it sought a second category of evidence: information about when and why those employees who had been fired after taking the test had been fired.  The District Court provided no explanation for not enforcing the subpoena to the extent it sought this information, and the Court of Appeals reversed on that ground.  804 F.\u00a03d 1051, 1059 (CA9 2015).  McLane does not challenge this aspect of the Court of Appeals' decision.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.\nFootnote 3\u00a0To be sure, there are pure questions of law embedded in a district court's decision to enforce or quash a subpoena.  Whether a charge is \"valid,\" EEOC v. Shell Oil Co., 466 U.\u00a0S. 54, 72, n. 26 (1984)--that is, legally sufficient--is a pure question of law.  And the question whether a district court employed the correct standard of relevance, see id., at 68-69--as opposed to how it applied that standard to the facts of a given case--is a question of law.

DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-5294\nArgued: April 24, 2017Decided: June 19, 2017\n\n\nAke v. Oklahoma, 470 U.\u00a0S. 68, 83, clearly established that when an indigent \"defendant demonstrates .\u00a0.\u00a0. that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant fact at trial, the State must\" provide the defendant with \"access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One month after Ake was decided, Alabama charged petitioner McWilliams with rape and murder.  Finding him indigent, the trial court appointed counsel, who requested a psychiatric evaluation of McWilliams.  The court granted the motion and the State convened a commission, which concluded that McWilliams was competent to stand trial and had not been suffering from mental illness at the time of the alleged offense.  A jury convicted McWilliams of capital murder and recommended a death sentence.  Later, while the parties awaited McWilliams' judicial sentencing hearing, McWilliams' counsel asked for neurological and neuropsychological testing of McWilliams.  The court agreed and McWilliams was examined by Dr. Goff.  Dr. Goff filed a report two days before the judicial sentencing hearing.  He concluded that McWilliams was likely exaggerating his symptoms, but nonetheless appeared to have some genuine neuropsychological problems.  Just before the hearing, counsel also received updated records from the commission's evaluation and previously subpoenaed mental health records from the Alabama Department of Corrections.  At the hearing, defense counsel requested a continuance in order to evaluate all the new material, and asked for the assistance of someone with expertise in psychological matters to review the findings.  The trial court denied defense counsel's requests.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the court sentenced McWilliams to death.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On appeal, McWilliams argued that the trial court denied him the right to meaningful expert assistance guarantee by Ake.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed McWilliams' conviction and sentence, holding that Dr. Goff's examination satisfied Ake's requirements.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, and McWilliams failed to obtain state postconviction relief.  On federal habeas review, a Magistrate Judge also found that the Goff examination satisfied Ake and, therefore, that the State Court of Criminal Appeals' decision was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  Adopting the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation, the District Court denied relief.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Ake clearly established that when certain threshold criteria are met, the state must provide a defendant with access to a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively \"conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\"  470 U.\u00a0S., at 83.  The Alabama courts' determination that McWilliams received all the assistance to which Ake entitled him was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.  Pp.\u00a011-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Three preliminary issues require resolution.  First, the conditions that trigger Ake's application are present.  McWilliams is and was an \"indigent defendant,\" 470 U.\u00a0S., at 70, and his \"mental condition\" was both \"relevant to .\u00a0.\u00a0. the punishment he might suffer,\" id., at 80, and \"seriously in question,\" id., at 70.  Second, this Court rejects Alabama's claim the State was relieved of its Ake obligations because McWilliams received brief assistance from a volunteer psychologist at the University of Alabama.  Even if the episodic help of an outside volunteer could satisfy Ake, the State does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that the volunteer psychologist was available to the defense at the judicial sentencing proceeding.  Third, contrary to Alabama's suggestion, the record indicates that McWilliams did not get all the mental health assistance that he requested.  Rather, he asked for additional help at the judicial sentencing hearing, but was rebuffed.  Pp.\u00a011-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0This Court does not have to decide whether Ake requires a State to provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team.  That is because Alabama did not meet even Ake's most basic requirements in this case.  Ake requires more than just an examination.  It requires that the State provide the defense with \"access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate [1] examination and assist in [2] evaluation, [3] preparation, and [4] presentation of the defense.\"  470 U.\u00a0S., at 83.  Even assuming that Alabama met the examination requirement, it did not meet any of the other three.  No expert helped the defense evaluate the Goff report or McWilliams' extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy.  No expert helped the defense prepare and present arguments that might, e.g., have explained that McWilliams' purported malingering was not necessarily inconsistent with mental illness.  No expert helped the defense prepare direct or cross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearing.  Since Alabama's provision of mental health assistance fell so dramatically short of Ake's requirements, the Alabama courts' decision affirming McWilliams' sentence was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  Pp.\u00a013-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit should determine on remand whether the Alabama courts' error had the \"substantial and injurious effect or influence\" required to warrant a grant of habeas relief, Davis v.

McWILLIAMS, PETITIONER v. JEFFERSON S. DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[June 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirty-one years ago, petitioner James Edmond McWilliams, Jr., was convicted of capital murder by an Alabama jury and sentenced to death.  McWilliams challenged his sentence on appeal, arguing that the State had failed to provide him with the expert mental health assistance the Constitution requires, but the Alabama courts refused to grant relief.  We now consider, in this habeas corpus case, whether the Alabama courts' refusal was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  We hold that it was.  Our decision in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.\u00a0S. 68 (1985), clearly established that, when certain threshold criteria are met, the State must provide an indigent defendant with access to a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively \"assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\"  Id., at 83.  Petitioner in this case did not receive that assistance.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McWilliams and the State of Alabama agree that Ake (which this Court decided in February 1985) sets forth the applicable constitutional standards.  Before turning to the circumstances of McWilliams' case, we describe what the Court held in Ake.  We put in italics language that we find particularly pertinent here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court began by stating that the \"issue in this case is whether the Constitution requires that an indigent defendant have access to the psychiatric examination and assistance necessary to prepare an effective defense based on his mental condition, when his sanity at the time of the offense is seriously in question.\"  Id., at 70 (emphasis added).  The Court said it would consider that issue within the framework of earlier cases granting \"an indigent defendant .\u00a0.\u00a0. a fair opportunity to present his defense\" and \"to participate meaningfully in a judicial proceeding in which his liberty is at stake.\"  Id., at 76.  \"Meaningful access to justice,\" the Court added, \"has been the consistent theme of these cases.\"  Id., at 77.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court then wrote that \"when the State has made the defendant's mental condition relevant to his criminal culpability and to the punishment he might suffer, the assistance of a psychiatrist may well be crucial to the defendant's ability to marshal his defense.\"  Id., at 80.  A psychiatrist may, among other things, \"gather facts,\" \"analyze the information gathered and from it draw  plausible conclusions,\" and \"know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers.\"  Ibid.  These and related  considerations\n\"lea[d] inexorably to the conclusion that, without the assistance of a psychiatrist to conduct a professional examination on issues relevant to the defense, to help determine whether the insanity defense is viable, to present testimony, and to assist in preparing the cross-examination of a State's psychiatric witnesses, the risk of an inaccurate resolution of sanity issues is extremely high.  With such assistance, the defendant is fairly able to present at least enough information to the jury, in a meaningful manner, as to permit it to make a sensible determination.\"  Id., at 82 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court concluded: \"We therefore hold that when a defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial, the State must, at a minimum, assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. Our concern is that the indigent defendant have access to a competent psychiatrist for the[se] purpose[s].\"  Id., at 83 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ake thus clearly establishes that when its threshold criteria are met, a State must provide a mental health professional capable of performing a certain role: \"conduct[ing] an appropriate examination and assist[ing] in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\"  Ibid.  Unless a defendant is \"assure[d]\" the assistance of someone who can effectively perform these functions, he has not received the \"minimum\" to which Ake entitles him.  Ibid.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One month after this Court decided Ake, the State of Alabama charged McWilliams with rape and murder.  The trial court found McWilliams indigent and provided him with counsel.  It also granted counsel's pretrial motion for a psychiatric evaluation of McWilliams' sanity, including aspects of his mental condition relevant to \"mitigating circumstances to be considered in a capital case in the sentencing stage.\"  T. 1526.  (\"T.\" refers to the certified trial record; \"P. C. T.\" refers to the certified court reporter's state postconviction proceedings transcript.)   The court ordered the State to convene a \"Lunacy Commission,\" which would examine McWilliams and file a report with the court.  See id., at 1528-1529.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsequently a three-member Lunacy Commission examined McWilliams at a state hospital, the Taylor Hardin Secure Medical Facility.  The three members, all psychiatrists, concluded that McWilliams was competent to stand trial and that he had not been suffering from mental illness at the time of the alleged offense.  Id., at 1544-1546.  One of them, Dr. Kamal Nagi, wrote that \"Mr. McWilliams is grossly exaggerating his psychological symptoms to mimic mental illness.\"  Id., at 1546.  Dr. Nagi noted that McWilliams' performance on one of the tests \"suggested that [McWilliams] had exaggerated his endorsement of symptoms of illness and the profile was considered a 'fake bad.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McWilliams' trial took place in late August 1986.  On August 26 the jury convicted him of capital murder.  The prosecution sought the death penalty, which under then-applicable Alabama law required both a jury recommendation (with at least 10 affirmative votes) and a later determination by the judge.  See Ala. Code \u00a713A-5-46(f) (1986).  The jury-related portion of the sentencing proceeding took place the next day.  The prosecution reintroduced evidence from the guilt phase and called a police officer to testify that McWilliams had a prior conviction.  T. 1297, 1299-1303. The defense called McWilliams and his  mother.  Both testified that McWilliams, when a child, had suffered multiple serious head injuries. Id., at 1303-1318, 1320-1335.  McWilliams also described his history of psychiatric and psychological evaluations, reading from the prearrest report of one psychologist, who concluded that McWilliams had a \"blatantly psychotic thought disorder\" and needed inpatient treatment.  Id., at 1329-1332.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the prosecutor, cross-examining McWilliams, asked about the neurological effects of his head injuries, McWilliams replied, \"I am not a psychiatrist.\"  Id., at 1328.  Similarly, when the prosecutor asked McWilliams' mother whether her son was \"crazy,\" she answered, \"I am no expert: I don't know whether my son is crazy or not.  All I know, that my son do need help.\"  Id., at 1317.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prosecution then called two of the mental health professionals who had signed the Lunacy Commission's report, Dr. Kamal Nagi and Dr. Norman Poythress.  Dr. Nagi testified that he had found no evidence of psychosis, but did not appear to be aware of McWilliams' history of head trauma.  See id., at 1351-1352.  Dr. Poythress testified that one of the tests that McWilliams took was \"clinically invalid\" because the test's \"validity scales\" indicated that McWilliams had exaggerated or faked his symptoms.  Id., at 1361-1363.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although McWilliams' counsel had subpoenaed further mental health records from Holman State Prison, where McWilliams was being held, the jury did not have the opportunity to consider them, for, though subpoenaed on August 13, the records had not arrived by August 27, the day of the jury hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the hearing, the jury recommended the death penalty by a vote of 10 to 2, the minimum required by Alabama law.  The court scheduled its judicial sentencing hearing for October 9, about six weeks later.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Five weeks before that hearing, the trial court ordered the Alabama Department of Corrections to respond to McWilliams's subpoena for mental health records.  Id., at 1619.  The court also granted McWilliams' motion for neurological and neuropsychological exams.  Id., at 1615-1617.  That motion (apparently filed at the suggestion of a University of Alabama psychologist who had \"volunteer[ed]\" to help counsel \"in her spare time,\" P. C. T. 251-252) asked the court to \"issue an order requiring the State of Alabama to do complete neurological and neuropsychological testing on the Defendant in order to have the test results available for his sentencing hearing.\"  T. 1615.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, Dr. John Goff, a neuropsychologist employed by the State's Department of Mental Health, examined McWilliams.  On October 7, two days before the judicial sentencing hearing, Dr. Goff filed his report.  The report concluded that McWilliams presented \"some diagnostic dilemmas.\"  Id., at 1635.  On the one hand, he was \"obviously attempting to appear emotionally disturbed\" and \"exaggerating his neuropsychological problems.\"  Ibid.  But on the other hand, it was \"quite apparent that he ha[d] some genuine neuropsychological problems.\"  Ibid.  Tests revealed \"cortical dysfunction attributable to right cerebral hemisphere dysfunction,\" shown by \"left hand weakness, poor motor coordination of the left hand, sensory deficits including suppressions of the left hand and very poor visual search skills.\"  Id., at 1636.  These deficiencies were \"suggestive of a right hemisphere lesion\" and \"compatible with the injuries [McWilliams] sa[id] he sustained as a child.\"  Id., at 1635.  The report added that McWilliams' \"obvious neuropsychological deficit\" could be related to his \"low frustration tolerance and impulsivity,\" and suggested a diagnosis of \"organic personality syndrome.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The day before the sentencing hearing defense counsel also received updated records from Taylor Hardin hospital, and on the morning of the hearing he received the records (subpoenaed in mid-August) from Holman Prison.  The prison records indicated that McWilliams was taking an assortment of psychotropic medications including Desyrel, Librium, and an antipsychotic, Mellaril.  See App. 190a-193a.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judicial sentencing hearing began on the morning of October 9.  Defense counsel told the trial court that the eleventh-hour arrival of the Goff report and the mental health records left him \"unable to present any evidence today.\"  Id., at 194a.  He said he needed more time to go over the new information.  Furthermore, since he was \"not a psychologist or a psychiatrist,\" he needed \"to have someone else review these findings\" and offer \"a second opinion as to the severity of the organic problems discovered.\"  Id., at 192a-196a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial judge responded, \"All right.  Well, let's proceed.\"  Id., at 197a.  The prosecution then presented its case.  Once it had finished, defense counsel moved for a continuance in order \"to allow us to go through the material that has been provided to us in the last 2 days.\"  Id., at 204a.  The judge offered to give defense counsel until 2 p.m. that afternoon.  He also stated that \"[a]t that time, The Court will entertain any motion that you may have with some other person to review\" the new material.  Id., at 205a.  Defense counsel protested that \"there is no way that I can go through this material,\" but the judge immediately added, \"Well, I will give you the opportunity.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. If you do not want to try, then you may not.\"  Id., at 206a.  The court then adjourned until 2 p.m.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the recess, defense counsel moved to withdraw.  He said that \"the abritrary [sic] position taken by this Court regarding the Defendant's right to present mitigating circumstances is unconscionable resulting in this proceeding being a mockery.\"  T. 1644.  He added that \"further participation would be tantamount to exceptance [sic] of the Court's ruling.\"  Ibid.  The trial court denied the motion to withdraw.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the proceedings resumed, defense counsel renewed his motion for a continuance, explaining,\n\"It is the position of the Defense that we have received these records at such a late date, such a late time that it has put us in a position as laymen, with regard to psychological matters, that we cannot adequately make a determination as what to present to The Court with regards to the particular deficiencies that the Defendant has.  We believe that he has the type of diagnosed illness that we pointed out earlier for The Court and have mentioned for The Court.  But we cannot determine ourselves from the records that we have received and the lack of receiving the test and the lack of our own expertise, whether or not such a condition exists; whether the reports and tests that have been run by Taylor Hardin, and the Lunacy Commission, and at Holman are tests that should be challenged in some type of way or the results should be challenged, we really need an opportunity to have the right type of experts in this field, take a look at all of those records and tell us what is happening with him.  And that is why we renew the Motion for a Continuance.\"  App. 207a.\nThe trial court denied the motion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prosecutor then offered his closing statement, in which he argued that there were \"no mitigating circumstances.\"  Id., at 209a.  Defense counsel replied that he \"would be pleased to respond to [the prosecutor's] remarks that there are no mitigating circumstances in this case if I were able to have time to produce .\u00a0.\u00a0. any mitigating circumstances.\"  Id., at 210a.  But, he said, since neither he nor his co-counsel were \"doctors,\" neither was \"really capable of going through those records on our own.\"  Ibid.  The court had thus \"foreclosed by structuring this hearing as it has, the Defendant from presenting any evidence of mitigation in psychological--psychiatric terms.\"  Id., at 211a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial judge then said that he had reviewed the records himself and found evidence that McWilliams  was faking and manipulative.  Ibid.  Defense counsel attempted to contest that point, which led to the following exchange:\n\"MR. SOGOL: I told Your Honor that my looking at those records was not of any value to me; that I needed to have somebody look at those records who understood them, who could interpret them for me.  Did I not tell Your Honor that?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE COURT: As I said, on the record earlier, Mr. Sogol, and I don't want to argue or belabor this, but I would have given you the opportunity to make a motion to present someone to evaluate that.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MR. SOGOL: Your Honor gave me no time in which to do that.  Your Honor told me to be here at 2 o'clock this afternoon.  Would Your Honor have wanted me  to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0THE COURT: I want you to approach with your client, please.\"  Id., at 211a-212a.\nThe court then sentenced McWilliams to death.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court later issued a written sentencing order.  It found three aggravating circumstances and no mitigating circumstances.  It found that McWilliams \"was not and is not psychotic,\" and that \"the preponderance of the evidence from these tests and reports show [McWilliams] to be feigning, faking, and manipulative.\"  Id., at 188a.  The court wrote that even if McWilliams' mental health issues \"did rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance, the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance.\"  Ibid.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McWilliams appealed, arguing that the trial court had denied him the right to meaningful expert assistance guaranteed by Ake.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals rejected his argument.  It wrote that Ake's requirements \"are met when the State provides the [defendant] with a competent psychiatrist.\"  McWilliams v. State, 640 So.\u00a02d 982, 991 (1991).  And Alabama, by \"allowing Dr. Goff to examine\" McWilliams, had satisfied those requirements.  Ibid.  The court added that \"[t]here is no indication in the record that [McWilliams] could not have called Dr. Goff as a witness to explain his findings or that he even tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss his findings,\" ibid.; that \"the trial court indicated that it would have considered a motion to present an expert to evaluate this report\" had one been made, ibid.; and that there was \"no prejudice by the trial court's denial of [McWilliams'] motion for continuance,\" id., at 993.  The appeals court therefore affirmed McWilliams' conviction and sentence. The Alabama Supreme Court, in turn, affirmed the appeals court (without addressing the Ake issue).  Ex\u00a0parte McWilliams, 640 So.\u00a02d 1015 (1993).  After McWilliams failed to obtain postconviction relief from the state courts, he sought a federal writ of habeas corpus.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254.\nE\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In federal habeas court McWilliams argued before a Magistrate Judge that he had not received the expert assistance that Ake required.  The Magistrate Judge recommended against issuing the writ.  He wrote that McWilliams had \"received the assistance required by Ake\" because Dr. Goff \"completed the testing\" that McWilliams requested.  App. 88a.  Hence, the decision of the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was not contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established federal law.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  The District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge's report and recommendation and denied relief.  A divided panel of the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.  See McWilliams v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 634\u00a0Fed. Appx. 698 (2015) (\u00a0per curiam); id., at 711 (Jordan, J., concurring); id., at 712 (Wilson, J., dissenting).  McWilliams filed a petition for certiorari.  We granted the petition.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The  question before us is whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance to which Ake entitled him was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  Before turning to the heart of that question, we resolve three preliminary issues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, no one denies that the conditions that trigger application of Ake are present.  McWilliams is and was an \"indigent defendant,\" 470 U.\u00a0S., at 70.  See supra, at 3.  His \"mental condition\" was \"relevant to .\u00a0.\u00a0. the punishment he might suffer,\" 470 U.\u00a0S., at 80.  See supra, at 4-5.  And, that \"mental condition,\" i.e., his \"sanity at the time of the offense,\" was \"seriously in question,\" 470 U.\u00a0S., at 70.  See supra, at 4-5.  Consequently, the Constitution, as interpreted in Ake, required the State to provide McWilliams with \"access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate examination and assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\"  470 U.\u00a0S., at 83.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, we reject Alabama's claim that the State was exempted from its obligations because McWilliams already had the assistance of Dr. Rosenszweig, the psychologist at the University of Alabama who \"volunteer[ed]\" to help defense counsel \"in her spare time\" and suggested the defense ask for further testing, P. C. T. 251-252.  Even if the episodic assistance of an outside volunteer could relieve the State of its constitutional duty to ensure an indigent defendant access to meaningful expert assistance, no lower court has held or suggested that Dr. Rosenszweig was available to help, or might have helped, McWilliams at the judicial sentencing proceeding, the proceeding here at issue.  Alabama does not refer to any specific record facts that indicate that she was available to the defense at this time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Alabama argues that Ake's requirements are irrelevant because McWilliams \"never asked for more expert assistance\" than he got, \"even though the trial court gave him the opportunity to do so.\"  Brief for Respondent 50-51.  The record does not support this contention.  When defense counsel requested a continuance at the sentencing hearing, he repeatedly told the court that he needed \"to have someone else review\" the Goff report and medical records.  App. 193a.  See, e.g., id., at 196a (\"[I]t is just incumbent upon me to have a second opinion as to the severity of the organic problems discovered\"); id., at 207a (\"[W]e really need an opportunity to have the right type of experts in this field, take a look at all of these records and tell us what is happening with him\"); id., at 211a (\"I told Your Honor that my looking at these records was not of any value to me; that I needed to have somebody look at those records who understood them, who could interpret them for me\").  Counsel also explicitly asked the trial court what else he was supposed to ask for to obtain an expert: \"Would Your Honor have wanted me to file a Motion for Extraordinary Expenses to get someone?\"  Id., at 212a.  We have reproduced a lengthier account of the exchanges, supra, at 7-9. They make clear that counsel wanted additional expert assistance to review the report and records--that was the point of asking for a continuance.  In response, the court told counsel to approach the bench and sentenced McWilliams to death.  Thus the record, in our view, indicates that McWilliams did request additional help from mental health experts.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We turn to the main question before us: whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals' determination that McWilliams got all the assistance that Ake requires was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0McWilliams would have us answer \"yes\" on the ground that Ake clearly established that a State must provide an indigent defendant with a qualified mental health expert retained specifically for the defense team, not a neutral expert available to both parties.  He points to language in Ake that seems to foresee that consequence.  See, e.g., 470 U.\u00a0S., at 81 (\"By organizing a defendant's mental history, examination results and behavior, and other information, interpreting it in light of their expertise, and then laying out their investigative and analytic process to the jury, the psychiatrists for each party enable the jury to make its most accurate determination of the truth on the issue before them\" (emphasis added)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We need not, and do not, decide, however, whether this particular McWilliams claim is correct.  As discussed above, Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively \"assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.\"  Id., at 83.  As a practical matter, the simplest way for a State to meet this standard may be to provide a qualified expert retained specifically for the defense team.  This appears to be the approach that the overwhelming majority of jurisdictions have adopted.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as Amici Curiae 8-35 (describing practice in capital-active jurisdictions); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40 (respondent conceding that \"this issue really has been mooted over the last 30-some-odd years because of statutory changes\").  It is not necessary, however, for us to decide whether the Constitution requires States to satisfy Ake's demands in this way.  That is because Alabama here did not meet even Ake's most basic requirements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent calls our unwillingness to resolve the broader question whether Ake clearly established a right to an expert independent from the prosecution a \"most unseemly maneuver.\"  Post, at 1-2 (opinion of Alito, J.).  We do  not agree.  We recognize that we granted petitioner's first question presented--which addressed whether Ake clearly established a right to an independent expert--and not his second, which raised more case-specific concerns.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  Yet that does not bind us to issue a sweeping ruling when a narrow one will do.  As we explain below, our determination that Ake clearly established that a defendant must receive the assistance of a mental health expert who is sufficiently available to the defense and independent from the prosecution to effectively \"assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,\" 470 U.\u00a0S.,  at 83, is sufficient to resolve the case.  We therefore need not decide whether Ake clearly established more.  (Nor do we agree with the dissent that our approach is \"acutely unfair to Alabama\" by not \"giv[ing] the State a fair chance to respond.\"  Post, at 12.  In fact, the State devoted an entire section of its merits brief to explaining why it thought that \"[n]o matter how the Court resolves the [independent expert] question, the court of appeals correctly denied the habeas petition.\"  Brief for Respondent 50.  See also id., at 14, 52 (referring to the lower courts' case-specific determinations that McWilliams got all the assistance Ake requires).)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alabama appeals court held that \"the requirements of Ake v. Oklahoma .\u00a0.\u00a0. are met when the State provides the [defendant] with a competent psychiatrist.  The State met this requirement in allowing Dr. Goff to examine [McWilliams].\"  McWilliams, 640 So.\u00a02d, at 991.  This was plainly incorrect.  Ake does not require just an examination.  Rather, it requires the State to provide the defense with \"access to a competent psychiatrist who will conduct an appropriate [1] examination and assist in [2] evaluation, [3] preparation, and [4] presentation of the defense.\"  Ake, supra, at 83 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are willing to assume that Alabama met the examination portion of this requirement by providing for Dr. Goff's examination of McWilliams.  See supra, at 6.  But what about the other three parts?  Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense evaluate Goff's report or McWilliams' extensive medical records and translate these data into a legal strategy.  Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare and present arguments that might, for example, have explained that McWilliams' purported malingering was not necessarily inconsistent with mental illness (as an expert later testified in postconviction proceedings, see P. C. T. 936-943).  Neither Dr. Goff nor any other expert helped the defense prepare direct or cross-examination of any witnesses, or testified at the judicial sentencing hearing himself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent emphasizes that Dr. Goff was never ordered to do any of these things by the trial court.  See post, at 13, n.\u00a05.  But that is precisely the point.  The relevant court order did not ask Dr. Goff or anyone else to provide the defense with help in evaluating, preparing, and presenting its case.  It only required \"the Department of Corrections\" to \"complete neurological and neuropsychological testing on the Defendant .\u00a0.\u00a0. and send all test materials, results and evaluations to the Clerk of the Court.\"  T. 1612.  Nor did the short time frame allow for more expert assistance.  (Indeed, given that timeframe, we do not see how Dr. Goff or any other expert could have satisfied the latter three portions of Ake's requirements even had he been instructed to do so.)  Then, when McWilliams asked for the additional assistance to which he was constitutionally entitled at the sentencing hearing, the judge rebuffed his requests.  See supra, at 7-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since Alabama's provision of mental health assistance fell so dramatically short of what Ake requires, we must conclude that the Alabama court decision affirming McWilliams's conviction and sentence was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\"  28 U. S. C. \u00a72254(d)(1).\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit held in the alternative that, even if the Alabama courts clearly erred in their application of federal law, their \"error\" nonetheless did not have the \"substantial and injurious effect or influence\" required to warrant a grant of habeas relief, Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See 634 Fed. Appx., at 707.  In reaching this conclusion, however, the Eleventh Circuit only considered whether \"[a] few additional days to review Dr. Goff's findings\" would have made a difference.  Ibid.  It did not specifically consider whether access to the type of meaningful assistance in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the defense that Ake requires would have mattered.  There is reason to think that it could have.  For example, the trial judge relied heavily on his belief that McWilliams was malingering.  See App. 188a, 211a.  If McWilliams had the assistance of an expert to explain that \"[m]alingering is not inconsistent with serious mental illness,\" Brief for American Psychiatric Association et al. as Amici Curiae 20, he might have been able to alter the judge's perception of the case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since \"we are a court of review, not of first view,\" Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005), we do not now resolve this question.  Rather we leave it to the lower courts to decide in the first instance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-5294\nJAMES E. McWILLIAMS, PETITIONER v. JEFFERSON S. DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[June 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Gorsuch join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted review in this case to decide a straightforward legal question on which the lower courts are divided: whether our decision in Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.\u00a0S. 68 (1985), clearly established that an indigent defendant whose mental health will be a significant factor at trial is entitled to the assistance of a psychiatric expert who is a member of the defense team instead of a neutral expert who is available to assist both the prosecution and the defense.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to that question is plain: Ake did not clearly establish that a defendant is entitled to an expert who is a member of the defense team.  Indeed, \"Ake appears to have been written so as to be deliberately ambiguous on this point, thus leaving the issue open for future consideration.\"  W. LaFave, Criminal Law \u00a78.2(d), p. 449 (5th ed. 2010) (LaFave).  Accordingly, the proper disposition of this case is to affirm the judgment below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court avoids that outcome by means of a most unseemly maneuver.  The Court declines to decide the question on which we granted review and thus leaves in place conflicting lower court decisions regarding the meaning of a 32-year-old precedent.2  That is bad enough.  But to make matters worse, the Court achieves this unfortunate result by deciding a separate question on which we expressly declined review.  And the Court decides that fact-bound question without giving Alabama a fair opportunity to brief the issue.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), federal habeas relief cannot be awarded on a claim that a state court decided on the merits unless the state court's decision \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  That standard, by design, is \"difficult to meet.\"  White v. Woodall, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It requires habeas petitioners to \"show that the state court's ruling on the claim .\u00a0.\u00a0. was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\"  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 103 (2011).  Put another way, \"[w]hen reviewing state criminal convictions on collateral review, federal judges are required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong.\"  Woods v. Donald, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (\u00a0per curiam) (slip op., at 4-5).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Ake, we held that a defendant must be provided \"access to a competent psychiatrist\" in two circumstances: first, \"when [the] defendant demonstrates to the trial judge that his sanity at the time of the offense is to be a significant factor at trial,\" and, second, at the sentencing phase of a capital trial, \"when the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness.\"  470 U.\u00a0S., at 83.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question that we agreed to review concerns the type of expert that must be provided.  Did Ake clearly establish that a defendant in the two situations just noted must be provided with the services of an expert who functions solely as a dedicated member of the defense team as opposed to a neutral expert who examines the defendant, reports his or her conclusions to the court and the parties, and is available to assist and testify for both sides?  Did Ake speak with such clarity that it ruled out \"any possibility for fairminded disagreement\"?  Harrington, supra, at 103.  The answer is \"no.\"  Ake provides no clear guidance one way or the other.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is certainly true that there is language in Ake that points toward the position that a defense-team psychiatrist should be provided.  Explaining the need for the appointment of a psychiatric expert, Ake noted that a psychiatrist can \"assist in preparing the cross-examination of a State's psychiatric witnesses\" and would \"know the probative questions to ask of the opposing party's psychiatrists and how to interpret their answers.\"  470 U.\u00a0S., at 82, 80.  And when Ake discussed expert assistance during capital sentencing, the Court said that it is important for a defendant to \"offer a well-informed expert's opposing view\" in the form of \"responsive psychiatric testimony.\"  Id., at 84.  Ake also explained that factfinding is improved when evidence is offered by \"psychiatrists for each party.\"  Id., at 81.  While it is possible for a neutral expert to provide these services, in our adversary system they are customarily performed by an expert working exclusively for one of the parties.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other language in Ake, however, points at least as strongly in the opposite direction.  Ake was clear that an indigent defendant does not have a constitutional right to \"choose a psychiatrist of his personal liking or .\u00a0.\u00a0. receive funds to hire his own.\"  Id., at 83.  Instead, the Court held only that a defendant is entitled to have \"access\" to \"one competent psychiatrist\" chosen by the trial judge. Id., at 83, 79.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These limitations are at odds with the defense-expert model, which McWilliams characterizes as \"the norm in our adversarial system.\"  Reply Brief 3.  As McWilliams explains, \"other litigants of means\" screen experts to find one whose tentative views are favorable, and they often hire both consulting and testifying experts.  Id., at 2-3.  But the Ake Court was clear that it was not holding \"that a State must purchase for the indigent defendant all the assistance that his wealthier counterpart might buy.\"  470 U.\u00a0S., at 77.  On the contrary, Ake expressly stated that a State need only provide for a single psychiatric expert to be selected by the trial judge.  Thus, Ake does not give the defense the right to interview potential experts, to seek out an expert who offers a favorable preliminary diagnosis, or to hire more than one expert.  And if the court-appointed expert reaches a conclusion unfavorable to the defendant on the issue of sanity or future dangerousness, Ake requires the defense team to live with the expert's unfavorable conclusions.  As McWilliams concedes, when the only expert available to indigent defendants is one selected by the trial court, these defendants \"face a risk that their expert will ultimately be unwilling or unable to offer testimony that will advance their cause.\"  Reply Brief 3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ake also acknowledged that one of our prior cases, United States ex\u00a0rel. Smith v. Baldi, 344 U.\u00a0S. 561 (1953), \"support[ed] the proposition\" that due process is satisfied if a defendant merely has access to a psychiatrist \"not beholden to the prosecution.\"  470 U.\u00a0S., at 85.  While Ake also declared that Baldi did not limit the Court \"in considering whether fundamental fairness today requires a different result,\" 470 U.\u00a0S., at 85, Ake did not explicitly overrule Baldi, and ultimately its treatment of that case was \"most ambiguous,\" LaFave \u00a78.2, at 450, n. 124.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is also significant that the Ake Court had no need to decide whether due process requires the appointment of a defense-team expert as opposed to a neutral expert because Ake was denied the assistance of any psychiatrist--neutral or otherwise--for purposes of assessing his sanity at the time of the offense or his mental state as it related to capital sentencing.  470 U.\u00a0S., at 71-73 (state experts who examined Ake and testified he was dangerous evaluated him only in connection with his competency to stand trial).  As Ake's counsel explained at argument, the Court could rule in his client's favor without accepting his client's \"primary submission\" that due process requires the appointment of a defense-team expert.  Tr. of Oral Arg. in No. 83-5424 p. 21 (arguing that Ake's rights were violated even under Baldi).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, Ake is ambiguous, perhaps \"deliberately\" so.  LaFave \u00a78.2(d), at 449; see ibid. (\"[C]omments supporting a move in either direction appear throughout the majority opinion in the case\").  If the Justices who joined Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court had agreed that a defense-team expert must be appointed, it would have been a simple matter for the Court to say so expressly.  Justice Marshall demonstrated this a few years later when he dissented from the denial of certiorari in a case that presented the very issue that the Court now dodges.  Granviel v. Texas, 495 U.\u00a0S. 963 (1990).  There, Justice Marshall stated unambiguously that \"Ake mandates the provision of a psychiatrist who will be part of the defense team and serve the defendant's interests in the context of our adversarial system.\"  Ibid.  If all the Justices who joined the opinion of the Court in Ake had shared this view, there is no obvious reason for the absence of the sort of clear statement that Justice Marshall would later provide when he wrote only for himself.  The opinion in Ake has all the hallmarks of a compromise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's actions in the aftermath of Ake lend support to this conclusion.  The Court repeatedly denied certiorari in cases that would have permitted it to resolve this question or others left open by Ake.  See, e.g., Norris v. Starr, 513 U.\u00a0S. 995 (1994); Vickers v. Arizona, 497 U.\u00a0S. 1033 (1990); Brown v. Dodd, 484 U.\u00a0S. 874 (1987); Johnson v. Oklahoma, 484 U.\u00a0S. 878 (1987); Granviel, supra, at 963.  And in many of these cases (Vickers, Dodd, Johnson, and Granviel), Justice Marshall dissented.  The most reasonable conclusion to draw from the Court's silence is that the exact type of expert required by Ake has remained \"an open question in our jurisprudence.\"  Carey v. Musladin, 549 U.\u00a0S. 70, 76 (2006).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the lower courts have \"diverged widely\" in assessing whether our precedents dictate a legal rule, that is a sign that the rule is not clearly established, ibid., and that is the situation here.  At the time the Alabama court addressed McWilliams's Ake claim on the merits, some courts had held that Ake requires the appointment of a defense-team expert.  See, e.g., Smith v. McCormick, 914 F.\u00a02d 1153, 1156-1160 (CA9 1990); United States v. Sloan, 776 F.\u00a02d 926, 929 (CA10 1985).  But others disagreed.  The Fifth Circuit had held that a defense-team expert is not required.  Granviel v. Lynaugh, 881 F.\u00a02d 185, 191-192 (1989), cert. denied, 495 U.\u00a0S. 963 (1990).  And the Oklahoma courts in Ake itself also interpreted our holding this way.  Ake v. State, 778 P.\u00a02d 460, 465 (Okla. Crim. App. 1989) (\"[D]ue process does not entitle [Ake] to a state-funded psychiatric expert to support his claim; rather, due process requires that he have access to a competent and impartial psychiatrist\").  So had at least seven other state high courts.  Willie v. State, 585 So.\u00a02d 660, 671 (Miss. 1991); State v. Hix, 38 Ohio St. 3d 129, 131-132, 527 N.\u00a0E. 2d 784, 787 (1988); Dunn v. State, 291 Ark. 131, 132-134, 722 S.\u00a0W. 2d 595, 595-596 (1987); State v. Indvik, 382 N.\u00a0W. 2d 623, 625-626 (N. D. 1986); Palmer v. State, 486 N.\u00a0E. 2d 477, 481-482 (Ind. 1985); State v. Smith, 217 Mont. 453, 457-460, 705 P.\u00a02d 1110, 1113-1114 (1985); State v. Hoopii, 68 Haw. 246, 248-251, 710 P. 2d 1193, 1195-1196 (1985).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other courts struggled to reach agreement on the question.  Two Eleventh Circuit panels held that a neutral expert suffices, see Magwood v. Smith, 791 F.\u00a02d 1438, 1443 (1986) (Ake satisfied where neutral, court-appointed experts examined the defendant and testified); Clisby v. Jones, 907 F.\u00a02d 1047, 1050 (1990) (per curiam) (\"The state provided a duly qualified psychiatrist not beholden to the prosecution and, therefore, met its obligation under Ake\"), reh'g en banc, 960 F.\u00a02d 925, 928-934 (1992) (rejecting Ake claim on other grounds).  But another Eleventh Circuit panel disagreed.  Cowley v. Stricklin, 929 F.\u00a02d 640, 644 (1991) (holding that due process requires more than a neutral expert).  A Sixth Circuit panel held that Ake does not require appointment of a defense-team expert.  Kordenbrock v. Scroggy, 889 F.\u00a02d 69, 75 (1989).  And when the Sixth Circuit reviewed that decision en banc, its holding was fractured, but 7 of the 13 judges expressed the view that Ake requires only a neutral, court-appointed expert.3  919 F.\u00a02d 1091, 1110, 1117-1120, 1131-1132 (1990).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ake's ambiguity has been noted time and again by commentators.  See, e.g., LaFave \u00a78.2(d), at 449 (Ake appears to be \"deliberately ambiguous\"); Mosteller, The Sixth Amendment Right to Fairness: The Touchstone of Effectiveness and Pragmatism, 45 Tex. Tech.

Pet. for Cert. i.  The first was the legal question discussed above; the second raised an issue that is tied to the specific facts of McWilliams's case: whether the neutral expert appointed in this case failed to provide the assistance that Ake requires because he \"distributed his report to all parties just two days before sentencing and was unable to review voluminous medical and psychological records.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  Our Rules and practice disfavor questions of this nature, see this Court's Rule 10, and we denied review.  Heeding our decision, the parties briefed the first question but scarcely mentioned anything related to the second.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court, however, feels no similar obligation to abide by the Rules.  The Court refuses to decide the legal question on which we granted review and instead decides the question on which review was denied.  The Court holds that \"Alabama here did not meet even Ake's most basic requirements.\"  Ante, at 14.  In support of this conclusion, the Court states that neither Dr. Goff (the expert appointed by the trial judge) nor any other expert provided assistance in understanding and evaluating medical reports and records, preparing a legal strategy, presenting evidence, or preparing to cross-examine witnesses.  Ibid.  The Court does not question Dr. Goff's qualifications or his objectivity.  Instead, the crux of the Court's complaint is that Dr. Goff merely submitted his report and did not provide further assistance to the defense.  Ibid.  But as far as the record shows, Dr. Goff was never asked and never refused to provide assistance to McWilliams.  He did not provide the assistance that the Court finds essential because his report was not given to the parties until two days before sentencing, and arrangements were not made for him to provide the assistance during that brief interlude.  Thus, the question that the Court decides is precisely the question on which we denied review: namely, whether Dr. Goff's assistance was deficient because he \"distributed his report to all parties just two days before sentencing and was unable to review voluminous medical and psychological records.\"  Pet. for Cert. i\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Rules instruct litigants that we will consider only the questions on which review was granted and \"subsidiary question fairly included therein.\"  This Court's Rule 14.1(a); Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.\u00a0S. 519, 535 (1992) (The Court will consider an \"unpresented question\" only in \"the most exceptional cases\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also this Court's Rule 24.1(a) (parties may not change the substance of the question presented once granted).  And we have not hesitated to enforce these Rules when petitioners who \"persuaded us to grant certiorari\" on one question instead \"chose to rely on a different argument in their merits briefing.\"  Visa, Inc. v. Osborn, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted) (dismissing cases as improvidently granted on this ground).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These Rules exist for good reasons.  Among other things, they give the parties notice of the question to be decided and ensure that we receive adversarial briefing, see Yee, supra, at 536, which in turns helps the Court reach sound decisions.  But in this case, the Court feels free to disregard our Rules and long-established practice.  If McWilliams, after inducing us to grant certiorari on the first question presented, had decided to ignore that question and instead brief a fact-specific alternative theory, we would have dismissed the case as improvidently granted.  We do not tolerate this sort of bait-and-switch tactic from litigants, and we should not engage in it ourselves.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's approach is acutely unfair to Alabama.  The State surely believed that it did not need to brief the second question presented in McWilliams's petition.  The State vigorously opposed review of that question, calling it \"an invitation to conduct factbound error correction,\" Brief in Opposition 13, and we denied review.  It will come as a nasty surprise to Alabama that the Court has ruled against it on the very question we declined to review--and without giving the State a fair chance to respond.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is worth remembering that today's ruling requires the Court to conclude that the state court's treatment of McWilliams's Ake claim \"was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\"  Harrington, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 103.  This \"standard is difficult to meet,\" id., at 102, and Alabama would surely have appreciated the opportunity to contest whether McWilliams has met it.  Denying Alabama that chance does not show \"[a] proper respect for AEDPA's high bar for habeas relief,\" which counsels restraint in \"disturbing the State's significant interest in repose for concluded litigation, denying society the right to punish some admitted offenders, and intruding on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal authority.\"  Virginia v. LeBlanc, ante, at 5 (per curiam) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is debatable whether the Court has even answered question two correctly (and, of course, meaningful briefing by the parties would have allowed the Court to answer the question with more confidence).5  But the fundamental point is that the Court should not have addressed this question at all.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having completed an arduous detour around the question that we agreed to decide, the majority encounters an inconvenient roadblock: The Court of Appeals has already determined that any error of the sort the majority identifies today was harmless.  So the majority relies on the thinnest of reasons to require the Eleventh Circuit to redo its analysis.  That conclusion is unwarranted, and nothing in the majority opinion prevents the Court of Appeals from reaching the same result on remand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority claims that the Court of Appeals did not \"specifically consider whether access to the type of meaningful assistance in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the defense that Ake requires would have mattered.\"  Ante, at 15.  But the Court of Appeals concluded that, even if Dr. Goff's performance did not satisfy Ake, the error did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the outcome of the sentencing proceeding.  McWilliams v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 634 Fed. Appx. 698, 706-707 (CA11 2015) (per curiam).  Thus, the Court of Appeals specifically addressed the very question that the majority instructs it to consider on remand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the majority disagrees with the Court of Appeals' decision on that question, it should explain its reasons, but the majority is unwilling to tackle that matter and instead recites that \"we are a court of review, not first view.\"  Ante, at 16 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court's invocation of this oft-used formulation is utterly inapt because the Eleventh Circuit has already reviewed the question of harmless error.  Moreover, unlike the question that the majority does decide, the harmless-error issue was at least briefed in a meaningful way by the parties.  Brief for Petitioner 41-46; Brief for Respondents 52-56; Reply Brief 14-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had the Court confronted the harmless-error issue, it would have found it difficult to reject the Court of Appeals' conclusion that any Ake error here was harmless.  In 1984, McWilliams \"raped, robbed, and murdered Patricia Vallery Reynolds.\"  McWilliams v. State, 640 So.\u00a02d 982, 986 (Ala. Crim. App. 1991) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Reynolds was a clerk at a convenience store in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.  Ibid.  McWilliams robbed the store, brutally raped Reynolds in a back room, then left her on the floor to die after shooting her six times execution style with a .38 caliber pistol.  Ibid.  After McWilliams was apprehended, he bragged to other jail inmates about what he had done.  Id., at 987.  The jury needed less than an hour of deliberation to find him guilty, and it recommended the death penalty by a 10-to-2 vote the following day.  Id., at 986.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Agreeing with the jury's nonbinding recommendation, the trial court imposed the death penalty based on three aggravating circumstances.  McWilliams had prior violent felony convictions for first-degree robbery and first-degree rape.  App. 182a-183a.  He murdered Reynolds in the course of committing a robbery and rape.  Id., at 183a.  And his crime \"was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\": He executed the only potential eyewitness to his robbery, and his conduct during and after the crime showed an \"obvious lack of regard or compassion for the life and human dignity of the victim.\"  Id., at 184a.  Balanced against these three aggravators was McWilliams's claim that he was psychotic and suffered from organic brain dysfunction--the mitigating evidence that Dr. Goff's report supposedly would have supported.  But the sentencing court concluded that this evidence \"did not rise to the level of a mitigating circumstance,\" in part because of the extensive evidence that McWilliams was feigning symptoms.  Id., at 188a.  And in any event, the sentencing court found that \"the aggravating circumstances would far outweigh this as a mitigating circumstance.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority hints that the sentencing court's weighing might have been different if McWilliams had been afforded more time to work with Dr. Goff to prepare a mitigation presentation and to introduce Dr. Goff's testimony at the sentencing hearing.  But there is little basis for this belief.  The defense would have faced potential rebuttal testimony from three doctors who evaluated McWilliams and firmly concluded that McWilliams's mental state did not reduce his responsibility for his actions.  Certified Trial Record 1545 (Dr. Yumul) (McWilliams \"was responsible and free of mental illness at the time of the alleged offense\"); id., at 1546 (Dr. Nagi) (McWilliams \"was not suffering from a mental illness\" at the time of the crime and \"[t]here see[m] to be no mitigating circumstances involved in [his] case\"); ibid. (Dr. Bryant) (finding no \"evidence of psychiatric symptoms of other illness that would provide a basis for mitigating factors at the time of the alleged crime\").  One of these psychiatrists also concluded that McWilliams was \"grossly exaggerating his psychological symptoms to mimic mental illness\" and that he \"obviously\" did so \"to evade criminal prosecution.\"  Ibid. (Dr. Nagi).  Even Dr. Goff found it \"quite obvious\" that McWilliams's \"symptoms of psychiatric disturbance [were] quite exaggerated and, perhaps, feigned.\"  Id., at 1635.  In light of all this, the defense would have faced an uphill battle in convincing the sentencing judge that, despite McWilliams's consistent malingering, his mental health was so impaired that it constituted a mitigating circumstance and that it outweighed the three aggravators the State proved.  If the sentencing judge had thought that there was a possibility that hearing from Dr. Goff would change his evaluation of aggravating and mitigating factors, he could have granted a continuance and called for Dr. Goff to appear.  But he did not do so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also ignores the fact that McWilliams has already had the chance to show that the outcome of the sentencing proceeding would have been different if he had been given more expert assistance.  In state postconviction proceedings, McWilliams argued that he was denied effective assistance of counsel because his lawyers did not obtain an expert who would have fully probed his mental state for purposes of mitigation.  McWilliams called an expert, Dr. Woods, who offered the opinion that McWilliams suffered from bipolar disorder at the time of the crime and testified that McWilliams's exaggeration of symptoms was not inconsistent with psychiatric problems.  But Dr. Woods also acknowledged that McWilliams \"tr[ied] to malinger for purposes of making himself look worse than he is,\" agreed that this malingering could have been done for the purpose of avoiding the death penalty, and declined to say that McWilliams's disorder explains why he raped and murdered Reynolds.  Postconviction Tr. 1002-1005, 1022-1023.  Dr. Woods even endorsed Dr. Goff's conclusion that McWilliams \"exaggerated certain aspects of his impairment.\"  Id., at 955 (\"I think Dr. Goff did an excellent job of attempting to separate out what were in fact exaggerations and what was real impairment\").  The State introduced a psychologist of its own (Dr. Kirkland) who strenuously disagreed with Dr. Woods's diagnosis and concluded that nothing \"indicate[s] that Mr. McWilliams was mentally impaired on the night of the offense.\"  Id., at 1088.  At the end of a lengthy hearing in which both experts addressed the malingering issue (see, e.g.,  id., at 935-943, 955, 964-966, 1076-1077), the state postconviction court found that \"McWilliams's claims based upon the testimony of Dr. Woods are without merit.\"  Id., at 1810.  It credited the \"consensus opinion\" reached by the three neutral state psychiatrists, who observed and evaluated McWilliams for over a month before his trial and concluded that he \"did not suffer from a mental illness.\"  Id., at 1812.  It expressly found that \"both the credibility of Dr. Woods and the reliability of his findings are questionable.\"  Id., at 1814.  And even if Dr. Woods's diagnosis was accurate, the court stated, it \"[would] not find that a failure to present\" evidence of this sort \"made a difference in the outcome.\"  Id., 1815.6  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed, McWilliams v. State, 897 So. 2d 437 (2004), and the Alabama Supreme Court denied review.  I see no ground for disturbing the Eleventh Circuit's decision on harmless error.7\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision represents an inexcusable departure from sound practice.  I would affirm the judgment below, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The question was worded as follows: \"When this Court held in Ake that an indigent defendant is entitled to meaningful expert assistance for the 'evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,'  did it clearly establish that the expert should be independent of the prosecution?\"\nFootnote 2\u00a0Defending its approach, the Court says that it had no need to decide the \"sweeping\" question on which review was granted \"when a narrow one will do.\"  Ante, at 14.  Narrow holdings have their place, but here: (1) We denied review of the narrow question; (2) the question decided is not just narrow, it is the sort of factbound question as to which review is disfavored, see this Court's Rule 10; (3) the narrow question is not fairly included in the question presented, see this Court's Rule 14(a); (4) deciding the case on this narrow ground leaves in place the conflict in the lower courts that supported the grant of certiorari; and (5) the parties were not given notice of this possible disposition, and the Court was thus deprived of the benefit of full briefing and argument on the issue.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The Sixth Circuit's experience, standing alone, is a telling reflection of Ake's ambiguity.  Years after Kordenbrock, a Sixth Circuit panel held that Ake requires a defense expert.  Powell v. Collins, 332 F.\u00a03d 376, 392 (2003).  A later panel disagreed.  Smith v. Mitchell, 348 F.\u00a03d 177, 207-208, and n.\u00a010 (2003).  A different panel concluded three years later that the Circuit had \"extend[ed] Ake\" to require a defense expert.  Carter v. Mitchell, 443 F.\u00a03d 517, 526 (2003).  A later panel insisted that \"Ake does not entitle [defendants] to .\u00a0.\u00a0. an [independent psychiatric] expert,\" but to \"a 'friend of the court' appointment.\"  Wogenstahl v. Mitchell, 668 F.\u00a03d 307, 340 (2012).  The Sixth Circuit ultimately concluded that Ake did not itself clearly compel an answer to this question for AEDPA purposes.  Miller v. Colson, 694 F.\u00a03d 691, 698 (2012) (\"[O]ur own internal conflict about the scope of Ake evidences the reasonableness of the state court decision\").\nFootnote 4\u00a0The Court is incorrect in suggesting that Alabama \"devoted an entire section of its merits brief\" to the question that the Court decides.  Ante, at 14.  In the section to which the Court refers, Alabama argued that even if McWilliams was entitled to relief under Ake to a partisan expert, no relief was warranted because he \"had a consulting expert that did not report to the State,\" i.e. \"a psychologist employed at the University of Alabama,\" and because the trial court ordered every form of testing that the defense requested.  Brief for Respondents 50-52.  Exactly six sentences of the State's briefing in this section, id., at 52, touch on the services provided by Dr. Goff and the trial court's denial of a continuance.  The State's inclusion of this fleeting discussion cannot justify a decision based on a question on which relief was denied.\nFootnote 5\u00a0The Court never even recites the applicable standard: whether the Alabama courts erred beyond fairminded disagreement in rejecting McWilliams's claim under Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.\u00a0S. 68 (1985).  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 103 (2011).  This bar is difficult for a habeas petitioner to hurdle, and it is far from clear that McWilliams has done so.  The Court says that Dr. Goff did not play the role Ake requires of an expert because he only examined McWilliams and reported his findings to the trial court.  Ante, at\u00a015.  But that is exactly what the trial court (at McWilliams's request) ordered him to do.  Cert. Trial Record 1615, 1616.  The Court briskly concludes that Dr. Goff did not assist the defense in understanding his report prior to the hearing or testify for McWilliams at the judicial sentencing hearing.  Ante, at 14-15.  But the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals found \"no indication in the record that [McWilliams] could not have called Dr. Goff as a witness to explain his findings or that he even tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss his findings.\"  McWilliams v. State, 640 So.\u00a02d 982, 991 (1991).  And the Eleventh Circuit saw no reason why McWilliams's defense team could not have been in contact with Dr. Goff while he was preparing the report.  McWilliams v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 634 Fed. Appx. 698, 706-707 (2015) (\u00a0per curiam).\nFootnote 6\u00a0Dr. Goff was notably absent from the postconviction proceeding.  McWilliams's failure to call him as a witness there creates a \"void in the record\" that prevents McWilliams from carrying his burden of showing \"how additional time with Dr. Goff (and his report) would have benefited the defense.\"  634 Fed. Appx., at 712 (Jordan, J., concurring).  It also suggests that, to McWilliams's postconviction counsel, Dr. Goff\u00a0's diagnosis and the opportunity to present it to the sentencer was not as important as McWilliams suggests.\nFootnote 7\u00a0McWilliams's entitlement to relief under Ake is questionable for an additional reason.  Ake held that the right to a psychiatric expert at capital sentencing comes into play \"when the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness.\"  470 U.\u00a0S., at 83-84, 86.  Here, the State did not introduce such evidence because future dangerousness was not an aggravator under Alabama law.  See App. 182a-184a.  As lower courts have noted, we have never held that a capital defendant is entitled to the assistance of a psychiatric expert at sentencing where future dangerousness is not in issue and the State does not introduce psychiatric evidence to prove it.  See, e.g., Revilla v. Gibson, 283 F.\u00a03d 1203, 1220-1221 (CA10 2002) (\"Ake held only that an indigent capital defendant must, upon request,\u00a0be provided an expert for the penalty phase when the State presents psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Ramdass v. Angelone, 187 F.\u00a03d 396, 409 (CA4 1999) (\"Ake provides a right to assistance of a mental health expert only if .\u00a0.\u00a0. , in arguing future dangerousness in the sentencing phase, the prosecution used expert psychiatric testimony\"); Goodwin v. Johnson, 132 F.\u00a03d 162, 189 (CA5 1997), as amended Jan. 15, 1998 (\"Ake only creates an entitlement to the assistance of a psychiatrist during sentencing when the state offers psychiatric evidence of the defendant's future dangerousness\" (emphasis deleted)).\n\n\n","2":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK ET AL. v. STAPLETON ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-74\nArgued: March 27, 2017Decided: June 5, 2017\n\n\nThe Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) generally obligates private employers offering pension plans to adhere to an array of rules designed to ensure plan solvency and protect plan participants.  \"[C]hurch plan[s],\" however, are exempt from those regulations.  29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71003(b)(2).  From the beginning, ERISA has defined a \"church plan\" as \"a plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. for its employees .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church.\"  \u00a71002(33)(A).  Congress then amended the statute to expand that definition, adding the provision whose effect is at issue here: \"A plan established and maintained for its employees .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church .\u00a0.\u00a0. includes a plan maintained by an organization .\u00a0.\u00a0. the principal purpose .\u00a0.\u00a0. of which is the administration or funding of [such] plan .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the employees of a church .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0, if such organization is controlled by or associated with a church.\"  \u00a71002(33)(C)(i).  (This opinion refers to the organizations described in that provision as \"principal-purpose organizations.\")\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners, who identify themselves as three church-affiliated nonprofits that run hospitals and other healthcare facilities (collectively, hospitals), offer their employees defined-benefit pension plans.  Those plans were established by the hospitals themselves, and are managed by internal employee-benefits committees.  Respondents, current and former hospital employees, filed class actions alleging that the hospitals' pension plans do not fall within ERISA's church-plan exemption because they were not established by a church.  The District Courts, agreeing with the employees, held that a plan must be established by a church to qualify as a church plan.  The Courts of Appeals affirmed.\nHeld:\u00a0A plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization qualifies as a \"church plan,\" regardless of who established it.  Pp.\u00a05-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The term \"church plan\" initially \"mean[t]\" only \"a plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church.\"  But subparagraph (C)(i) provides that the original definitional phrase will now \"include\" another--\"a plan maintained by [a principal-purpose] organization.\"  That use of the word \"include\" is not literal, but tells readers that a different type of plan should receive the same treatment (i.e., an exemption) as the type described in the old definition.  In other words, because Congress deemed the category of plans \"established and maintained by a church\" to \"include\" plans \"maintained by\" principal-purpose organizations, those plans--and all those plans--are exempt from ERISA's requirements.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had Congress wanted, as the employees contend, to alter only the maintenance requirement, it could have provided in subparagraph (C)(i) that \"a plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by\" a principal-purpose organization--removing \"established and\" from the first part of the sentence.  But Congress did not adopt that ready alternative.  Instead, it added language whose most natural reading is to enable a plan \"maintained\" by a principal-purpose organization to substitute for a plan both \"established\" and \"maintained\" by a church.  And as a corollary to that point, the employees' construction runs aground on the so-called surplusage canon--the presumption that each word Congress uses is there for a reason.  The employees read subparagraph (C)(i) as if it were missing the two words \"established and.\"  This Court, however, \"give[s] effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\"  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.\u00a0S. 362, 404.  Pp.\u00a05-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Both parties' accounts of Congress's purpose in enacting subparagraph (C)(i) tend to confirm this Court's reading that plans maintained by principal-purpose organizations are eligible for the church-plan exemption, whatever their origins.  According to the hospitals, Congress wanted to ensure that churches and church-affiliated organizations received comparable treatment under ERISA.  If that is so, this Court's construction of the text fits Congress's objective to a T, as a church-establishment requirement would necessarily disfavor plans created by church affiliates.  The employees, by contrast, claim that subparagraph (C)(i)'s main goal was to bring within the church-plan exemption plans managed by local pension boards--organizations often used by congregational denominations--so as to ensure parity between congregational and hierarchical churches.  But that account cuts against, not in favor of, their position.  Keeping the church-establishment requirement would have prevented some plans run by pension boards--the very entities the employees say Congress most wanted to benefit--from qualifying as \"church plans\" under ERISA.

STARLA ROLLINS\n\n\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the third circuit\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[June 5, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) exempts \"church plan[s]\" from its otherwise-comprehensive regulation of employee benefit plans.  88 Stat. 840, as amended, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71003(b)(2).  Under the statute, certain plans for the employees of churches or church-affiliated nonprofits count as \"church plans\" even though not actually administered by a church.  See \u00a71002(33)(C)(i).  The question presented here is whether  a church must have originally established such a plan for it to so qualify.  ERISA, we hold, does not impose that requirement.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners identify themselves as three church-affiliated nonprofits that run hospitals and other healthcare facilities (collectively, hospitals).1  They offer defined-benefit pension plans to their employees.  Those plans were established by the hospitals themselves--not by a church--and are managed by internal employee-benefits committees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ERISA generally obligates private employers offering pension plans to adhere to an array of rules designed to ensure plan solvency and protect plan participants.  See generally New York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.\u00a0S. 645, 651 (1995) (cataloguing ERISA's \"reporting and disclosure mandates,\" \"participation and vesting requirements,\" and \"funding standards\").  But in enacting the statute, Congress made an important exception.  \"[C]hurch plan[s]\" have never had to comply with ERISA's requirements.  \u00a71003(b)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutory definition of \"church plan\" came in two distinct phases.  From the beginning, ERISA provided that \"[t]he term 'church plan' means a plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. for its employees .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church or by a convention or association of churches.\"  \u00a71002(33)(A).  Then, in 1980, Congress amended the statute to expand that definition by deeming additional plans to fall within it.  The amendment specified that for purposes of the church-plan definition, an \"employee of a church\" would include an employee of a church-affiliated organization (like the hospitals here).  \u00a71002(33)(C)(ii)(II).  And it added the provision whose effect is at issue in these cases:\n\"A plan established and maintained for its employees .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church or by a convention or association of churches includes a plan maintained by an organization .\u00a0.\u00a0. the principal purpose or function of which is the administration or funding of a plan or program for the provision of retirement benefits or welfare benefits, or both, for the employees of a church or a convention or association of churches, if such organization is controlled by or associated with a church  or a convention or association of churches.\"  \u00a71002(33)(C)(i).\nThat is a mouthful, for lawyers and non-lawyers alike; to digest it more easily, note that everything after the word \"organization\" in the third line is just a (long-winded) description of a particular kind of church-associated entity--which this opinion will call a \"principal-purpose organization.\"  The main job of such an entity, as the statute explains, is to fund or manage a benefit plan for the employees of churches or (per the 1980 amendment's other part) of church affiliates.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The three federal agencies responsible for administering ERISA have long read those provisions, when taken together, to exempt plans like the hospitals' from the statute's mandates.  (The relevant agencies are the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor, and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.)  The original definitional provision--\u00a71002(33)(A), or paragraph (A) for short--defines a \"church plan\" as one \"established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church\"--not by a church-affiliated nonprofit.  But according to the agencies, the later (block-quoted) provision--\u00a71002(33)(C)(i), or just subparagraph (C)(i)--expands that definition to include any plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization, regardless of whether a church initially established the plan.  And, the agencies believe, the internal benefits committee of a church-affiliated nonprofit counts as such an organization.  See, e.g., IRS General Counsel Memorandum No. 39007 (Nov. 2, 1982), App. 636-637.  That interpretation has appeared in hundreds of private letter rulings and opinion letters issued since 1982, including several provided to the hospitals here.  See App. 57-69, 379-386, 668-715.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The three cases before us are part of a recent wave of litigation challenging the agencies' view.  Respondents, current and former employees of the hospitals, filed class actions alleging that their employers' pension plans do not fall within ERISA's church-plan exemption (and thus must satisfy the statute's requirements).  That is so, the employees claim, because those plans were not established by a church--and ERISA, even as amended, demands that all \"church plans\" have such an origin.  According to the employees, the addition of subparagraph (C)(i) allowed principal-purpose organizations to maintain such plans in lieu of churches; but that provision kept as-is paragraph (A)'s insistence that churches themselves establish \"church plans.\"  See id., at 265-268, 435-437, 783-785.  The District Courts handling the cases agreed with the employees' position, and therefore held that the hospitals' plans must comply with ERISA.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Courts of Appeals for the Third, Seventh, and Ninth Circuits affirmed those decisions.  The Third Circuit ruled first, concluding that ERISA's \"plain text\" requires that a pension plan be established by a church to qualify for the church-plan exemption.  Kaplan v. Saint Peter's Healthcare System, 810 F.\u00a03d 175, 177 (2015).  In the court's view, paragraph (A) set out \"two requirements\" for the exemption--\"establishment and maintenance\"--and \"only the latter is expanded by the use of 'includes'\u00a0\" in subparagraph (C)(i).  Id., at 181.  The Seventh and Ninth Circuits relied on similar reasoning to decide in the employees' favor.  See Stapleton v. Advocate Health Care Network, 817 F.\u00a03d 517, 523 (CA7 2016); Rollins v. Dignity Health, 830 F.\u00a03d 900, 906 (CA9 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the importance of the issue, this Court granted certiorari.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dispute in these cases about what counts as a \"church plan\" hinges on the combined meaning of paragraph (A) and subparagraph (C)(i).  Interpretive purists may refer back as needed to the provisions as quoted above.  See supra, at 3.  But for those who prefer their statutes in (comparatively) user-friendly form, those provisions go as follows:\nUnder paragraph (A), a \"\u00a0'church plan' means a plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church.\"  \nUnder subparagraph (C)(i), \"[a] plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church .\u00a0.\u00a0. includes a plan maintained by [a principal-purpose] organization.\"3\nThe parties agree that under those provisions, a \"church plan\" need not be maintained by a church; it may instead be maintained by a principal-purpose organization.  But the parties differ as to whether a plan maintained by that kind of organization must still have been established by a church to qualify for the church-plan exemption.  The hospitals say no: The effect of subparagraph (C)(i) was to bring within the church-plan definition all pension plans maintained by a principal-purpose organization, regardless of who first established them.  The employees say yes: Subparagraph (C)(i) altered only the requirement that a pension plan be maintained by a church, while leaving intact the church-establishment condition.  We conclude that the hospitals have the better of the argument.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start, as we always do, with the statutory language--here, a new definitional phrase piggy-backing on the one already existing.  The term \"church plan,\" as just stated, initially \"mean[t]\" only \"a plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church.\"  But subparagraph (C)(i) provides that the original definitional phrase will now \"include\" another--\"a plan maintained by [a principal-purpose] organization.\"  That use of the word \"include\" is not literal--any more than when Congress says something like \"a State 'includes' Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.\"  See, e.g., 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71002(10).4  Rather, it tells readers that a different type of plan should receive the same treatment (i.e., an exemption) as the type described in the old definition.  And those newly favored plans, once again, are simply those \"maintained by a principal-purpose organization\"--irrespective of their origins.  In effect, Congress provided that the new phrase can stand in for the old one as follows: \"The term 'church plan' means a plan established and maintained by a church [a plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization].\"  The church-establishment condition thus drops out of the picture.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider the same point in the form of a simple logic problem, with paragraph (A) and subparagraph (C)(i) as its first two steps: \nPremise 1: A plan established and maintained by a church is an exempt church plan.\nPremise 2: A plan established and maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization.\nDeduction: A plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization is an exempt church plan.\nOr, as one court put the point without any of the ERISA terminology: \"[I]f A is exempt, and A includes C, then C is exempt.\"  Overall v. Ascension, 23 F. Supp. 3d 816, 828 (ED Mich. 2014).  Just so.  Because Congress deemed the category of plans \"established and maintained by a church\" to \"include\" plans \"maintained by\" principal-purpose organizations, those plans--and all those plans--are exempt from ERISA's requirements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had Congress wanted, as the employees contend, to alter only the maintenance requirement, it had an easy way to do so--differing by only two words from the language it chose, but with an altogether different meaning.  Suppose Congress had provided that \"a plan maintained by a church includes a plan maintained by\" a principal-purpose organization, leaving out the words \"established and\" from the first part of the sentence.  That amendment would have accomplished exactly what the employees argue Congress intended: The language, that is, would have enabled a principal-purpose organization to take on the maintenance of a \"church plan,\" but left untouched the requirement that a church establish the plan in the first place.  But Congress did not adopt that ready alternative.  Instead, it added language whose most natural reading is to enable a plan \"maintained\" by a principal-purpose organization to substitute for a plan both \"established\" and \"maintained\" by a church.  That drafting decision indicates that Congress did not in fact want what the employees claim.  See, e.g., Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.\u00a0S. 1, ___-___ (2014) (slip op., at 13-14) (When legislators did not adopt \"obvious alternative\" language, \"the natural implication is that they did not intend\" the alternative).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A corollary to this point is that the employees' construction runs aground on the so-called surplusage canon--the presumption that each word Congress uses is there for a reason.  See generally A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 174-179 (2012).  As just explained, the employees urge us to read subparagraph (C)(i) as if it were missing the two words \"established and.\"  The employees themselves do not contest that point: They offer no account of what function that language would serve on their proposed interpretation.  See Brief for Respondents 34-35.  In essence, the employees ask us to treat those words as stray marks on a page--notations that Congress regrettably made but did not really intend.  Our practice, however, is to \"give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\"  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.\u00a0S. 362, 404 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And here, that means construing the words \"established and\" in subparagraph (C)(i) as removing, for plans run by principal-purpose organizations, paragraph (A)'s church-establishment condition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The employees' primary argument to the contrary takes the form of a supposed interpretive principle: \"[I]f a definition or rule has two criteria, and a further provision expressly modifies only one of them, that provision is understood to affect only the criterion it expands or modifies.\"  Brief for Respondents 22.  Applied here, the employees explain, that principle requires us to read subparagraph (C)(i) as \"modify[ing] only the criterion\" in paragraph (A) that \"it expressly expands ('maintained'), while leaving the other criterion ('established') unchanged.\"  Id., at 14.  The employees cite no precedent or other authority to back up their proposed rule of construction, but they offer a thought-provoking hypothetical to demonstrate its good sense.  Id., at 22.  Imagine, they say, that a statute provides free insurance to a \"person who is disabled and a veteran,\" and an amendment then states that \"a person who is disabled and a veteran includes a person who served in the National Guard.\"  Ibid. (quoting 810 F.\u00a03d, at 181). Would a non-disabled member of the National Guard be entitled to the insurance benefit?  Surely not, the employees answer: All of us would understand the \"includes\" provision to expand (or clarify) only the meaning of \"veteran\"--leaving unchanged the requirement of a disability.  And the same goes here, the employees claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But one good example does not a general rule make.  Consider a variant of the employees' hypothetical: A statute offers free insurance to a \"person who enlisted and served in the active Armed Forces,\" with a later amendment providing that \"a person who enlisted and served in the active Armed Forces includes a person who served in the National Guard.\"  Would a person who served in the National Guard be ineligible for benefits unless she had also enlisted in the active Armed Forces--say, the regular Army or Navy?  Of course not.5  Two hypotheticals with similar grammatical constructions, two different results.  In the employees' example, the mind rebels against reading the statute literally, in line with the logical and canonical principles described above.  In the variant, by contrast, the statute's literal meaning and its most natural meaning cohere: Satisfaction of the amendment's single eligibility criterion--service in the National Guard--is indeed enough.  What might account for that divergence?  And what does such an explanation suggest for ERISA?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two features of the employees' hypothetical, when taken in combination, make it effective.  First, the criteria there--veteran-status and disability--are relatively distinct from one another.  (Compare enlistment and service, which address similar matters and tend to travel in tandem, the one preceding the other.)  The more independent the specified variables, the more likely that they were designed to have standalone relevance.  Second and yet more crucial, the employees' example trades on our background understanding that a given interpretation is simply implausible--that it could not possibly have been what Congress wanted.  Congress, we feel sure, would not have intended all National Guardsmen to get a benefit that is otherwise reserved for disabled veterans.  (Compare that to our sense of whether Congress would have meant to hinge benefits to Guardsmen on their enlistment in a different service.)  That sense of inconceivability does most of the work in the employees' example, urging readers to discard usual rules of interpreting text because they will lead to a \"must be wrong\" outcome.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But subparagraph (C)(i) possesses neither of those characteristics.  For starters, the criteria at issue--establishment and maintenance--are not unrelated.  The former serves as a necessary precondition of the latter, and both describe an aspect of an entity's involvement with a benefit plan.  Indeed, for various purposes, ERISA treats the terms \"establish\" and \"maintain\" interchangeably.  See, e.g., \u00a71002(16)(B) (defining the \"sponsor\" of a plan as the organization that \"establishe[s] or maintain[s]\" the plan).  So an amendment altering the one requirement could naturally alter the other too.  What's more, nothing we know about the way ERISA is designed to operate makes that an utterly untenable result.  Whereas the disability condition is central to the statutory scheme in the employees' hypothetical, the church-establishment condition, taken on its own, has limited functional significance.  Establishment of a plan, after all, is a one-time, historical event; it is the entity maintaining the plan that has the primary ongoing responsibility (and potential liability) to plan participants.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31; Rose v. Long Island R.\u00a0R. Pension Plan, 828 F.\u00a02d 910, 920 (CA2 1987), cert. denied, 485 U.\u00a0S. 936 (1988) (\"[T]he status of the entity which currently maintains a particular pension plan bears more relation  to Congress' goals in enacting ERISA and its various exemptions[\u00a0] than does the status of the entity which established the plan\").  So removing the establishment condition for plans run by principal-purpose organizations has none of the contextual implausibility--the \"Congress could not possibly have meant that\" quality--on which the employees' example principally rides.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the contrary, everything we can tell from extra-statutory sources about Congress's purpose in enacting subparagraph (C)(i) supports our reading of its text.  We say \"everything we can tell\" because in fact we cannot tell all that much.  The legislative materials in these cases consist almost wholly of excerpts from committee hearings and scattered floor statements by individual lawmakers--the sort of stuff we have called \"among the least illuminating forms of legislative history.\"  NLRB v. SW General, Inc., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 16).  And even those lowly sources speak at best indirectly to the precise question here: None, that is, comments in so many words on whether subparagraph (C)(i) altered paragraph (A)'s church-establishment condition.  Still, both the hospitals and the employees have constructed narratives from those bits and pieces about Congress's goals in amending paragraph (A).  And our review of their accounts--the employees' nearly as much as the hospitals'--tends to confirm our conviction that plans maintained by principal-purpose organizations are eligible for ERISA's \"church plan\" exemption, whatever their origins.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the hospitals, Congress wanted to eliminate any distinction between churches and church-affiliated organizations under ERISA.  See Brief for Petitioners 18, 33-35.  The impetus behind the 1980 amendment, they claim, was an IRS decision holding that pension plans established by orders of Catholic Sisters (to benefit their hospitals' employees) did not qualify as \"church plans\" because the orders were not \"carrying out [the Church's] religious functions.\"  IRS General Counsel Memorandum No. 37266, 1977 WL 46200, *5 (Sept. 22, 1977).  Many religious groups protested that ruling, criticizing the IRS for \"attempting to define what is and what is not [a] 'church' and how the mission of the church is to be carried out.\"  125 Cong. Rec. 10054 (1979) (letter to Sen. Talmadge from the Lutheran Church-Missouri  Synod); see id., at 10054-10058 (similar letters).  And that anger, the hospitals maintain, was what prompted ERISA's amendment: Congress, they say, designed the new provision to ensure that, however categorized, all groups associated with church activities would receive comparable treatment.  See Brief for Petitioners 35.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If that is so, our construction of the text fits Congress's objective to a T.  A church-establishment requirement necessarily puts the IRS in the business of deciding just what a church is and is not--for example (as in the IRS's ruling about the Sisters), whether a particular Catholic religious order should count as one.  And that requirement, by definition, disfavors plans created by church affiliates, as compared to those established by (whatever the IRS has decided are) churches.  It thus makes key to the \"church plan\" exemption the very line that, on the hospitals' account, Congress intended to erase.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The employees tell a different story about the origins of subparagraph (C)(i)--focusing on the pension boards that congregational denominations often used.  See Brief for Respondents 14, 38-42; see also Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19-22.  In line with their non-hierarchical nature, those denominations typically relied on separately incorporated local boards--rather than entities integrated into a national church structure--to administer benefits for their ministers and lay workers.  According to the employees, subparagraph (C)(i)'s main goal was to bring those local pension boards within the church-plan exemption, so as to ensure that congregational and hierarchical churches would receive the same treatment.  In support of their view, the employees cite several floor statements in which the amendment's sponsors addressed that objective.  See Brief for Respondents 38.  Senator Talmadge, for example, stated that under the amendment, a \"plan or program funded or administered through a pension board .\u00a0.\u00a0. will be considered a church plan.\"  124 Cong. Rec. 16523; see also 124 Cong. Rec. 12107 (remarks of Rep. Conable).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that account of subparagraph (C)(i)'s primary purpose cuts against, not in favor of, the employees' position.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21 (accepting the employees' narrative, but arguing that it buttresses the opposite conclusion).  That is because, as hearing testimony disclosed, plans run by church-affiliated pension boards came in different varieties: Some were created by church congregations, but others were established by the boards themselves.  See, e.g., Hearings on S. 1090 et\u00a0al. before the Subcommittee on Private Pension Plans and Employee Fringe Benefits of the Senate Committee on Finance, 96th Cong., 1st Sess., 400-401, 415-417  (1979).  And still others were sufficiently old that their provenance could have become the subject of dispute.  See id., at 411; 125 Cong. Rec. 10052 (remarks of Sen. Talmadge) (\"The average age of a church plan is at least 40 years\").  So keeping the church-establishment requirement would have prevented some plans run by pension boards--the very entities the employees say Congress most wanted to benefit--from qualifying as \"church plans\" under ERISA.  No argument the employees have offered here supports that goal-defying (much less that text-defying) statutory construction.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ERISA provides (1) that a \"church plan\" means a \"plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church\" and (2) that a \"plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church\" is to \"include[\u00a0] a plan maintained by\" a principal-purpose organization.  Under the best reading of the statute, a plan maintained by a principal-purpose organization therefore qualifies as a \"church plan,\" regardless of who established it.  We accordingly reverse the judgments of the Courts of Appeals.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\nSotomayor, J., concurring\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNos. 16-74, 16-86, and 16-258\nADVOCATE HEALTH CARE NETWORK, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS 16-74\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.

Spink, 517 U.\u00a0S. 882, 887 (1996).  Any decision interpreting the provisions governing which employers are subject to ERISA is ultimately a decision about which employees receive this assurance.  Today, by holding that ERISA's exemption for \"church plan[s],\" 29 U. S. C. \u00a71003(b)(2), covers plans neither established nor maintained by a church, the Court holds that scores of employees--who work for organizations that look and operate much like secular businesses--potentially might be denied ERISA's protections.  In fact, it was the failure of unregulated \"church plans\" that spurred cases such as these.  See, e.g., Brief for Respondents 7-8 (collecting cases and press reports of church plan failures).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I join the Court's opinion because I am persuaded that it correctly interprets the relevant statutory text.  But I am nonetheless troubled by the outcome of these cases.  As the majority acknowledges, ante, at 12, the available legislative history does not clearly endorse this result.  That silence gives me pause: The decision to exempt plans neither established nor maintained by a church could have the kind of broad effect that is usually thoroughly debated during the legislative process and thus recorded in the legislative record.  And to the extent that Congress acted to exempt plans established by orders of Catholic Sisters, see ibid., it is not at all clear that Congress would take the same action today with respect to some of the largest health-care providers in the country.  Despite their relationship to churches, organizations such as petitioners operate for-profit subsidiaries, see Dignity Health and Subordinate Corporations, Consolidated Financial Statements as of and for Years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 and Independent Auditors' Report, p. 50, https:\/\/emma. msrb.org\/ES823341-ES646022-ES1041174.pdf (as last visited  June 1, 2017); employ thousands of employees, App. 774; App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 16-74, pp. 5a, 31a; earn billions of dollars in revenue, ibid.; and compete in the secular market with companies that must bear the cost of complying with ERISA.  These organizations thus bear little resemblance to those Congress considered when enacting the 1980 amendment to the church plan definition.  This current reality might prompt Congress to take a different path.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the end, I agree with the majority that the statutory text compels today's result.  Other provisions also impact the scope of the \"church plan\" exemption.  Those provisions--including the provisions governing which organizations qualify as principal  purpose organizations permitted to establish and maintain \"church plans,\" see, e.g., ante, at 6, n. 3--need also be construed in line with their text and with a view toward effecting ERISA's broad remedial purposes.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Together with No. 16-86, Saint Peter's Healthcare System et\u00a0al. v. Kaplan, on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and No. 16-258, Dignity Health et\u00a0al. v. Rollins, on certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The parties disputed the hospitals' church ties in the courts below, see n.\u00a02, infra, but we assume for purposes of this decision that the facts are as the hospitals describe them.  On those facts: Advocate Health Care Network operates 12 hospitals and some 250 other healthcare facilities in Illinois, and is associated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the United Church of Christ.  Saint Peter's Healthcare System runs a teaching hospital and several other medical facilities in New Jersey, and is both owned and controlled by a Roman Catholic diocese there.  And Dignity Health runs an extensive network of community hospitals throughout the country, and maintains ties to the Catholic religious orders that initially sponsored some of its facilities.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The employees alternatively argued in the District Courts that the hospitals' pension plans are not \"church plans\" because the hospitals do not have the needed association with a church and because, even if they do, their internal benefits committees do not count as principal-purpose organizations.  See App. 267-269, 437-438, 785-786.  Those issues are not before us, and nothing we say in this opinion expresses a view of how they should be resolved.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Again, we use the term \"principal-purpose organization\" as shorthand for the entity described in subparagraph (C)(i): a church-associated organization whose chief purpose or function is to fund or administer a benefits plan for the employees of either a church or a church-affiliated nonprofit.  See supra, at 3.  And again, the scope of that term--and whether it comprehends the hospitals' internal benefits committees--is not at issue here.  See n.\u00a02, supra.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Or any more than when Congress, in the same 1980 amendment to ERISA, provided that an \"employee of a church\" was to \"include[\u00a0]\" an employee of a church-affiliated organization.  \u00a71002(33)(C)(ii); see supra, at 3.\nFootnote 5\u00a0You might ask yourself, on reading this hypothetical statute, why Congress would not have made the removal of both original conditions clearer still by stating that the original provision \"includes a person who enlisted and served in the National Guard.\"  We won't go down the rabbit hole of further expounding on a fictional statute, but we can answer a parallel question for subparagraph (C)(i).  Suppose Congress had stated that \"[a] plan established and maintained .\u00a0.\u00a0. by a church .\u00a0.\u00a0. includes a plan established and maintained by [a principal-purpose] organization.\"  That language would have left out of the \"church plan\" definition pension plans originally established by churches, but subsequently maintained by principal-purpose organizations.  And everyone agrees--the employees no less than the hospitals--that Congress wanted to treat those plans as \"church plans.\"  (The dispute is only as to plans that principal-purpose organizations both establish and maintain.)  See supra, at 6; Brief for Petitioners 25-26; Brief for Respondents 14, 35; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24.  So Congress could not have taken such a drafting tack to eliminate the necessity of church establishment.\n\n\n","3":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBANK OF AMERICA CORP. ET AL. v. CITY OF MIAMI, FLORIDA(2017)\nNo. 15-1111\nArgued: November 8, 2016Decided: May 1, 2017\n\n\nThe City of Miami filed suit against Bank of America and Wells Fargo (Banks), alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act (FHA or Act).  The FHA prohibits, among other things, racial discrimination in connection with real-estate transactions, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73604(b), 3605(a), and permits any \"aggrieved person\" to file a civil damages action for a violation of the Act, \u00a7\u00a73613(a)(1)(A), (c)(1).  The City's complaints charge that the Banks intentionally targeted predatory practices at African-American and Latino neighborhoods and residents, lending to minority borrowers on worse terms than equally creditworthy nonminority borrowers and inducing defaults by failing to extend refinancing and loan modifications to minority borrowers on fair terms.  The City alleges that the Banks' discriminatory conduct led to a disproportionate number of foreclosures and vacancies in majority-minority neighborhoods, which impaired the City's effort to assure racial integration, diminished the City's property-tax revenue, and increased demand for police, fire, and other municipal services.  The District Court dismissed the complaints on the grounds that (1) the harms alleged fell outside the zone of interests the FHA protects and (2) the complaints failed to show a sufficient causal connection between the City's injuries and the Banks' discriminatory conduct.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The City is an \"aggrieved person\" authorized to bring suit under the FHA.  In addition to satisfying constitutional standing requirements, see Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, a plaintiff must show that the statute grants the plaintiff the cause of action he or she asserts.  It is presumed that a statute ordinarily provides a cause of action \"only to plaintiffs whose interests 'fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.'\u00a0\"  Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The City's claims of financial injury are, at the least, \"arguably within the zone of interests\" the FHA protects.  Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.\u00a0S. 150, 153.  The FHA defines an \"aggrieved person\" as \"any person who\" either \"claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice\" or believes that such an injury \"is about to occur,\" 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73602(i).  This Court has said that the definition of \"person aggrieved\" in the original version of the FHA \"showed 'a congressional intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution,'\u00a0\" Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.\u00a0S. 205, 209; and has held that the Act permits suit by parties similarly situated to the City, see, e.g., Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.\u00a0S. 91 (village alleging that it lost tax revenue and had the racial balance of its community undermined by racial-steering practices).  Against the backdrop of those decisions, Congress did not materially alter the definition of person \"aggrieved\" when it reenacted the current version of the Act.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Banks nonetheless contend that the definition sets boundaries that fall short of those the Constitution sets.  Even assuming that some form of their argument is valid, this Court concludes that the City's financial injuries fall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects.  The City's claims are similar in kind to those of the Village of Bellwood, which the Court held in Gladstone, supra, could bring suit under the FHA.  The Court explained that the defendants' discriminatory conduct adversely affected the village by, among other things, producing a \"significant reduction in property values [that] directly injures a municipality by diminishing its tax base, thus threatening its ability to bear the costs of local government and to provide services.\"  Id., at 110-111.  The City's alleged economic injuries thus arguably fall within the FHA's zone of interests, as this Court has previously interpreted that statute.  Stare decisis principles compel the Court's adherence to those precedents, and principles of statutory interpretation demand that the Court respect Congress' decision to ratify those precedents when it reenacted the relevant statutory text.  Pp.\u00a05-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit erred in concluding that the complaints met the FHA's proximate-cause requirement based solely on the finding that the City's alleged financial injuries were foreseeable results of the Banks' misconduct.  A claim for damages under the FHA is akin to a \"tort action,\" Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.\u00a0S. 280, 285, and is thus subject to the common-law requirement that loss is attributable \"\u00a0'to the proximate cause, and not to any remote cause,'\u00a0\" Lexmark, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  The proximate-cause analysis asks \"whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.\"  Id., at ___.  With respect to the FHA, foreseeability alone does not ensure the required close connection.  Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to provide a remedy for any foreseeable result of an FHA violation, which may \"\u00a0'cause ripples of harm to flow'\u00a0\" far beyond the defendant's misconduct, Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.\u00a0S. 519, 534; and doing so would risk \"massive and complex damages litigation,\" id., at 545.  Rather, proximate cause under the FHA requires \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\"  Holmes v. Securities Investors Protection Corporation, 503 U.\u00a0S. 258, 268.  The Court has repeatedly applied directness principles to statutes with \"common-law foundations.\"  Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.\u00a0S. 451, 457.  \"\u00a0'The general tendency'\u00a0\" in these cases, \"\u00a0'in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step.'\u00a0\"  Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.\u00a0S. 1, 10.  What falls within that step depends in part on the \"nature of the statutory cause of action,\" Lexmark, supra, at ___, and an assessment \"\u00a0'of what is administratively possible and convenient,'\u00a0\" Holmes, supra, at 268.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Court declines to draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause under the FHA, particularly where neither the Eleventh Circuit nor other courts of appeals have weighed in on the issue.  Instead, the lower courts should define, in the first instance, the contours of proximate cause under the FHA and decide how that standard applies to the City's claims for lost property-tax revenue and increased municipal expenses.

CITY OF MIAMI, FLORIDA\n\n\non writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[May 1, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fair Housing Act (FHA or Act) forbids\n\"discriminat[ing] against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith, because of race .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73604(b).\nIt further makes it unlawful for\n\"any person or other entity whose business includes engaging in residential real estate-related transactions to discriminate against any person in making available such a transaction, or in the terms or conditions of such a transaction, because of race .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  \u00a73605(a).\nThe statute allows any \"aggrieved person\" to file a civil action seeking damages for a violation of the statute.  \u00a7\u00a73613(a)(1)(A), 3613(c)(1).  And it defines an \"aggrieved person\" to include \"any person who .\u00a0.\u00a0. claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice.\"  \u00a73602(i).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The City of Miami claims that two banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo, intentionally issued riskier mortgages on less favorable terms to African-American and Latino customers than they issued to similarly situated white, non-Latino customers, in violation of \u00a7\u00a73604(b) and 3605(a).  App. 185-197, 244-245, 350-362, 428.  The City, in amended complaints, alleges that these discriminatory practices have (1) \"adversely impacted the racial composition of the City,\" id., at 232, 416; (2) \"impaired the City's goals to assure racial integration and desegregation,\" ibid.; (3) \"frustrate[d] the City's longstanding and active interest in promoting fair housing and securing the benefits of an integrated community,\" id., at 232-233, 416-417; and (4) disproportionately \"cause[d] foreclosures and vacancies in minority communities in Miami,\" id., at 229, 413.  Those foreclosures and vacancies have harmed the City by  decreasing \"the property value of the foreclosed home as well as the values of other homes in the neighborhood,\" thereby (a) \"reduc[ing] property tax revenues to the City,\" id., at 234, 418, and (b) forcing the City to spend more on \"municipal services that it provided and still must provide to remedy blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions which exist at properties that were foreclosed as a result of [the Banks'] illegal lending practices,\" id., at  233-234, 417.  The City claims that those practices violate the FHA and that it is entitled to damages for the listed injuries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Banks respond that the complaints do not set forth a cause of action for two basic reasons.  First, they contend that the City's claimed harms do not \"arguably\" fall within the \"zone of interests\" that the statute seeks to protect, Association of Data Processing Service Organizations, Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.\u00a0S. 150, 153 (1970); hence, the City is not an \"aggrieved person\" entitled to sue under the Act, \u00a73602(i).  Second, they say that the complaint fails to draw a \"proximate-cause\" connection between the violation claimed and the harm allegedly suffered.  In their view, even if the City proves the violations it charges, the distance between those violations and the harms the City claims to have suffered is simply too great to entitle the City to collect damages.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that the City's claimed injuries fall within the zone of interests that the FHA arguably protects.  Hence, the City is an \"aggrieved person\" able to bring suit under the statute.  We also hold that, to establish proximate cause under the FHA, a plaintiff must do more than show that its injuries foreseeably flowed from the alleged statutory violation.  The lower court decided these cases on the theory that foreseeability is all that the statute requires, so we vacate and remand for further proceedings.  \nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2013, the City of Miami brought lawsuits in federal court against two banks, Bank of America and Wells Fargo.  The City's complaints charge that the Banks discriminatorily imposed more onerous, and indeed \"predatory,\" conditions on loans made to minority borrowers than to similarly situated nonminority borrowers.  App. 185-197, 350-362.  Those \"predatory\" practices included, among others, excessively high interest rates, unjustified fees, teaser low-rate loans that overstated refinancing opportunities, large prepayment penalties, and--when default loomed--unjustified refusals to refinance or modify the loans.  Id., at 225, 402.  Due to the discriminatory nature of the Banks' practices, default and foreclosure rates among minority borrowers were higher than among otherwise similar white borrowers and were concentrated in minority neighborhoods.  Id., at 225-232, 408-415.  Higher foreclosure rates lowered property values and diminished property-tax revenue.  Id., at 234, 418.  Higher foreclosure rates--especially when accompanied by vacancies--also  increased demand for municipal services, such as police, fire, and building and code enforcement services, all needed \"to remedy blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions\" that the foreclosures and vacancies generate.  Id., at 238-240, 421-423.  The complaints describe statistical analyses that trace the City's financial losses to the Banks' discriminatory practices.  Id., at 235-237; 419-420.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court dismissed the complaints on the grounds that (1) the harms alleged, being economic and not discriminatory, fell outside the zone of interests the FHA protects; (2) the complaints fail to show a sufficient causal connection between the City's injuries and the Banks' discriminatory conduct; and (3) the complaints fail to allege unlawful activity occurring within the Act's 2-year statute of limitations.  The City then filed amended complaints (the complaints now before us) and sought reconsideration.  The District Court held that the amended complaints could solve only the statute of limitations problem.  It consequently declined to reconsider the  dismissals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court.  800 F.\u00a03d 1262 (CA11 2015); 801 F.\u00a03d 1258 (CA11 2015).  It held that the City's injuries fall within the \"zone of interests,\" Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 10), that the FHA protects.  800 F.\u00a03d, at 1274-1275, 1277 (relying on Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.\u00a0S. 205 (1972); Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.\u00a0S. 91 (1979); and Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.\u00a0S. 363 (1982)); 801 F.\u00a03d, at 1266-1267 (similar).  It added that the complaints adequately allege proximate cause.  800 F.\u00a03d, at 1278; 801 F.\u00a03d, at 1267.  And it remanded the cases while ordering the District Court to accept the City's complaints as amended.  800 F.\u00a03d, at 1286; 801 F.\u00a03d, at 1267.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Banks filed petitions for certiorari, asking us to decide whether, as the Court of Appeals had in effect held, the amended complaints satisfied the FHA's zone-of-interests and proximate-cause requirements.  We agreed to do so.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To satisfy the Constitution's restriction of this Court's jurisdiction to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies,\" Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72, a plaintiff must demonstrate constitutional standing.  To do so, the plaintiff must show an \"injury in fact\" that is \"fairly traceable\" to the defendant's conduct and \"that is likely  to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6) (citing Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.\u00a0S. 555, 560-561 (1992)).  This Court has also referred to a plaintiff's need to satisfy \"prudential\" or \"statutory\" standing requirements.  See Lexmark, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___, and n.\u00a04 (slip op., at 6-9, and n.\u00a04).  In Lexmark, we said that the label \"\u00a0'prudential standing'\u00a0\" was misleading, for the requirement at issue is in reality tied to a particular statute.  Ibid.  The question is whether the statute grants the plaintiff the cause of action that he asserts.  In answering that question, we presume that a statute ordinarily provides a cause of action \"only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We have added that \"[w]hether a plaintiff comes within 'the zone of interests' is an issue that requires us to determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff's claim.\"  Id.,  at ___ (slip op., at 8) (some internal quotation marks  omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, we conclude that the City's claims of financial injury in their amended complaints--specifically, lost tax revenue and extra municipal expenses--satisfy the \"cause-of-action\" (or \"prudential standing\") requirement.  To use the language of Data Processing, the City's claims of injury it suffered as a result of the statutory violations are, at the least, \"arguably within the zone of interests\" that the FHA protects.  397 U.\u00a0S., at 153 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FHA permits any \"aggrieved person\" to bring a housing-discrimination lawsuit.  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73613(a).  The statute defines \"aggrieved person\" as \"any person who\" either \"claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice\" or believes that such an injury \"is about to occur.\"  \u00a73602(i).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has repeatedly written that the FHA's definition of person \"aggrieved\" reflects a congressional intent to confer standing broadly.  We have said that the definition of \"person aggrieved\" in the original version of the FHA, \u00a7810(a), 82 Stat. 85, \"showed 'a congressional intention to define standing as broadly as is permitted by Article III of the Constitution.'\u00a0\"  Trafficante, supra, at 209 (quoting Hackett v. McGuire Brothers, Inc., 445 F.\u00a02d 442, 446 (CA3 1971)); see Gladstone, supra, at 109 (similar); Havens Realty, supra, at 372, 375-376 (similar); see also Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP, 562 U.\u00a0S. 170, 176 (2011) (\"Later opinions, we must acknowledge, reiterate that the term 'aggrieved' [in the FHA] reaches as far as Article III permits\"); Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.\u00a0S. 154, 165-166 (1997) (\"[Trafficante] held that standing was expanded to the full extent permitted under Article III by \u00a7810(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1968\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, we have held that the Act allows suits by white tenants claiming that they were deprived benefits from interracial associations when discriminatory rental practices kept minorities out of their apartment complex, Trafficante, 409 U.\u00a0S., at 209-212; a village alleging that it lost tax revenue and had the racial balance of its community undermined by racial-steering practices, Gladstone, 441 U.\u00a0S., at 110-111; and a nonprofit organization that spent money to combat housing discrimination, Havens Realty, 455 U.\u00a0S., at 379.  Contrary to the dissent's view, those cases did more than \"sugges[t]\" that plaintiffs similarly situated to the City have a cause of action under the FHA.  Post, at 5.  They held as much.  And the dissent is wrong to say that we characterized those cases as resting on \"ill-considered dictum.\"  Post, at 4 (quoting Thompson, supra, at 176).  The \"dictum\" we cast doubt on in Thompson addressed who may sue under Title VII, the employment discrimination statute, not under the FHA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, in 1988, when Congress amended the FHA, it retained without significant change the definition of \"person aggrieved\" that this Court had broadly construed. Compare \u00a7810(a), 82 Stat. 85, with \u00a75(b), 102 Stat. 1619-1620 (codified at 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73602(i)) (changing \"person aggrieved\" to \"aggrieved person\" and making other minor changes to the definition).  Indeed, Congress \"was aware of\" our precedent and \"made a considered judgment to retain the relevant statutory text,\" Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 13).  See H. R. Rep. No.\u00a0100-711, p. 23 (1988) (stating that the \"bill adopts as its definition language similar to that contained in Section 810 of existing law, as modified to reaffirm the broad holdings of these cases\" and discussing Gladstone and Havens Realty); cf. Lorillard v. Pons, 434 U.\u00a0S. 575, 580 (1978) (Congress normally adopts our interpretations of statutes when it reenacts those statute without change).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Banks do not deny the broad reach of the words \"aggrieved person\" as defined in the FHA.  But they do contend that those words nonetheless set boundaries that fall short of those the Constitution sets.  Brief for Petitioners in No.\u00a015-1112, p. 12 (Brief for Wells Fargo); Brief for Petitioners in No.\u00a015-1111, pp. 19-20 (Brief for Bank of America).  The Court's language in Trafficante, Gladstone, and Havens Realty, they argue, was exaggerated and unnecessary to decide the cases then before the Court.  See Brief for Wells Fargo 19-23; Brief for Bank of America 27-33.  Moreover, they warn that taking the Court's words literally--providing everyone with constitutional standing a cause of action under the FHA--would produce a legal anomaly.  After all, in Thompson, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 175-177, we held that the words \"\u00a0'person claiming to be aggrieved'\u00a0\" in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the employment discrimination statute, did not stretch that statute's zone of interest to the limits of Article III.  We reasoned that such an interpretation would produce farfetched results, for example, a shareholder in a company could bring a Title VII suit against the company for discriminatorily firing an employee.  Ibid.  The Banks say it would be similarly farfetched if restaurants, plumbers, utility companies, or any other participant in the local economy could sue the Banks to recover business they lost when people had to give up their homes and leave the neighborhood as a result of the Banks' discriminatory lending practices.  Brief for Wells Fargo 18-19; Brief for Bank of America 22, 24-25.  That, they believe, cannot have been the intent of the Congress that enacted or amended the FHA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We need not discuss the Banks' argument at length, for even if we assume for argument's sake that some form of it is valid, we nonetheless conclude that the City's financial injuries fall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects.  Our case law with respect to the FHA drives that conclusion.  The City's complaints allege that the Banks \"intentionally targeted predatory practices at African-American and Latino neighborhoods and residents,\" App. 225; id., at 409 (similar).  That unlawful conduct led  to a \"concentration\" of \"foreclosures and vacancies\" in those neighborhoods.  Id., at 226, 229, 410, 413.  Those concentrated \"foreclosures and vacancies\" caused \"stagnation and decline in African-American and Latino neighborhoods.\"  Id., at 225, 409.  They hindered the City's efforts to create integrated, stable neighborhoods.  Id., at 186, 351.  And, highly relevant here, they reduced property values, diminishing the City's property-tax revenue and increasing demand for municipal services.  Id., at 233-234, 417.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those claims are similar in kind to the claims the Village of Bellwood raised in Gladstone.  There, the plaintiff village had alleged that it was \"\u00a0'injured by having [its] housing market .\u00a0.\u00a0. wrongfully and illegally manipulated to the economic and social detriment of the citizens of [the] village.'\u00a0\"  441 U.\u00a0S., at 95 (quoting the complaint; alterations in original).  We held that the village could bring suit.  We wrote that the complaint in effect alleged that the defendant-realtors' racial steering \"affect[ed] the village's racial composition,\" \"reduce[d] the total number of buyers in the Bellwood housing market,\" \"precipitate[d] an exodus of white residents,\" and caused \"prices [to] be deflected downward.\"  Id., at 110.  Those circumstances adversely affected the village by, among other things, producing a \"significant reduction in property values [that] directly injures a municipality by diminishing its tax base, thus threatening its ability to bear the costs of local government and to provide services.\"  Id., at 110-111 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The upshot is that the City alleges economic injuries that arguably fall within the FHA's zone of interests, as we have previously interpreted that statute.  Principles of stare decisis compel our adherence to those precedents in this context.  And principles of statutory interpretation require us to respect Congress' decision to ratify those precedents when it reenacted the relevant statutory text.  See supra, at 7.  \nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The remaining question is one of causation: Did the Banks' allegedly discriminatory lending practices proximately cause the City to lose property-tax revenue and spend more on municipal services?  The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the answer is \"yes\" because the City plausibly alleged that its financial injuries were foreseeable results of the Banks' misconduct.  We conclude that foreseeability alone is not sufficient to establish proximate cause under the FHA, and therefore vacate the judgment below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is a \"\u00a0'well established principle of [the common] law that in all cases of loss, we are to attribute it to the proximate cause, and not to any remote cause.'\u00a0\"  Lexmark, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  We assume Congress \"is familiar with the common-law rule and does not mean to displace it sub silentio\" in federal causes of action.  Ibid.  A claim for damages under the FHA--which is akin to a \"tort action,\" Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.\u00a0S. 280, 285 (2003)--is no exception to this traditional requirement.  \"Proximate-cause analysis is controlled by the nature of the statutory cause of action.  The question it presents is whether the harm alleged has a sufficiently close connection to the conduct the statute prohibits.\"  Lexmark, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In these cases, the \"conduct the statute prohibits\" consists of intentionally lending to minority borrowers on worse terms than equally creditworthy nonminority borrowers and inducing defaults by failing to extend refinancing and loan modifications to minority borrowers on fair terms.  The City alleges that the Banks' misconduct led to a disproportionate number of foreclosures and vacancies in specific Miami neighborhoods.  These foreclosures and vacancies purportedly harmed the City, which lost property-tax revenue when the value of the properties in those neighborhoods fell and was forced to spend more on municipal services in the affected areas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit concluded that the City adequately pleaded that the Banks' misconduct proximately caused these financial injuries.  800 F.\u00a03d, at 1282.  The court held that in the context of the FHA \"the proper standard\" for proximate cause \"is based on foreseeability.\"  Id., at 1279, 1282.  The City, it continued, satisfied that element: Although there are \"several links in the causal chain\" between the charged discriminatory lending practices and the claimed losses, the City plausibly alleged that \"none are unforeseeable.\"  Id., at 1282.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that foreseeability is sufficient to establish proximate cause under the FHA.  As we have explained, proximate cause \"generally bars suits for alleged harm that is 'too remote' from the defendant's unlawful conduct.\"  Lexmark, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14).  In the context of the FHA, foreseeability alone does not ensure the close connection that proximate cause requires.  The housing market is interconnected with economic and social life.  A violation of the FHA may, therefore, \"\u00a0'be expected to cause ripples of harm to flow'\u00a0\"  far beyond the defendant's misconduct.  Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.\u00a0S. 519, 534 (1983).  Nothing in the statute suggests that Congress intended to provide a remedy wherever those ripples travel.  And entertaining suits to recover damages for any foreseeable result of an FHA violation would risk \"massive and complex damages litigation.\"  Id., at 545.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather, proximate cause under the FHA requires \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\"  Holmes v. Securities Investors Protection Corporation, 503 U. S. 258, 268 (1992).  A damages claim under the statute \"is analogous to a number of tort actions recognized at common law,\" Curtis v. Loether, 415 U.\u00a0S. 189, 195 (1974), and we have repeatedly applied directness principles to statutes with \"common-law foundations,\" Anza v. Ideal Steel Supply Corp., 547 U.\u00a0S. 451, 457 (2006).  \"\u00a0'The general tendency'\u00a0\" in these cases, \"\u00a0'in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step.'\u00a0\"  Hemi Group, LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.\u00a0S. 1, 10 (2010).  What falls within that \"first step\" depends in part on the \"nature of the statutory cause of action,\" Lexmark, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14), and an assessment \"\u00a0'of what is administratively possible and convenient,'\u00a0\" Holmes, supra, at 268.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The parties have asked us to draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause under the FHA and to determine on which side of the line the City's financial injuries fall.  We decline to do so.  The Eleventh Circuit grounded its decision on the theory that proximate cause under the FHA is \"based on foreseeability\" alone.  800 F. 3d, at 1282.  We therefore lack the benefit of its judgment on how the contrary principles we have just stated apply to the FHA.  Nor has any other court of appeals weighed in on the issue.  The lower courts should define, in the first instance, the contours of proximate cause under the FHA and decide how that standard applies to the City's claims for lost property-tax revenue and increased municipal expenses.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\nOpinion of Thomas, J.\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNos. 15-1111 and 15-1112\nBANK OF AMERICA CORPORATION, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS 15-1111\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.

CITY OF MIAMI, FLORIDA\n\n\non writs of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[May 1, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These cases arise from lawsuits filed by the city of Miami alleging that residential mortgage lenders engaged in discriminatory lending practices in violation of the Fair Housing Act (FHA).  The FHA prohibits \"discrimination\" against \"any person\" because of \"race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin\" with respect to the \"sale or rental\" of \"a dwelling.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73604; accord, \u00a73605(a); \u00a73606.  Miami's complaints do not allege that any defendant discriminated against it within the meaning of the FHA.  Neither is Miami attempting to bring a lawsuit on behalf of its residents against whom petitioners allegedly discriminated.  Rather, Miami's theory is that, between 2004 and 2012, petitioners' allegedly discriminatory mortgage-lending practices led to defaulted loans, which led to foreclosures, which led to vacant houses, which led to decreased property values, which led to reduced property taxes and urban blight.  See 800 F.\u00a03d 1262, 1268 (CA11 2015); 801 F. 3d 1258, 1266 (CA11 2015).  Miami seeks damages from the lenders for reduced property tax revenues and for the cost of increased municipal services--\"police, firefighters, building inspectors, debris collectors, and others\"--deployed to attend to the blighted areas.  800 F.\u00a03d, at 1269; 801 F.\u00a03d, at 1263.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today holds that Congress intended to remedy those kinds of injuries when it enacted the FHA, but leaves open the question whether Miami sufficiently alleged that the discriminatory lending practices caused its injuries.  For the reasons explained below, I would hold that Miami's injuries fall outside the FHA's zone of interests.  I would also hold that, in any event, Miami's alleged injuries are too remote to satisfy the FHA's proximate-cause requirement.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A plaintiff seeking to bring suit under a federal statute must show not only that he has standing under Article III, ante, at 5, but also that his \"complaint fall[s] within the zone of interests protected by the law\" he invokes, Lexmark Int'l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The zone-of-interests requirement is \"root[ed]\" in the \"common-law rule\" providing that a plaintiff may \"recover under the law of negligence for injuries caused by violation of a statute\" only if \"the statute 'is interpreted as designed to protect the class of persons in which the plaintiff is included, against the risk of the type of harm which has in fact occurred as a result of its violation.'\u00a0\"  Id., at ___, n.\u00a05 (slip op., at 11, n.\u00a05) (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a736, pp. 229-230 (5th ed. 1984)).  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have \"made clear\" that \"Congress is presumed to legislate against the background\" of that common-law rule.  Lexmark, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We thus apply it \"to all statutorily created causes of action .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless it is expressly negated.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  \"Whether a plaintiff comes within the zone of interests is an issue that requires us to determine, using traditional tools of statutory interpretation, whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff's claim.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in the text of the FHA suggests that Congress intended to deviate from the zone-of-interests limitation.  The statute's private-enforcement mechanism provides that only an \"aggrieved person\" may sue, \u00a73613(a)(1)(A), and the statute defines \"aggrieved person\" to mean someone who \"claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice\" or who believes he \"will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur,\" \u00a7\u00a73602(i)(1), (2).  That language does not hint--much less expressly provide--that Congress sought to depart from the common-law rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have considered similar language in other statutes and reached the same conclusion.  In Thompson v. North American Stainless, LP, 562 U.\u00a0S. 170 (2011), for example, we considered Title VII's private-enforcement provision, which provides that \"\u00a0'a person claiming to be aggrieved'\u00a0\" may file an employment discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.  Id., at 173  (quoting \u00a72000e-5(b)).  We unanimously concluded that Congress did not depart from the zone-of-interests limitation in Title VII by using that language.  Id., at 175-178.  And in Lexmark, we interpreted a provision of the Lanham Act that permitted \"any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged by a defendant's false advertising\" to sue.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even when faced with the broader \"any person\" language, we expressly rejected the argument that the statute conferred a cause of action upon anyone claiming an Article III injury in fact.  We observed that it was unlikely that \"Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover,\" and we concluded that the zone-of-interests test was the \"appropriate tool for determining who may invoke the cause of action\" under the statute.  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 11) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, some language in our older precedents suggests that the FHA's zone of interests extends to the limits of Article III.  See Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.\u00a0S. 205, 209 (1972); Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.\u00a0S. 91, 109 (1979); Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.\u00a0S. 363, 372 (1982).  But we have since described that language as \"ill-considered\" dictum leading to \"absurd consequences.\"  Thompson, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 176.  And we have observed that the \"holdings of those cases are compatible with the \"\u00a0'zone of interests' limitation\" described in Thompson.  Ibid.  That limitation provides that a plaintiff may not sue when his \"interests are so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the statute that it cannot be assumed that Congress intended to permit the suit.\"  Id., at 178 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It thus \"exclud[es] plaintiffs who might technically be injured in an Article III sense but whose interests are unrelated to the statutory prohibitions.\"  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, Miami's asserted injuries are \"so marginally related to or inconsistent with the purposes\" of the FHA that they fall outside the zone of interests.  Here, as in any other case, the text of the FHA defines the zone of interests that the statute protects.  See Lexmark, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The FHA permits \"[a]n aggrieved person\" to sue, \u00a73613(a)(1)(A), if he \"claims to have been injured by a discriminatory housing practice\" or believes that he \"will be injured by a discriminatory housing practice that is about to occur,\" \u00a7\u00a73602(i)(1), (2) (emphasis added).  Specifically, the FHA makes it unlawful to do any of the following on the basis of \"race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin\": \"refuse to sell or rent .\u00a0.\u00a0. a dwelling,\" \u00a73604(a); discriminate in the \"terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities in connection therewith,\" \u00a73604(b); \"make, print, or publish .\u00a0.\u00a0. any notice, statement, or advertisement, with respect to the sale or rental of a dwelling that indicates any preference, limitation, or discrimination,\" \u00a73604(c); \"represent to any person .\u00a0.\u00a0. that any dwelling is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling is in fact so available,\" \u00a73604(d); \"induce any person to sell or rent any dwelling by representations regarding the entry or prospective entry into the neighborhood of a person or persons of\" certain characteristics, \u00a73604(e); or discriminate in the provision of real estate or brokerage services, \u00a7\u00a73605, 3606.  The quintessential \"aggrieved person\" in cases involving violations of the FHA is a prospective home buyer or lessee discriminated against during the home-buying or leasing process.  Our cases have also suggested that the interests of a person who lives in a neighborhood or apartment complex that remains segregated (or that risks becoming segregated) as a result of a discriminatory housing practice may be arguably within the outer limit of the interests the FHA protects.  See Trafficante, supra, at 211 (concluding that one purpose of the FHA was to promote \"truly integrated and balanced living patterns\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miami's asserted injuries are not arguably related to the interests the statute protects.  Miami asserts that it received \"reduced property tax revenues,\" App. 233, 417, and that it was forced to spend more money on \"municipal services that it provided and still must provide to remedy blight and unsafe and dangerous conditions,\" id., at 417; see also ante, at 2. The city blames these expenditures on the falling property values and vacant homes that resulted from foreclosures.  But nothing in the text of the FHA suggests that Congress was concerned about decreased property values, foreclosures, and urban blight, much less about strains on municipal budgets that might follow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miami's interests are markedly distinct from the interests this Court confronted in Trafficante, Gladstone, and Havens.  In Trafficante, one white and one black tenant of an apartment complex sued on the ground that the complex discriminated against nonwhite rental applicants.  409 U.\u00a0S., at 206-208.  They argued that this discrimination deprived them of the social and economic benefits of living in an integrated community.  Id., at 208.  In Gladstone, residents in a village sued based on alleged discrimination in the home-buying process.  441 U.\u00a0S., at 93-95.  They contended that white home buyers were steered away from a racially integrated neighborhood and toward an all-white neighborhood, whereas black home buyers were steered away from the all-white neighborhood and toward the integrated neighborhood.  Id., at 95.  The plaintiffs thus alleged that they were \"denied their right to select housing without regard to race.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The village also sued, alleging that the FHA violations were affecting its \"racial composition, replacing what is presently an integrated neighborhood with a segregated one\" and that its budget was strained from resulting lost tax revenues.  Id., at 110.  Finally, in Havens, one white and one black plaintiff sued after having posed as \"testers,\" for the purpose of \"collecting evidence of unlawful steering practices.\"  455 U.\u00a0S., at 373.  According to their complaint, the owner of an apartment complex had told the white plaintiff that apartments were available, but had told the black plaintiff that apartments were not.  Id., at 368.  The Court held that the white plaintiff could not sue, because he had been provided truthful information, but that the black plaintiff could sue, because the FHA requires truthful information about housing without regard to race.  Id., at 374-375.  In all three of these cases, the plaintiffs claimed injuries based on racial steering and segregation--interests that, under this Court's precedents, at least arguably fall within the zone of interests that the FHA protects.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miami's asserted injuries implicate none of those interests.  Miami does not assert that it was injured based on efforts by the lenders to steer certain residents into one neighborhood rather than another.  Miami does not even assert that it was injured because its neighborhoods were segregated.  Miami therefore is not, as the majority describes, \"similarly situated\" to the plaintiffs in Trafficante, Gladstone, and Havens.  Ante, at 7.  Rather, Miami asserts injuries allegedly resulting from foreclosed-upon and then vacant homes.  The FHA's zone of interests is not so expansive as to include those kinds of injuries.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today reaches the opposite conclusion, resting entirely on the brief mention in Gladstone of the village's asserted injury of reduced tax revenues, and on principles of stare decisis.  See ante, at 9.  I do not think Gladstone compels the conclusion the majority reaches.  Unlike these cases, Gladstone involved injuries to interests in \"racial balance and stability,\" 441 U.\u00a0S., at 111, which, our cases have suggested, arguably fall within the zone of interests protected by the FHA, see supra, at 6.  The fact that the village plaintiff asserted a budget-related injury in addition to its racial-steering injury does not mean that a city alleging only a budget-related injury is authorized to sue.  A budget-related injury might be necessary to establish a sufficiently concrete and particularized injury for purposes of Article III, but it is not sufficient to satisfy the FHA's zone-of-interests limitation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court's reliance on Gladstone is misplaced, its opinion today is notable primarily for what it does not say.  First, the Court conspicuously does not reaffirm the broad language from Trafficante, Gladstone, and Havens suggesting that Congress intended to permit any person with Article III standing to sue under the FHA.  The Court of Appeals felt bound by that language, see 800 F.\u00a03d, at 1277; 801 F.\u00a03d, at 1266, and we granted review, despite the absence of a circuit conflict, to decide whether the language survived Thompson and Lexmark, see Brief for Petitioner in No. 15-1111, p.\u00a0i (\"By limiting suit to 'aggrieved person[s],' did Congress require that an FHA plaintiff plead more than just Article III injury-in-fact?\"); Brief for Petitioner in No. 15-1112, p.\u00a0i (\"Whether the term 'aggrieved' in the Fair Housing Act imposes a zone-of-interests requirement more stringent than the injury-in-fact requirement of Article III\").  Today's opinion avoids those questions presented and thus cannot be read as retreating from our more recent precedents on the zone-of-interests limitation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court does not reject the lenders' arguments about many other kinds of injuries that fall outside of the FHA's zone of interests.  We explained in Thompson that an expansive reading of Title VII's zone of interests would allow a shareholder \"to sue a company for firing a valuable employee for racially discriminatory reasons, so long as he could show that the value of his stock decreased as a consequence.\"  562 U.\u00a0S., at 177.  Petitioners similarly argue that, if Miami can sue for lost tax revenues under the FHA, then \"plumbers, utility companies, or any other participant in the local economy could sue the Banks to recover business they lost when people had to give up their homes and leave the neighborhood as a result of the Banks' discriminatory lending practices.\"  Ante, at 8 (citing petitioners' briefs).  The Court today decides that it \"need not discuss\" this argument because Gladstone and stare decisis compel the conclusion that Miami can sue.  Ante, at 8.  That conclusion is wrong, but at least it is narrow.  Accordingly, it should not be read to authorize suits by local businesses alleging the same injuries that Miami alleges here.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although I disagree with its zone-of-interests holding, I agree with the Court's conclusions about proximate cause, as far as they go.  The Court correctly holds that \"foreseeability alone is not sufficient to establish proximate cause under the FHA.\"  Ante, at 10.  Instead, the statute requires \"\u00a0'some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 11 (quoting Holmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corporation, 503 U.\u00a0S. 258, 268 (1992)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After articulating this test for proximate cause, the Court remands to the Court of Appeals because it \"decline[s]\" to \"draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause under the FHA\" or to \"determine on which side of the line the City's financial injuries fall.\"  Ante, at 12.  But these cases come to the Court on a motion to dismiss, and the Court of Appeals has no advantage over us in evaluating the complaint's proximate-cause theory.  Moreover, the majority opinion leaves little doubt that neither Miami nor any similarly situated plaintiff can satisfy the rigorous standard for proximate cause that the Court adopts and leaves to the Court of Appeals to apply.  See ante, at 11 (\"The general tendency in these cases, in regard to damages at least, is not to go beyond the first step\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Miami's own account of causation shows that the link between the alleged FHA violation and its asserted injuries is exceedingly attenuated.  According to Miami, the lenders' injurious conduct was \"target[ing] black and Latino customers in Miami for predatory loans.\"  Brief for Respondent in No. 15-1111, p. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And according to Miami, the injuries asserted are its \"loss of tax revenues\" and its expenditure of \"additional monies on municipal services to address\" the consequences of urban blight.  Id., at 6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Miami describes it, the chain of causation between the injurious conduct and its asserted injuries proceeds as follows: As a result of the lenders' discriminatory loan practices, borrowers from predominantly minority neighborhoods were likely to default on their home loans, leading to foreclosures.  Id., at 5-6.  The foreclosures led to vacant houses.  Id., at 6.  The vacant houses, in turn, led to decreased property values for the surrounding homes.  Ibid.  Finally, those decreased property values resulted in homeowners paying lower property taxes to the city government.  Ibid.  Also, Miami explains, the foreclosed-upon, vacant homes eventually led to \"vagrancy, criminal activity, and threats to public health and safety,\" which the city had to address through the expenditures of municipal resources.  Ibid.  And all this occurred, according to Miami, between 2004 and 2012.  See ibid.  The Court of Appeals will not need to look far to discern other, independent events that might well have caused the injuries Miami alleges in these cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of this attenuated chain of causation, Miami's asserted injuries are too remote from the injurious conduct it has alleged.  See Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. Carpenters, 459 U.\u00a0S. 519, 532, n.\u00a025 (1983).  Indeed, any other conclusion would lead to disquieting consequences.  Under Miami's own theory of causation, its injuries are one step further removed from the allegedly discriminatory lending practices than the injuries suffered by the neighboring homeowners whose houses declined in value.  No one suggests that those homeowners could sue under the FHA, and I think it is clear that they cannot.  Accordingly, I would hold that Miami has failed to sufficiently plead proximate cause under the FHA.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the Court of Appeals.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1Together with No. 15-1112, Wells Fargo & Co. et\u00a0al. v.

UNITED STATES(2017)\nNo. 15-8544\nArgued: November 28, 2016Decided: March 6, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Beckles was convicted of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, 18 U.\u00a0S. C. \u00a7922(g)(1).  His presentence investigation report concluded that he was eligible for a sentencing enhancement as a \"career offender\" under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a74B1.1(a) because his offense qualified as a \"crime of violence\" under \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause.  The District Court sentenced petitioner as a career offender, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  Petitioner then filed a postconviction motion to vacate his sentence, arguing that his offense was not a \"crime of violence.\"  The District Court denied the motion, and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  Petitioner next filed a petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court.  While his petition was pending, this Court held that the identically worded residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), \u00a7924(e)(2)(b), was unconstitutionally vague, Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___.  The Court vacated and remanded petitioner's case in light of Johnson.  On remand, the Eleventh Circuit affirmed again, distinguishing the ACCA's unconstitutionally vague residual clause from the residual clause in the Sentencing Guidelines. \nHeld:\u00a0The Federal Sentencing Guidelines, including \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause, are not subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause.  Pp. 4-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Due Process Clause prohibits the Government from \"taking away someone's life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\"  Johnson, supra, at ___-___.  Under the void-for-vagueness doctrine, laws that fix the permissible sentences for criminal offenses must specify the range of available sentences with \"sufficient clarity.\"  United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.\u00a0S. 114, 123.  In Johnson, this Court held that the ACCA's residual clause fixed--in an impermissibly vague way--a higher range of sentences for certain defendants.  But the advisory Guidelines do not fix the permissible range of sentences.  They merely guide the exercise of a court's discretion in choosing an appropriate sentence within the statutory range.  Pp. 4-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0The limited scope of the void-for-vagueness doctrine in this context is rooted in the history of federal sentencing.  Congress has long permitted district courts \"wide discretion to decide whether the offender should be incarcerated and for how long.\"  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.\u00a0S. 361, 363.  Yet this Court has \"never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range,\" United States v. Booker, 543 U.\u00a0S. 220, 233, nor suggested that a defendant can successfully challenge as vague a sentencing statute conferring discretion to select an appropriate sentence from within a statutory range, even when that discretion is unfettered, see Batchelder, supra, at 123, 126.  Pp. 6-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 departed from this regime by establishing several factors to guide district courts in exercising their sentencing discretion.  It also created the United States Sentencing Commission and charged it with establishing the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  Because the Guidelines have been rendered \"effectively advisory\" by this Court, Booker, supra, at 245, they guide district courts in exercising their discretion, but do not constrain that discretion.  Accordingly, they are not amenable to vagueness challenges: If a system of unfettered discretion is not unconstitutionally vague, then it is difficult to see how the present system of guided discretion could be.  Neither do they implicate the twin concerns underlying vagueness doctrine--providing notice and preventing arbitrary enforcement.  The applicable statutory range, which establishes the permissible bounds of the court's sentencing discretion, provides all the notice that is required.  Similarly, the Guidelines do not invite arbitrary enforcement within the meaning of this Court's case law, because they do not permit the sentencing court to prohibit behavior or to prescribe the sentencing ranges available.  Rather, they advise sentencing courts how to exercise their discretion within the bounds established by Congress.  Pp. 7-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The holding in this case does not render the advisory Guidelines immune from constitutional scrutiny, see, e.g., Peugh v. United States, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, or render \"sentencing procedure[s]\" entirely \"immune from scrutiny under the due process clause,\" Williams v. New York, 337 U.\u00a0S. 241, 252, n.\u00a018.  This Court holds only that the Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to a challenge under the void-for-vagueness doctrine.  Pp. 10-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Nor does this holding cast doubt on the validity of the other factors that sentencing courts must consider in exercising their sentencing discretion.  See \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1)-(3), (5)-(7).  A contrary holding, however, would cast serious doubt on those other factors because many of them appear at least as unclear as \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause.  This Court rejects the Government's argument that the individualized sentencing required by those other factors is distinguishable from that required by the Guidelines.  It is far from obvious that \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause implicates the twin concerns of vagueness more than the other factors do, and neither the Guidelines nor the other factors implicate those concerns more than the absence of any guidance at all, which the Government concedes is constitutional.

UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[March 6, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the time of petitioner's sentencing, the advisory Sentencing Guidelines included a residual clause defining a \"crime of violence\" as an offense that \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a74B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2006) (USSG).  This Court held in Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), that the identically worded residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 (ACCA), 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B), was unconstitutionally vague.  Petitioner contends that the Guidelines' residual clause is also void for vagueness.  Because we hold that the advisory Guidelines are not subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause, we reject petitioner's argument.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Travis Beckles was convicted in 2007 of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, \u00a7922(g)(1).  According to the presentence investigation report, the firearm was a sawed-off shotgun, and petitioner was therefore eligible for a sentencing enhancement as a \"career offender\" under the Sentencing Guidelines.  The 2006 version of the Guidelines, which were in effect when petitioner was sentenced,1 provided that \"[a] defendant is a career offender if\n\"(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\"  USSG \u00a74B1.1(a).\nThe Guidelines defined \"crime of violence\" as\n\"any offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year that--\n\"(1)\u2002has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or\n\"(2)\u2002is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\"  \u00a74B1.2(a) (emphasis added).\nThe clause beginning with \"or otherwise\" in this definition is known as the residual clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The commentary to the career-offender Guideline provided that possession of a sawed-off shotgun was a crime of violence.  See \u00a74B1.2, comment., n.\u00a01 (\"Unlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75845(a) (e.g., a sawed-off shotgun .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0) is a 'crime of violence'\u00a0\"); \u00a75845(a) (\"The term 'firearm' means (1) a shotgun having a barrel or barrels of less than 18 inches in length\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court agreed that petitioner qualified as a career offender under the Guidelines.  Petitioner was over 18 years of age at the time of his offense, and his criminal history included multiple prior felony convictions for controlled substance offenses.  Furthermore, in the District Court's view, petitioner's \u00a7922(g)(1) conviction qualified as a \"crime of violence.\"  Because he qualified as a career offender, petitioner's Guidelines range was 360 months to life imprisonment.  The District Court sentenced petitioner to 360 months.  The Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence, and this Court denied certiorari.  United States v. Beckles, 565 F.\u00a03d 832, 846 (CA11), cert denied, 558 U.\u00a0S. 906 (2009).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In September 2010, petitioner filed a motion to vacate his sentence under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72255, arguing that his conviction for unlawful possession of a firearm was not a \"crime of violence,\" and therefore that he did not qualify as a career offender under the Guidelines.  The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner then filed a second petition for certiorari in this Court.  While his petition was pending, the Court decided Johnson, holding that \"imposing an increased sentence under the residual clause of the [ACCA]\"--which contained the same language as the Guidelines' residual clause--\"violate[d] the Constitution's guarantee of due process\" because the clause was unconstitutionally vague.  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  We subsequently granted his petition, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded for further consideration in light of Johnson.  Beckles v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, petitioner argued that his enhanced sentence was based on \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause, which he contended was unconstitutionally vague under Johnson.  The Court of Appeals again affirmed.  It noted that petitioner \"was sentenced as a career offender based not on the ACCA's residual clause, but based on express language in the Sentencing Guidelines classifying [his] offense as a 'crime of violence.'\u00a0\" 616 Fed. Appx. 415, 416 (2015) (\u00a0per curiam).  \"Johnson,\" the Court of Appeals reasoned, \"says and decided nothing about career-offender enhancements under the Sentencing Guidelines or about the Guidelines commentary underlying [petitioner]'s status as a career-offender.\"  Ibid.  The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner filed another petition for certiorari in this Court, again contending that \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause is void for vagueness.  To resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether Johnson's vagueness holding applies to the residual clause in \u00a74B1.2(a) of the Guidelines,2 we granted certiorari.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  Because the United States, as respondent, agrees with petitioner that the Guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges, the Court appointed Adam K. Mortara as amicus curiae to argue the contrary position.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  He has ably discharged his responsibilities.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has held that the Due Process Clause prohibits the Government from \"taking away someone's life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\"  Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 3-4) (citing Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.\u00a0S. 352, 357-358 (1983)).  Applying this standard, the Court has invalidated two kinds of criminal laws as \"void for vagueness\": laws that define criminal offenses and laws that fix the permissible sentences for criminal offenses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the former, the Court has explained that \"the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\"  Id., at 357.  For the latter, the Court has explained that \"statutes fixing sentences,\" Johnson, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4) (citing United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.\u00a0S. 114, 123 (1979)), must specify the range of available sentences with \"sufficient clarity,\" id., at 123; see also United States v. Evans, 333 U.\u00a0S. 483 (1948); cf. Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.\u00a0S. 399 (1966).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Johnson, we applied the vagueness rule to a statute fixing permissible sentences.  The ACCA's residual clause, where applicable, required sentencing courts to increase a defendant's prison term from a statutory maximum of 10 years to a minimum of 15 years.  That requirement thus fixed--in an impermissibly vague way--a higher range of sentences for certain defendants.  See Alleyne v. United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (describing the legally prescribed range of available sentences as the penalty fixed to a crime).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the ACCA, however, the advisory Guidelines do not fix the permissible range of sentences.  To the contrary, they merely guide the exercise of a court's discretion in choosing an appropriate sentence within the statutory range.  Accordingly, the Guidelines are not subject to a vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause.  The residual clause in \u00a74B1.2(a)(2) therefore is not void for vagueness.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limited scope of the void-for-vagueness doctrine in this context is rooted in the history of federal sentencing.  Instead of enacting specific sentences for particular federal crimes, Congress historically permitted district courts \"wide discretion to decide whether the offender should be incarcerated and for how long.\"  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.\u00a0S. 361, 363 (1989).  For most crimes, Congress set forth a range of sentences, and sentencing courts had \"almost unfettered discretion\" to select the actual length of a defendant's sentence \"within the customarily wide range\" Congress had enacted.  Id., at 364; see also, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.\u00a0S. 466, 481-482 (2000); Williams v. New York, 337 U.\u00a0S. 241, 247-248 (1949).  That discretion allowed district courts to craft individualized sentences, taking into account the facts of the crime and the history of the defendant.  As a result, \"[s]erious disparities in sentences .\u00a0.\u00a0. were common.\"  Mistretta, supra, at 365.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet in the long history of discretionary sentencing, this Court has \"never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range.\"  United States v. Booker, 543 U.\u00a0S. 220, 233 (2005); see also, e.g., Apprendi, supra, at 481 (\"[N]othing in this history suggests that it is impermissible for judges to exercise discretion .\u00a0.\u00a0. in imposing a judgment within the range prescribed by statute\"); Giaccio, supra, at 405, n.\u00a08 (\"[W]e intend to cast no doubt whatever on the constitutionality of the settled practice of many States to leave to juries finding defendants guilty of a crime the power to fix punishment within legally prescribed limits\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More specifically, our cases have never suggested that a defendant can successfully challenge as vague a sentencing statute conferring discretion to select an appropriate sentence from within a statutory range, even when that discretion is unfettered.  In fact, our reasoning in Batchelder suggests the opposite.  This Court considered in that case the constitutionality of two overlapping criminal provisions that authorized different maximum penalties for the same conduct.  442 U.\u00a0S., at 115-116.  The Court held that the sentencing provisions were not void for vagueness because they specified the \"penalties available\" and defined the \"punishment authorized\" upon conviction for each crime.  Id., at 123.  \"Although the statutes create[d] uncertainty as to which crime may be charged and therefore what penalties may be imposed, they d[id] so to no greater extent than would a single statute authorizing various alternative punishments.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  By specifying \"the range of penalties that prosecutors and judges may seek and impose,\" Congress had \"fulfilled its duty.\"  Id., at 126 (citing Evans, supra, at 483; emphasis added).  Indeed, no party to this case suggests that a system of purely discretionary sentencing could be subject to a vagueness challenge.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 departed from this regime by establishing several factors to guide district courts in exercising their traditional sentencing discretion.  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553.  Congress in the same Act created the United States Sentencing Commission and charged it with establishing guidelines to be used for sentencing.  Mis- tretta, supra, at 367.  The result of the Commission's work is the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, which are one of the sentencing factors that the Act requires courts to consider.  \u00a73553(a)(4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guidelines were initially binding on district courts, Booker, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 233, but this Court in Booker rendered them \"effectively advisory,\" id., at 245.  Although the Guidelines remain \"the starting point and the initial benchmark\" for sentencing, a sentencing court may no longer rely exclusively on the Guidelines range; rather, the court \"must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented\" and the other statutory factors.  Gall v. United States, 552 U.\u00a0S. 38, 49, 50 (2007).  The Guidelines thus continue to guide district courts in exercising their discretion by serving as \"the framework for sentencing,\" Peugh v. United States, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 11), but they \"do not constrain th[at] discretion,\" id., at ___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op.,  at 2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because they merely guide the district courts' discretion, the Guidelines are not amenable to a vagueness challenge.  As discussed above, the system of purely discretionary sentencing that predated the Guidelines was constitutionally permissible.  If a system of unfettered discretion is not unconstitutionally vague, then it is difficult to see how the present system of guided discretion could be.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The advisory Guidelines also do not implicate the twin concerns underlying vagueness doctrine--providing notice and preventing arbitrary enforcement.  As to notice, even perfectly clear Guidelines could not provide notice to a person who seeks to regulate his conduct so as to avoid particular penalties within the statutory range.  See, e.g., Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.\u00a0S. 104, 108 (1972).  That is because even if a person behaves so as to avoid an enhanced sentence under the career-offender guideline, the sentencing court retains discretion to impose the enhanced sentence.  See, e.g., Pepper v. United States, 562 U.\u00a0S. 476, 501 (2011) (\"[O]ur post-Booker decisions make clear that a district court may in appropriate cases impose a non-Guidelines sentence based on a disagreement with the Commission's views\").  As we held in Irizarry v. United States, 555 U.\u00a0S. 708 (2008), \"[t]he due process concerns that .\u00a0.\u00a0. require notice in a world of mandatory Guidelines no longer\" apply.  Id., at 714; see id., at 713 (\"Any expectation subject to due process protection .\u00a0.\u00a0. that a criminal defendant would receive a sentence within the presumptively applicable Guidelines range did not survive our decision in [Booker], which invalidated the mandatory features of the Guidelines\").  All of the notice required is provided by the applicable statutory range, which establishes the permissible bounds of the court's sentencing discretion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The advisory Guidelines also do not implicate the vagueness doctrine's concern with arbitrary enforcement.  Laws that \"regulate persons or entities,\" we have explained, must be sufficiently clear \"that those enforcing the law do not act in an arbitrary or discriminatory way.\"  FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.\u00a0S. 239, 253 (2012); see also Grayned, supra, at 108-109 (\"A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters\" to judges \"for resolution on an ad\u00a0hoc and subjective basis\").  An unconstitutionally vague law invites arbitrary enforcement in this sense if it \"leaves judges and jurors free to decide, without any legally fixed standards, what is prohibited and what is not in each particular case,\" Giaccio, 382 U.\u00a0S., at 402-403, or permits them to prescribe the sentences or sentencing range available, cf. Alleyne, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (\"[T]he legally prescribed range is the penalty affixed to the crime\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guidelines, however, do not regulate the public by prohibiting any conduct or by \"establishing minimum and maximum penalties for [any] crime.\"  Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 396 (Sentencing Guidelines \"do not bind or regulate the primary conduct of the public\").  Rather, the Guidelines advise sentencing courts how to exercise their discretion within the bounds established by Congress.  In this case, for example, the District Court did not \"enforce\" the career-offender Guideline against petitioner.  It enforced 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1)'s prohibition on possession of a firearm by a felon--which prohibited petitioner's conduct--and \u00a7924(e)(1)'s mandate of a sentence of 15 years to life imprisonment--which fixed the permissible range of petitioner's sentence.  The court relied on the career-offender Guideline merely for advice in exercising its discretion to choose a sentence within those statutory limits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor's concurrence suggests that judges interpreting a vague sentencing Guideline might rely on \"statistical analysis,\" \"gut instinct,\" or the judge's \"own feelings\" to decide whether a defendant's conviction is a crime of violence.  Post, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A judge granted unfettered discretion could use those same approaches  in determining a defendant's sentence.  Indeed, the concurrence notes that federal judges before the Guidelines considered their own \"view[s] of proper sentencing policy,\" among other considerations.  Post, at 11.  Yet we have never suggested that unfettered discretion can be void for vagueness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, we hold that the advisory Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to a vagueness challenge under the Due Process Clause and that \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause is not void for vagueness.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our holding today does not render the advisory Guidelines immune from constitutional scrutiny.  This Court held in Peugh, for example, that a \"retrospective increase in the Guidelines range applicable to a defendant\" violates the Ex Post Facto Clause.  569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  But the void-for-vagueness and ex post facto inquiries are \"analytically distinct.\"  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 19) (distinguishing an ex post facto inquiry from a Sixth Amendment inquiry).  Our ex post facto cases \"have focused on whether a change in law creates a 'significant risk' of a higher sentence.\"  Ibid.  A retroactive change in the Guidelines creates such a risk because \"sentencing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines,\" which establish \"the framework for sentencing.\"  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 10, 11).  In contrast, the void-for-vagueness doctrine requires a different inquiry.  The question is whether a law regulating private conduct by fixing permissible sentences provides notice and avoids arbitrary enforcement by clearly specifying the range of penalties available.  The Government's rebuttal that both doctrines are concerned with \"\u00a0'fundamental justice,'\u00a0\" Reply Brief for United States 7, ignores the contours of our precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has also recognized \"in the Eighth Amendment context\" that a district court's reliance on a vague sentencing factor in a capital case, even indirectly, \"can taint the sentence.\"  Brief for United States 43 (citing Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U.\u00a0S. 1079, 1082 (1992) (\u00a0per curiam); emphasis added).  But our approach to vagueness under the Due Process Clause is not interchangeable with \"the rationale of our cases construing and applying the Eighth Amendment.\"  Maynard v. Cartwright, 486 U.\u00a0S. 356, 361 (1988).  Our decision in Espinosa is thus inapposite, as it did not involve advisory Sentencing Guidelines or the Due Process Clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, our holding today also does not render \"sentencing procedure[s]\" entirely \"immune from scrutiny under the due process clause.\"  Williams, 337 U.\u00a0S., at 252, n.\u00a018; see, e.g., Townsend v. Burke, 334 U.\u00a0S. 736, 741 (1948) (holding that due process is violated when a court relies on \"extensively and materially false\" evidence to impose a sentence on an uncounseled defendant).  We hold only that the advisory Sentencing Guidelines, including \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause, are not subject to a challenge under the void-for-vagueness doctrine.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to directing sentencing courts to consider the Guidelines, see \u00a73553(a)(4)(A), Congress has directed them to consider a number of other factors in exercising their sentencing discretion, see \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1)-(3), (5)-(7).  The Government concedes that \"American judges have long made th[e] sorts of judgments\" called for by the \u00a73553(a) factors \"in indeterminate-sentencing schemes, and this Court has never understood such discretionary determinations to raise vagueness concerns.\"  Brief for United States 42.  Because the \u00a73553 factors--like the Guidelines--do not mandate any specific sentences, but rather guide the exercise of a district court's discretion within the applicable statutory range, our holding today casts no doubt on their validity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Holding that the Guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause, however, would cast serious doubt on their validity.  Many of these other factors appear at least as unclear as \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause.  For example, courts must assess \"the need for the sentence imposed\" to achieve certain goals--such as to \"reflect the seriousness of the offense,\" \"promote respect for the law,\" \"provide just punishment for the offense,\" \"afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct,\" and \"provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the most effective manner.\"  \u00a73553(a)(2).  If petitioner were correct that \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause were subject to a vagueness challenge, we would be hard pressed to find these factors sufficiently definite to provide adequate notice and prevent arbitrary enforcement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government tries to have it both ways, arguing that the individualized sentencing required by the other \u00a73553(a) factors is different in kind from that required by the Guidelines.  \"An inscrutably vague advisory guideline,\" it contends, \"injects arbitrariness into the sentencing process that is not found in the exercise of unguided discretion in a traditional sentencing system.\"  Reply Brief for United States 10-11.  But it is far from obvious that the residual clause implicates the twin concerns of vagueness any more than the statutory command that sentencing courts impose a sentence tailored, for example, \"to promote respect for the law.\"  \u00a73553(a)(2)(A).  And neither the Guidelines nor the other \u00a73553 factors implicate those concerns more than the absence of any guidance at all, which the Government concedes is constitutional.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government also suggests that the Guidelines are not like the other \u00a73553(a) factors \"because they require a court to decide whether the facts of the case satisfy a legal standard in order to derive a specific numerical range.\"  Id., at 22.  But that does not distinguish the other sentencing factors, which require courts to do the same thing.  Section 3553(a) states that district courts \"shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a73553(a)(2)].\"  In fact, the Guidelines generally offer more concrete advice in imposing a particular sentence and make it easier to review whether a court has abused its substantial discretion.  There is no sound reason to conclude that the Guidelines--but not \u00a73553(a)'s other sentencing factors--are amenable to vagueness review.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the advisory Sentencing Guidelines are not subject to a due process vagueness challenge, \u00a74B1.2(a)'s residual clause is not void for vagueness.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nKennedy, J., concurring\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-8544\nTRAVIS BECKLES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[March 6, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As sentencing laws and standards continue to evolve, cases may arise in which the formulation of a sentencing provision leads to a sentence, or a pattern of sentencing, challenged as so arbitrary that it implicates constitutional concerns.  In that instance, a litigant might use the word vague in a general sense--that is to say, imprecise or unclear--in trying to establish that the sentencing decision was flawed.  That something is vague as a general matter, however, does not necessarily mean that it is vague within the well-established legal meaning of that term.  And it seems most unlikely that the definitional structure used to explain vagueness in the context of fair warning to a transgressor, or of preventing arbitrary enforcement, is, by automatic transference, applicable to the subject of sentencing where judicial discretion is involved as distinct from a statutory command.  See Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The existing principles for defining vagueness cannot be transported uncritically to the realm of judicial discretion in sentencing.  Some other explication of the constitutional limitations likely would be required.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These considerations inform my reading of the Court's opinion, in which I join.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-8544\nTRAVIS BECKLES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[March 6, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case has a simple solution.  When Travis Beckles was convicted in 2007 of violating 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1), the official commentary to the career-offender Sentencing Guideline expressly designated his offense of conviction--possessing a sawed-off shotgun as a felon--a \"crime of violence.\"  See ante, at 1-3; United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \u00a74B1.2(a), comment., n.\u00a01 (Nov. 2006).  Harmonious with federal law and the text of \u00a74B1.2(a), that commentary was \"authoritative.\"  Stinson v. United States, 508 U.\u00a0S. 36, 38 (1993).*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beckles therefore cannot, and indeed does not, claim that \u00a74B1.2(a) was vague as applied to him.  And because his conduct was \"clearly proscribed,\" he also \"cannot complain of the vagueness of the [guideline] as applied to the conduct of others.\"  Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.\u00a0S. 1, 18-19 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted) (rejecting vagueness challenge to terrorism material-support statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72339B).  I would accordingly defer any more encompassing ruling until a case we have agreed to take up requires one.\n\nSotomayor, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-8544\nTRAVIS BECKLES, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[March 6, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg explains why the Court's holding today is unnecessary.  See ante, at 1-2 (opinion concurring in judgment).  Petitioner Travis Beckles was sentenced to 30 years in prison on the basis of commentary promulgated by the U. S. Sentencing Commission interpreting a sentencing provision identical to the \"residual clause\" we held unconstitutionally vague two years ago in Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).  But Johnson affords Beckles no relief, because the commentary under which he was sentenced was not unconstitutionally vague.  Had the majority limited itself to this conclusion, I would have joined its opinion.  Instead, the majority reaches far beyond what is necessary to resolve this case and announces that the U.\u00a0S. Sentencing Guidelines as a whole are immune from vagueness challenges.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write separately to explain why that holding is not only unnecessary, but also deeply unsound.  The Guidelines anchor every sentence imposed in federal district courts.  They are, \"\u00a0'in a real sense[,] the basis for the sentence.'\u00a0\"  Molina-Martinez v. United States, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9) (quoting Peugh v. United States, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 11); emphasis deleted).  The Due Process Clause requires that rules this weighty be drafted \"with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand\" them, and \"in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\"  Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.\u00a0S. 352, 357 (1983).  Because I cannot agree with the majority's conclusion to the contrary, I respectfully concur in the judgment only.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Due Process Clause prohibits the Government from \"taking away someone's life, liberty, or property under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\"  Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  The prohibition against vagueness in criminal proceedings is \"a well-recognized requirement, consonant alike with ordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law.\"  Connally v. General Constr. Co., 269 U.\u00a0S. 385, 391 (1926).  The doctrine rests on two justifications.  First, it ensures that people receive \"fair notice of what is prohibited.\"  United States v. Williams, 553 U.\u00a0S. 285, 304 (2008).  Second, it safeguards the integrity of the judicial system by ensuring that criminal adjudications are not conducted in an arbitrary manner and that terms of imprisonment are not imposed \"on an ad\u00a0hoc and subjective basis.\"  Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.\u00a0S. 104, 109 (1972).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"These principles apply not only to statutes defining elements of crimes, but also to statutes fixing sentences.\"  Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Just two Terms ago, we struck down a sentencing law--the Armed Career Criminal Act's (ACCA) residual clause, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(e)(2)(B)--as unconstitutionally vague.  See 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  We spent little time on whether the vagueness doctrine applied to such provisions.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  And for good reason: A statute fixing a sentence imposes no less a deprivation of liberty than does a statute defining a crime, as our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence makes plain.  See Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.\u00a0S. 466, 490 (2000).  We instead analyzed the residual clause in light of \"[n]ine years' experience trying to derive meaning from\" it, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10), and declared the experiment a failure.  \"Invoking so shapeless a provision to condemn someone to prison for 15 years to life,\" we held, \"does not comport with the Constitution's guarantee of due process.\"  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question before us is how these principles apply to the U. S. Sentencing Guidelines.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress established the U. S. Sentencing Commission in 1984 in order to address \"[f]undamental and widespread dissatisfaction\" with the then-prevailing regime of discretionary sentencing.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.\u00a0S. 361, 365-366 (1989); see Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, \u00a7217(a), 98 Stat. 2017.  It charged the Commission with reducing \"the great variation among sentences imposed by different judges upon similarly situated offenders\" and the resulting \"uncertainty as to the time [each] offender would spend in prison.\"  Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 366.  The Sentencing Guidelines are the product of that mandate.  The Guidelines establish a framework \"under which a set of inputs specific to a given case (the particular characteristics of the offense and offender) yiel[d] a predetermined output (a range of months within which the defendant [can] be sentenced).\"  Peugh, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  In doing so, the Guidelines ensure \"uniformity in sentencing .\u00a0.\u00a0. imposed by different federal courts for similar criminal conduct\" and \"proportionality in sentencing through a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of different severity.\"  Rita v. United States, 551 U.\u00a0S. 338, 349 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Guidelines today play a central role in federal sentencing.  Although no longer binding on federal courts, see United States v. Booker, 543 U.\u00a0S. 220, 245 (2005), the Guidelines nonetheless \"provide the framework for the tens of thousands of federal sentencing proceedings that occur each year,\" Molina-Martinez, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  A district court must \"begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range.\"  Gall v. United States, 552 U.\u00a0S. 38, 49-50 (2007).  The court must entertain the parties' arguments and consider the factors set forth in 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a) as possible grounds for deviation from the Guidelines range, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 49-50, and \"may not presume the .\u00a0.\u00a0. range is reasonable,\" id., at 50.  But it must explain any deviation from the range on the record, and it must \"ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\"  Ibid.; see Peugh, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 17-18).  A district court that incorrectly calculates the Guidelines range commits reversible procedural error, see Gall, 552 U.\u00a0S., at 51; a district court that imposes a sentence within the correct Guidelines range, by contrast, may be afforded a presumption that the sentence it has imposed is reasonable, see Rita, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 347.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importance of the Guidelines in this process, as we explained last Term, makes them \"not only the starting point for most federal sentencing proceedings but also the lodestar.\"  Molina-Martinez, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  In most cases, it is the range set by the Guidelines, not the minimum or maximum term of imprisonment set by statute, that specifies the number of years a defendant will spend in prison.  District courts impose a sentence within the Guidelines (or below the Guidelines based on a Government motion) over 80% of the time.  Ibid.; see 2015 Annual Report and 2015 Sourcebook of Federal Sentencing Statistics (20th ed.) (Figure G), online at http:\/\/ www.ussc.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/pdf\/research-and-publications\/ annual-reports-and-sourcebooks\/2015\/FigureG.pdf (as last visited Feb. 27, 2017).  And when Guidelines ranges change--because the Guidelines themselves change, or because the court is informed of an error it made in applying them--sentences change, too.1  See Molina-Martinez, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); Peugh, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  It is therefore no exaggeration to say that the Guidelines are, \"\u00a0'in a real sense[,] the basis for the sentence'\u00a0\" imposed by the district court.  Molina-Martinez, 578 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting Peugh, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); emphasis deleted).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It follows from the central role that the Guidelines play at sentencing that they should be susceptible to vagueness challenges under the Due Process Clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to the majority's conclusion, an inscrutably vague Guideline implicates both of the concerns animating the prohibition on vagueness.  First, a district court's reliance on such a Guideline deprives an ordinary person of \"fair notice\" of the consequences of his actions.  See Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  A defendant is entitled to understand the legal rules that will determine his sentence.  But a vague Guideline is by definition impossible to understand.  Take the career-offender Guideline at issue here.  We explained in Johnson that the identically worded provision in the ACCA created \"pervasive disagreement\" among courts imposing sentences as to \"the nature of the inquiry\" that they were required to conduct.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  The result was a law that was \"\u00a0'nearly impossible to apply consistently.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting Chambers v. United States, 555 U.\u00a0S. 122, 133 (2009) (Alito, J., concurring in judgment)).  An ordinary person cannot be expected to understand the consequences that such a shapeless provision will have on his sentence.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, and more importantly, a district court's reliance on a vague Guideline creates a serious risk of \"arbitrary enforcement.\"  See Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  As set out above, although the Guidelines do not bind a district court as a formal matter, as a functional matter they \"anchor both the district court's discretion and the appellate review process.\"  Peugh, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).  It introduces an unacceptable degree of arbitrariness into sentencing proceedings to begin by applying a rule that is so vague that efforts to interpret it boil down to \"guesswork and intuition.\"  Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  One judge may conduct a statistical analysis to decide that a defendant's crime of conviction is not a crime of violence.  Another may rely on gut instinct to conclude that it is.  Still a third may \"throw [our] opinions into the air in frustration, and give free rein to [her] own feelings\" in making the decision.  Derby v. United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. 1047, 1049 (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari).  Importantly, that decision is the end of the ballgame for a criminal defendant.  Although he may ask the judge to vary downward from the Guidelines range, he must take the range as the starting point for his request.  He may ask for a month here or a month there, but he is negotiating from a baseline he cannot control or predict.  The result is a sentencing proceeding hopelessly skewed from the outset by \"unpredictability and arbitrariness.\"  Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  The Due Process Clause does not tolerate such a proceeding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider, by way of example, a hypothetical version of Beckles' own sentencing proceeding in which the commentary played no clarifying role.  Beckles was convicted of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7922(g)(1), and sentenced to 360 months in prison.  That sentence sat at the bottom end of the applicable Guidelines range, factoring in the career-offender Guideline: 360 months to life.  But had the career-offender Guideline not applied to Beckles, the Guidelines range calculated by the District Court would have been significantly lower: 262 to 327 months.  See Beckles v. United States, Civ. No. 10-23517 (SD Fla., Mar. 4, 2013), App. 129-130.  Absent that Guideline, Beckles would have been sentenced to between 33 and 98 fewer months in prison.  The District Court admitted as much, explaining that had the Guideline not applied, she \"would not have imprisoned Beckles to 360 months\" in prison.  Id., at 149 (emphasis deleted).  Years of Beckles' life thus turned solely on whether the career-offender Guideline applied.  There is no meaningful way in which the Guideline exerted less effect on Beckles' sentence than did the statute setting his minimum and maximum terms of imprisonment; indeed, it was the Guidelines, not just the statute, that \"fix[ed]\" Beckles' \"sentenc[e]\" in every meaningful way.  Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Nothing of substance, in other words, distinguishes the Guidelines from the kind of laws we held susceptible to vagueness challenges in Johnson; both law and Guideline alike operate to extend the time a person spends in prison.  The Due Process Clause should apply equally to each.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority brushes past this logic in its decision to shield the Guidelines from vagueness challenges.  In doing so, it casts our sentencing jurisprudence into doubt and upends the law of nearly every Court of Appeals to have considered this question.3  None of its explanations justify its novel and sweeping conclusion.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority first reasons that the Guidelines are not susceptible to vagueness challenges because they \"do not fix the permissible range of sentences,\" ante, at 5, but merely \"guide district courts in exercising their discretion,\" ante, at 8.  But we have not embraced such formalism before, and the majority provides no coherent justification for its decision to do so here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, we have refused before to apply exactly the formalistic distinction that the majority now embraces.  In Espinosa v. Florida, 505 U.\u00a0S. 1079, 1081 (1992) (per curiam), we held that a state's capital aggravating factor that was drafted in a manner \"so vague as to leave the sentencer without sufficient guidance for determining the presence or absence of the factor\" violated the Eighth Amendment.  The factor was unconstitutional, we explained, notwithstanding the fact that only the jury, not the judge, was instructed on the factor; that the judge, not the jury, made the final decision to sentence the defendant to death; and that the judge, in doing so, was not required to defer to the jury's recommendation.  \"This kind of indirect weighing of an invalid aggravating factor,\" we explained, \"creates the same potential for arbitrariness as the direct weighing of an invalid aggravating factor.\"  Id., at 1082.  In doing so, we effectively rejected just the argument the majority now embraces: that advisory guidelines lack the kind of binding legal effect that subject them to constitutional scrutiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there were any doubt that advisory sentencing guidelines are subject to constitutional limits, we dispelled it in Peugh, where we held that the Guidelines are amenable to challenges under the Ex Post Facto Clause.  See 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  There, the Government argued that the \"advisory\" nature of the Guidelines rendered them immune from such claims.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  But we rejected such an argument.  \"The federal system,\" we explained, \"adopts procedural measures intended to make the Guidelines the lodestone of sentencing,\" and \"considerable empirical evidence indicate[s] that the .\u00a0.\u00a0. Guidelines have the intended effect.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 12-13).  We declined the Government's invitation to limit our ex post facto jurisprudence to rules that, as a formal matter, \"increase[d] the maximum sentence for which a defendant is eligible.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  And we explained that a rule may exert \"\u00a0'binding legal effect' through .\u00a0.\u00a0. procedural rules and standards for appellate review that, in combination, encourag[e] district courts to sentence within the guidelines.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  It was not true, we concluded, that \"the Guidelines are too much like guideposts and not enough like fences,\" ibid.; instead, the Guidelines were just fencelike enough--just lawlike enough--that they cannot be shielded from the Constitution's reach.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same principle should dictate the same result in this case.  How can the Guidelines carry sufficient legal weight to warrant scrutiny under the Eighth Amendment and the Ex Post Facto Clause, but not enough to warrant scrutiny under the Due Process Clause?  Cf. United States v. Hurlburt, 835 F. 3d 715, 724 (CA7 2016) (en banc) (\"We see no principled way to distinguish Peugh on doctrinal grounds\").  The majority offers no convincing answer.  It asserts that the Due Process Clause \"requires a different inquiry\" than these provisions do.  Ante, at 10.  But it does not explain why it views this as relevant to the constitutional status of the Guidelines.  A court considering a challenge to a criminal statute under the Ex Post Facto Clause will apply a different legal standard than will a court considering a vagueness challenge to the same statute; that does not make the statute more or less susceptible to constitutional challenge in one context than the other.  Our opinion in Peugh is particularly difficult for the majority to escape, given that the Ex Post Facto Clause, like the Due Process Clause's prohibition against vagueness, is rooted in concerns about \"fair warning\" and \"\u00a0'fundamental fairness.'\u00a0\"  569 U. S., at ___ (plurality opinion) (slip op., at 13).  The majority musters no persuasive explanation for why those concerns would have less force in this context than in that one.  That is because none exists.4\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority next posits that because courts have long sentenced defendants under purely discretionary regimes, there can be no vagueness concern with any system that, like the Guidelines regime, sets guideposts on the exercise of discretion.  Ante, at 6-7.  But this argument fundamentally misunderstands the problem caused by a court's reliance on a vague sentencing guideline.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0True enough, for many years, federal courts relied on \"a system of indeterminate sentencing\" in criminal cases.  Mistretta, 488 U.\u00a0S., at 363; see also K. Stith & J. Cabranes, Fear of Judging: Sentencing Guidelines in the Federal Courts 9-14 (1998).  Under such a scheme, a sentencing judge considers the full range of relevant aggravating and mitigating facts and circumstances, as well as his view of proper sentencing policy, and then imposes a sentence in light of those considerations.  See Koon v. United States, 518 U.\u00a0S. 81, 113 (1996) (\"It has been uniform and constant in the federal judicial tradition for the sentencing judge to consider every convicted person as an individual and every case as a unique study in the human failings that sometimes mitigate, sometimes magnify, the crime and the punishment to ensue\").  As the majority notes, no party here \"suggests that a system of purely discretionary sentencing could be subject to a vagueness challenge.\"  Ante, at 7.  The majority reasons that the Guidelines--which limit the sentencing judge's discretion from what he otherwise would have enjoyed--must therefore also be immune from vagueness attacks.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the majority misapprehends the nature of the constitutional infirmity that occurs when a sentencing judge relies on an inscrutably vague guideline.  A defendant who is sentenced under a purely discretionary regime does not face the prospect of \"arbitrary enforcement\" by the sentencing judge, Kolender, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 358; rather, he faces a fact- and context-sensitive determination informed by the exercise of reasoned judgment.  A defendant sentenced pursuant to an impossibly vague Guideline, by contrast, is put in an untenable position.  The \"lodestone\" of his sentence--the baseline against which the district court will assess his characteristics and his conduct--is set by a rule that is impossible to understand.  Such a proceeding is the antithesis of due process.  See Giaccio v. Pennsylvania, 382 U.\u00a0S. 399, 403 (1966) (\"Implicit in [due process] is the premise that the law must be one that carries an understandable meaning with legal standards that courts must enforce\").  It is not reliance on discretion that makes a sentencing regime vague; it is reliance on an impenetrable rule as a baseline for the exercise of that discretion.  Reliance on a rule of this kind, whether set out in a statute or in a Guideline, does not comport with \"\u00a0'ordinary notions of fair play.'\u00a0\"  Johnson, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority ends by speculating that permitting vagueness attacks on the Guidelines would call into question the validity of many Guidelines, and even the factors that Congress has instructed courts to consider in imposing sentences.  See ante, at 11-12.  In doing so, the majority once more resuscitates arguments we have already considered and dismissed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson confronted and rejected a version of this argument.  There, the Government contended that \"dozens of federal and state criminal laws use terms like 'substantial risk,' 'grave risk,' and 'unreasonable risk,'\u00a0\" terms that--in its view--were indistinguishable from the residual clause at issue in that case.  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  We rejected the argument, explaining that such rules \"call[ed] for the application of a qualitative standard such as 'substantial risk' to real-world conduct; 'the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends on his estimating rightly .\u00a0.\u00a0. some matter of degree.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting Nash v. United States, 229 U.\u00a0S. 373, 377 (1913)).  What rendered the ACCA's residual clause unconstitutionally vague, we explained, was not that it required \"gauging the riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages on a particular occasion,\" but that it required the application of an ambiguous standard \"to an idealized ordinary case of the crime.\"  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Holding the residual clause unconstitutionally vague, in other words, cast no doubt on the dozens of laws elsewhere in the U. S. Code requiring the application of general standards to particular conduct.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same is true here.  The sentencing factors described by the majority bear no similarity to the categorical risk analysis that the Court held unconstitutionally vague in Johnson, nor to any other statutes it has previously found vague.  Congress' instruction to district courts to consider, for instance, \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" \u00a73553(a)(1), bears little resemblance to statutes requiring subjective determinations as to whether conduct is \"annoying\" or \"unjust.\"  See Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U.\u00a0S. 611, 615-616 (1971); United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., 255 U.\u00a0S. 81, 89 (1921).5  And to the extent that the majority's concern is that subjecting sentencing factors to the Due Process Clause's prohibition on vagueness would risk the demise of discretionary sentencing regimes, that prospect is unlikely, for the reasons I have already explained.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It violates the Due Process Clause \"to condemn someone to prison\" on the basis of a sentencing rule \"so shapeless\" as to resist interpretation.  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  But the Court's decision today permits exactly that result.  With respect, I concur only in the judgment.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0With one exception not relevant here, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a)(4)(A) instructs sentencing courts to consider the Guidelines ranges that \"are in effect on the date the defendant is sentenced.\"  Accordingly, references in this opinion to the Guidelines are to the 2006 version.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Compare United States v. Matchett, 802 F.\u00a03d 1185, 1193-1196 (CA11 2015) (holding that the Guidelines are not subject to due process vagueness challenges), with, e.g., United States v. Townsend, 638 Fed. Appx. 172, 178, n.\u00a014 (CA3 2015) (declining to follow Matchett); United States v.

But excising the problematic provision first and considering illustrative language second \"flip[s] the normal order of operations in adjudicating vagueness challenges.\"  Brief for United States 55.  This Court has routinely rejected, in a variety of contexts, vagueness claims where a clarifying construction rendered an otherwise enigmatic provision clear as applied to the challenger.  See Bell v. Cone, 543 U.\u00a0S. 447, 453, 457-458 (2005) (per curiam) (capital aggravating factor clarified by state-court precedent); Hoffman Estates v.

FCC, 395 U.\u00a0S. 367, 395 (1969) (federal regulation clarified by agency adjudications).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The evidence before us suggests that the same is true of the career-offender Guideline at issue here.  Given the near consensus among the lower courts that this Guideline is unconstitutionally vague, see n.\u00a03, infra, some courts have proceeded to resentence defendants whose sentences were originally enhanced under the Guideline.  See App. to Reply Brief 1-14.  In these resentencings, \"every defendant but one received a sentence lower than the sentence originally imposed,\" and the average defendant received a sentence \"more than [three] years lower than the original sentence.\"  Reply Brief 12.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Our decision in Irizarry v. United States, 553 U.\u00a0S. 708 (2008), is not to the contrary.  In Irizarry we held that Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(h) does not require a judge to inform a defendant, in advance of a sentencing proceeding, of his intent to vary above the Guidelines range.  Id., at 715-716.  That narrow decision has no bearing on the broader question whether ordinary people are entitled to fair notice, under the Due Process Clause, of the rules that will dictate their punishment.\nFootnote 3\u00a0See United States v. Hurlburt, 835 F.\u00a03d 715, 721-725 (CA7 2016) (en banc) (the Guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges); United States v. Calabretta, 831 F.\u00a03d 128, 136-137 (CA3 2016) (same); United States v. Sheffield, 832 F.\u00a03d 296, 312-313 (CADC 2016) (same); United States v.

Matchett, 802 F.\u00a03d 1185, 1193-1196 (CA11 2015) (they are not).\nFootnote 4\u00a0The Court's adherence to the formalistic distinction between mandatory and advisory rules at least leaves open the question whether defendants sentenced to terms of imprisonment before our decision in United States v. Booker, 543 U.\u00a0S. 220 (2005)--that is, during the period in which the Guidelines did \"fix the permissible range of sentences,\" ante, at 5--may mount vagueness attacks on their sentences.  See Brief for Scholars of Criminal Law, Federal Courts, and Sentencing as Amici Curiae 33-34.  That question is not presented by this case and I, like the majority, take no position on its appropriate resolution.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Indeed, the Ninth Circuit has held for decades that the Guidelines are subject to vagueness challenges, see United States v. Helmy, 951 F.\u00a02d 988, 993 (CA9 1991), yet the Government represents that that court has never found a Guideline unconstitutionally vague.

VIRGINIA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-680\nArgued: December 5, 2016Decided: March 1, 2017\n\n\nAfter the 2010 census, the Virginia State Legislature drew new lines for 12 state legislative districts, with a goal of ensuring that each district would have a black voting-age population (BVAP) of at least 55%.  Certain voters filed suit, claiming that the new districts violated the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  State legislative officials (State) intervened to defend the plan.  A three-judge District Court rejected the challenges.  As to 11 of the districts, the court concluded that the voters had not shown, as this Court's precedent requires, \"that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district,\" Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 916.  In so doing, the court held that race predominates only where there is an \"\u00a0'actual conflict between traditional redistricting criteria and race.'\u00a0\" 141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 505, 524.  It thus confined the predominance analysis to the portions of the new lines that appeared to deviate from traditional criteria.  As to the remaining district, District 75, the court found that race did predominate, but that the lines were constitutional because the legislature's use of race was narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest.  In particular, the court found the legislature had good reasons to believe that a 55% racial target was necessary in District 75 to avoid diminishing the ability of black voters to elect their preferred candidates, which at the time would have violated \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, see Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The District Court employed an incorrect legal standard in determining that race did not predominate in 11 of the 12 districts.  Pp.\u00a06-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State, without sufficient justification, from \"separat[ing] its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.\"  Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 911.  Courts must \"exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims\" of racial gerrymandering, id., at 916, since a legislature is always \"aware of race when it draws district lines, just as it is aware of .\u00a0.\u00a0. other demographic factors,\" Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.\u00a0S. 630, 646 (Shaw I).  A plaintiff alleging racial gerrymandering thus bears the burden \"to show, either through circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's [districting] decision,\" which requires proving \"that the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles .\u00a0.\u00a0. to racial considerations.\"  Miller, supra, at 916.  Here, the District Court misapplied controlling law in two principal ways.  Pp.\u00a06-7. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0First, the District Court misunderstood relevant precedents when it required the challengers to establish, as a prerequisite to showing racial predominance, an actual conflict between the enacted plan and traditional redistricting principles.  This Court has made clear that parties may show predominance \"either through circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose,\" Miller, supra, at 916, and that race may predominate even when a plan respects traditional principles, Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899, 907 (Shaw II).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State's theory in this case is irreconcilable with Miller and Shaw II.  The State insists, e.g., that the harm from racial gerrymandering lies not in racial line-drawing per se but in grouping voters of the same race together when they otherwise lack shared interests.  But \"the constitutional violation\" in racial gerrymandering cases stems from the \"racial purpose of state action, not its stark manifestation.\"  Miller, supra, at 913.  The State also contends that race does not have a prohibited effect on a district's lines if the legislature could have drawn the same lines in accordance with traditional criteria.  The proper inquiry, however, concerns the actual considerations that provided the essential basis for the lines drawn, not post hoc justifications that the legislature could have used but did not.  A legislature could construct a plethora of potential maps that look consistent with traditional, race-neutral principles, but if race is the overriding reason for choosing one map over others, race still may predominate.  A conflict or inconsistency may be persuasive circumstantial evidence tending to show racial predomination, but no rule requires challengers to present this kind of evidence in every case.  As a practical matter, this kind of evidence may be necessary in many or even most cases.  But there may be cases where challengers can establish racial predominance without evidence of an actual conflict.  Pp.\u00a07-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The District Court also erred in considering the legislature's racial motive only to the extent that the challengers identified deviations from traditional redistricting criteria attributable to race and not to some other factor.  Racial gerrymandering claims proceed \"district-by-district,\" Alabama, supra, at ___, and courts should not divorce any portion of a district's lines--whatever their relationship to traditional principles--from the rest of the district.  Courts may consider evidence pertaining to an area that is larger or smaller than the district at issue.  But the ultimate object of the inquiry is the legislature's predominant motive for the district's design as a whole, and any explanation for a particular portion of the lines must take account of the districtwide context.  A holistic analysis is necessary to give the proper weight to districtwide evidence, such as stark splits in the racial composition of populations moved into and out of a district, or the use of a racial target.  Pp.\u00a011-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The District Court is best positioned to determine on remand the extent to which, under the proper standard, race directed the shape of these 11 districts, and if race did predominate, whether strict scrutiny is satisfied.  Pp.\u00a012-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The District Court's judgment regarding District 75 is consistent with the basic narrow tailoring analysis explained in Alabama.  Where a challenger succeeds in establishing racial predominance, the burden shifts to the State to \"demonstrate that its districting legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest.\"  Miller, supra, at 920.  Here, it is assumed that the State's interest in complying with the Voting Rights Act was a compelling interest.  When a State justifies the predominant use of race in redistricting on the basis of the need to comply with the Voting Rights Act, \"the narrow tailoring requirement insists only that the legislature have a 'strong basis in evidence' in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.\"  Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___.  The State must show not that its action was actually necessary to avoid a statutory violation, but only that the legislature had \"\u00a0'good reasons to believe'\u00a0\" its use of race was needed in order to satisfy the Voting Rights Act.  Ibid.  There was no error in the District Court's conclusion that the legislature had sufficient grounds to determine that the race-based calculus it employed in District 75 was necessary to avoid violating \u00a75.  Under the facts found by that court, the legislature performed the kind of functional analysis of District 75 necessary under \u00a75, and the result reflected the good-faith efforts of legislators to achieve an informed bipartisan consensus.  In contesting the sufficiency of that evidence and the evidence justifying the 55% BVAP floor, the challengers ask too much from state officials charged with the sensitive duty of reapportioning legislative districts.  As to the claim that the BVAP floor is akin to the \"mechanically numerical view\" of \u00a75 rejected in Alabama, supra, at ___, the record here supports the State's conclusion that this was an instance where a 55% BVAP was necessary for black voters to have a functional working majority.

After the 2010 census, some redistricting was required to ensure proper numerical apportionment for the Virginia House of Delegates.  It is undisputed that the boundary lines for the 12 districts at issue were drawn with a goal of ensuring that each district would have a black voting-age population (BVAP) of at least 55%.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certain voters challenged the new districts as unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.  The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, constituted as a three-judge district court, rejected the challenges as to each of the 12 districts.  As to 11 of the districts, the District Court concluded that the voters had not shown, as this Court's precedent requires, \"that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\"  Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 916 (1995).

As to the remaining district, District 75, the District Court found that race did predominate.  It concluded, however, that the lines were constitutional because the legislature's use of race was narrowly tailored to a compelling state interest.  In particular, the District Court determined that the legislature had \"good reasons to believe\" that a 55% racial target was necessary in District 75 to avoid diminishing the ability of black voters to elect their preferred candidates, which at the time would have violated \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

This Court now affirms as to District 75 and vacates and remands as to the remaining 11 districts.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the 2010 census, the Virginia General Assembly set out to redraw the legislative districts for the State Senate and House of Delegates in time for the 2011 elections.  In February 2011, the House Committee on Privileges and Elections adopted a resolution establishing criteria to guide the redistricting process.  Among those criteria were traditional redistricting factors such as compactness, contiguity of territory, and respect for communities of interest.  But above those traditional objectives, the committee gave priority to two other goals.  First, in accordance with the principle of one person, one vote, the committee resolved that \"[t]he population of each district shall be as nearly equal to the population of every other district as practicable,\" with any deviations falling \"within plus-or-minus one percent.\"  141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 518.  Second, the committee resolved that the new map must comply with the \"protections against .\u00a0.\u00a0. unwarranted retrogression\" contained in \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act.  Ibid.  At the time, \u00a75 required covered jurisdictions, including Virginia, to preclear any change to a voting standard, practice, or procedure by showing federal authorities that the change would not have the purpose or effect of \"diminishing the ability of [members of a minority group] to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\"  \u00a75, 120 Stat. 580-581, 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710304(b).  After the redistricting process here was completed, this Court held that the coverage formula in \u00a74(b) of the Voting Rights Act no longer may be used to require preclearance under \u00a75.  See Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 24).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The committee's criteria presented potential problems for 12 House districts.  Under \u00a75 as Congress amended it in 2005, \"[a] plan leads to impermissible retrogression when, compared to the plan currently in effect (typically called a 'benchmark plan'), the new plan diminishes the number of districts in which minority groups can 'elect their preferred candidates of choice' (often called 'ability-to-elect' districts).\"  Harris v. Arizona Independent Redistricting Comm'n, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (slip op., at 5-6) (quoting 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710304(b)).  The parties agree that the 12 districts at issue here, where minorities had constituted a majority of the voting-age population for many past elections, qualified as \"ability-to-elect\" districts.  Most of the districts were underpopulated, however, so any new plan required moving significant numbers of new voters into these districts in order to comply with the principle of one person, one vote.  Under the benchmark plan, the districts had BVAPs ranging from 62.7% down to 46.3%.  Three districts had BVAPs below 55%.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeking to maintain minority voters' ability to elect their preferred candidates in these districts while complying with the one-person, one-vote criterion, legislators concluded that each of the 12 districts \"needed to contain a BVAP of at least 55%.\"  141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 519.  At trial, the parties disputed whether the 55% figure \"was an aspiration or a target or a rule.\"  Ibid.  But they did not dispute \"the most important question--whether [the 55%] figure was used in drawing the Challenged Districts.\"  Ibid.  The parties agreed, and the District Court found, \"that the 55% BVAP figure was used in structuring the districts.\"  Ibid.  In the enacted plan all 12 districts contained a BVAP greater than 55%.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Who first suggested the 55% BVAP criterion and how the legislators agreed upon it was less clear from the evidence.  See id., at 521 (describing the \"[t]estimony on this question\" as \"a muddle\").  In the end, the District Court found that the 55% criterion emerged from discussions among certain members of the House Black Caucus and the leader of the redistricting effort in the House, Delegate Chris Jones, \"based largely on concerns pertaining to the re-election of Delegate Tyler in [District] 75.\"  Id., at 522.  The 55% figure \"was then applied across the board to all twelve\" districts.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In April 2011, the General Assembly passed Delegate Jones' plan with broad support from both parties and members of the Black Caucus.  One of only two dissenting members of the Black Caucus was Delegate Tyler of District 75, who objected solely on the ground that the 55.4% BVAP in her district was too low.  In June 2011, the U.\u00a0S. Department of Justice precleared the plan.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three years later, before this suit was filed, a separate District Court struck down Virginia's third federal congressional district (not at issue here), based in part on the legislature's use of a 55% BVAP threshold.  See Page v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 58 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 533, 553 (ED Va. 2014), vacated and remanded sub\u00a0nom. Cantor v. Personhuballah, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), judgt. entered sub\u00a0nom. Page v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 2015 WL 3604029 (June 5, 2015), appeal dism'd sub\u00a0nom. Wittman v. Personhuballah, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  After that decision, 12 voters registered in the 12 districts here at issue filed this action challenging the district lines under the Equal Protection Clause.  Because the claims \"challeng[ed] the constitutionality of .\u00a0.\u00a0. the apportionment of [a] statewide legislative body,\" the case was heard by a three-judge District Court.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72284(a).  The Virginia House of Delegates and its Speaker, William Howell (together referred to hereinafter as the State), intervened and assumed responsibility for defending the plan, both before the District Court and now before this Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a 4-day bench trial, a divided District Court ruled for the State.  With respect to each challenged district, the court first assessed whether \"racial considerations predominated over--or 'subordinated'--traditional redistricting criteria.\"  141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 523.  An essential premise of the majority opinion was that race does not predominate unless there is an \"actual conflict between traditional redistricting criteria and race that leads to the subordination of the former.\"  Id., at 524.  To implement that standard, moreover, the court limited its inquiry into racial motive to those portions of the district lines that appeared to deviate from traditional criteria.  The court thus \"examine[d] those aspects of the [district] that appear[ed] to constitute 'deviations' from neutral criteria\" to ascertain whether the deviations were attributable to race or to other considerations, \"such as protection of incumbents.\"  Id., at 533-534.  Only if the court found a deviation attributable to race did it proceed to \"determine whether racial considerations qualitatively subordinated all other non-racial districting criteria.\"  Ibid.  Under that analysis, the court found that race did not predominate in 11 of the 12 districts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When it turned to District 75, the District Court found that race did predominate.  The court reasoned that \"[a]chieving a 55% BVAP floor required 'drastic maneuvering' that is reflected on the face of the district.\"  Id., at 557.  Applying strict scrutiny, the court held that compliance with \u00a75 was a compelling state interest and that the legislature's consideration of race in District 75 was narrowly tailored.  As to narrow tailoring, the court explained that the State had \"a strong basis in evidence\" to believe that its actions were \"reasonably necessary\" to avoid retrogression.  Id., at 548.  In particular, the court found that Delegate Jones had considered \"precisely the kinds of evidence that legislators are encouraged to use\" in achieving compliance with \u00a75, including turnout rates, the district's large disenfranchised prison population, and voting patterns in the contested 2005 primary and general elections.  Id., at 558.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Keenan dissented as to all 12 districts.  She concluded that the majority applied an incorrect understanding of racial predominance and that Delegate Jones' analysis of District 75 was too \"general and conclusory.\"  Id., at 578.  This appeal followed, and probable jurisdiction was noted.  578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016); see 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71253.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against the factual and procedural background set out above, it is now appropriate to consider the controlling legal principles in this case.  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State, without sufficient justification, from \"separat[ing] its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.\"  Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 911.  The harms that flow from racial sorting \"include being personally subjected to a racial classification as well as being represented by a legislator who believes his primary obligation is to represent only the members of a particular racial group.\"  Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (alterations, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted).  At the same time, courts must \"exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis of race.\"  Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 916.  \"Electoral districting is a most difficult subject for legislatures,\" requiring a delicate balancing of competing considerations.  Id., at 915.  And \"redistricting differs from other kinds of state decisionmaking in that the legislature always is aware of race when it draws district lines, just as it is aware of .\u00a0.\u00a0. a variety of other demographic factors.\"  Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.\u00a0S. 630, 646 (1993) (Shaw I).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of these considerations, this Court has held that a plaintiff alleging racial gerrymandering bears the burden \"to show, either through circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose, that race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\"  Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S. at 916.  To satisfy this burden, the plaintiff \"must prove that the legislature subordinated traditional race-neutral districting principles .\u00a0.\u00a0. to racial considerations.\"  Ibid.  The challengers contend that, in finding that race did not predominate in 11 of the 12 districts, the District Court misapplied controlling law in two principal ways.  This Court considers them in turn.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The challengers first argue that the District Court misunderstood the relevant precedents when it required the challengers to establish, as a prerequisite to showing racial predominance, an actual conflict between the enacted plan and traditional redistricting principles.  The Court agrees with the challengers on this point.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A threshold requirement that the enacted plan must conflict with traditional principles might have been reconcilable with this Court's case law at an earlier time.  In Shaw I, the Court recognized a claim of racial gerrymandering for the first time.  See 509 U.\u00a0S., at 652.  Certain language in Shaw I can be read to support requiring a challenger who alleges racial gerrymandering to show an actual conflict with traditional principles.  The opinion stated, for example, that strict scrutiny applies to \"redistricting legislation that is so bizarre on its face that it is unexplainable on grounds other than race.\"  Id., at 644 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The opinion also stated that \"reapportionment is one area in which appearances do matter.\"  Id., at 647.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's opinion in Miller, however, clarified the racial predominance inquiry.  In particular, it rejected the argument that, \"regardless of the legislature's purposes, a plaintiff must demonstrate that a district's shape is so bizarre that it is unexplainable other than on the basis of race.\"  515 U.\u00a0S., at 910-911.  The Court held to the contrary in language central to the instant case: \"Shape is relevant not because bizarreness is a necessary element of the constitutional wrong or a threshold requirement of proof, but because it may be persuasive circumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature's dominant and controlling rationale.\"  Id., at 913.  Parties therefore \"may rely on evidence other than bizarreness to establish race-based districting,\" and may show predominance \"either through circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose.\"  Id., at 913, 916.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court addressed racial gerrymandering and traditional redistricting factors again in Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899 (1996) (Shaw II).  The Court there rejected the view of one of the dissents that \"strict scrutiny does not apply where a State 'respects' or 'complies with traditional districting principles.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 906 (quoting id., at 931-932 (Stevens, J., dissenting); alteration omitted).  Race may predominate even when a reapportionment plan respects traditional principles, the Court explained, if \"[r]ace was the criterion that, in the State's view, could not be compromised,\" and race-neutral considerations \"came into play only after the race-based decision had been made.\"  Id., at 907.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State's theory in this case is irreconcilable with Miller and Shaw II.  The State insists, for example, that the harm from racial gerrymandering lies not in racial line-drawing per se but in grouping voters of the same race together when they otherwise lack shared interests.  But \"the constitutional violation\" in racial gerrymandering cases stems from the \"racial purpose of state action, not its stark manifestation.\"  Miller, supra, at 913.  The Equal Protection Clause does not prohibit misshapen districts.  It prohibits unjustified racial classifications.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State contends further that race does not have a prohibited effect on a district's lines if the legislature could have drawn the same lines in accordance with traditional criteria.  That argument parallels the District Court's reasoning that a reapportionment plan is not an express racial classification unless a racial purpose is apparent from the face of the plan based on the irregular nature of the lines themselves.  See 141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 524-526.  This is incorrect.  The racial predominance inquiry concerns the actual considerations that provided the essential basis for the lines drawn, not post hoc justifications the legislature in theory could have used but in reality did not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Traditional redistricting principles, moreover, are numerous and malleable.  The District Court here identified no fewer than 11 race-neutral redistricting factors a legislature could consider, some of which are \"surprisingly ethereal\" and \"admi[t] of degrees.\"  Id., at 535, 537.  By deploying those factors in various combinations and permutations, a State could construct a plethora of potential maps that look consistent with traditional, race-neutral principles.  But if race for its own sake is the overriding reason for choosing one map over others, race still may predominate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, a conflict or inconsistency between the enacted plan and traditional redistricting criteria is not a threshold requirement or a mandatory precondition in order for a challenger to establish a claim of racial gerrymandering.  Of course, a conflict or inconsistency may be persuasive circumstantial evidence tending to show racial predomination, but there is no rule requiring challengers to present this kind of evidence in every case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a practical matter, in many cases, perhaps most cases, challengers will be unable to prove an unconstitutional racial gerrymander without evidence that the enacted plan conflicts with traditional redistricting criteria.  In general, legislatures that engage in impermissible race-based redistricting will find it necessary to depart from traditional principles in order to do so.  And, in the absence of a conflict with traditional principles, it may be difficult for challengers to find other evidence sufficient to show that race was the overriding factor causing neutral considerations to be cast aside.  In fact, this Court to date has not affirmed a predominance finding, or remanded a case for a determination of predominance, without evidence that some district lines deviated from traditional principles.  See Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17); Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.\u00a0S. 541, 547 (1999); Bush v. Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S. 952, 962, 966, 974 (1996) (plurality opinion); Shaw II, supra, at 905-906; Miller, supra, at 917; Shaw I, supra, at 635-636.  Yet the law responds to proper evidence and valid inferences in ever-changing circumstances, as it learns more about ways in which its commands are circumvented.  So there may be cases where challengers will be able to establish racial predominance in the absence of an actual conflict by presenting direct evidence of the legislative purpose and intent or other compelling circumstantial evidence.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The challengers submit that the District Court erred further when it considered the legislature's racial motive only to the extent that the challengers identified deviations from traditional redistricting criteria that were attributable to race and not to some other factor.  In the challengers' view, this approach foreclosed a holistic analysis of each district and led the District Court to give insufficient weight to the 55% BVAP target and other relevant evidence that race predominated.  Again, this Court agrees.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As explained, showing a deviation from, or conflict with, traditional redistricting principles is not a necessary prerequisite to establishing racial predominance.  Supra, at 10.  But even where a challenger alleges a conflict, or succeeds in showing one, the court should not confine its analysis to the conflicting portions of the lines.  That is because the basic unit of analysis for racial gerrymandering claims in general, and for the racial predominance inquiry in particular, is the district.  Racial gerrymandering claims proceed \"district-by-district.\"  Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).  \"We have consistently described a claim of racial gerrymandering as a claim that race was improperly used in the drawing of the boundaries of one or more specific electoral districts.\"  Ibid.  And Miller's basic predominance test scrutinizes the legislature's motivation for placing \"a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\"  515 U. S., at 916.  Courts evaluating racial predominance therefore should not divorce any portion of the lines--whatever their relationship to traditional principles--from the rest of the district.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not to suggest that courts evaluating racial gerrymandering claims may not consider evidence pertaining to an area that is larger or smaller than the district at issue.  The Court has recognized that \"[v]oters, of course, can present statewide evidence in order to prove racial gerrymandering in a particular district.\"  Alabama, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (emphasis deleted).  Districts share borders, after all, and a legislature may pursue a common redistricting policy toward multiple districts.  Likewise, a legislature's race-based decisionmaking may be evident in a notable way in a particular part of a district.  It follows that a court may consider evidence regarding certain portions of a district's lines, including portions that conflict with traditional redistricting principles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The ultimate object of the inquiry, however, is the legislature's predominant motive for the design of the district as a whole.  A court faced with a racial gerrymandering claim therefore must consider all of the lines of the district at issue; any explanation for a particular portion of the lines, moreover, must take account of the districtwide context.  Concentrating on particular portions in isolation may obscure the significance of relevant districtwide evidence, such as stark splits in the racial composition of populations moved into and out of disparate parts of the district, or the use of an express racial target.  A holistic analysis is necessary to give that kind of evidence its proper weight.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The challengers ask this Court not only to correct the District Court's racial predominance standard but also to apply that standard and conclude that race in fact did predominate in the 11 districts where the District Court held that it did not.  For its part, the State asks the Court to hold that, even if race did predominate in these districts, the State's predominant use of race was narrowly tailored to the compelling interest in complying with \u00a75.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court declines these requests.  \"[O]urs is a court of final review and not first view.\"  Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The District Court is best positioned to determine in the first instance the extent to which, under the proper standard, race directed the shape of these 11 districts.  And if race did predominate, it is proper for the District Court to determine in the first instance whether strict scrutiny is satisfied.  These matters are left for the District Court on remand.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court now turns to the arguments regarding District 75.  Where a challenger succeeds in establishing racial predominance, the burden shifts to the State to \"demonstrate that its districting legislation is narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling interest.\"  Miller, supra, at 920.  The District Court here determined that the State's predominant use of race in District 75 was narrowly tailored to achieve compliance with \u00a75.  The challengers contest the finding of narrow tailoring, but they do not dispute that compliance with \u00a75 was a compelling interest at the relevant time.  As in previous cases, therefore, the Court assumes, without deciding, that the State's interest in complying with the Voting Rights Act was compelling.  E.g., Alabama, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 19-23); Shaw II, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 915.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to narrow tailoring, the Court explained the contours of that requirement in Alabama.  When a State justifies the predominant use of race in redistricting on the basis of the need to comply with the Voting Rights Act, \"the narrow tailoring requirement insists only that the legislature have a strong basis in evidence in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.\"  575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 22) (internal quotation marks omitted).  That standard does not require the State to show that its action was \"actually .\u00a0.\u00a0. necessary\" to avoid a statutory violation, so that, but for its use of race, the State would have lost in court.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Rather, the requisite strong basis in evidence exists when the legislature has \"good reasons to believe\" it must use race in order to satisfy the Voting Rights Act, \"even if a court does not find that the actions were necessary for statutory compliance.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court now finds no error in the District Court's conclusion that the State had sufficient grounds to determine that the race-based calculus it employed in District 75 was necessary to avoid violating \u00a75.  As explained, \u00a75 at the time barred Virginia from adopting any districting change that would \"have the effect of diminishing the ability of [members of a minority group] to elect their preferred candidates of choice.\"  52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710304(b).  Determining what minority population percentage will satisfy that standard is a difficult task requiring, in the view of the Department of Justice, a \"functional analysis of the electoral behavior within the particular .\u00a0.\u00a0. election district.\"  Guidance Concerning Redistricting Under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, 76 Fed. Reg. 7471 (2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the facts found by the District Court, the legislature performed that kind of functional analysis of District 75 when deciding upon the 55% BVAP target.  Redrawing this district presented a difficult task, and the result reflected the good-faith efforts of Delegate Jones and his colleagues to achieve an informed bipartisan consensus.  Delegate Jones met with Delegate Tyler \"probably half a dozen times to configure her district\" in order to avoid retrogression.  141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 558 (internal quotation marks omitted).  He discussed the district with incumbents from other majority-minority districts.  He also considered turnout rates, the results of the recent contested primary and general elections in 2005, and the district's large population of disenfranchised black prisoners.  The challengers, moreover, do not dispute that District 75 was an ability-to-elect district, or that white and black voters in the area tend to vote as blocs.  See id., at 557-559.  In light of Delegate Jones' careful assessment of local conditions and structures, the State had a strong basis in evidence to believe a 55% BVAP floor was required to avoid retrogression.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The challengers' responses ask too much from state officials charged with the sensitive duty of reapportioning legislative districts.  First, the challengers contest the sufficiency of the evidence showing that Delegate Jones in fact performed a functional analysis, in part because that analysis was not memorialized in writing.  But the District Court's factual findings are reviewed only for clear error.  See Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.\u00a0S. 234, 242 (2001).  The findings regarding how the legislature arrived at the 55% BVAP target are well supported, and \"we do not .\u00a0.\u00a0. require States engaged in redistricting to compile a comprehensive administrative record.\"  Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 966 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The challengers argue further that the drafters of the plan had insufficient evidence to justify a 55% BVAP floor.  The 2005 elections were idiosyncratic, the challengers contend; moreover, demographic information about the prison in the district is absent from the record, and Delegate Tyler's perspective was influenced by a personal interest in reelection.  That may have been so, and for those reasons, it is possible that, if the State had drawn District 75 with a BVAP below 55% and had sought judicial preclearance, a court would have found no \u00a75 violation.  But that is not the question here.  \"The law cannot insist that a state legislature, when redistricting, determine precisely what percent minority population \u00a75 demands.\"  Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip  op., at 22).  The question is whether the State had \"good reasons\" to believe a 55% BVAP floor was necessary to avoid liability under \u00a75.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The State did have good reasons under these circumstances.  Holding otherwise would afford state legislatures too little breathing room, leaving them \"trapped between the competing hazards of liability\" under the Voting Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause.  Vera, supra, at 977 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a final point, the challengers liken the 55% BVAP floor here to the \"mechanically numerical view\" of \u00a75 this Court rejected in Alabama.  575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 21).  But Alabama did not condemn the use of BVAP targets to comply with \u00a75 in every instance.  Rather, this Court corrected the \"misperception\" that \u00a75 required a State to \"maintai[n] the same population percentages in majority-minority districts as in the prior plan.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 19-20).  \"[I]t would seem highly unlikely,\" the Court explained, that reducing a district's BVAP \"from, say, 70% to 65% would have a significant impact on the black voters' ability to elect their preferred candidate.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 21).  Yet reducing the BVAP below 55% well might have that effect in some cases.  The record here supports the legislature's conclusion that this was one instance where a 55% BVAP was necessary for black voters to have a functional working majority.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's holding in this case is controlled by precedent.  The Court reaffirms the basic racial predominance analysis explained in Miller and Shaw II, and the basic narrow tailoring analysis explained in Alabama.  The District Court's judgment as to District 75 is consistent with these principles.  Applying these principles to the remaining 11 districts is entrusted to the District Court in the first instance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the District Court is affirmed in part and vacated in part.  The case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nOpinion of Alito, J.\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-680\nGOLDEN BETHUNE-HILL, et\u00a0al., APPELLANTS v.

Ante, at 13-16.  The districting plan at issue here was adopted prior to our decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), and therefore it is appropriate to apply the body of law in effect at that time.  What is more, appellants have never contested the District Court's holding that compliance with \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act was a compelling government interest for covered jurisdictions before our decision in Shelby County.  See 141 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 505, 545-547 (ED Va. 2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I concur in the judgment of the Court insofar as it vacates and remands the judgment below with respect to all the remaining districts.  Unlike the Court, however, I would hold that all these districts must satisfy strict scrutiny.  See post, at 1-2 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see also League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.\u00a0S. 399, 517 (2006) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (\"[W]hen a legislature intentionally creates a majority-minority district, race is necessarily its predominant motivation and strict scrutiny is therefore triggered\").\n\nOpinion of Thomas, J.\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-680\nGOLDEN BETHUNE-HILL, et\u00a0al., APPELLANTS v. VIRGINIA STATE BOARD OF ELECTIONS, et\u00a0al.\non appeal from the united states district court for the eastern district of virginia\n[March 1, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Appellants contend that 12 of Virginia's state legislative districts are unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.  The three-judge District Court rejected their challenge, holding that race was not the legislature's predominant motive in drawing 11 of the districts and that the remaining district survives strict scrutiny.  I would reverse the District Court as to all 12 districts.  I therefore concur in the judgment in part and dissent in part.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I concur in the Court's judgment reversing the District Court's decision to uphold 11 of the 12 districts at issue in this case--House Districts 63, 69, 70, 71, 74, 77, 80, 89, 90, 92, and 95.  I do not agree, however, with the Court's decision to leave open the question whether race predominated in those districts and, thus, whether they are subject to strict scrutiny.  Ante, at 12-13.  Appellees (hereinafter State) concede that the legislature intentionally drew all 12 districts as majority-black districts.  See, e.g., Brief for Appellees 1 (\"[T]he legislature sought to achieve a [black voting-age population] of at least 55% in adjusting the lines of the 12 majority-minority districts\").  That concession, in my view, mandates strict scrutiny as to each district.  See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S. 952, 1000 (1996) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (A State's \"concession that it intentionally created majority-minority districts [i]s sufficient to show that race was a predominant, motivating factor in its redistricting\"); League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.\u00a0S. 399, 517 (2006) (LULAC) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (\"[W]hen a legislature intentionally creates a majority-minority district, race is necessarily its predominant motivation and strict scrutiny is therefore triggered\").  I would therefore hold that the District Court must apply strict scrutiny to Districts 63, 69, 70, 71, 74, 77, 80, 89, 90, 92, and 95 on remand.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I disagree with the Court's judgment with respect to the remaining district, District 75.  The majority affirms the District Court's holding that District 75 is subject to strict scrutiny.  With this I agree, because, as with the other 11 districts, the State conceded that it intentionally drew District 75 as a majority-black district.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I disagree, however, with the majority's determination that District 75 satisfies strict scrutiny.  This Court has held that a State may draw distinctions among its citizens based on race only when it \"is pursuing a compelling state interest\" and has chosen \"narrowly tailored\" means to accomplish that interest.  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899, 908 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The State asserts that it used race in drawing District 75 to further a \"compelling interest in complying with Section 5 of the [Voting Rights Act of 1965].\"  Brief for Appellees 50.1  And it argues that, based on its \"good-faith functional analysis\" of the district, it narrowly tailored its use of race to achieve that interest.  Id., at 56.  In my view, the State has neither asserted a compelling state interest nor narrowly tailored its use of race.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an initial matter, the majority errs by \"assum[ing], without deciding, that the State's interest in complying with the Voting Rights Act was compelling.\"  Ante, at 13.  To be sure, this Court has previously assumed that a State has a compelling interest in complying with the Voting Rights Act.  But it has done so only in cases in which it has not upheld the redistricting plan at issue.  See, e.g., Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 921 (1995) (leaving open the question \"[w]hether or not in some cases compliance with the [Voting Rights] Act, standing alone, can provide a compelling interest independent of any interest in remedying past discrimination\").2  This Court has never, before today, assumed a compelling state interest while upholding a state redistricting plan. Indeed, I know of no other case, in any context, in which the Court has assumed away part of the State's burden to justify its intentional use of race.  This should not be the first.  I would hold that complying with \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act is not a compelling interest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[C]ompliance with federal antidiscrimination laws cannot justify race-based districting where the challenged district was not reasonably necessary under a constitutional reading and application of those laws.\"  Id., at 921 (emphasis added).  More than a decade ago, I joined Justice Scalia's opinion in LULAC, which noted that this Court had \"upheld the constitutionality of \u00a75 as a proper exercise of Congress's authority under \u00a72 of the Fifteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment's prohibition on the denial or abridgment of the right to vote.\"  548 U.\u00a0S., at 518.  I therefore agreed that, \"[i]n the proper case, .\u00a0.\u00a0. a covered jurisdiction may have a compelling interest in complying with \u00a75.\"  Id., at 519.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have since concluded that \u00a75 is \"unconstitutional.\" Northwest Austin Municipal Util. Dist. No. One v. Holder, 557 U.\u00a0S. 193, 216 (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  \"[T]he violence, intimidation, and subterfuge that led Congress to pass \u00a75 and this Court to uphold it no longer remains,\" id., at 229, so \u00a75 \"can no longer be justified as an appropriate mechanism for enforcement of the Fifteenth Amendment,\" id., at 216.  Because, in my view, \u00a75 is unconstitutional, I would hold that a State does not have a compelling interest in complying with it.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if compliance with \u00a75 were a compelling interest, the State failed to narrowly tailor its use of race to further that interest.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has explained that \"[a]ny preference based on racial or ethnic criteria must necessarily receive a most searching examination.\"  Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Ed., 476 U.\u00a0S. 267, 273 (1986) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted); accord, Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pe\u00f1a, 515 U.\u00a0S. 200, 223 (1995); Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.\u00a0S. 306, 378 (2003) (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., dissenting).  This exacting scrutiny makes sense because \"[d]iscrimination on the basis of race\" is \"odious in all aspects.\"  Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.\u00a0S. 545, 555 (1979).  Accordingly, a State's use of race must bear \"\u00a0'the most exact connection'\u00a0\" to the compelling state interest.  Wygant, supra, at 280 (opinion of Powell, J.).  In the context of redistricting, the redistricting map must, \"at a minimum,\" actually \"remedy the anticipated violation\" or \"achieve compliance\" with the Voting Rights Act.  Shaw, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 916.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have serious doubts about the Court's standard for narrow tailoring, as characterized today and in Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).  Relying on Alabama, the majority explains that narrow tailoring in the redistricting context requires \"only that the legislature have a strong basis in evidence in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.\"  Ante, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That standard \"does not demand that a State's actions actually be necessary to achieve a compelling state interest in order to be constitutionally valid.\"  Alabama, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also ante, at 14.  Instead, under that standard, a state legislature needs only \"good reasons to believe\" that the use of race is required, even if the use of race is not \"actually .\u00a0.\u00a0. necessary.\"  Alabama, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That approach to narrow tailoring--deferring to a State's belief that it has good reasons to use race--is \"strict\" in name only.  To the extent the Court applies Alabama to dilute the well-settled standard established by our precedents, I demur.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying the proper narrow-tailoring standard for state classifications based on race, I conclude that the State did not narrowly tailor its use of race to comply with \u00a75.  As the majority recognizes, \u00a75 requires a state redistricting plan to maintain the black population's ability to elect the candidate of its choice in the district at issue--in other words, the State must \"avoid retrogression\" in the new district.  Ante, at 14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority observes that the redistricting plan's architect, Delegate Chris Jones, performed a \"functional analysis\" in deciding that District 75 required a 55% black voting-age population--as opposed to some other percentage--to avoid retrogression.  Ibid.  The Court notes that, in arriving at the 55% threshold, Delegate Jones considered turnout rates, the results of the primary and general elections in 2005, and the district's \"large population of disenfranchised black prisoners.\"  Ante, at 15.  He also met with the incumbent delegate for District 75 \"probably half a dozen times\" and \"discussed the district with incumbents from other majority-black districts.\"  Ante, at 14-15 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Those efforts add up, in the majority's view, to a \"careful assessment of local conditions and structures.\"  Ante, at 15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not agree that those efforts satisfy narrow tailoring. Delegate Jones admitted that he was \"not aware\" of \"any retrogress[ion] analysis\" performed by \"h[im] or any persons that worked with him in the development of the [redistricting] plan.\"  App. 288-289.  Instead, he merely \"look[ed] at\" the \"percentage of black population and the percentage of black voting age population,\" \"looked at what happened over the last 10 year period given the existing population and demographic shifts,\" and \"tried to restore back\" the levels of black voting-age population from the previous maps.  Id., at 290.  That approach was misguided, because \u00a75 \"does not require maintaining the same population percentages in majority-minority districts as in the prior plan.\"  Alabama, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 20).  And in any event, that back-of-the-envelope calculation does not qualify as rigorous analysis. I do not think we would permit so imprecise an approach with regard to any other instance of racial discrimination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other evidence cited by the majority is similarly weak.  The majority points to the \"\u00a0'half a dozen'\u00a0\" meetings between Delegate Jones and the incumbent delegate for District 75, ante, at 14, but it is not apparent from the record whether District 75's incumbent is the current black population's candidate of choice.  Moreover, the incumbent delegate may well have wanted her district to be electorally safer than the Voting Rights Act requires.  It also is not obvious to me that Delegate Jones was seeking to avoid retrogression in District 75 when he met with incumbent delegates from other majority-black districts.  Ibid.  In my view, those efforts fall far short of establishing that a 55% black voting-age population bears a more \"\u00a0'exact connection'\u00a0\" to the State's interest than any alternative percentage.  Wygant, supra, at 279 (opinion of Powell, J.).  Accordingly, I would hold that the State failed to narrowly tailor its use of race to avoid retrogression in District 75.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reaching these conclusions, I recognize that this Court is at least as responsible as the state legislature for these racially gerrymandered districts.  As explained above, this Court has repeatedly failed to decide whether compliance with the Voting Rights Act is a compelling governmental interest.  See supra, at 3, and n. 2.  Indeed, this Court has refused even to decide whether \u00a75 is constitutional, despite having twice taken cases to decide that question.  Compare Juris. Statement in Northwest Austin, O.\u00a0T. 2008, No. 08-322, p. i (presenting the question \"[w]hether .\u00a0.\u00a0. the \u00a75 preclearance requirement can be applied as a valid exercise of Congress's remedial powers under the Reconstruction Amendments\"), and Shelby County v. Holder, 568 U.\u00a0S. 1006 (2012) (granting certiorari on the question \"[w]hether Congress' decision in 2006 to reauthorize Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act under the pre-existing coverage formula of Section 4(b) .\u00a0.\u00a0. violated the Tenth Amendment and Article IV of the United States Constitution\"), with Northwest Austin, 557 U.\u00a0S., at 197 (holding that the district at issue was eligible to seek bailout under the Voting Rights Act and therefore \"not reach[ing] the constitutionality of \u00a75\"), and Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 24) (holding only that the coverage formula under \u00a74(b) was unconstitutional and \"issu[ing] no holding on \u00a75 itself\").  As a result, the Court has left the State without clear guidance about its redistricting obligations under \u00a75.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has put the State in a similar bind with respect to narrow tailoring.  To comply with \u00a75, a State necessarily must make a deliberate and precise effort to sort its citizens on the basis of their race.  But that result is fundamentally at odds with our \"color-blind\" Constitution, which \"neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.\"  Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.\u00a0S. 537, 559 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting).  That contradiction illustrates the perversity of the Court's jurisprudence in this area as well as the uncomfortable position in which the State might find itself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite my sympathy for the State, I cannot ignore the Constitution's clear prohibition on state-sponsored race discrimination.  \"The Constitution abhors classifications based on race, not only because those classifications can harm favored races or are based on illegitimate motives, but also because every time the government places citizens on racial registers .\u00a0.\u00a0. , it demeans us all.\"  Grutter, 539 U.\u00a0S., at 353 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  This prohibition was \"[p]urchased at the price of immeasurable human suffering,\" and it \"reflects our Nation's understanding that such classifications ultimately have a destructive impact on the individual and our society.\"  Adarand Constructors, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 240 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  I respectfully dissent from the Court's judgment as to District 75.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0It is unclear from the record whether the State sought to justify its use of race on other grounds.  I would leave it to the District Court to evaluate in the first instance any other asserted compelling interest, including whether such interest has been forfeited.\nFootnote 2\u00a0See also Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899, 911 (1996) (\"In Miller, we expressly left open the question whether under the proper circumstances compliance with the Voting Rights Act, on its own, could be a compelling [state] interest .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.

TYRRELL, SPECIAL ADMINISTRATOR FOR THE ESTATE OF TYRRELL, DECEASED, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-405\nArgued: April 25, 2017Decided: May 30, 2017\n\n\nThe Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a751 et\u00a0seq., makes railroads liable in money damages to their employees for on-the-job injuries.  Respondent Robert Nelson, a North Dakota resident, brought a FELA suit against petitioner BNSF Railway Company (BNSF) in a Montana state court, alleging that he had sustained injuries while working for BNSF.  Respondent Kelli Tyrrell, appointed in South Dakota as the administrator of her husband Brent Tyrrell's estate, also sued BNSF under FELA in a Montana state court, alleging that Brent had developed a fatal cancer from his exposure to carcinogenic chemicals while working for BNSF.  Neither worker was injured in Montana.  Neither incorporated nor headquartered there, BNSF maintains less than 5% of its work force and about 6% of its total track mileage in the State.  Contending that it is not \"at home\" in  Montana, as required for the exercise of general personal jurisdiction under Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, BNSF moved to dismiss both suits.  Its motion was granted in Nelson's case and denied in Tyrrell's.  After consolidating the two cases, the Montana Supreme Court held that Montana courts could exercise general personal jurisdiction over BNSF because the railroad both \"d[id] business\" in the State within the meaning of 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a756 and was \"found within\" the State within the compass of Mont. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(b)(1).  The due process limits articulated in Daimler, the court added, did not control because Daimler did not involve a FELA claim or a railroad defendant.  \nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Section 56 does not address personal jurisdiction over railroads.

Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Kepner, 314 U.\u00a0S. 44, 52.  Congress generally uses the expression, where suit \"may be brought,\" to indicate the federal districts in which venue is proper, see, e.g., 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(b), while it typically provides for the exercise of personal jurisdiction by authorizing service of process, see, e.g., 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a722.  Nelson and Tyrrell contend that the 1888 Judiciary Act provision that prompted \u00a756's enactment concerned both personal jurisdiction and venue, but this Court has long read that Judiciary Act provision to concern venue only, see, e.g., Green v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 205 U.\u00a0S. 530, 532-533.  Pp.\u00a05-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The second relevant sentence of \u00a756--that \"[t]he jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States\"--refers to concurrent subject-matter jurisdiction of state and federal courts over FELA actions.  See Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U.\u00a0S. 1, 55-56.  Congress added this clarification after the Connecticut Supreme Court held that Congress intended to confine FELA litigation to federal courts, and that state courts had no obligation to entertain FELA claims.

Pope v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 345 U.\u00a0S. 379; Miles v. Illinois Central R. Co., 315 U.\u00a0S. 698; Kepner, 314 U.\u00a0S. 44; and Denver & Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Terte, 284 U.\u00a0S. 284, distinguished.  Moreover, all these cases, save Pope, were decided before this Court's transformative decision on personal jurisdiction in International Shoe Co. v.

Pp.\u00a08-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The Montana courts' exercise of personal jurisdiction under Montana law does not comport with the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  Only the propriety of general personal jurisdiction is at issue here because neither Nelson nor Tyrrell alleges injury from work in or related to Montana.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A state court may exercise general jurisdiction over out-of-state corporations when their \"affiliations with the State are so 'continuous and systematic' as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.\"  Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___.

KELLI TYRRELL, special administrator for the ESTATE OF BRENT T. TYRRELL, DECEASED, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of montana\n[May 30, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The two cases we decide today arise under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 35 Stat. 65, as amended, 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a751 et\u00a0seq., which makes railroads liable in money damages to their employees for on-the-job injuries.  Both suits were pursued in Montana state courts although the injured workers did not reside in Montana, nor were they injured there.  The defendant railroad, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), although \"doing business\" in Montana when the litigation commenced, was not incorporated in Montana, nor did it maintain its principal place of business in that State.  To justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over BNSF, the Montana Supreme Court relied on \u00a756, which provides in relevant part:\n\"Under this chapter an action may be brought in a district court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.  The jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that \u00a756 does not address personal jurisdiction over railroads.  Its first relevant sentence is a venue prescription governing proper locations for FELA suits filed in federal court.  The provision's second relevant sentence, using the term \"concurrent\" jurisdiction, refers to subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction.  It simply clarifies that the federal courts do not have exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction over FELA suits; state courts can hear them, too.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Montana's Supreme Court, in the alternative, relied on state law, under which personal jurisdiction could be asserted over \"persons found within .\u00a0.\u00a0. Montana.\"  Mont. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(b)(1) (2015).  BNSF fit that bill, the court stated, because it has over 2,000 miles of railroad track and employs more than 2,000 workers in Montana.  Our precedent, however, explains that the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause does not permit a State to hale an out-of-state corporation before its courts when the corporation is not \"at home\" in the State and the episode-in-suit occurred elsewhere.  Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Montana Supreme Court.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In March 2011, respondent Robert Nelson, a North Dakota resident, brought a FELA suit against BNSF in a Montana state court to recover damages for knee injuries Nelson allegedly sustained while working for BNSF as a fuel-truck driver.  383 Mont. 417, 419, 373 P.\u00a03d 1, 3 (2016).  In May 2014, respondent Kelli Tyrrell, appointed in South Dakota as the administrator of her husband Brent Tyrrell's estate, similarly sued BNSF under FELA in a Montana state court.  Id., at 419-420, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 3.  Brent Tyrrell, his widow alleged, had developed a fatal kidney cancer from his exposure to carcinogenic chemicals while working for BNSF.  Id., at 420, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 3.  Neither plaintiff alleged injuries arising from or related to work performed in Montana; indeed, neither Nelson nor Brent Tyrrell appears ever to have worked for BNSF in Montana.  Id., at 419-420, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BNSF is incorporated in Delaware and has its principal place of business in Texas.  Id., at 419, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 3. It operates railroad lines in 28 States.  No. DV 14-699 (13th Jud. Dist., Yellowstone Cty., Mont., Oct. 7, 2014), App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a.  BNSF has 2,061 miles of railroad track in Montana (about 6% of its total track mileage of 32,500), employs some 2,100 workers there (less than 5% of its total work force of 43,000), generates less than 10% of its total revenue in the State, and maintains only one of its 24 automotive facilities in Montana (4%).  Ibid.  Contending that it is not \"at home\" in Montana, as required for the exercise of general personal jurisdiction under Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted), BNSF moved to dismiss both suits for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Its motion was granted in Nelson's case and denied in Tyrrell's.  383 Mont., at 419, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After consolidating the two cases, the Montana Supreme Court held that Montana courts could exercise general personal jurisdiction over BNSF.  Id., at 429, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 9.  Section 56, the court determined, authorizes state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over railroads \"doing business\" in the State.  Id., at 426, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In addition, the court observed, Montana law provides for the exercise of general jurisdiction over \"[a]ll persons found within\" the State.  Id., at 427, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 8 (quoting Mont. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(b)(1) (2015)).  In view of the railroad's many employees and miles of track in Montana, the court concluded, BNSF is both \"doing business\" and \"found within\" the State, such that both FELA and Montana law authorized the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  383 Mont., at 426, 428, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 7-8 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The due process limits articulated in Daimler, the court added, did not control, because Daimler did not involve a FELA claim or a railroad defendant.  383 Mont., at 424, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice McKinnon dissented.  Section 56, she wrote, is a federal-court venue prescription, and also confers subject-matter jurisdiction on state courts in FELA cases, concurrent with federal courts.  Id., at 435-437, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 13. But \u00a756, she maintained, does not touch or concern personal jurisdiction.  Ibid.  Furthermore, she concluded, Daimler controls, rendering the Montana courts' exercise of personal jurisdiction impermissible because BNSF is not \"at home\" in Montana.  383 Mont., at 433-434, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 11-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), to resolve whether \u00a756 authorizes state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over railroads doing business in their States but not incorporated or headquartered there, and whether the Montana courts' exercise of personal jurisdiction in these cases comports with due process.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nelson and Tyrrell contend that \u00a756's first relevant sentence confers personal jurisdiction on federal courts, and that the section's second relevant sentence extends that grant of jurisdiction to state courts.  Neither contention  is tenable.  Section 56's first relevant sentence concerns venue; its next sentence speaks to subject-matter jurisdiction.1\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first sentence of \u00a756 states that \"an action may be brought in a district court of the United States,\" in, among other places, the district \"in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.\"  In Baltimore & Ohio R. Co. v. Kepner, 314 U.\u00a0S. 44 (1941), we comprehended this clause as \"establish[ing] venue\" for a federal-court action.  Id., at 52.  Congress, we explained, designed \u00a756 to expand venue beyond the limits of the 1888 Judiciary Act's general venue provision, which allowed suit only \"in districts of which the defendant was an inhabitant.\"  Id., at 49; see Act of Aug. 13, 1888, \u00a71, 25 Stat. 434.  Nowhere in Kepner or in any other decision did we intimate that \u00a756 might affect personal jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress generally uses the expression, where suit \"may be brought,\" to indicate the federal districts in which venue is proper.  See, e.g., 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(b) (general venue statute specifying where \"[a] civil action may be brought\"); J. Oakley, ALI, Fed. Judicial Code Rev. Project 253-290 (2004) (listing special venue statutes, many with similar language).  See also Kepner, 314 U.\u00a0S., at 56 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (\"The phrasing of [\u00a756] follows the familiar pattern generally employed by Congress in framing venue provisions.\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In contrast, Congress' typical mode of providing for the exercise of personal jurisdiction has been to authorize service of process.  See, e.g., 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a722 (Clayton Act provision stating that \"all process in [cases against a corporation arising under federal antitrust laws] may be served in the district of which [the defendant] is an inhabitant, or wherever [the defendant] may be found\"); \u00a753(a) (under Federal Trade Commission Act, \"process may be served on any person, partnership, or corporation wherever it may be found\").  See also Omni Capital Int'l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.\u00a0S. 97, 106-107 (1987) (discussing statutes that authorize (or fail to authorize) nationwide service of process).  But cf. Schlanger v. Seamans, 401 U.\u00a0S. 487, 490, n.\u00a04 (1971) (though \"Congress has provided for nationwide service of process\" in 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(e) (1964 ed., Supp. V), that statute was meant to expand venue, not personal jurisdiction).  Congress uses this terminology because, absent consent, a basis for service of a summons on the defendant is prerequisite to the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  See Omni Capital, 484 U.\u00a0S., at 104.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nelson and Tyrrell, however, argue that \u00a756 relates to personal jurisdiction.  In their view, the 1888 Judiciary Act provision that prompted \u00a756's enactment, 25 Stat. 434, concerned both personal jurisdiction and venue.  According to House and Senate Reports, they contend, two cases had brought to Congress' attention the problem with the prior provision--namely, that in federal-question cases it authorized suit only in the district of the defendant's residence.  Brief for Respondents 16-18.  See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 513, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., 6 (1910) (citing Macon Grocery Co. v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 215 U.\u00a0S. 501 (1910); Cound v. Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co., 173 F. 527 (WD Tex. 1909)); S.\u00a0Rep. No. 432, 61st Cong., 2d Sess.,\u00a04 (1910) (same).  In both cases, the courts had dismissed FELA suits for \"want of jurisdiction.\"  Macon Grocery, 215 U.\u00a0S., at 510; Cound, 173 F., at 534.  To avert such jurisdictional dismissals, they urge, Congress enacted \u00a756.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Legislative history \"throws little light\" here.  Kepner, 314 U.\u00a0S., at 50.2  Driving today's decision, we have long read the 1888 Judiciary Act provision to concern venue only.  See Green v. Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co., 205 U.\u00a0S. 530, 532-533 (1907) (analyzing personal jurisdiction separately, after concluding that venue was proper under 1888 Judiciary Act provision).  See also Lee v. Chesapeake & Ohio R. Co., 260 U.\u00a0S. 653, 655 (1923) (noting that materially identical successor to 1888 Judiciary Act provision, Act of Mar. 3, 1911, \u00a751, 36 Stat. 1101, \"relates to the venue of suits\").  Indeed, reading the 1888 Judiciary Act provision to authorize the exercise of personal jurisdiction would have yielded an anomalous result: In diversity cases, the provision allowed for suit \"in the district of the residence of either the plaintiff or the defendant.\"  25 Stat. 434.  Interpreting that clause to provide for jurisdiction would have allowed a plaintiff to hale a defendant into court  in the plaintiff's home district, even if the district was  one with which the defendant had no affiliation, and the episode-in-suit, no connection.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second \u00a756 sentence in point provides that \"[t]he jurisdiction of the courts of the United States under this chapter shall be concurrent with that of the courts of the several States.\"  Nelson and Tyrrell argue that this sentence extends to state courts the first sentence's alleged conferral of personal jurisdiction on federal courts.  But, as just discussed, the first sentence concerns federal-court venue and confers no personal jurisdiction on any court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have understood \u00a756's second sentence to provide for the concurrent subject-matter jurisdiction of state and federal courts over actions under FELA.  See Second Employers' Liability Cases, 223 U.\u00a0S. 1, 55-56 (1912).  As Nelson and Tyrrell acknowledge, Congress added the provision to confirm concurrent subject-matter jurisdiction after the Connecticut Supreme Court held that Congress intended to confine FELA litigation to federal courts, and that state courts had no obligation to entertain FELA claims.  See Brief for Respondents 23 (citing Hoxie v. New York, N.\u00a0H. & H.\u00a0R. Co., 82 Conn. 352, 73 A. 754 (1909)).  As Justice McKinnon recognized in her dissent from the Montana Supreme Court's decision in Nelson's and Tyrrell's cases, \"[t]he phrase 'concurrent jurisdiction' is a well-known term of art long employed by Congress and courts to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction.\"  383 Mont., at 436, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 13.  See, e.g., Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.\u00a0S. 368, 372 (2012) (\"federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over private suits arising under the [Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, 47 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7227]\"); Claflin v. Houseman, 93 U.\u00a0S. 130, 133-134 (1876) (State courts retain \"concurrent jurisdiction\" over \"suits in which a bankrupt\" party is involved, notwithstanding exclusive federal jurisdiction over bankruptcy matters).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pointing to a quartet of cases, the Montana Supreme Court observed that this Court \"consistently has interpreted [\u00a7]56 to allow state courts to hear cases brought under FELA even where the only basis for jurisdiction is the railroad doing business in the forum [S]tate.\"  383 Mont., at 421-423, 425-426, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 4-7 (citing Pope v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 345 U.\u00a0S. 379 (1953); Miles v. Illinois Central R. Co., 315 U.\u00a0S. 698 (1942); Kepner, 314 U.\u00a0S. 44; Denver & Rio Grande Western R. Co. v. Terte, 284 U.\u00a0S. 284 (1932)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of the decisions featured by the Montana Supreme Court resolved a question of personal jurisdiction.  Terte held that a FELA plaintiff, injured in Colorado, could bring suit in Missouri state court against a railroad incorporated elsewhere.  284 U.\u00a0S., at 286-287.  The dispute, however, was over the Dormant Commerce Clause, not personal jurisdiction; the railroad defendants argued that the suit would unduly burden interstate commerce, and the decision rested on two Commerce Clause decisions, Michigan Central R. Co. v. Mix, 278 U.\u00a0S. 492 (1929), and Hoffman v. Missouri ex rel. Foraker, 274 U.\u00a0S. 21 (1927), not on an interpretation of \u00a756.  See Terte, 284 U.\u00a0S., at 285, 287.  In Kepner and Miles, this Court held that a state court may not, based on inconvenience to a railroad defendant, enjoin its residents from bringing a FELA suit in another State's federal (Kepner) or state (Miles) courts.  Kepner, 314 U.\u00a0S., at 54; Miles, 315 U.\u00a0S., at 699-700, 704.  Pope held that 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71404(a)'s provision for transfer from one federal court to another did not bear on the question decided in Miles: A state court still could not enjoin a FELA action brought in another State's courts.  345 U.\u00a0S., at 383-384.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, all these cases, save Pope, were decided before this Court's transformative decision on personal jurisdiction in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.\u00a0S. 310 (1945).  See Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a018 (slip op., at 20, n.\u00a018) (cautioning against reliance on cases \"decided in the era dominated by\" the \"territorial thinking\" of Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.\u00a0S. 714 (1878)).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because FELA does not authorize state courts to exercise personal jurisdiction over a railroad solely on the ground that the railroad does some business in their States, the Montana courts' assertion of personal jurisdiction over BNSF here must rest on Mont. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(b)(1), the State's provision for the exercise of personal jurisdiction over \"persons found\" in Montana.  See supra, at 2-3.  BNSF does not contest that it is \"found within\" Montana as the State's courts comprehend that rule.  We therefore inquire whether the Montana courts' exercise of personal jurisdiction under Montana law comports with the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In International Shoe, this Court explained that a state court may exercise personal jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant who has \"certain minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\u00a0\"  326 U.\u00a0S., at 316.  Elaborating on this guide, we have distinguished between specific or case-linked jurisdiction and general or all-purpose jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\u00a0A. v. Brown, 564 U.\u00a0S. 915, 919 (2011); Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\u00a0A. v. Hall, 466 U.\u00a0S. 408, 414, nn.\u00a08, 9 (1984).  Because neither Nelson nor Tyrrell alleges any injury from work in or related to Montana, only the propriety of general jurisdiction is at issue here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Goodyear and Daimler clarified that \"[a] court may assert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or foreign-country) corporations to hear any and all claims against them when their affiliations with the State are so 'continuous and systematic' as to render them essentially at home in the forum State.\"  Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (quoting Goodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 919).  The \"paradigm\" forums in which a corporate defendant is \"at home,\" we explained, are the corporation's place of incorporation and its principal place of business.  Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18-19); Goodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 924.  The exercise of general jurisdiction is not limited to these forums; in an \"exceptional case,\" a corporate defendant's operations in another forum \"may be so substantial and of such a nature as to render the corporation at home in that State.\"  Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a019 (slip op., at 20, n.\u00a019).  We suggested that Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.\u00a0S. 437 (1952), exemplified such a case.  Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a019 (slip op., at 20, n.\u00a019).  In Perkins, war had forced the defendant corporation's owner to temporarily relocate the enterprise from the Philippines to Ohio.  342 U.\u00a0S., at 447-448.  Because Ohio then became \"the center of the corporation's wartime activities,\" Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a08 (slip op., at 12, n.\u00a08), suit was proper there, Perkins, 342 U.\u00a0S., at 448.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Montana Supreme Court distinguished Daimler on the ground that we did not there confront \"a FELA claim or a railroad defendant.\"  383 Mont., at 424, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 6.  The Fourteenth Amendment due process constraint described in Daimler, however, applies to all state-court assertions of general jurisdiction over nonresident defendants; the constraint does not vary with the type of claim asserted or business enterprise sued.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BNSF, we repeat, is not incorporated in Montana and does not maintain its principal place of business there.  Nor is BNSF so heavily engaged in activity in Montana \"as to render [it] essentially at home\" in that State.  See Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).  As earlier noted, BNSF has over 2,000 miles of railroad track and more than 2,000 employees in Montana.  But, as we observed in Daimler, \"the general jurisdiction inquiry does not focus solely on the magnitude of the defendant's in-state contacts.\"  Id., at ___, n.\u00a020 (slip op., at 21, n.\u00a020) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  Rather, the inquiry \"calls for an appraisal of a corporation's activities in their entirety\"; \"[a] corporation that operates in many places can scarcely be deemed at home in all of them.\"  Ibid.  In short, the business BNSF does in Montana is sufficient to subject the railroad to specific personal jurisdiction in that State on claims related to the business it does in Montana.  But in-state business, we clarified in Daimler and Goodyear, does not suffice to permit the assertion of general jurisdiction over claims like Nelson's and Tyrrell's that are unrelated to any activity occurring in Montana.4\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nelson and Tyrrell present a further argument--that BNSF has consented to personal jurisdiction in Montana.  See Brief for Respondents 50-51. The Montana Supreme Court did not address this contention, see 383 Mont., at 429, n.\u00a03, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 9, n.\u00a03, so we do not reach it.  See Cutter v.

I also agree that the Montana Supreme Court erred when it concluded that the nature of the claim here--a FELA claim against a railroad--answers the question whether the Due Process Clause allows the exercise of personal jurisdiction over BNSF.  But my agreement with the majority ends there.  I continue to disagree with the path the Court struck in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), which limits general jurisdiction over a corporate defendant only to those States where it is \"\u00a0'essentially at home,'\u00a0\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  And even if the Court insists on adhering to that standard, I dissent from its decision to apply it here in the first instance rather than remanding to the Montana Supreme Court for it to conduct what should be a fact-intensive analysis under the proper legal framework.  Accordingly, I join Parts I and II of the Court's opinion, but dissent from Part III and the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court would do well to adhere more faithfully to the direction from International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.\u00a0S. 310 (1945), which instructed that general jurisdiction is proper when a corporation's \"continuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\"  Id., at 318.  Under International Shoe, in other words, courts were to ask whether the benefits a defendant attained in the forum State warranted the burdens associated with general personal jurisdiction.  See id., at 317-318.  The majority itself acknowledges that International Shoe should govern, describing the question as whether a defendant's affiliations with a State are sufficiently \"\u00a0'continuous and systematic'\u00a0\" to warrant the exercise of general jurisdiction there.  Ante, at 10.  If only its analysis today reflected that directive.  Instead, the majority opinion goes on to reaffirm the restrictive \"at home\" test set out in Daimler--a test that, as I have explained, has no home in our precedents and creates serious inequities. See 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8-19).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's approach grants a jurisdictional windfall to large multistate or multinational corporations that operate across many jurisdictions.  Under its reasoning, it is virtually inconceivable that such corporations will ever be subject to general jurisdiction in any location other than their principal places of business or of incorporation.  Foreign businesses with principal places of business outside the United States may never be subject to general jurisdiction in this country even though they have continuous and systematic contacts within the United States.  See id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 17-18).  What was once a holistic, nuanced contacts analysis backed by considerations of fairness and reasonableness has now effectively been replaced by the rote identification of a corporation's principal place of business or place of incorporation.1  The result?  It is individual plaintiffs, harmed by the actions of a farflung foreign corporation, who will bear the brunt of the majority's approach and be forced to sue in distant jurisdictions with which they have no contacts or connection.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the comparative contacts analysis invented in Daimler resurfaces here and proves all but dispositive. The majority makes much of the fact that BNSF's contacts in Montana are only a percentage of its contacts with other jurisdictions.  Ante, at 3, 11. But International Shoe, which the majority agrees is the springboard for our modern personal jurisdiction jurisprudence, ante, at 9, applied no comparative contacts test.  There the Court analyzed whether the Delaware corporation had \"by its activities in the State of Washington rendered itself amenable to proceedings\" in the State.  326 U.\u00a0S., at 311.  The Court evaluated whether the corporation had offices in the forum State, made contracts there, delivered goods there, or employed salesmen there.  See id., at 313.  Despite acknowledging that the corporation maintained places of business in several States, ibid., the Court did not engage in a comparison between International Shoe's contacts within the State of Washington and the other States in which it operated.2  The Court noted that the corporation employed 11 to 13 salesmen in Washington but did not query how that number compared to the number of salesmen in other States.  Ibid.  As well it should not have; the relative percentage of contacts is irrelevant.  The focus should be on the quality and quantity of the defendant's contacts in the forum State.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority does even Daimler itself a disservice, paying only lipservice to the question the Court purported to reserve there--the possibility of an \"exceptional case\" in which general jurisdiction would be proper in a forum State that is neither a corporate defendant's place of incorporation nor its principal place of business.  See 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n. 19 (slip op., at 20, n.\u00a019).  Its opinion here could be understood to limit that exception to the exact facts of Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.\u00a0S. 437 (1952).  See ante, at 10-11.  That reading is so narrow as to read the exception out of existence entirely; certainly a defendant with significant contacts with more than one State falls outside its ambit.  And so it is inevitable under its own reasoning that the majority would conclude that BNSF's contacts with Montana are insufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction here.  This result is perverse.  Despite having reserved the possibility of an \"exceptional case\" in Daimler, the majority here has rejected that possibility out of hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worse, the majority reaches its conclusion only by departing from the Court's normal practice.4  Had it remanded to the Montana Supreme Court to reevaluate the due process question under the correct legal standard, that court could have examined whether this is such an \"exceptional case.\"  Instead, with its ruling today, the Court unnecessarily sends a signal to the lower courts that the exceptional-circumstances inquiry is all form, no substance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Section 56's first sentence, which provides a time bar for FELA claims, is not relevant to the issue at hand.  For ease of reference, we hereinafter refer to the first relevant sentence, describing where suit \"may be brought,\" as the provision's \"first\" sentence, and the sentence that immediately follows, referring to \"concurrent\" jurisdiction, as the \"second.\"\nFootnote 2\u00a0We note, moreover, that Nelson and Tyrrell overlooked the Senate Report's explicit reference to the first sentence of \u00a756 as a venue provision, with no mention of personal jurisdiction.  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 432, 61st Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1910).\nFootnote 3\u00a0The Montana Supreme Court also erred in asserting that \"Congress drafted the FELA to make a railroad 'at home' for jurisdictional purposes wherever it is 'doing business.'\u00a0\"  383 Mont. 417, 425, 373 P.\u00a03d 1, 6 (2016).  As discussed, supra, at 5-7, in \u00a756's first sentence, Congress dealt with venue only, not personal jurisdiction.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, dissenting in part, renews a debate comprehensively aired in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).  There, as again here, Justice Sotomayor treats the assertion of jurisdiction by the State of Washington courts in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.\u00a0S. 310 (1945), as an exercise of general, dispute-blind, jurisdiction, post, at 3, thereby overlooking the fundamental difference between International Shoe and these cases.  In International Shoe, the defendant corporation's in-state activities had \"not only been continuous and systematic, but also g[a]ve rise to the liabilities sued on.\"  326 U.\u00a0S., at 317.  The state courts there asserted jurisdiction not over claims that had nothing to do with the State; instead, they exercised adjudicatory authority to hold the defendant corporation accountable for activity pursued within the State of Washington.  Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___, n.\u00a010 (slip op., at 7, 14, n.\u00a010).  This Court, therefore, had no occasion in International Shoe to \"engage in a comparison between International Shoe's contacts within the State of Washington and the other States in which it operated.\"  Post, at 3.  In marked contrast to International Shoe, Nelson's and Tyrrell's claims have no relationship to anything that occurred or had its principal impact in Montana.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's opinion is not limited to \u00a756 because the Montana Supreme Court went on to address and decide the question: Do \"Montana courts have personal jurisdiction over BNSF under Montana law?\"  383 Mont., at 426, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 7.  See also id., at 429, 373 P.\u00a03d, at 9 (\"Under Montana law, Montana courts have general personal jurisdiction over BNSF.\").\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0As many commentators have observed, lower courts adhered to the continuous-and-systematic standard for decades before Daimler, and its predecessor Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\u00a0A. v. Brown, 564 U.\u00a0S. 915 (2011), wrought the present sea change.  See, e.g., Cornett & Hoffheimer, Good-Bye Significant Contacts: General Personal Jurisdiction after Daimler AG v. Bauman, 76 Ohio St. L.\u00a0J. 101 (2015); Parry, Rethinking Personal Jurisdiction after Bauman and Walden, 19 Lewis & Clark L.\u00a0Rev. 607 (2015); Doernberg, Resoling International Shoe, 2 Tex. A&M L.\u00a0Rev. 247 (2014); Feder, Goodyear, \"Home,\" and the Uncertain Future of Doing Business Jurisdiction, 63 S. C. L. Rev. 671 (2012).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The majority responds that the language from International Shoe informs only a specific jurisdiction case.  Ante, at 12, n.\u00a04.  But the majority's view of International Shoe is overly restrictive.  The terms \"specific jurisdiction\" and \"general jurisdiction\" are nowhere to be found in that opinion.  And I continue to believe, as I noted in Daimler, that there is no material difference between the \"continuous and systematic\" terminology International Shoe used for what we now call specific jurisdiction and the \"continuous\" and \"substantial\" terminology it used for what we now call general jurisdiction.  See Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n. 6 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8, n. 6).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Indeed, in neither Perkins v. Benguet Consol. Mining Co., 342 U.\u00a0S. 437 (1952), nor Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\u00a0A. v. Hall, 466 U.\u00a0S. 408 (1984), did the Court engage in a comparative-contacts analysis.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The Montana Supreme Court reached this question only by wrongly assuming that 45 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a756 is a jurisdictional statute and that a defendant's unique status as a railroad company is dispositive of the jurisdictional question.  A remand rather than an outright reversal is this Court's traditional practice where a lower court applies the incorrect legal standard; we have done it repeatedly just this Term.  See, e.g., Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017); Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int'l Drilling Co., ante, p. ___; McLane Co. v. EEOC, ante, p. ___; Moore v. Texas, ante, p. ___.\n\n\n","8":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBOLIVARIAN REPUBLIC OF VENEZUELA ET AL. v. HELMERICH &AMP; PAYNE INTERNATIONAL DRILLING CO. ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-423\nArgued: November 2, 2016Decided: May 1, 2017\n\n\nThe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) shields foreign states from suits in United States Courts, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71604, with specified exceptions.  The expropriation exception applies to \"any case .\u00a0.\u00a0. in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property .\u00a0.\u00a0. is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state .\u00a0.\u00a0. engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.\"  \u00a71605(a)(3).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A wholly owned Venezuelan subsidiary (Subsidiary) of an American company (Parent) has long supplied oil rigs to oil development entities that were part of the Venezuelan Government.  The American Parent and its Venezuelan Subsidiary (plaintiffs) filed suit in federal court against those entities (Venezuela), claiming that Venezuela had unlawfully expropriated the Subsidiary's rigs by nationalizing them.  Venezuela moved to dismiss the case on the ground that its sovereign immunity deprived the District Court of jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs argued that the case falls within the expropriation exception, but Venezuela claimed that international law did not cover the expropriation of property belonging to a country's nationals like the Subsidiary and that the American Parent did not have property rights in the Subsidiary's assets.  The District Court agreed as to the Subsidiary, dismissing its claim on jurisdictional grounds.  But it rejected the claim that the Parent had no rights in the Subsidiary's property.  The District of Columbia Circuit reversed in part and affirmed in part, finding that both claims fell within the exception.  With respect to the Subsidiary's claim, it concluded that a sovereign's taking of its own nationals' property would violate international law if the expropriation unreasonably discriminated based on a company's shareholders' nationality.  With respect to the Parent's claim, it held that the exception applied because the Parent had raised its rights in a nonfrivolous way.  The court decided only whether the plaintiffs might have a nonfrivolous expropriation claim, making clear that, under its standard, a nonfrivolous argument would be sufficient to bring a case within the scope of the exception.  Given the factual stipulations, the court concluded, the Subsidiary had satisfied that standard for purposes of surviving a motion to dismiss.  \nHeld:\u00a0The nonfrivolous-argument standard is not consistent with the FSIA.  A case falls within the scope of the expropriation exception only if the property in which the party claims to hold rights was indeed \"property taken in violation of international law.\"  A court should decide the foreign sovereign's immunity defense \"[a]t the threshold\" of the action, Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.\u00a0S. 480, 493, resolving any factual disputes as near to the outset of the case as is reasonably possible.  Pp.\u00a06-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The expropriation exception grants jurisdiction only where there is a legally valid claim that a certain kind of right is at issue (property rights) and that the relevant property was taken in a certain way (in violation of international law).  Simply making a nonfrivolous argument to that effect is not sufficient.  This reading is supported by the provision's language, which applies in a \"case.\u00a0.\u00a0. in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue.\"  Such language would normally foresee a judicial decision about the jurisdictional matter.  This interpretation is supported by precedent.  See, e.g., Permanent Mission of India to United Nations v. City of New York, 551 U.\u00a0S. 193, 201-202.  It is also supported by a basic objective of the FSIA, which is to follow international law principles, namely, that granting foreign sovereigns immunity from suit both recognizes the \"absolute independence of every sovereign authority\" and helps to \"induc[e]\" each nation state, as a matter of \"international comity,\" to \"respect the independence and dignity of every other,\" Berizzi Brothers Co. v. S. S. Pesaro, 271 U.\u00a0S. 562, 575.  Nothing in the FSIA's history suggests that Congress intended a radical departure from these principles in codifying the mid-20th-century doctrine of \"restrictive\" sovereign immunity, which denies immunity in cases \"arising out of a foreign state's strictly commercial acts,\" but applies immunity in \"suits involving the foreign sovereign's public acts,\" Verlinden, supra, at 487.  It is thus not surprising that the expropriation exception on its face emphasizes conformity with international law, requiring both a commercial connection with the United States and a taking of property \"in violation of international law.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A \"nonfrivolous-argument\" reading of the exception would undermine the objectives embedded in the statute's language, history, and structure.  It could also embroil a foreign sovereign in an American lawsuit for some time by adopting a standard limited only by the bounds of a lawyer's (nonfrivolous) imagination.  And it could cause friction with other nations, leading to reciprocal actions against this country.  Pp.\u00a06-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Plaintiffs' arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  They suggest that the expropriation exception should be treated similarly to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331's \"arising under\" jurisdiction, which applies if a plaintiff can make a nonfrivolous argument that a federal law provides the relief sought--even if, in fact, it does not, Bell v. Hood, 327 U.\u00a0S. 678 685.  But \u00a71331 differs from the exception in language and concerns.  Section 1331 often simply determines which court doors--federal or state--are open, and neither it nor related jurisdictional sections seek to provide a sovereign foreign nation with immunity--the FSIA's basic objective.  Nor does the text of \u00a71331 suggest that consistency with international law is of particular importance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiffs also claim that the nonfrivolous-argument approach will work little harm since the matter could be resolved by motion practice before the sovereign bears the expense of a full trial.  But resolving a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) or summary judgment under Rule 56 may impose increased burdens of time and expense upon the foreign nation.  And a district court's decision that there is a \"violation of international law\" as a matter of jurisdiction may be immediately appealable as a collateral order, while the same decision made pursuant to a Rule 12(b)(6) or Rule 56 motion would be a decision on the \"merits\" not subject to immediate appeal.  Moreover, the Circuit would part with its nonfrivolous-argument standard where a \"violation of international law\" is not an element of the claim to be decided on the merits.  This bifurcated approach is difficult to reconcile with the statute's language, history, or purpose; and it creates needless complexity for judges and lawyers, domestic and foreign.

One of the jurisdictional exceptions--the expropriation exception--says that\n\"[a] foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States in any case .\u00a0.\u00a0. (3) in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue and that property .\u00a0.\u00a0. is owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state .\u00a0.\u00a0. engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.\"  \u00a71605(a)(3).\nThe question here concerns the phrase \"case .\u00a0.\u00a0. in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does this phrase mean that, to defeat sovereign immunity, a party need only make a \"nonfrivolous\" argument that the case falls within the scope of the exception?  Once made, does the existence of that nonfrivolous argument mean that the court retains jurisdiction over the case until the court decides, say, the merits of the case?  Or does a more rigorous jurisdictional standard apply?  To put the question more generally: What happens in a case where the party seeking to rely on the expropriation exception makes a nonfrivolous, but ultimately incorrect, claim that his property was taken in violation of international law?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, a party's nonfrivolous, but ultimately incorrect, argument that property was taken in violation of international law is insufficient to confer jurisdiction.  Rather, state and federal courts can maintain jurisdiction to hear the merits of a case only if they find that the property in which the party claims to hold rights was indeed \"property taken in violation of international law.\"  Put differently, the relevant factual allegations must make out a legally valid claim that a certain kind of right is at issue (property rights) and that the relevant property was taken in a certain way (in violation of international law).  A good argument to that effect is not sufficient.  But a court normally need not resolve, as a jurisdictional matter, disputes about whether a party actually held rights in that property; those questions remain for the merits phase of the litigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, where jurisdictional questions turn upon further factual development, the trial judge may take evidence and resolve relevant factual disputes.  But, consistent with foreign sovereign immunity's basic objective, namely, to free a foreign sovereign from suit, the court should normally resolve those factual disputes and reach a decision about immunity as near to the outset of the case as is reasonably possible.  See Verlinden B. V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.\u00a0S. 480, 493-494 (1983).\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the mid-1970's a wholly owned Venezuela-incorporated subsidiary (Subsidiary) of an American company (Parent) supplied oil rigs to oil development entities that were part of the Venezuelan Government.  In 2011 the American Parent company and its Venezuelan Subsidiary (the respondents here) brought this lawsuit in federal court against those foreign government entities. (The entities go by their initials, PDVSA, but we shall normally refer to them as \"Venezuela\" or the \"Venezuelan Government.\")  The American Parent and the Venezuelan Subsidiary claimed that the Venezuelan Government had unlawfully expropriated the Subsidiary's oil rigs.  And they sought compensation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to stipulated facts, by early 2010 the Venezuelan Government had failed to pay more than $10 million that it owed the Subsidiary.  At that point the government sent troops to the equipment yard where the rigs were stored, prevented the Subsidiary from removing the rigs, and issued a \"\u00a0'Decree of Expropriation'\u00a0\" nationalizing the rigs.  App. 72-74.  Subsequently, the president of the oil development entities led a rally at the Subsidiary's offices, where he referred to the Venezuelan Subsidiary as an \"\u00a0'American company'\u00a0\" with \"\u00a0'foreign gentlemen investors.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 54.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Venezuela asked the court to dismiss the case on the ground that Venezuela possessed sovereign immunity and that the court consequently lacked \"jurisdiction\" to hear the case.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71604; Fed. Rules Civ. Proc. 12(b)(1) and (b)(2); Verlinden, supra, at 485, n.\u00a05 (explaining that a court lacks \"subject-matter\" and \"personal\" jurisdiction over a foreign sovereign unless an FSIA exception applies).  The companies replied that the case falls within the expropriation exception.  Venezuela in turn argued that the Subsidiary's expropriation claim did not satisfy the exception because \"\u00a0'international law does not cover expropriations of property belonging to a country's own nationals'\u00a0\"; the taking was not \"\u00a0'in violation of international law,'\u00a0\" and the exception thus does not apply.  Record in No. 11-cv-01735 (D DC), Doc. 22, p. 13.  Venezuela further argued that the American Parent's nationality makes no difference because, \"as a corporate parent, [it] does not own [the Subsidiary's] assets.\"  Id., Doc. 24, at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties agreed that the District Court should then decide whether the exception applies, and it should do so on the basis of governing law, taking all of the plaintiffs' well-pleaded allegations as true and construing the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.  App. 119.  The court decided, in relevant part, that the exception did not apply to the Venezuelan Subsidiary's claim because the Subsidiary was a national of Venezuela.  See 971 F. Supp. 2d 49, 57-61 (2013).  The court concluded that Venezuela consequently possessed sovereign immunity, and it dismissed the Subsidiary's claim on jurisdictional grounds.  It rejected, however, Venezuela's argument that the Parent had no rights in property in the Subsidiary.  It concluded that Venezuela's \"actions have deprived [the Parent], individually, of its essential and unique rights as sole shareholder .\u00a0.\u00a0. by dismantling its voting power, destroying its ownership, and frustrating its control over the company.\"  Id., at 73.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Venezuelan Subsidiary appealed the dismissal of its expropriation claim, and Venezuela appealed the court's refusal to dismiss the Parent's claim.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed in part and affirmed in part the District Court's conclusions.  It decided that both the Subsidiary's and the Parent's claims fell within the exception.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the Subsidiary's claim, the court agreed that a sovereign's taking of its own nationals' property normally does not violate international law.  But, the court said, there is an \"exception\" to this rule.  And that exception applies when a sovereign's expropriation unreasonably discriminates on the basis of a company's shareholders' nationality, 784 F.\u00a03d 804, 812 (CADC 2015) (citing Banco Nacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 307 F. 2d 845 (CA2 1962)).  That exception, it added, might apply here, in which case the expropriation would violate international law, the FSIA's expropriation exception would apply, and the federal courts would possess jurisdiction over the case.  784 F.\u00a03d, at 813.  With respect to the Parent's expropriation claim, the court agreed with the District Court that the expropriation exception applied because the Parent had \"\u00a0'put its rights in property in issue in a non-frivolous way.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 816.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For present purposes, it is important to keep in mind that the Court of Appeals did not decide (on the basis of the stipulated facts) that the plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to show their property was taken in violation of international law.  It decided instead that the plaintiffs might have such a claim.  And it made clear the legal standard that it would apply.  It said that, in deciding whether the expropriation exception applies, it would set an \"exceptionally low bar.\"  Id., at 812.  Any possible, i.e., \"\u00a0'non-frivolous,'\u00a0\" ibid., claim of expropriation is sufficient, in the Court of Appeals' view, to bring a case within the scope of the FSIA's exception.  In particular: If a plaintiff alleges facts and claims that permit the plaintiff to make an expropriation claim that is not \"\u00a0'wholly insubstantial or frivolous,'\u00a0\" then the exception permits the suit and the sovereign loses its immunity.  Ibid. (emphasis added).  Given the factual stipulations, the Court of Appeals did not suggest further factfinding on this jurisdictional issue but, rather, decided that the Subsidiary had \"satisfied this Circuit's forgiving standard for surviving a motion to dismiss in an FSIA case.\"  Id., at 813.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Venezuela filed a petition for certiorari asking us to decide whether the Court of Appeals had applied the correct standard in deciding that the companies had met the expropriation exception's requirements.  We agreed to do so.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Foreign sovereign immunity is jurisdictional in this case because explicit statutory language makes it so.  See \u00a71604 (\"[A] foreign state shall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the United States and of the States except as provided\" by the FSIA's exceptions); \u00a71605(a) (\"A foreign state shall not be immune from the jurisdiction\" of federal and state courts if the exception at issue here is satisfied).   Given the parties' stipulations as to all relevant facts, our inquiry poses a \"\u00a0'pure question of statutory construction,'\u00a0\" Republic of Austria v. Altmann, 541 U.\u00a0S. 677, 701 (2004).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, the expropriation exception grants jurisdiction only where there is a valid claim that \"property\" has been \"taken in violation of international law.\"  \u00a71605(a)(3).  A nonfrivolous argument to that effect is insufficient.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, the provision's language, while ambiguous, supports such a reading.  It says that there is jurisdiction in a \"case .\u00a0.\u00a0. in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue.\"  Ibid.  Such language would normally foresee a judicial decision about the jurisdictional matter.  And that matter is whether a certain kind of \"right\" is \"at issue,\" namely, a property right taken in violation of international law.  To take a purely hypothetical example, a party might assert a claim to a house in a foreign country.  If the foreign country nationalized the house and, when sued, asserted sovereign immunity, then the claiming party would as a jurisdictional matter prove that he claimed \"property\" (which a house obviously is) and also that the property was \"taken in violation of international law.\"  He need not show as a jurisdictional matter that he, rather than someone else, owned the house.  That question is part of the merits of the case and remains \"at issue.\"  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We recognize that merits and jurisdiction will sometimes come intertwined.  Suppose that the party asserted a claim to architectural plans for the house.  It might be necessary to decide whether the law recognizes the kind of right that he asserts, or whether it is a right in \"property\" that was \"taken in violation of international law.\"  Perhaps that is the only serious issue in the case.  If so, the court must still answer the jurisdictional question.  If to do so, it must inevitably decide some, or all, of the merits issues, so be it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our reading of the statute is consistent with its language.  The case is one which the existence of \"rights\" remains \"at issue\" until the court decides the merits of the case.  But whether the rights asserted are rights of a certain kind, namely, rights in \"property taken in violation of international law,\" is a jurisdictional matter that the court must typically decide at the outset of the case, or as close to the outset as is reasonably possible.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Precedent offers a degree of support for our interpretation.  In Permanent Mission of India to United Nations v. City of New York, 551 U.\u00a0S. 193 (2007), we interpreted a different FSIA exception for cases \"in which .\u00a0.\u00a0. rights in immovable property situated in the United States are in issue.\"  \u00a71605(a)(4).  We held that there was jurisdiction over the case because the plaintiff's lawsuit to enforce a tax lien \"directly implicate[d]\" the property rights described by the FSIA exception. See id., at 200-201.  We did not simply rely upon a finding that the plaintiff had made a nonfrivolous argument that the exception applied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For another thing, one of the FSIA's basic objectives, as shown by its history, supports this reading.  The Act for the most part embodies basic principles of international law long followed both in the United States and elsewhere. See Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 7 Cranch 116, 136-137 (1812); see also Verlinden, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 493 (explaining that the Act \"comprehensively regulat[es] the amenability of foreign nations to suit in the United States\").  Our courts have understood, as international law itself understands, foreign nation states to be \"independent sovereign\" entities.  To grant those sovereign entities an immunity from suit in our courts both recognizes the \"absolute independence of every sovereign authority\" and helps to \"\u00a0'induc[e]'\u00a0\" each nation state, as a matter of \"\u00a0'international comity,'\u00a0\" to \"\u00a0'respect the independence and dignity of every other,'\u00a0\" including our own.  Berizzi Brothers Co. v. S.\u00a0S. Pesaro, 271 U.\u00a0S. 562, 575 (1926) (quoting The Parlement Belge, [1880] 5 P. D. 197, 214-215 (appeal taken from Admiralty Div.)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the mid-20th century, we, like many other nations, began to treat nations acting in a commercial capacity like other commercial entities.  See Permanent Mission, supra, at 199-200.  And we consequently began to limit our recognition of sovereign immunity, denying that immunity in cases \"arising out of a foreign state's strictly commercial acts,\" but continuing to apply that doctrine in \"suits involving the foreign sovereign's public acts,\" Verlinden, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 487 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At first, our courts, aware of the expertise of the Executive Branch in matters of foreign affairs, relied heavily upon the advice of that branch when deciding just when and how this \"restrictive\" sovereign immunity doctrine applied.  Ibid.  See also H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 94-1487, pp. 8-9 (1976) (similar).  But in 1976, Congress, at the urging of the Department of State and Department of Justice, began to codify the doctrine.  The resulting statute, the FSIA, \"starts from a premise of immunity and then creates exceptions to the general principle.\"  Id., at 17; Verlinden, supra, at 493.  Almost all the exceptions involve commerce or immovable property located in the United States.  E.g., \u00a7\u00a71605(a)(2) and (4); see also \u00a71602 (expressing the finding that \"[u]nder international law, states are not immune from the jurisdiction of foreign courts insofar as their commercial activities are concerned\").  The statute thereby creates a doctrine that by and large continues to reflect basic principles of international law, in particular those principles embodied in what jurists refer to as the \"restrictive\" theory of sovereign immunity.  See, e.g., Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7451, and Comment a (1986) (describing the restrictive theory of immunity); United Nations General Assembly, Convention on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, Res. 59\/38, Arts. 5, 10-12 (Dec. 2, 2004) (adopting a restrictive theory of immunity and withdrawing immunity for loss of property where, among other requirements, \"the act or omission occurred in whole or in part in the territory of th[e] other State\"); United Nations General Assembly, Report of the Ad\u00a0Hoc Committee on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and Their Property, Supp. A\/59\/22 No. 1, pp.\u00a07-11 (Mar. 1-5, 2004) (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have found nothing in the history of the statute that suggests Congress intended a radical departure from these basic principles.  To the contrary, the State Department, which helped to draft the FSIA's language (and to whose views on sovereign immunity this Court, like Congress, has paid special attention, Altmann, 541 U.\u00a0S., at 696), told Congress that the Act was \"drafted keeping in mind what we believe to be the general state of the law internationally, so that we conform fairly closely .\u00a0.\u00a0. to our accepted international standards,\" Hearing on H.\u00a0R. 3493 before the Subcommittee on Claims and Governmental Relations of the House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary, 93d Cong., 1st Sess., 18 (1973).  The Department added that, by doing so, we would diminish the likelihood that other nations would each go their own way, thereby \"subject[ing]\" the United States \"abroad\" to more claims \"than we permit in this country .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  Ibid.  It is consequently not surprising to find that the expropriation exception on its face emphasizes conformity with international law by requiring not only a commercial connection with the United States but also a taking of property \"in violation of international law.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We emphasize this point, embedded in the statute's language, history, and structure, because doing so reveals a basic objective of our sovereign immunity doctrine, which a \"nonfrivolous-argument\" reading of the expropriation exception would undermine.  A sovereign's taking or regulating of its own nationals' property within its own territory is often just the kind of foreign sovereign's public act (a \"jure imperii\") that the restrictive theory of sovereign immunity ordinarily leaves immune from suit.  See Permanent Mission, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 199 (describing the FSIA's distinction between public acts, or jure imperii, and purely commercial ones); Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7712, at 196 (noting that, under international law, a state is responsible for a \"taking of the property of a national of another state\" (emphasis added)).  See also Restatement (Fourth) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \u00a7455, Reporter's Note 12, p. 9 (Tent. Draft No. 2, Mar. 22, 2016) (noting that \"[n]o provision comparable\" to the exception \"has yet been adopted in the domestic immunity statutes of other countries\" and that expropriations are considered acts jure imperii); United States v. Belmont, 301 U.\u00a0S. 324, 332 (1937); B. Cheng & G. Schwarzberger, General Principles of Law as Applied by International Courts and Tribunals 37-38 (1953) (collecting cases describing \"the power of the sovereign State to expropriate\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germany v. Italy), 2012 I. C. J. 99, 123-125, \u00b6\u00b656-60 (Judgt. of Feb. 3) (noting consistent state practice in respect to the distinction between public and commercial acts and describing an international law of immunity recognizing such a difference); Altmann, supra, at 708 (Breyer, J., concurring) (describing the French Court of Appeals' decision about whether a King who has abdicated the throne is \"\u00a0'entitled to claim .\u00a0.\u00a0. immunity'\u00a0\" as \"\u00a0'Hea[d] of State'\u00a0\" when his sovereign status at the time of suit was in doubt (quoting Ex-King Farouk of Egypt v. Christian Dior, 84 Clunet 717, 24 I. L. R. 228, 229 (CA Paris 1957))).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, there are fair arguments to be made that a sovereign's taking of its own nationals' property sometimes amounts to an expropriation that violates international law, and the expropriation exception provides that the general principle of immunity for these otherwise public acts should give way.  But such arguments are about whether such an expropriation does violate international law.  To find jurisdiction only where a taking does violate international law is thus consistent with basic international law and the related statutory objectives and principles that we have mentioned.  But to find jurisdiction where a taking does not violate international law (e.g., where there is a nonfrivolous but ultimately incorrect argument that the taking violates international law) is inconsistent with those objectives.  And it is difficult to understand why Congress would have wanted that result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the \"nonfrivolous-argument\" interpretation would, in many cases, embroil the foreign sovereign in an American lawsuit for an increased period of time.  It would substitute for a more workable standard (\"violation of international law\") a standard limited only by the bounds of a lawyer's (nonfrivolous) imagination.  It would create increased complexity in respect to a jurisdictional matter where clarity is particularly important.  Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.\u00a0S. 77, 94-95 (2010).  And clarity is doubly important here where foreign nations and foreign lawyers must understand our law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Solicitor General and the Department of State also warn us that the nonfrivolous-argument interpretation would \"affron[t]\" other nations, producing friction in our relations with those nations and leading some to reciprocate by granting their courts permission to embroil the United States in \"expensive and difficult litigation, based on legally insufficient assertions that sovereign immunity should be vitiated.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21-22.  (At any given time the Department of Justice's Office of Foreign Litigation represents the United States in about 1,000 cases in 100 courts around the world.  Ibid.)  See also National City Bank of N. Y. v. Republic of China, 348 U.\u00a0S. 356, 362 (1955) (noting that our grant of immunity to foreign sovereigns dovetails with our own interest in receiving similar treatment).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs make two important arguments to the contrary.  First, they point to the federal statute that gives federal courts jurisdiction over cases \"arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States,\" 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331.  They note that in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.\u00a0S. 678 (1946), this Court held that the \"arising under\" statute confers jurisdiction if a plaintiff can make a nonfrivolous argument that a federal law provides the relief he seeks--even if, in fact, it does not.  See id., at 685 (jurisdiction exists where, if the \"Constitution and laws of the United States are given one construction,\" a claim will be \"sustained,\" but if the laws are given a different construction, the claim \"will be defeated\").  And the plaintiffs say we should treat the expropriation exception similarly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1331, however, uses different language from the expropriation exception (\"arising under\") and focuses on different concerns.  Section 1331 often simply determines which court's doors are open (federal or state).  Cf. Mims v. Arrow Financial Services, LLC, 565 U.\u00a0S. 368, 375-379 (2012).  Unlike the FSIA, neither that jurisdictional section nor related jurisdictional sections seeks to provide a sovereign foreign nation (or any party) with immunity--the basic FSIA objective.  See Dole Food Co. v. Patrickson, 538 U.\u00a0S. 468, 479 (2003) (FSIA's objective is to give \"protection from the inconvenience of suit as a gesture of comity\"); Republic of Philippines v. Pimentel, 553 U.\u00a0S. 851, 866 (2008).  And unlike the expropriation exception, the \"arising under\" statute's language does not suggest that consistency with international law is of particular importance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, this Court has interpreted other jurisdictional statutes differently. Where jurisdiction depends on diversity of citizenship, for example, courts will look to see whether the parties are in fact diverse, not simply whether they are arguably so.  See Indianapolis v. Chase Nat. Bank, 314 U.\u00a0S. 63, 69 (1941); McNutt v. General Motors Acceptance Corp., 298 U.\u00a0S. 178, 189 (1936); see also 13E C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a73611 (2009).  We do not believe either jurisdictional analogy (28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331 or \u00a71332) is particularly helpful, but the expropriation exception's substantive goals suggest that the diversity jurisdiction example provides a marginally closer analogy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the plaintiffs argue that the nonfrivolous-argument approach will work little harm.  They say that a court faced with an arguable, but ultimately incorrect, claim of jurisdiction can simply decide the same question--say, whether there was a \"violation of international law\"--as part of its decision on the merits.  Thus a foreign sovereign defendant (in court because a plaintiff has made a nonfrivolous but incorrect argument that its property was taken in violation of international law) can simply move for judgment on the merits under Rule 12(b)(6), which provides for judgment where a plaintiff does not \"state a claim upon which relief can be granted.\"  Or the defendant could move for summary judgment under Rule 56.  In a word, the defendant may not need to undergo a full trial and judgment, remaining in court until the bitter end.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These alternatives, however, have their own problems.  For one thing, they will sometimes mean increased delay, imposing increased burdens of time and expense upon the foreign nation.  For another, where a district court decides that there is a \"violation of international law\" as a matter of jurisdiction, then (according to the Courts of Appeals) the losing sovereign nation can immediately appeal the decision as a collateral order.  But the same decision made to dispose of, say, a Rule 12(b)(6) motion or a Rule 56 motion would not be a \"collateral order.\"  It would be a decision on the \"merits.\"  And the foreign sovereign would not enjoy a right to take an immediate appeal.  See Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.\u00a0S. 463, 468 (1978) (permitting interlocutory appeal of a collateral order that \"resolve[s] an important issue completely separate from the merits of the action\"); Will v. Hallock, 546 U.\u00a0S. 345, 349 (2006) (same).  See also Intel Corp. v. Commonwealth Scientific, 455 F.\u00a03d 1364, 1366 (CA Fed. 2006) (permitting collateral appeal of an FSIA jurisdictional decision denying immunity); Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 637 F.\u00a03d 783, 785 (CA7 2011) (same); Compania Mexicana de Aviacion v. Central Dist. of Cal., 859 F. 2d 1354, 1356 (CA9 1988) (per curiam) (same); Foremost-McKesson v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 905 F.\u00a02d 438, 443 (CADC 1990) (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, what is a court to do in a case where a \"violation of international law,\" while a jurisdictional prerequisite, is not an element of the claim to be decided on the merits?  The Circuit has suggested that they arise when the plaintiffs' claim is not an \"expropriation claim,\" but rather a simple common-law claim of conversion, restitution, or breach of contract, the merits of which do not involve the merits of international law.  See Simon v. Republic of Hungary, 812 F. 3d 127, 141-142 (2016).  The Circuit has recognized that there are such cases, id., at 141, and a cursory survey of the principal district courts in which these cases are brought confirms the reality of the problem.  See, e.g., Philipp v. Federal Republic of Ger- many, ___ F.\u00a0Supp. 3d  ___, 2017 WL 1207408 (DC, Mar. 31, 2017) (deciding whether the expropriation exception is satisfied where the complaint pleads only common-law or statutory claims for relief); De Csepel v. Hungary, 169 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 143 (DC 2016) (similar); Pablo Star Ltd. v. Welsh Government, 170 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 597 (SDNY 2016) (similar); Chettri v. Nepal, 2014 WL 4354668 (SDNY, Sept. 2, 2014) (similar); Order Granting Defendants' Motion To Dismiss in Lu v. Central Bank of Republic of China, No. 2:12-cv-317 (CD Cal., June 13, 2013) (similar); Orkin v. Swiss Confederation, 770 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 612 (SDNY 2011) (similar); Hammerstein v. Federal Republic of Germany, 2011 WL 9975796 (EDNY, Aug. 1, 2011) (similar); Cassirer v. Kingdom of Spain, 461 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1157 (CD Cal. 2006) (similar).  Indeed, cases in which the jurisdictional inquiry does not overlap with the elements of a plaintiff's claims have been the norm in cases arising under other exceptions to the FSIA.  E.g., Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.\u00a0S. 607, 610 (1992) (deciding whether a plaintiffs' breach-of-contract claim satisfied the jurisdictional requirements of the commercial-activity exception, \u00a71605(a)(2)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To address the problem raised by these cases in which the \"jurisdictional and merits inquiries\" are not fully \"overlap[ping],\" the Circuit has held that a district court is not to apply its nonfrivolous-argument standard in such cases.  Simon, 812 F.\u00a03d, at 141.  Rather, a court is to ask \"whether the plaintiffs' allegations satisfy the jurisdictional standard.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We can understand why the Circuit has departed from its nonfrivolous-argument standard in these latter cases.  For, unless it did so, how could a foreign nation ever obtain a decision on the merits of the nonfrivolous argument that a plaintiff has advanced?  But what in the statutory provision suggests that sometimes courts should, but sometimes they should not, simply look to the existence of a nonfrivolous argument when they decide whether the requirements of the expropriation exception are satisfied?  It is difficult, if not impossible, to reconcile this bifurcated approach with the statute's language.  It receives little, if any, support from the statute's history or purpose.  And, it creates added complexity, making it more difficult for judges and lawyers, domestic and foreign, to understand the intricacies of the law.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that the nonfrivolous-argument standard is not consistent with the statute. Where, as here, the facts are not in dispute, those facts bring the case within the scope of the expropriation exception only if they do show (and not just arguably show) a taking of property in violation of international law.  Simply making a nonfrivolous argument to that effect is not sufficient.  Moreover, as we have previously stated, a court should decide the foreign sovereign's immunity defense \"[a]t the threshold\" of the action.  Verlinden, 461 U.\u00a0S., at 493.  As we have said, given the parties' stipulations as to all relevant facts, the question before us is purely a legal one and can be resolved at the outset of the case.  If a decision about the matter requires resolution of factual disputes, the court will have to resolve those disputes, but it should do so as near to the outset of the case as is reasonably possible.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\n\n\n","9":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB CO. v. SUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-466\nArgued: April 25, 2017Decided: June 19, 2017\n\n\nA group of plaintiffs, most of whom are not California residents, sued Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS) in California state court, alleging that the pharmaceutical company's drug Plavix had damaged their health.  BMS is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York, and it maintains substantial operations in both New York and New Jersey.  Although it engages in business activities in California and sells Plavix there, BMS did not develop, create a marketing strategy for, manufacture, label, package, or work on the regulatory approval for Plavix in the State.  And the nonresident plaintiffs did not allege that they obtained Plavix from a California source, that they were injured by Plavix in California, or that they were treated for their injuries in California.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The California Superior Court denied BMS's motion to quash service of summons on the nonresidents' claims for lack of personal jurisdiction, concluding that BMS's extensive activities in the State gave the California courts general jurisdiction.  Following this Court's decision in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, the State Court of Appeal found that the California courts lacked general jurisdiction.  But the Court of Appeal went on to find that the California courts had specific jurisdiction over the claims brought by the nonresident plaintiffs.  Affirming, the State Supreme Court applied a \"sliding scale approach\" to specific jurisdiction, concluding that BMS's \"wide ranging\" contacts with the State were enough to support a finding of specific jurisdiction over the claims brought by the nonresident plaintiffs.  That attenuated connection was met, the court held, in part because the nonresidents' claims were similar in many ways to the California residents' claims and because BMS engaged in other activities in the State.\nHeld: California courts lack specific jurisdiction to entertain the nonresidents' claims.  Pp.\u00a04-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The personal jurisdiction of state courts is \"subject to review for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\"  Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\u00a0A. v.

Specific jurisdiction, however, requires \"the suit\" to \"aris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant's contacts with the forum.\"  Daimler, supra, at ___ (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"primary concern\" in assessing personal jurisdiction is \"the burden on the defendant.\"  World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.\u00a0S. 286, 292.  Assessing this burden obviously requires a court to consider the practical problems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also encompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a State that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question.  At times, \"the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may .\u00a0.\u00a0. divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.\"  Id., at 294.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Settled principles of specific jurisdiction control this case.  For a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a claim there must be an \"affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State.\"  Goodyear, supra, at 919 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  When no such connection exists, specific jurisdiction is lacking regardless of the extent of a defendant's unconnected activities in the State.  The California Supreme Court's \"sliding scale approach\"--which resembles a loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction--is thus difficult to square with this Court's precedents.  That court found specific jurisdiction without identifying any adequate link between the State and the nonresidents' claims.  The mere fact that other plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California does not allow the State to assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents' claims.  Nor is it sufficient (or relevant) that BMS conducted research in California on matters unrelated to Plavix.  What is needed is a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.  Cf. Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___.  Pp.\u00a07-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The nonresident plaintiffs' reliance on Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.\u00a0S. 770, and Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.\u00a0S. 797, is misplaced.  Keeton concerned jurisdiction to determine the scope of a claim involving in-state injury and injury to residents of the State, not, as here, jurisdiction to entertain claims involving no in-state injury and no injury to residents of the forum State.  And Shutts, which concerned the due process rights of plaintiffs, has no bearing on the question presented here.  Pp.\u00a09-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0BMS's decision to contract with McKesson, a California company, to distribute Plavix nationally does not provide a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction.  It is not alleged that BMS engaged in relevant acts together with McKesson in California or that BMS is derivatively liable for McKesson's conduct in California.  The bare fact that BMS contracted with a California distributor is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction in the State.  Pp.\u00a011-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0The Court's decision will not result in the parade of horribles that respondents conjure up.  It does not prevent the California and out-of-state plaintiffs from joining together in a consolidated action in the States that have general jurisdiction over BMS.  Alternatively, the nonresident plaintiffs could probably sue together in their respective home States.  In addition, since this decision concerns the due process limits on the exercise of specific jurisdiction by a State, the question remains open whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court.

The California Supreme Court held that the California courts have specific jurisdiction to entertain the nonresidents' claims.  We now reverse.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BMS, a large pharmaceutical company, is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York, and it maintains substantial operations in both New York and New Jersey.  1 Cal.\u00a05th 783, 790, 377 P.\u00a03d 874, 879 (2016).  Over 50 percent of BMS's work force in the United States is employed in those two States.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0BMS also engages in business activities in other jurisdictions, including California.  Five of the company's research and laboratory facilities, which employ a total of around 160 employees, are located there.  Ibid.  BMS also employs about 250 sales representatives in California and maintains a small state-government advocacy office in Sacramento.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of the pharmaceuticals that BMS manufactures and sells is Plavix, a prescription drug that thins the blood and inhibits blood clotting.  BMS did not develop Plavix in California, did not create a marketing strategy for Plavix in California, and did not manufacture, label, package, or work on the regulatory approval of the product in California.  Ibid.  BMS instead engaged in all of these activities in either New York or New Jersey.  Ibid.  But BMS does sell Plavix in California.  Between 2006 and 2012, it sold almost 187 million Plavix pills in the State and took in more than $900 million from those sales.  1 Cal.\u00a05th, at 790-791, 377 P.\u00a03d, at 879.  This amounts to a little over one percent of the company's nationwide sales revenue.  Id., at 790, 377 P.\u00a03d, at 879.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A group of plaintiffs--consisting of 86 California residents and 592 residents from 33 other States--filed eight separate complaints in California Superior Court, alleging that Plavix had damaged their health.  Id., at 789, 377 P.\u00a03d, at 878.  All the complaints asserted 13 claims under California law, including products liability, negligent misrepresentation, and misleading advertising claims.  Ibid.  The nonresident plaintiffs did not allege that they obtained Plavix through California physicians or from any other California source; nor did they claim that they were injured by Plavix or were treated for their injuries in California.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Asserting lack of personal jurisdiction, BMS moved to quash service of summons on the nonresidents' claims, but the California Superior Court denied this motion, finding that the California courts had general jurisdiction over BMS \"[b]ecause [it] engages in extensive activities in California.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 150.  BMS unsuccessfully petitioned the State Court of Appeal for a writ of mandate, but after our decision on general jurisdiction in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), the California Supreme Court instructed the Court of Appeal \"to vacate its order denying mandate and to issue an order to show cause why relief sought in the petition should not be granted.\"  App. 9-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeal then changed its decision on the question of general jurisdiction.  228 Cal.\u00a0App.\u00a04th 605, 175 Cal.\u00a0Rptr.\u00a03d 412 (2014).  Under Daimler, it held, general jurisdiction was clearly lacking, but it went on to find that the California courts had specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents' claims against BMS.  228 Cal. App.\u00a04th 605, 175 Cal.\u00a0Rptr.\u00a03d, at 425-439.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The California Supreme Court affirmed.  The court unanimously agreed with the Court of Appeal on the issue of general jurisdiction, but the court was divided on the question of specific jurisdiction.  The majority applied a \"sliding scale approach to specific jurisdiction.\"  1 Cal. 5th, at 806, 377 P. 3d, at 889.  Under this approach, \"the more wide ranging the defendant's forum contacts, the more readily is shown a connection between the forum contacts and the claim.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying this test, the majority concluded that \"BMS's extensive contacts with California\" permitted the exercise of specific jurisdiction \"based on a less direct connection between BMS's forum activities and plaintiffs' claims than might otherwise be required.\"  Ibid.  This attenuated requirement was met, the majority found, because the claims of the nonresidents were similar in several ways to the claims of the California residents (as to which specific jurisdiction was uncontested).  Id., at 803-806, 377 P. 3d, at 887-889.  The court noted that \"[b]oth the resident and nonresident plaintiffs' claims are based on the same allegedly defective product and the assertedly misleading marketing and promotion of that product.\"  Id., at 804, 377 P. 3d, at 888.  And while acknowledging that \"there is no claim that Plavix itself was designed and developed in [BMS's California research facilities],\" the court thought it significant that other research was done in the State.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three justices dissented.  \"The claims of .\u00a0.\u00a0. nonresidents injured by their use of Plavix they purchased and used in other states,\" they wrote, \"in no sense arise from BMS's marketing and sales of Plavix in California,\" and they found that the \"mere similarity\" of the residents' and nonresidents' claims was not enough.  Id., at 819, 377 P.\u00a03d, at 898 (opinion of Werdegar, J.).  The dissent accused the majority of \"expand[ing] specific jurisdiction to the point that, for a large category of defendants, it becomes indistinguishable from general jurisdiction.\"  Id., at 816, 377 P.\u00a03d, at 896.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to decide whether the California courts' exercise of jurisdiction in this case violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).1\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has long been established that the Fourteenth Amendment limits the personal jurisdiction of state courts.  See, e.g., Daimler, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 6-13); World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.\u00a0S. 286, 291 (1980); International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.\u00a0S. 310, 316-317 (1945); Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0714, 733 (1878).  Because \"[a] state court's assertion of jurisdiction exposes defendants to the State's coercive power,\" it is \"subject to review for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause,\" Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\u00a0A. v. Brown, 564 U.\u00a0S. 915, 918 (2011), which \"limits the power of a state court to render a valid personal judgment against a nonresident defendant,\" World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, at 291.  The primary focus of our personal jurisdiction inquiry is the defendant's relationship to the forum State.  See Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2014) (slip op., at 5-8); Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.\u00a0S. 797, 806-807 (1985).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since our seminal decision in International Shoe, our decisions have recognized two types of personal jurisdiction: \"general\" (sometimes called \"all-purpose\") jurisdiction and \"specific\" (sometimes called \"case-linked\") jurisdiction.  Goodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 919.  \"For an individual, the paradigm forum for the exercise of general jurisdiction is the individual's domicile; for a corporation, it is an equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.\"  Id., at 924.  A court with general jurisdiction may hear any claim against that defendant, even if all the incidents underlying the claim occurred in a different State.  Id., at 919.  But \"only a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to\" general jurisdiction in that State.  Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Specific jurisdiction is very different.  In order for a state court to exercise specific jurisdiction, \"the suit\" must \"aris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant's contacts with the forum.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added); see Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.\u00a0S. 462, 472-473 (1985); Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\u00a0A. v. Hall, 466 U.\u00a0S. 408, 414 (1984).  In other words, there must be \"an affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State and is therefore subject to the State's regulation.\"  Goodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 919 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  For this reason, \"specific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of issues deriving from, or connected with, the very controversy that establishes jurisdiction.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In determining whether personal jurisdiction is present, a court must consider a variety of interests.  These include \"the interests of the forum State and of the plaintiff in proceeding with the cause in the plaintiff's forum of choice.\"  Kulko v. Superior Court of Cal., City and County of San Francisco, 436 U.\u00a0S. 84, 92 (1978); see Daimler, supra, at ___-___, n. 20 (slip op., at 21-22, n.\u00a020); Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U.\u00a0S. 102, 113 (1987); World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.\u00a0S., at 292.  But the \"primary concern\" is \"the burden on the defendant.\"  Id., at 292.  Assessing this burden obviously requires a court to consider the practical problems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also encompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a State that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question.  As we have put it, restrictions on personal jurisdiction \"are more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation.  They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States.\"  Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.\u00a0S. 235, 251 (1958).  \"[T]he States retain many essential attributes of sovereignty, including, in particular, the sovereign power to try causes in their courts.  The sovereignty of each State .\u00a0.\u00a0. implie[s] a limitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States.\"  World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.\u00a0S., at 293.  And at times, this federalism interest may be decisive.  As we explained in World-Wide Volkswagen, \"[e]ven if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.\"  Id., at 294.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our settled principles regarding specific jurisdiction control this case.  In order for a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a claim, there must be an \"affiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State.\"  Goodyear, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 919 (internal quotation marks and brackets in original omitted).  When there is no such connection, specific jurisdiction is lacking regardless of the extent of a defendant's unconnected activities in the State.  See id., at 931, n.\u00a06 (\"[E]ven regularly occurring sales of a product in a State do not justify the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim unrelated to those sales\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For this reason, the California Supreme Court's \"sliding scale approach\" is difficult to square with our precedents.  Under the California approach, the strength of the requisite connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue is relaxed if the defendant has extensive forum contacts that are unrelated to those claims.  Our cases provide no support for this approach, which resembles a loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction.  For specific jurisdiction, a defendant's general connections with the forum are not enough.  As we have said, \"[a] corporation's 'continuous activity of some sorts within a state .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 927 (quoting International Shoe, 326 U.\u00a0S., at 318).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present case illustrates the danger of the California approach.  The State Supreme Court found that specific jurisdiction was present without identifying any adequate link between the State and the nonresidents' claims.  As noted, the nonresidents were not prescribed Plavix in California, did not purchase Plavix in California, did not ingest Plavix in California, and were not injured by Plavix in California.  The mere fact that other plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California--and allegedly sustained the same injuries as did the nonresidents--does not allow the State to assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents' claims.  As we have explained, \"a defendant's relationship with a .\u00a0.\u00a0. third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\"  Walden, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  This remains true even when third parties (here, the plaintiffs who reside in California) can bring claims similar to those brought by the nonresidents.  Nor is it sufficient--or even relevant--that BMS conducted research in California on matters unrelated to Plavix.  What is needed--and what is missing here--is a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Walden, supra, illustrates this requirement.  In that case, Nevada plaintiffs sued an out-of-state defendant for conducting an allegedly unlawful search of the plaintiffs while they were in Georgia preparing to board a plane bound for Nevada.  We held that the Nevada courts lacked specific jurisdiction even though the plaintiffs were Nevada residents and \"suffered foreseeable harm in Nevada.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  Because the \"relevant conduct occurred entirely in Georgi[a] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the mere fact that [this] conduct affected plaintiffs with connections to the forum State d[id] not suffice to authorize jurisdiction.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In today's case, the connection between the nonresidents' claims and the forum is even weaker.  The relevant plaintiffs are not California residents and do not claim to have suffered harm in that State.  In addition, as in Walden, all the conduct giving rise to the nonresidents' claims occurred elsewhere.  It follows that the California courts cannot claim specific jurisdiction.  See World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, at 295 (finding no personal jurisdiction in Oklahoma because the defendant \"carr[ied] on no activity whatsoever in Oklahoma\" and dismissing \"the fortuitous circumstance that a single Audi automobile, sold [by defendants] in New York to New York residents, happened to suffer an accident while passing through Oklahoma\" as an \"isolated occurrence\").\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The nonresidents maintain that two of our cases support the decision below, but they misinterpret those  precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.\u00a0S. 770 (1984), a New York resident sued Hustler in New Hampshire, claiming that she had been libeled in five issues of the magazine, which was distributed throughout the country, including in New Hampshire, where it sold 10,000 to 15,000 copies per month.  Concluding that specific jurisdiction was present, we relied principally on the connection between the circulation of the magazine in New Hampshire and damage allegedly caused within the State.  We noted that \"[f]alse statements of fact harm both the subject of the falsehood and the readers of the statement.\"  Id., at 776 (emphasis deleted).  This factor amply distinguishes Keeton from the present case, for here the nonresidents' claims involve no harm in California and no harm to California residents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The nonresident plaintiffs in this case point to our holding in Keeton that there was jurisdiction in New Hampshire to entertain the plaintiff's request for damages suffered outside the State, id., at 774, but that holding concerned jurisdiction to determine the scope of a claim involving in-state injury and injury to residents of the State, not, as in this case, jurisdiction to entertain claims involving no in-state injury and no injury to residents of the forum State.  Keeton held that there was jurisdiction in New Hampshire to consider the full measure of the plaintiff's claim, but whether she could actually recover out-of-state damages was a merits question governed by New Hampshire libel law.  Id., at 778, n. 9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 U.\u00a0S. 797 (1985), which involved a class action filed in Kansas, is even less relevant.  The Kansas court exercised personal jurisdiction over the claims of nonresident class members, and the defendant, Phillips Petroleum, argued that this violated the due process rights of these class members because they lacked minimum contacts with the State.2  According to the defendant, the out-of-state class members should not have been kept in the case unless they affirmatively opted in, instead of merely failing to opt out after receiving notice.  Id., at 812.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Holding that there had been no due process violation, the Court explained that the authority of a State to entertain the claims of nonresident class members is entirely different from its authority to exercise jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant.  Id., at 808-812.  Since Shutts concerned the due process rights of plaintiffs, it has no bearing on the question presented here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents nevertheless contend that Shutts supports their position because, in their words, it would be \"absurd to believe that [this Court] would have reached the exact opposite result if the petitioner [Phillips] had only invoked its own due-process rights, rather than those of the non-resident plaintiffs.\"  Brief for Respondents 28-29, n.\u00a06 (emphasis deleted).  But the fact remains that Phillips did not assert that Kansas improperly exercised personal jurisdiction over it, and the Court did not address that issue.3  Indeed, the Court stated specifically that its \"discussion of personal jurisdiction [did not] address class actions where the jurisdiction is asserted against a defendant class.\"  Shutts, supra, at 812, n.\u00a03.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a last ditch contention, respondents contend that BMS's \"decision to contract with a California company [McKesson] to distribute [Plavix] nationally\" provides a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.  But as we have explained, \"[t]he requirements of International Shoe .\u00a0.\u00a0. must be met as to each defendant over whom a state court exercises jurisdiction.\"  Rush v. Savchuk, 444 U.\u00a0S. 320, 332 (1980); see Walden, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op, at 8) (\"[A] defendant's relationship with a .\u00a0.\u00a0. third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction\").  In this case, it is not alleged that BMS engaged in relevant acts together with McKesson in California.  Nor is it alleged that BMS is derivatively liable for McKesson's conduct in California.  And the nonresidents \"have adduced no evidence to show how or by whom the Plavix they took was distributed to the pharmacies that dispensed it to them.\"  1 Cal. 5th, at 815, 377 P. 3d, at 895 (Werdegar, J., dissenting) (emphasis deleted).  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33 (\"It is impossible to trace a particular pill to a particular person .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  It's not possible for us to track particularly to McKesson\").  The bare fact that BMS contracted with a California distributor is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction in the State.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our straightforward application in this case of settled principles of personal jurisdiction will not result in the parade of horribles that respondents conjure up.  See Brief for Respondents 38-47.  Our decision does not prevent the California and out-of-state plaintiffs from joining together in a consolidated action in the States that have general jurisdiction over BMS.  BMS concedes that such suits could be brought in either New York or Delaware.  See Brief for Petitioner 13.  Alternatively, the plaintiffs who are residents of a particular State--for example, the 92 plaintiffs from Texas and the 71 from Ohio--could probably sue together in their home States.  In addition, since our decision concerns the due process limits on the exercise of specific jurisdiction by a State, we leave open the question whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court.

Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).  Today, the Court takes its first step toward a similar contraction of specific jurisdiction by holding that a corporation that engages in a nationwide course of conduct cannot be held accountable in a state court by a group of injured people unless all of those people were injured in the forum State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I fear the consequences of the Court's decision today will be substantial.  The majority's rule will make it difficult to aggregate the claims of plaintiffs across the country whose claims may be worth little alone.  It will make it impossible to bring a nationwide mass action in state court against defendants who are \"at home\" in different States.  And it will result in piecemeal litigation and the bifurcation of claims.  None of this is necessary.  A core concern in this Court's personal jurisdiction cases is fairness.  And there is nothing unfair about subjecting a massive corporation to suit in a State for a nationwide course of conduct that injures both forum residents and nonresidents alike.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bristol-Myers Squibb is a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York.  It employs approximately 25,000 people worldwide and earns annual revenues of over $15 billion.  In the late 1990's, Bristol-Myers began to market and sell a prescription blood thinner called Plavix.  Plavix was advertised as an effective tool for reducing the risk of blood clotting for those vulnerable to heart attacks and to strokes.  The ads worked: At the height of its popularity, Plavix was a blockbuster, earning Bristol-Myers billions of dollars in annual revenues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bristol-Myers' advertising and distribution efforts were national in scope.  It conducted a single nationwide advertising campaign for Plavix, using television, magazine, and Internet ads to broadcast its message.  A consumer in California heard the same advertisement as a consumer in Maine about the benefits of Plavix.  Bristol-Myers' distribution of Plavix also proceeded through nationwide channels: Consistent with its usual practice, it relied on a small number of wholesalers to distribute Plavix throughout the country.  One of those distributors, McKesson Corporation, was named as a defendant below; during the relevant time period, McKesson was responsible for almost a quarter of Bristol-Myers' revenue worldwide.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 2005 publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine questioning the efficacy and safety of Plavix put Bristol-Myers on the defensive, as consumers around the country began to claim that they were injured by the drug.  The plaintiffs in these consolidated cases are 86 people who allege they were injured by Plavix in California and several hundred others who say they were injured by the drug in other States.1  They filed their suits in California Superior Court, raising product-liability claims against Bristol-Myers and McKesson.  Their claims are \"materially identical,\" as Bristol-Myers concedes.  See Brief for Petitioner 4, n.\u00a01.  Bristol-Myers acknowledged it was subject to suit in California state court by the residents of that State.  But it moved to dismiss the claims brought by the nonresident plaintiffs--respondents here--for lack of jurisdiction.  The question here, accordingly, is not whether Bristol-Myers is subject to suit in California on claims that arise out of the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of Plavix--it is.  The question is whether Bristol-Myers is subject to suit in California only on the residents' claims, or whether a state court may also hear the nonresidents' \"identical\" claims.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the majority explains, since our pathmarking opinion in International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.\u00a0S. 310 (1945), the touchstone of the personal-jurisdiction analysis has been the question whether a defendant has \"certain minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 316 (quoting Milliken v. Meyer, 311 U.\u00a0S. 457, 463 (1940)).  For decades this Court has considered that question through two different jurisdictional frames: \"general\" and \"specific\" jurisdiction.  See Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\u00a0A. v. Hall, 466 U.\u00a0S. 408, 414, nn. 8-9 (1984).  Under our current case law, a state court may exercise general, or all-purpose, jurisdiction over a defendant corporation only if its \"affiliations with the State are so 'continuous and systematic' as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\"  Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\u00a0A. v. Brown, 564 U.\u00a0S. 915, 919 (2011).2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If general jurisdiction is not appropriate, however, a state court can exercise only specific, or case-linked, jurisdiction over a dispute.  Id., at 923-924.  Our cases have set out three conditions for the exercise of specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.  4A C. Wright, A. Miller, & A. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71069, pp. 22-78 (4th ed. 2015) (Wright); see also id., at 22-27, n.\u00a010 (collecting authority).  First, the defendant must have \"\u00a0'purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State'\u00a0\" or have purposefully directed its conduct into the forum State.  J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.\u00a0S. 873, 877 (2011) (plurality opinion) (quoting Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.\u00a0S. 235, 253 (1958)).  Second, the plaintiff's claim must \"arise out of or relate to\" the defendant's forum conduct.  Helicopteros, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 414.  Finally, the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable under the circumstances.  Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty., 480 U.\u00a0S. 102, 113-114 (1987); Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.\u00a0S. 462, 477-478 (1985).  The factors relevant to such an analysis include \"the burden on the defendant, the forum State's interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff's interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, the interstate judicial system's interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\"  Id., at 477 (internal quotation marks omitted).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Viewed through this framework, the California courts appropriately exercised specific jurisdiction over respondents' claims.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, there is no dispute that Bristol-Myers \"purposefully avail[ed] itself,\" Nicastro, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 877, of California and its substantial pharmaceutical market.  Bristol-Myers employs over 400 people in California and maintains half a dozen facilities in the State engaged in research, development, and policymaking.  Ante, at 1-2.  It contracts with a California-based distributor, McKesson, whose sales account for a significant portion of its revenue.  Supra, at 2.  And it markets and sells its drugs, including Plavix, in California, resulting in total Plavix sales in that State of nearly $1 billion during the period relevant to this suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, respondents' claims \"relate to\" Bristol-Myers' in-state conduct.  A claim \"relates to\" a defendant's forum conduct if it has a \"connect[ion] with\" that conduct.  International Shoe, 326 U.\u00a0S., at 319.  So respondents could not, for instance, hale Bristol-Myers into court in California for negligently maintaining the sidewalk outside its New York headquarters--a claim that has no connection to acts Bristol-Myers took in California.  But respondents' claims against Bristol-Myers look nothing like such a claim.  Respondents' claims against Bristol-Myers concern conduct materially identical to acts the company took in California: its marketing and distribution of Plavix, which it undertook on a nationwide basis in all 50 States.  That respondents were allegedly injured by this nationwide course of conduct in Indiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, and not California, does not mean that their claims do not \"relate to\" the advertising and distribution efforts that Bristol-Myers undertook in that State.  All of the plaintiffs--residents and nonresidents alike--allege that they were injured by the same essential acts.  Our cases require no connection more direct than that.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, and importantly, there is no serious doubt that the exercise of jurisdiction over the nonresidents' claims is reasonable.  Because Bristol-Myers already faces claims that are identical to the nonresidents' claims in this suit, it will not be harmed by having to defend against respondents' claims: Indeed, the alternative approach--litigating those claims in separate suits in as many as 34 different States--would prove far more burdensome.  By contrast, the plaintiffs' \"interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,\" Burger King, 471 U.\u00a0S., at 477 (internal quotation marks omitted), is obviously furthered by participating in a consolidated proceeding in one State under shared counsel, which allows them to minimize costs, share discovery, and maximize recoveries on claims that may be too small to bring on their own.  Cf. American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (Kagan., J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (\"No rational actor would bring a claim worth tens of thousands of dollars if doing so meant incurring costs in the hundreds of thousands\").  California, too, has an interest in providing a forum for mass actions like this one: Permitting the nonresidents to bring suit in California alongside the residents facilitates the efficient adjudication of the residents' claims and allows it to regulate more effectively the conduct of both nonresident corporations like Bristol-Myers and resident ones like McKesson.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in the Due Process Clause prohibits a California court from hearing respondents' claims--at least not in a case where they are joined to identical claims brought by California residents.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bristol-Myers does not dispute that it has purposefully availed itself of California's markets, nor--remarkably--did it argue below that it would be \"unreasonable\" for a California court to hear respondents' claims.  See 1 Cal. 5th 783, 799, n.\u00a02, 377 P. 3d 874, 885, n.\u00a02 (2016).  Instead, Bristol-Myers contends that respondents' claims do not \"arise out of or relate to\" its California conduct.  The majority agrees, explaining that no \"adequate link\" exists \"between the State and the nonresidents' claims,\" ante, at 8--a result that it says follows from \"settled principles [of] specific jurisdiction,\" ante, at 7.  But our precedents do not require this result, and common sense says that it cannot be correct.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority casts its decision today as compelled by precedent.  Ibid. But our cases point in the other direction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority argues at length that the exercise of spe-cific jurisdiction in this case would conflict with our decision in Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).  That is plainly not true.  Walden concerned the requirement that a defendant \"purposefully avail\" himself of a forum State or \"purposefully direc[t]\" his conduct toward that State, Nicastro, 564 U.\u00a0S., at 877, not the separate requirement that a plaintiff's claim \"arise out of or relate to\" a defendant's forum contacts.  The lower court understood the case that way.  See Fiore v. Walden, 688 F.\u00a03d 558, 576-582 (CA9 2012).  The parties understood the case that way.  See Brief for Petitioner 17-31, Brief for Respondent 20-44, Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12-18, in Walden v. Fiore, O.\u00a0T. 2013, No. 12-574.  And courts and commentators have understood the case that way.  See, e.g., 4 Wright \u00a71067.1, at 388-389.  Walden teaches only that a defendant must have purposefully availed itself of the forum, and that a plaintiff cannot rely solely on a defendant's contacts with a forum resident to establish the necessary relationship.  See 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\"[T]he plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the forum\").  But that holding has nothing to do with the dispute between the parties: Bristol-Myers has purposefully availed itself of California--to the tune of millions of dollars in annual revenue.  Only if its language is taken out of context, ante, at 8-9, can Walden be made to seem relevant to the case at hand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, our decision in Keeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.\u00a0S. 770 (1984), suggests that there should be no such barrier to the exercise of jurisdiction here.  In Keeton, a New York resident brought suit against an Ohio corporation, a magazine, in New Hampshire for libel.  She alleged that the magazine's nationwide course of conduct--its publication of defamatory statements--had injured her in every State, including New Hampshire.  This Court unanimously rejected the defendant's argument that it should not be subject to \"nationwide damages\" when only a small portion of those damages arose in the forum State, id., at 781; exposure to such liability, the Court explained, was the consequence of having \"continuously and deliberately exploited the New Hampshire market,\" ibid.  The majority today dismisses Keeton on the ground that the defendant there faced one plaintiff's claim arising out of its nationwide course of conduct, whereas Bristol-Myers faces many more plaintiffs' claims.  See ante, at 10.  But this is a distinction without a difference: In either case, a defendant will face liability in a single State for a single course of conduct that has impact in many States.  Keeton informs us that there is no unfairness in such a result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's animating concern, in the end, appears to be federalism: \"[T]erritorial limitations on the power of the respective States,\" we are informed, may--and today do--trump even concerns about fairness to the parties.  Ante, at 6.  Indeed, the majority appears to concede that this is not, at bottom, a case about fairness but instead a case about power: one in which \"\u00a0'the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; .\u00a0.\u00a0. the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; [and] the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation'\u00a0\" but personal jurisdiction still will not lie.  Ante, at 7 (quoting World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.\u00a0S. 286, 294 (1980)).  But I see little reason to apply such a principle in a case brought against a large corporate defendant arising out of its nationwide conduct.  What interest could any single State have in adjudicating respondents' claims that the other States do not share?  I would measure jurisdiction first and foremost by the yardstick set out in International Shoe--\"fair play and substantial justice,\" 326 U.\u00a0S., at 316 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The majority's opinion casts that settled principle aside.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I fear the consequences of the majority's decision today will be substantial.  Even absent a rigid requirement that a defendant's in-state conduct must actually cause a plaintiff's claim,3 the upshot of today's opinion is that plaintiffs cannot join their claims together and sue a defendant in a State in which only some of them have been injured.  That rule is likely to have consequences far beyond this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, and most prominently, the Court's opinion in this case will make it profoundly difficult for plaintiffs who are injured in different States by a defendant's nationwide course of conduct to sue that defendant in a single, consolidated action.  The holding of today's opinion is that such an action cannot be brought in a State in which only some plaintiffs were injured.  Not to worry, says the majority: The plaintiffs here could have sued Bristol-Myers in New York or Delaware; could \"probably\" have subdivided their separate claims into 34 lawsuits in the States in which they were injured; and might have been able to bring a single suit in federal court (an \"open .\u00a0.\u00a0. question\").  Ante, at 12.  Even setting aside the majority's caveats, what is the purpose of such limitations?  What interests are served by preventing the consolidation of claims and limiting the forums in which they can be consolidated?  The effect of the Court's opinion today is to eliminate nationwide mass actions in any State other than those in which a defendant is \"\u00a0'essentially at home.'\u00a0\"4  See Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  Such a rule hands one more tool to corporate defendants determined to prevent the aggregation of individual claims, and forces injured plaintiffs to bear the burden of bringing suit in what will often be far flung jurisdictions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court's opinion today may make it impossible to bring certain mass actions at all.  After this case, it is difficult to imagine where it might be possible to bring a nationwide mass action against two or more defendants headquartered and incorporated in different States.  There will be no State where both defendants are \"at home,\" and so no State in which the suit can proceed.  What about a nationwide mass action brought against a defendant not headquartered or incorporated in the United States?  Such a defendant is not \"at home\" in any State.  Cf. id., at ___-___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 18-19).  Especially in a world in which defendants are subject to general jurisdiction in only a handful of States, see ibid., the effect of today's opinion will be to curtail--and in some cases eliminate--plaintiffs' ability to hold corporations fully accountable for their nationwide conduct.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority chides respondents for conjuring a \"parade of horribles,\" ante, at 12, but says nothing about how suits like those described here will survive its opinion in this case.  The answer is simple: They will not.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It \"does not offend 'traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,'\u00a0\" International Shoe, 326 U.\u00a0S., at 316, to permit plaintiffs to aggregate claims arising out of a single nationwide course of conduct in a single suit in a single State where some, but not all, were injured.  But that is exactly what the Court holds today is barred by the Due Process Clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not a rule the Constitution has required before.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0California law provides that its courts may exercise jurisdiction \"on any basis not inconsistent with the Constitution .\u00a0.\u00a0. of the United States,\" Cal. Civ. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a7410.10 (West 2004); see Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The Court held that the defendant had standing to argue that the Kansas court had improperly exercised personal jurisdiction over the claims of the out-of-state class members because that holding materially affected the defendant's own interests, specifically, the res judicata effect of an adverse judgment.  472 U.\u00a0S., at 803-806.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Petitioner speculates that Phillips did not invoke its own due process rights because it was believed at the time that the Kansas court had general jurisdiction.  See Reply Brief 7, n.\u00a01.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Like the parties and the majority, I refer to these people as \"residents\" and \"nonresidents\" of California as a convenient shorthand.  See ante, at 2; Brief for Petitioner 4-5, n.\u00a01; Brief for Respondents 2, n.\u00a01.  For jurisdictional purposes, the important question is generally (as it is here) where a plaintiff was injured, not where he or she resides.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Respondents do not contend that the California courts would be able to exercise general jurisdiction over Bristol-Myers--a concession that follows directly from this Court's opinion in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).  As I have explained, I believe the restrictions the Court imposed on general jurisdiction in Daimler were ill advised.  See BNSF R.\u00a0Co. v. Tyrrell, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Daimler, 571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment).  But I accept respondents' concession, for the purpose of this case, that Bristol-Myers is not subject to general jurisdiction in California.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Bristol-Myers urges such a rule upon us, Brief for Petitioner 14-37, but its adoption would have consequences far beyond those that follow from today's factbound opinion.  Among other things, it might call into question whether even a plaintiff injured in a State by an item identical to those sold by a defendant in that State could avail himself of that State's courts to redress his injuries--a result specifically contemplated by World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.\u00a0S. 286, 297 (1980).  See Brief for Civil Procedure Professors as Amici Curiae 14-18; see also J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.\u00a0S. 873, 906-907 (2011) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).  That question, and others like it, appears to await another case.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The Court today does not confront the question whether its opinion here would also apply to a class action in which a plaintiff injured in the forum State seeks to represent a nationwide class of plaintiffs, not all of whom were injured there.  Cf. Devlin v. Scardelletti, 536 U.\u00a0S. 1, 9-10 (2002) (\"Nonnamed class members .\u00a0.\u00a0. may be parties for some purposes and not for others\"); see also Wood, Adjudicatory Jurisdiction and Class Actions, 62 Ind. L.\u00a0J. 597, 616-617 (1987).\n\n\n","10":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nBUCK v. DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION(2017)\nNo. 15-8049\nArgued: October 5, 2016Decided: February 22, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Duane Buck was convicted of capital murder in a Texas court.  Under state law, the jury was permitted to impose a death sentence only if it found unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt that Buck was likely to commit acts of violence in the future.  Buck's attorney called a psychologist, Dr. Walter Quijano, to offer his opinion on that issue.  Dr. Quijano had been appointed to evaluate Buck by the presiding judge and had prepared a report setting out his conclusions.  To determine the likelihood that Buck would act violently in the future, Dr. Quijano had considered a number of statistical factors, including Buck's race.  Although Dr. Quijano ultimately concluded that Buck was unlikely to be a future danger, his report also stated that Buck was statistically more likely to act violently because he is black.  The report read, in relevant part: \"Race.  Black: Increased probability.\"  App. 19a.  Despite knowing the contents of the report, Buck's counsel called Dr. Quijano to the stand, where he testified that race is a factor \"know[n] to predict future dangerousness.\"  Id., at 146a.  Dr. Quijano's report was admitted into evidence at the close of his testimony.  The prosecution questioned Dr. Quijano about his conclusions on race and violence during cross-examination, and it relied on his testimony in summation.  During deliberations, the jury requested and received the expert reports admitted into evidence, including Dr. Quijano's.  The jury returned a sentence of death.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck contends that his attorney's introduction of this evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  Buck failed to raise this claim in his first state postconviction proceeding.  While that proceeding was pending, this Court received a petition for certiorari in Saldano v. Texas, 530 U.\u00a0S. 1212, a case in which Dr. Quijano had testified that the petitioner's Hispanic heritage weighed in favor of a finding of future dangerousness.  Texas confessed error on that ground, and this Court vacated the judgment below.  Soon afterward, the Texas Attorney General issued a public statement identifying six similar cases in which Dr. Quijano had testified.  Buck's was one of them.  In the other five cases, the Attorney General confessed error and consented to resentencing.  But when Buck filed a second state habeas petition alleging that his attorney had been ineffective in introducing Dr. Quijano's testimony, the State did not confess error, and the court dismissed the petition as an abuse of the writ on the ground that Buck had failed to raise the claim in his first petition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck then sought federal habeas relief under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254.  The State again declined to confess error, and Buck's ineffective assistance claim was held procedurally defaulted and unreviewable under Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722.  This Court's later decisions in Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.\u00a0S. 1, and Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, modified the rule of Coleman.  Had they been decided before Buck filed his federal habeas petition, Buck's claim could have been heard on the merits provided he had demonstrated that (1) state postconviction counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise the claim, and (2) the claim had some merit.  Following the decision in Trevino, Buck sought to reopen his \u00a72254 case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).  To demonstrate the \"extraordinary circumstances\" required for relief, Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.\u00a0S. 524, 535, Buck cited the change in law effected by Martinez and Trevino, as well as ten other factors, including the introduction of expert testimony linking Buck's race to violence and the State's confession of error in similar cases.  The District Court denied relief.  Reasoning that \"the introduction of any mention of race\" during Buck's sentencing was \"de minimis,\" the court concluded, first, that Buck had failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances; and second, that even if the circumstances were extraordinary, Buck had failed to demonstrate ineffective assistance under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668.  Buck sought a certificate of appealability (COA) from the Fifth Circuit to appeal the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  The Fifth Circuit denied his application, concluding that he had not shown extraordinary circumstances justifying relief from the District Court's judgment.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The Fifth Circuit exceeded the limited scope of the COA analysis.  The COA statute sets forth a two-step process: an initial determination whether a claim is reasonably debatable, and, if so, an appeal in the normal course.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253.  At the first stage, the only question is whether the applicant has shown that \"jurists of reason could disagree with the district court's resolution of his constitutional claims or .\u00a0.\u00a0. could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\"  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.\u00a0S. 322, 327.  Here, the Fifth Circuit phrased its determination in proper terms.  But it reached its conclusion only after essentially deciding the case on the merits, repeatedly faulting Buck for having failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances.  The question for the Court of Appeals was not whether Buck had shown that his case is extraordinary; it was whether jurists of reason could debate that issue.  The State points to the Fifth Circuit's thorough consideration of the merits to defend that court's approach, but this hurts rather than helps its case.  Pp.\u00a012-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Buck has demonstrated ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland.  Pp.\u00a015-20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0To satisfy Strickland, a defendant must first show that counsel performed deficiently.  466 U.\u00a0S., at 687.  Buck's trial counsel knew that Dr. Quijano's report reflected the view that Buck's race predisposed him to violent conduct and that the principal point of dispute during the penalty phase was Buck's future dangerousness.  Counsel nevertheless called Dr. Quijano to the stand, specifically elicited testimony about the connection between race and violence, and put Dr. Quijano's report into evidence.  No competent defense attorney would introduce evidence that his client is liable to be a future danger because of his race.  Pp.\u00a015-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Strickland further requires a defendant to demonstrate prejudice--\"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 694.  It is reasonably probable that without Dr. Quijano's testimony on race and violence, at least one juror would have harbored a reasonable doubt on the question of Buck's future dangerousness.  This issue required the jury to make a predictive judgment inevitably entailing a degree of speculation.  But Buck's race was not subject to speculation, and according to Dr. Quijano, that immutable characteristic carried with it an increased probability of future violence.  Dr. Quijano's testimony appealed to a powerful racial stereotype and might well have been valued by jurors as the opinion of a medical expert bearing the court's imprimatur.  For these reasons, the District Court's conclusion that any mention of race during the penalty phase was de minimis is rejected.  So is the State's argument that Buck was not prejudiced by Dr. Quijano's testimony because it was introduced by his own counsel, rather than the prosecution.  Jurors understand that prosecutors seek convictions and may reasonably be expected to evaluate the government's evidence in light of its motivations.  When damaging evidence is introduced by a defendant's own lawyer, it is in the nature of an admission against interest, more likely to be taken at face value.  Pp.\u00a017-20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0The District Court's denial of Buck's Rule 60(b)(6) motion was an abuse of discretion.

Determining whether such circumstances are present may include consideration of a wide range of factors, including \"the risk of injustice to the parties\" and \"the risk of undermining the public's confidence in the judicial process.\"  Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.\u00a0S. 847, 863-864.  The District Court's denial of Buck's motion rested largely on its determination that race played only a de minimis role in his sentencing.  But there is a reasonable probability that Buck was sentenced to death in part because of his race.  This is a disturbing departure from the basic premise that our criminal law punishes people for what they do, not who they are.  That it concerned race amplifies the problem.  Relying on race to impose a criminal sanction \"poisons public confidence\" in the judicial process, Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, a concern that supports Rule 60(b)(6) relief.  The extraordinary nature of this case is confirmed by the remarkable steps the State itself took in response to Dr. Quijano's testimony in other cases.  Although the State attempts to justify its decision to treat Buck differently from the other five defendants identified in the Attorney General's public statement, its explanations for distinguishing Buck's case from Saldano have nothing to do with the Attorney General's stated reasons for confessing error in that case.  Pp.\u00a020-24.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Unless Martinez and Trevino, rather than Coleman, would govern Buck's case were it reopened, his claim would remain unreviewable and Rule 60(b)(6) relief would be inappropriate.  The State argues that Martinez and Trevino would not govern Buck's case because they announced a \"new rule\" under Teague v. Lane, 489 U.\u00a0S. 288, that does not apply retroactively to cases (like Buck's) on collateral review.  This argument, however, has been waived: the State failed to advance it in District Court, before the Fifth Circuit, or in its brief in opposition to Buck's petition for certiorari.

LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit\n[February 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A Texas jury convicted petitioner Duane Buck of capital murder.  Under state law, the jury could impose a death sentence only if it found that Buck was likely to commit acts of violence in the future.  Buck's attorney called a psychologist to offer his opinion on that issue.  The psychologist testified that Buck probably would not engage in violent conduct.  But he also stated that one of the factors pertinent in assessing a person's propensity for violence was his race, and that Buck was statistically more likely to act violently because he is black.  The jury sentenced Buck to death.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck contends that his attorney's introduction of this evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel.  This claim has never been heard on the merits in any court, because the attorney who represented Buck in his first state postconviction proceeding failed to raise it.  In 2006, a Federal District Court relied on that failure--properly, under then-governing law--to hold that Buck's claim was procedurally defaulted and unreviewable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2014, Buck sought to reopen that 2006 judgment by filing a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).  He argued that this Court's decisions in Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2012), and Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), had changed the law in a way that provided an excuse for his procedural default, permitting him to litigate his claim on the merits.  In addition to this change in the law, Buck's motion identified ten other factors that, he said, constituted the \"extraordinary circumstances\" required to justify reopening the 2006 judgment under the Rule.  See Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.\u00a0S. 524, 535 (2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court below denied the motion, and the Fifth Circuit declined to issue the certificate of appealability (COA) requested by Buck to appeal that decision.  We granted certiorari, and now reverse.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the morning of July 30, 1995, Duane Buck arrived at the home of his former girlfriend, Debra Gardner.  He was carrying a rifle and a shotgun.  Buck entered the home, shot Phyllis Taylor, his stepsister, and then shot Gardner's friend Kenneth Butler.  Gardner fled the house, and Buck followed.  So did Gardner's young children.  While Gardner's son and daughter begged for their mother's life, Buck shot Gardner in the chest.  Gardner and Butler died of their wounds.  Taylor survived.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Police officers arrived soon after the shooting and placed Buck under arrest.  An officer would later testify that Buck was laughing at the scene.  He remained \"happy\" and \"upbeat\" as he was driven to the police station, \"[s]miling and laughing\" in the back of the patrol car.  App. 134a-135a, 252a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck was tried for capital murder, and the jury convicted.  During the penalty phase of the trial, the jury was charged with deciding two issues.  The first was what the parties term the \"future dangerousness\" question.  At the time of Buck's trial, a Texas jury could impose the death penalty only if it found--unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt--\"a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society.\"  Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 37.071, \u00a72(b)(1) (Vernon 1998).  The second issue, to be reached only if the jury found Buck likely to be a future danger, was whether mitigating circumstances nevertheless warranted a sentence of life imprisonment instead of death.  See \u00a72(e).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties focused principally on the first question.  The State called witnesses who emphasized the brutality of Buck's crime and his evident lack of remorse in its aftermath.  The State also called another former girlfriend, Vivian Jackson.  She testified that, during their relationship, Buck had routinely hit her and had twice pointed a gun at her.  Finally, the State introduced evidence of Buck's criminal history, including convictions for delivery of cocaine and unlawfully carrying a weapon.  App. 125a-127a, 185a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defense counsel answered with a series of lay witnesses, including Buck's father and stepmother, who testified that they had never known him to be violent.  Counsel also called two psychologists to testify as experts.  The first, Dr. Patrick Lawrence, observed that Buck had previously served time in prison and had been held in minimum custody.  From this he concluded that Buck \"did not present any problems in the prison setting.\"  Record in No. 4:04-cv-03965 (SD Tex.), Doc. 5-116, pp. 12-13.  Dr. Lawrence further testified that murders within the Texas penal system tend to be gang related (there was no evidence Buck had ever been a member of a gang) and that Buck's offense had been a \"crime of passion\" occurring within the context of a romantic relationship.  Id., at 4, 19, 21.  Based on these considerations, Dr. Lawrence determined that Buck was unlikely to be a danger if he were sentenced to life in prison.  Id., at 20-21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck's second expert, Dr. Walter Quijano, had been appointed by the presiding judge to conduct a psychological evaluation.  Dr. Quijano had met with Buck in prison prior to trial and shared a report of his findings with defense counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like Dr. Lawrence, Dr. Quijano thought it significant that Buck's prior acts of violence had arisen from romantic relationships with women; Buck, of course, would not form any such relationships while incarcerated.  And Dr. Quijano likewise considered Buck's behavioral record in prison a good indicator that future violence was unlikely.  App. 36a, 39a-40a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there was more to the report.  In determining whether Buck was likely to pose a danger in the future, Dr. Quijano considered seven \"statistical factors.\"  The fourth factor was \"race.\"  His report read, in relevant part: \"4. Race.  Black: Increased probability.  There is an over-representation of Blacks among the violent offenders.\"  Id., at 19a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite knowing Dr. Quijano's view that Buck's race was competent evidence of an increased probability of future violence, defense counsel called Dr. Quijano to the stand and asked him to discuss the \"statistical factors\" he had \"looked at in regard to this case.\"  Id., at 145a-146a.  Dr. Quijano responded that certain factors were \"know[n] to predict future dangerousness\" and, consistent with his report, identified race as one of them.  Id., at 146a.  \"It's a sad commentary,\" he testified, \"that minorities, Hispanics and black people, are over represented in the Criminal Justice System.\"  Ibid.  Through further questioning, counsel elicited testimony concerning factors Dr. Quijano thought favorable to Buck, as well as his ultimate opinion that Buck was unlikely to pose a danger in the future.  At the close of Dr. Quijano's testimony, his report was admitted into evidence.  Id., at 150a-152a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After opening cross-examination with a series of general questions, the prosecutor likewise turned to the report.  She asked first about the statistical factors of past crimes and age, then questioned Dr. Quijano about the roles of sex and race: \"You have determined that the sex factor, that a male is more violent than a female because that's just the way it is, and that the race factor, black, increases the future dangerousness for various complicated reasons; is that correct?\"  Id., at 170a.  Dr. Quijano replied, \"Yes.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During closing arguments, defense counsel emphasized that Buck had proved to be \"controllable in the prison population,\" and that his crime was one of \"jealousy, .\u00a0.\u00a0. passion and emotion\" unlikely to be repeated in jail.  Id., at 189a-191a.  The State stressed the crime's brutal nature and Buck's lack of remorse, along with the inability of Buck's own experts to guarantee that he would not act violently in the future--a point it supported by reference to Dr. Quijano's testimony.  See id., at 198a-199a (\"You heard from Dr. Quijano, .\u00a0.\u00a0. who told you that .\u00a0.\u00a0. the probability did exist that [Buck] would be a continuing threat to society.\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury deliberated over the course of two days.  During that time it sent out four notes, one of which requested the \"psychology reports\" that had been admitted into evidence.  Id., at 209a.  These reports--including Dr. Quijano's--were provided.  The jury returned a sentence of death.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck's conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal.  Buck v. State, No. 72,810 (Tex. Crim. App., Apr. 28, 1999).  His case then entered a labyrinth of state and federal collateral review, where it has wandered for the better part of two decades.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck filed his first petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Texas state court in 1999.  The four claims advanced in his petition, however, were all frivolous or noncognizable.  See Ex\u00a0parte Buck, No. 699684-A (Dist. Ct. Harris Cty., Tex., July 11, 2003), pp.\u00a06-7.  The petition failed to mention defense counsel's introduction of expert testimony that Buck's race increased his propensity for violence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Dr. Quijano had testified in other cases, too, and in 1999, while Buck's first habeas petition was pending, one of those cases reached this Court.  The petitioner, Victor Hugo Saldano, argued that his death sentence had been tainted by Dr. Quijano's testimony that Saldano's Hispanic heritage \"was a factor weighing in the favor of future dangerousness.\"  App. 302a.  Texas confessed error on that ground and asked this Court to grant Saldano's petition for certiorari, vacate the state court judgment, and remand the case.  In June 2000, the Court did so.  Saldano v. Texas, 530 U.\u00a0S. 1212.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Within days, the Texas Attorney General, John Cornyn, issued a public statement concerning the cases in which Dr. Quijano had testified.  The statement affirmed that \"it is inappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice system.\"  App. 213a.  In keeping with that principle, the Attorney General explained that his office had conducted a \"thorough audit\" and \"identified eight more cases in which testimony was offered by Dr. Quijano that race should be a factor for the jury to consider in making its determination about the sentence in a capital murder trial.\"  Ibid.  Six of those cases were \"similar to that of Victor Hugo Saldano\"; in those cases, letters had been sent to counsel apprising them of the Attorney General's findings.  Id., at 213a-214a.  The statement closed by identifying the defendants in those six cases.  Buck was one of them.  Id., at 215a-217a.  By the close of 2002, the Attorney General had confessed error, waived any available procedural defenses, and consented to resentencing in the cases of five of those six defendants.  See Alba v. Johnson, 232 F. 3d 208 (CA5 2000) (Table); Memorandum and Order in Blue v. Johnson, No. 4:99-cv-00350 (SD Tex.), pp. 15-17; Order in Garcia v. Johnson, No. 1:99-cv-00134 (ED Tex.), p. 1; Order in Broxton v. Johnson, No. 4:00-cv-01034 (SD Tex.), pp. 10-11; Final Judgment in Gonzales v. Cockrell, No. 7:99-cv-00072 (WD Tex.), p. 1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not, however, in Buck's.  In 2002, Buck's attorney filed a new state habeas petition alleging that trial counsel had rendered ineffective assistance by introducing Dr. Quijano's testimony.  The State was not represented by the Attorney General in this proceeding--the Texas Attorney General represents state respondents in federal habeas cases, but not state habeas cases--and it did not confess error.  Because Buck's petition was successive, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals dismissed it as an abuse of the writ.  Ex\u00a0parte Buck, Nos. 57,004-01, 57,004-02 (Tex. Crim. App., Oct. 15, 2003) (\u00a0per curiam).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck turned to the federal courts.  He filed a petition for habeas corpus under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254 in October 2004, by which time Attorney General Cornyn had left office.  See Buck v. Dretke, 2006 WL 8411481, *2 (SD Tex., July 24, 2006).  Buck sought relief on the ground that trial counsel's introduction of Dr. Quijano's testimony was constitutionally ineffective.  The State responded that the state court had dismissed Buck's ineffective assistance claim because Buck had failed to press it in his first petition, raising it for the first time in a procedurally improper second petition.  The State argued that such reliance on an established state rule of procedure was an adequate and independent state ground precluding federal review.  Texas acknowledged that it had waived similar procedural defenses in Saldano's case.  But it argued that Buck's case was different because \"[i]n Saldano's case Dr. Quijano testified for the State\"; in Buck's, \"it was Buck who called Dr. Quijano to testify.\"  Answer and Motion for Summary Judgment in No. 4:04-cv-03965 (SD Tex.), p.\u00a020.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck countered that, notwithstanding his procedural default, the District Court should reach the merits of his claim because a failure to do so would result in a miscarriage of justice.  Buck did not argue that his default should be excused on a showing of \"cause\" and \"prejudice\"--that is, cause for the default, and prejudice from the denial of a federal right.  And for good reason: At the time Buck filed his \u00a72254 petition, our decision in Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722, 752-753 (1991), made clear that an attorney's failure to raise an ineffective assistance claim during state postconviction review could not constitute cause.  The District Court rejected Buck's miscarriage of justice argument and held that, because of his procedural default, his ineffective assistance claim was unreviewable.  Buck v. Dretke, 2006 WL 8411481, at *8.  Buck unsuccessfully sought review of the District Court's ruling.  See Buck v. Thaler, 345 Fed. Appx. 923 (CA5 2009) (\u00a0per curiam) (denying application for a COA), cert. denied, 559 U.\u00a0S. 1072 (2010).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2011, Buck sought to reopen his case, arguing that the prosecution had violated the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses by asking Dr. Quijano about the relationship between race and future violence on cross-examination and referring to his testimony during summation.  Buck also argued that the State's decision to treat him differently from the other defendants affected by Dr. Quijano's testimony justified relieving him of the District Court's adverse judgment.  The Fifth Circuit disagreed, see Buck v. Thaler, 452 Fed. Appx. 423, 427-428 (CA5 2011) (\u00a0per curiam), and we denied certiorari, Buck v. Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 1022 (2011).  Buck, still barred by Coleman from avoiding the consequences of his procedural default, did not pursue his ineffective assistance claim.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2012, this Court \"modif[ied] the unqualified statement in Coleman that an attorney's ignorance or inadvertence in a postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.\"  Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 9.  We held that when a state formally limits the adjudication of claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel to collateral review, a prisoner may establish cause for procedural default if (1) \"the state courts did not appoint counsel in the initial-review collateral proceeding,\" or \"appointed counsel in [that] proceeding .\u00a0.\u00a0. was ineffective under the standards of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984)\"; and (2) \"the underlying .\u00a0.\u00a0. claim is a substantial one, which is to say that .\u00a0.\u00a0. the claim has some merit.\"  Id., at 14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its terms, Martinez did not bear on Buck's ineffective assistance claim.  At the time of Buck's conviction and appeal, Texas did not formally require criminal defendants to reserve such claims for collateral review.  In Tre- vino, however, the Court concluded that the exception announced in Martinez extended to state systems that, as a practical matter, deny criminal defendants \"a meaningful opportunity\" to press ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal.  569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  The Court further concluded that the system in Texas, where petitioner had been convicted, was such a system.  Ibid.  The upshot: Had Martinez and Trevino been decided before Buck filed his \u00a72254 petition, a federal court could have reviewed Buck's ineffective assistance claim if he demonstrated that (1) state postconviction counsel had been constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise it, and (2) the claim had \"some merit.\"  Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 14.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Trevino was decided, Buck's third state habeas petition was pending in Texas court.  That petition was denied in November 2013.  Ex\u00a0parte Buck, 418 S.\u00a0W. 3d 98 (Tex. Crim. App. 2013) (\u00a0per curiam).  Two months later, Buck returned to federal court, where he filed a motion to reopen his \u00a72254 case under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6).  Rule 60(b) enumerates specific circumstances in which a party may be relieved of the effect of a judgment, such as mistake, newly discovered evidence, fraud, and the like.  The Rule concludes with a catchall category--subdivision (b)(6)--providing that a court may lift a judgment for \"any other reason that justifies relief.\"  Relief is available under subdivision (b)(6), however, only in \"extraordinary circumstances,\" and the Court has explained that \"[s]uch circumstances will rarely occur in the habeas context.\"  Gonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 535.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In his motion, Buck identified 11 factors that, in his view, justified reopening the judgment.  These included his attorney's introduction of expert testimony linking Buck's race to violence, the central issue at sentencing; the prosecution's questions about race and violence on cross-examination and reliance on Dr. Quijano's testimony in summation; the State's confession of error in other cases in which Dr. Quijano testified, but its refusal to concede error in Buck's case; and the change in law effected by Martinez and Trevino, which, if they had been decided earlier, would have permitted federal review of Buck's defaulted claim.  App. 283a-285a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court denied relief on two grounds.  First, the court concluded that Buck had failed to demonstrate extraordinary circumstances.  To that end, the court observed that a change in decisional law is rarely extraordinary by itself.  Buck v. Stephens, 2014 WL 11310152, *4 (SD Tex., Aug. 29, 2014).  It further determined that the State's \"promise\" not to oppose resentencing did not count for much, reasoning that \"Buck's case is different in critical respects from the cases in which Texas confessed error\" in that Buck's lawyer, not the prosecutor, had first elicited the objectionable testimony.  Id., at *4-*5.  The court also dismissed the contention that the nature of Dr. Quijano's testimony argued for reopening the case.  Although \"the introduction of any mention of race was,\" in the court's view, \"ill[ ]advised at best and repugnant at worst,\" it was also \"de minimis\": Dr. Quijano had discussed the connection between race and violence only twice.  Id., at *5. The court accordingly concluded that Buck had failed to make out the predicate for Rule 60(b)(6) relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the court determined that--even if the circumstances were extraordinary--Buck's claim would fail on the merits.  The court noted that under Strickland, Buck was obliged to show that counsel's performance was both deficient and prejudicial.  The court held that Buck's lawyer had indeed performed deficiently in calling Dr. Quijano to give testimony that \"len[t] credence to any potential latent racial prejudice held by the jury.\"  2014 WL 11310152, at *6. But, the court concluded, Buck had failed to demonstrate prejudice.  It observed that Buck's crime had been \"horrific.\"  Ibid.  And the court had already concluded that \"the introduction of any mention of race was .\u00a0.\u00a0. de minimis.\"  Id., at *5. For those reasons, it held, Buck had failed to show a reasonable probability that he would not have been sentenced to death but for Dr. Quijano's testimony about race and violence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck sought to appeal the denial of his Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  He accordingly filed an application for a COA with the Fifth Circuit.  To obtain a COA, Buck was required to make \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"*  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fifth Circuit denied a COA, concluding that Buck's case was \"not extraordinary at all in the habeas context.\"  Buck v. Stephens, 623 Fed. Appx. 668, 673 (2015).  The panel agreed with the District Court that Martinez and Trevino were not significant factors in the analysis.  It characterized most of the other factors Buck had identified as \"variations on the merits\" of his claim, which was \"at least unremarkable as far as [ineffective assistance] claims go.\"  623 Fed. Appx., at 673.  The panel likewise rejected Buck's argument that he was entitled to relief because the State had issued a press release indicating that his case would be treated like Saldano's, and then had confessed error in the other cases identified as similar in the statement, but not in Buck's.  Id., at 674.  Because Buck had \"not shown extraordinary circumstances that would permit relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6),\" the panel \"den[ied] the application for a COA.\"  Id., at 669.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck's motion for rehearing en banc was denied over two dissenting votes.  Buck v. Stephens, 630 Fed. Appx. 251 (CA5 2015) (\u00a0per curiam).  We granted certiorari.  Buck v. Stephens, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A state prisoner whose petition for a writ of habeas corpus is denied by a federal district court does not enjoy an absolute right to appeal.  Federal law requires that he first obtain a COA from a circuit justice or judge.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(1).  A COA may issue \"only if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\"  \u00a72253(c)(2).  Until the prisoner secures a COA, the Court of Appeals may not rule on the merits of his case.  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.\u00a0S. 322, 336 (2003).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The COA inquiry, we have emphasized, is not coextensive with a merits analysis.  At the COA stage, the only question is whether the applicant has shown that \"jurists of reason could disagree with the district court's resolution of his constitutional claims or that jurists could conclude the issues presented are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\"  Id., at 327.  This threshold question should be decided without \"full consideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support of the claims.\"  Id., at 336.  \"When a court of appeals sidesteps [the COA] process by first deciding the merits of an appeal, and then justifying its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the actual merits, it is in essence deciding an appeal without jurisdiction.\"  Id., at 336-337.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court below phrased its determination in proper terms--that jurists of reason would not debate that Buck should be denied relief, 623 Fed. Appx., at 674--but it reached that conclusion only after essentially deciding the case on the merits.  As the court put it in the second sentence of its opinion: \"Because [Buck] has not shown extraordinary circumstances that would permit relief under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6), we deny the application for a COA.\"  Id., at 669.  The balance of the Fifth Circuit's opinion reflects the same approach.  The change in law effected by Martinez and Trevino, the panel wrote, was \"not an extraordinary circumstance.\"  623 Fed. Appx., at 674.  Even if Texas initially indicated to Buck that he would be resentenced, its \"decision not to follow through\" was \"not extraordinary.\"  Ibid.  Buck \"ha[d] not shown why\" the State's alleged broken promise \"would justify relief from the judgment.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the question for the Fifth Circuit was not whether Buck had \"shown extraordinary circumstances\" or \"shown why [Texas's broken promise] would justify relief from the judgment.\"  Id., at 669, 674.  Those are ultimate merits determinations the panel should not have reached.  We reiterate what we have said before: A \"court of appeals should limit its examination [at the COA stage] to a threshold inquiry into the underlying merit of [the] claims,\" and ask \"only if the District Court's decision was debatable.\"  Miller-El, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 327, 348.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent does not accept this established rule, arguing that a reviewing court that deems a claim nondebatable \"must necessarily conclude that the claim is meritless.\"  Post, at 2 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  Of course when a court of appeals properly applies the COA standard and determines that a prisoner's claim is not even debatable, that necessarily means the prisoner has failed to show that his claim is meritorious.  But the converse is not true.  That a prisoner has failed to make the ultimate showing that his claim is meritorious does not logically mean he failed to make a preliminary showing that his claim was debatable.  Thus, when a reviewing court (like the Fifth Circuit here) inverts the statutory order of operations and \"first decid[es] the merits of an appeal, .\u00a0.\u00a0. then justif[ies] its denial of a COA based on its adjudication of the actual merits,\" it has placed too heavy a burden on the prisoner at the COA stage.  Miller-El, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 336-337.  Miller-El flatly prohibits such a departure from the procedure prescribed by \u00a72253.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State defends the Fifth Circuit's approach by arguing that the court's consideration of an application for a COA is often quite thorough.  The court \"occasionally hears oral argument when considering whether to grant a COA in a capital case.\"  Brief for Respondent 50. Indeed, in one recent case, it \"received nearly 200 pages of initial briefing, permitted a reply brief, considered the parties' supplemental authorities, invited supplemental letter briefs from both sides, and heard oral argument before denying the request for a COA.\"  Id., at 50-51.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this hurts rather than helps the State's case.  \"[A] claim can be debatable even though every jurist of reason might agree, after the COA has been granted and the case has received full consideration, that petitioner will not prevail.\"  Miller-El, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 338.  The statute sets forth a two-step process: an initial determination whether a claim is reasonably debatable, and then--if it is--an appeal in the normal course.  We do not mean to specify what procedures may be appropriate in every case.  But whatever procedures are employed at the COA stage should be consonant with the limited nature of the  inquiry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the approach of the court below, it is perhaps understandable that the parties have essentially briefed and argued the underlying merits at length.  See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 32 (\"[T]rial counsel rendered deficient performance under Strickland.\"); id., at 39 (\"[T]here is a reasonable probability that Dr. Quijano's race-as-dangerousness opinion swayed the judgment of jurors in favor of death.\" (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)); id., at 59 (Buck \"has demonstrated his entitlement to relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\"); Brief for Respondent 40 (\"The particular facts of petitioner's case do not establish extraordinary circumstances justifying relief from the judgment.\" (boldface type deleted)).  With respect to this Court's review, \u00a72253 does not limit the scope of our consideration of the underlying merits, and at this juncture we think it proper to meet the decision below and the arguments of the parties on their own terms.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck's request for a COA raised two separate questions for the Fifth Circuit, one substantive and one procedural: first, whether reasonable jurists could debate the District Court's conclusion that Buck was not denied his right to effective assistance of counsel under Strickland; and second, whether reasonable jurists could debate the District Court's procedural holding that Buck had not made the necessary showing to reopen his case under Rule 60(b)(6).\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with the District Court's determination (not specifically addressed by the Fifth Circuit) that Buck's constitutional claim failed on the merits.  The Sixth Amendment right to counsel \"is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\"  Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 686 (quoting McMann v. Richardson, 397 U.\u00a0S. 759, 771, n.\u00a014 (1970)).  A defendant who claims to have been denied effective assistance must show both that counsel performed deficiently and that counsel's deficient performance  caused him prejudice.  466 U.\u00a0S., at 687.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strickland's first prong sets a high bar.  A defense lawyer navigating a criminal proceeding faces any number of choices about how best to make a client's case.  The lawyer has discharged his constitutional responsibility so long as his decisions fall within the \"wide range of professionally competent assistance.\"  Id., at 690.  It is only when the lawyer's errors were \"so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed .\u00a0.\u00a0. by the Sixth Amendment\" that Strickland's first prong is satisfied.  Id., at 687.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court determined that, in this case, counsel's performance fell outside the bounds of competent representation.  We agree.  Counsel knew that Dr. Quijano's report reflected the view that Buck's race disproportionately predisposed him to violent conduct; he also knew that the principal point of dispute during the trial's penalty phase was whether Buck was likely to act violently in the future.  Counsel nevertheless (1) called Dr. Quijano to the stand; (2) specifically elicited testimony about the connection between Buck's race and the likelihood of future violence; and (3) put into evidence Dr. Quijano's expert report that stated, in reference to factors bearing on future dangerousness, \"Race.  Black: Increased probability.\"  App. 19a, 145a-146a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that the jury had to make a finding of future dangerousness before it could impose a death sentence, Dr. Quijano's report said, in effect, that the color of Buck's skin made him more deserving of execution.  It would be patently unconstitutional for a state to argue that a defendant is liable to be a future danger because of his race.  See Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.\u00a0S. 862, 885 (1983) (identifying race among factors that are \"constitutionally impermissible or totally irrelevant to the sentencing process\").  No competent defense attorney would introduce such evidence about his own client.  See Buck v. Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 1022 (statement of Alito, J., joined by Scalia and Breyer, JJ., respecting denial of certiorari) (Buck's case \"concerns bizarre and objectionable testimony\").\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To satisfy Strickland, a litigant must also demonstrate prejudice--\"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 694.  Accordingly, the question before the District Court was whether Buck had demonstrated a reasonable probability that, without Dr. Quijano's testimony on race, at least one juror would  have harbored a reasonable doubt about whether Buck was likely to be violent in the future.  The District Court concluded that Buck had not made such a showing.  We disagree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In arguing that the jury would have imposed a death sentence even if Dr. Quijano had not offered race-based testimony, the State primarily emphasizes the brutality of Buck's crime and his lack of remorse.  A jury may conclude that a crime's vicious nature calls for a sentence of death.  See Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U.\u00a0S. 15 (2009) (\u00a0per curiam).  In this case, however, several considerations convince us that it is reasonably probable--notwithstanding the nature of Buck's crime and his behavior in its aftermath--that the proceeding would have ended differently had counsel rendered competent representation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Quijano testified on the key point at issue in Buck's sentencing.  True, the jury was asked to decide two issues--whether Buck was likely to be a future danger, and, if so, whether mitigating circumstances nevertheless justified a sentence of life imprisonment.  But the focus of the proceeding was on the first question.  Much of the penalty phase testimony was directed to future dangerousness, as were the summations for both sides.  The jury, consistent with the focus of the parties, asked during deliberations to see the expert reports on dangerousness.  See App. 187a-196a, 198a-203a, 209a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deciding the key issue of Buck's dangerousness involved an unusual inquiry.  The jurors were not asked to determine a historical fact concerning Buck's conduct, but to render a predictive judgment inevitably entailing a degree of speculation.  Buck, all agreed, had committed acts of terrible violence.  Would he do so again?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck's prior violent acts had occurred outside of prison, and within the context of romantic relationships with women.  If the jury did not impose a death sentence, Buck would be sentenced to life in prison, and no such romantic relationship would be likely to arise.  A jury could conclude that those changes would minimize the prospect of future dangerousness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But one thing would never change: the color of Buck's skin.  Buck would always be black.  And according to Dr. Quijano, that immutable characteristic carried with it an \"[i]ncreased probability\" of future violence.  Id., at 19a.  Here was hard statistical evidence--from an expert--to guide an otherwise speculative inquiry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And it was potent evidence.  Dr. Quijano's testimony appealed to a powerful racial stereotype--that of black men as \"violence prone.\"  Turner v. Murray, 476 U.\u00a0S. 28, 35 (1986) (plurality opinion).  In combination with the substance of the jury's inquiry, this created something of a perfect storm.  Dr. Quijano's opinion coincided precisely with a particularly noxious strain of racial prejudice, which itself coincided precisely with the central question at sentencing.  The effect of this unusual confluence of factors was to provide support for making a decision on life or death on the basis of race.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This effect was heightened due to the source of the testimony.  Dr. Quijano took the stand as a medical expert bearing the court's imprimatur.  The jury learned at the outset of his testimony that he held a doctorate in clinical psychology, had conducted evaluations in some 70 capital murder cases, and had been appointed by the trial judge (at public expense) to evaluate Buck.  App. 138a-141a.  Reasonable jurors might well have valued his opinion concerning the central question before them.  See Satterwhite v. Texas, 486 U.\u00a0S. 249, 259 (1988) (testimony from \"a medical doctor specializing in psychiatry\" on the question of future dangerousness may have influenced the sentencing jury).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, we cannot accept the District Court's conclusion that \"the introduction of any mention of race\" during the penalty phase was \"de minimis.\"  2014 WL 11310152, at *5.  There were only \"two references to race in Dr. Quijano's testimony\"--one during direct examination, the other on cross.  Ibid.  But when a jury hears expert testimony that expressly makes a defendant's race directly pertinent on the question of life or death, the impact of that evidence cannot be measured simply by how much air time it received at trial or how many pages it occupies in the record.  Some toxins can be deadly in small doses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State acknowledges, as it must, that introducing \"race or ethnicity as evidence of criminality\" can in some cases prejudice a defendant.  Brief for Respondent 31.  But it insists that this is not such a case, because Buck's own counsel, not the prosecution, elicited the offending testimony.  We are not convinced.  In fact, the distinction could well cut the other way.  A prosecutor is seeking a conviction.  Jurors understand this and may reasonably be expected to evaluate the government's evidence and arguments in light of its motivations.  When a defendant's own lawyer puts in the offending evidence, it is in the nature of an admission against interest, more likely to be taken at face value.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The effect of Dr. Quijano's testimony on Buck's sentencing cannot be dismissed as \"de minimis.\"  Buck has demonstrated prejudice.\nB\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now turn to the lower courts' procedural holding: that Buck failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to have the judgment against him reopened under Rule 60(b)(6).  We have held that a litigant seeking a COA must demonstrate that a procedural ruling barring relief is itself debatable among jurists of reason; otherwise, the appeal would not \"deserve encouragement to proceed further.\"  Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.\u00a0S. 473, 484 (2000) (quoting Barefoot v. Estelle, 463 U.\u00a0S. 880, 893, n.\u00a04 (1983)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rule 60(b)(6) holding Buck challenges would be reviewed for abuse of discretion during a merits appeal, see 11 C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72857 (3d ed. 2012), and the parties agree that the COA question is therefore whether a reasonable jurist could conclude that the District Court abused its discretion in declining to reopen the judgment.  See Brief for Petitioner 54-57; Brief for Respondent 34.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Buck brought his Rule 60(b) motion under the Rule's catchall category, subdivision (b)(6), which permits a court to reopen a judgment for \"any other reason that justifies relief.\"  Rule 60(b) vests wide discretion in courts, but we have held that relief under Rule 60(b)(6) is available only in \"extraordinary circumstances.\"  Gonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 535.  In determining whether extraordinary circumstances are present, a court may consider a wide range of factors.  These may include, in an appropriate case, \"the risk of injustice to the parties\" and \"the risk of undermining the public's confidence in the judicial process.\"  Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.\u00a0S. 847, 863-864 (1988).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the circumstances of this case, the District Court abused its discretion in denying Buck's Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  The District Court's conclusion that Buck \"ha[d] failed to demonstrate that this case presents extraordinary circumstances\" rested in large measure on its determination that \"the introduction of any mention of race\"--though \"ill[\u00a0]advised at best and repugnant at worst\"--played only a \"de minimis\" role in the proceeding.  2014 WL 11310152, at *5.  The Fifth Circuit, for its part, failed even to mention the racial evidence in concluding that Buck's claim was \"at least unremarkable as far as [ineffective assistance] claims go.\"  623 Fed. Appx., at 673.  But our holding on prejudice makes clear that Buck may have been sentenced to death in part because of his race.  As an initial matter, this is a disturbing departure from a basic premise of our criminal justice system: Our  law punishes people for what they do, not who they are.  Dispensing punishment on the basis of an immutable characteristic flatly contravenes this guiding principle.  As petitioner correctly puts it, \"[i]t stretches credulity to characterize Mr. Buck's [ineffective assistance of counsel] claim as run-of-the-mill.\"  Brief for Petitioner 57.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This departure from basic principle was exacerbated because it concerned race.  \"Discrimination on the basis of race, odious in all aspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of justice.\"  Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.\u00a0S. 545, 555 (1979).  Relying on race to impose a criminal sanction \"poisons public confidence\" in the judicial process.  Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 28).  It thus injures not just the defendant, but \"the law as an institution, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the community at large, and .\u00a0.\u00a0. the democratic ideal reflected in the processes of our courts.\"  Rose, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 556 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Such concerns are precisely among those we have identified as supporting relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  See Liljeberg, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 864.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The extraordinary nature of this case is confirmed by what the State itself did in response to Dr. Quijano's testimony.  When the case of Victor Hugo Saldano came before this Court, Texas confessed error and consented to resentencing.  The State's response to Saldano's petition for certiorari succinctly expressed the injustice Saldano had suffered: \"the infusion of race as a factor for the jury to weigh in making its determination violated his constitutional right to be sentenced without regard to the color of his skin.\"  App. 306a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Attorney General's public statement, issued shortly after we vacated the judgment in Saldano's case, reflected this sentiment.  It explained that the State had responded to Saldano's troubling petition by conducting a \"thorough audit\" of criminal cases, finding six similar to Saldano's \"in which testimony was offered by Dr. Quijano that race should be a factor for the jury to consider.\"  Id., at 213a.  The statement affirmed that \"it is inappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice system.\" Ibid.  Consistent with this position--and to its credit--the State confessed error in the cases of five of the six defendants identified in the Attorney General's statement, waiving all available procedural defenses and consenting to resentencing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These were remarkable steps.  It is not every day that a State seeks to vacate the sentences of five defendants found guilty of capital murder.  But then again, these were--as the State itself put it at oral argument here--\"extraordinary\" cases.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 41; see Buck v. Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 1030 (Sotomayor, J., joined by Kagan, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (\"Especially in light of the capital nature of this case and the express recognition by a Texas attorney general that the relevant testimony was inappropriately race charged, Buck has presented issues that 'deserve encouragement to proceed further.'\u00a0\" (quoting Miller-El, 537 U.\u00a0S., at 327)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, the State has repeatedly attempted to justify its decision to treat Buck differently from the other five defendants identified in the Attorney General's statement, including on asserted factual grounds that the State has been required to abjure.  See Brief for Respondent 46, n.\u00a010 (the State's initial opposition to Buck's habeas petition \"erroneously\" argued that Buck was treated differently because defense counsel, not the State, called Dr. Quijano as a witness; that was also true of two of the other defendants).  The State continues its efforts before this Court, arguing that Buck's was the only one of the six cases in which defense counsel, not the prosecution, first elicited Dr. Quijano's opinion on race.  See also post, at 8 (opinion of Thomas, J.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this is beside the point.  The State's various explanations for distinguishing Buck's case have nothing to do with the Attorney General's stated reasons for confessing error in Saldano and the cases acknowledged as similar.  Regardless of which party first broached the subject, race was in all these cases put to the jury \"as a factor .\u00a0.\u00a0. to weigh in making its determination.\"  App. 306a.  The statement that \"it is inappropriate to allow race to be considered as a factor in our criminal justice system\" is equally applicable whether the prosecution or ineffective defense counsel initially injected race into the proceeding.  Id., at 213a.  The terms of the State's announcement provide every reason for originally including Buck on the list of defendants situated similarly to Saldano, and no reason for later taking him off.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In opposition, the State reminds us of the importance of preserving the finality of judgments.  Brief for Respondent 34.  But the \"whole purpose\" of Rule 60(b) \"is to make an exception to finality.\"  Gonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 529.  And in this case, the State's interest in finality deserves little weight.  When Texas recognized that the infusion of race into proceedings similar to Saldano's warranted confession of error, it effectively acknowledged that the people of Texas lack an interest in enforcing a capital sentence obtained on so flawed a basis.  In concluding that the value of finality does not demand that we leave the District Court's judgment in place, we do no more than acknowledge what Texas itself recognized 17 years ago.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our Rule 60(b)(6) analysis has thus far omitted one significant element.  When Buck first sought federal habeas relief in 2004, Coleman barred the District Court from hearing his claim.  Today, however, a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel defaulted in a Texas postconviction proceeding may be reviewed in federal court if state habeas counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to raise it, and the claim has \"some merit.\"  Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 14; see Trevino, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  Buck cannot obtain relief unless he is entitled to the benefit of this rule--that is, unless Martinez and Trevino, not Coleman, would govern his case were it reopened.  If they would not, his claim would remain unreviewable, and Rule 60(b)(6) relief would be inappropriate.  See 11 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72857 (showing \"a good claim or defense\" is a precondition of Rule 60(b)(6) relief\u00a0).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Until merits briefing in this Court, both parties litigated this matter on the assumption that Martinez and Trevino would apply if Buck reopened his case.  See Pet. for Cert. 27-28; Brief in Opposition 11-13; Amended Application for Certificate of Appealability and Brief in Support 26, Respondent-Appellee's Opposition to Pet. for En Banc Rehearing 9-11, and Respondent's Opposition to Application for Certificate of Appealability 15-17 in No. 14-70030 (CA5); Amended Response to Motion for Relief from Judgment in No. 4:04-cv-03965 (SD Tex.), pp. 11-13.  But the State's brief adopts a new position on this issue.  The State now argues that those cases announced a \"new rule\" that, under Teague v. Lane, 489 U.\u00a0S. 288 (1989) (plurality opinion), does not apply retroactively to cases (like Buck's) on collateral review.  Brief for Respondent 38-40.  Buck responds that Teague analysis applies only to new rules of criminal procedure that govern trial proceedings--not new rules of habeas procedure that govern collateral proceedings--and that the State has in any event waived its Teague argument.  Reply Brief 20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We agree that the argument has been waived.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, 552 U.\u00a0S. 264, 289 (2008) (\"States can waive a Teague defense .\u00a0.\u00a0. by failing to raise it in a timely manner\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\").  It was not advanced in District Court, before the Fifth Circuit, or in the State's brief in opposition to Buck's petition for certiorari.  Although we may reach the issue in our discretion, we have observed before that a State's failure to raise a Teague argument at the petition stage is particularly \"significant\" in deciding whether such an exercise of discretion is appropriate.  Schiro v. Farley, 510 U.\u00a0S. 222, 228-229 (1994).  When \"a legal issue appears to warrant review, we grant certiorari in the expectation of being able to decide that issue.\"  Id., at 229.  If we were to entertain the State's eleventh-hour Teague argument and find it persuasive, Buck's Strickland and Rule 60(b)(6) contentions--the issues we thought worthy of review--would be insulated from our consideration.  We therefore decline to reach the Teague question and conclude that Martinez and Trevino apply to Buck's claim.  We reach no broader determination concerning the application of these cases.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that Buck has demonstrated both ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland and an entitlement to relief under Rule 60(b)(6).  It follows that the Fifth Circuit erred in denying Buck the COA required to pursue these claims on appeal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-8049\nDUANE EDWARD BUCK, PETITIONER v. LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL  INSTITUTIONS DIVISION\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit\n[February 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having settled on a desired outcome, the Court bulldozes procedural obstacles and misapplies settled law to justify it.  But the majority's focus on providing relief to petitioner in this particular case has at least one upside: Today's decision has few ramifications, if any, beyond the highly unusual facts presented here.  The majority leaves entirely undisturbed the black-letter principles of collateral review, ineffective assistance of counsel, and Rule 60(b)(6) law that govern day-to-day operations in federal courts.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reversing the judgment below, the majority relies on three grounds: that the Fifth Circuit misapplied the standard for granting a certificate of appealability (COA); that the District Court erroneously rejected petitioner's Sixth Amendment ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim; and that the District Court abused its discretion in rejecting petitioner's Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(6) motion to reopen the court's earlier judgment denying habeas relief.  On each ground, the majority simply disagrees with the courts below over the application of the governing standard.  The majority does not announce any new standards or suggest that the District Court or the Fifth Circuit applied the wrong standards altogether.  See, e.g., ante, at 13 (\"The court below phrased its determination in proper terms .\u00a0.\u00a0. \").  I agree with the majority that the courts below identified the correct standards for all three of these inquiries.  Contrary to the majority's conclusion, however, I would hold that they correctly applied those standards, too.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, the Court wrongly criticizes the Fifth Circuit for its application of the COA standard.  A COA is warranted only if the district court's ruling is \"debatable amongst jurists of reason.\"  Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.\u00a0S. 322, 336 (2003).  To answer this question, a court must conduct a \"general assessment\" of the merits of a defendant's claim.  Ibid.  The majority faults the Fifth Circuit for concluding outright that petitioner \"\u00a0'has not shown extraordinary circumstances that would permit relief under [Rule] 60(b)(6).'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 13 (quoting Buck v. Stephens, 623 Fed. Appx. 668, 669 (CA5 2015)).  In the majority's view, the existence of extraordinary circumstances represents an \"ultimate merits determinatio[n] the panel should not have reached.\"  Ante, at 13-14.  Instead, according to the majority, the panel should have limited itself to the threshold question whether the merits were debatable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's criticism of the Fifth Circuit is misplaced.  A court may grant a COA even if it might ultimately conclude that the underlying claim is meritless, so long as the claim is debatable.  Miller-El, supra, at 336.  But to deny a COA, a court must necessarily conclude that the claim is meritless.  A reviewing court cannot determine that a claim is indisputably meritless (that is, nondebatable) without first deciding that it is meritless.  See Slack v. McDaniel, 529 U.\u00a0S. 473, 484 (2000) (\"Where a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case,\" the claim is not debatable (emphasis added)); Weeks v. Angelone, 528 U.\u00a0S. 225, 231, 234 (2000) (affirming denial of COA after determining that petitioner's claim was meritless).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In concluding that petitioner's claims were indisputably meritless as a prelude to denying the COA, the Fifth Circuit thus adopted the approach that courts must take in denying a COA.  The majority might disagree with the conclusion that petitioner's claims are indisputably meritless, but its criticism of the Fifth Circuit's approach is most certainly misguided.  The majority's contrary approach would prevent a court of appeals from denying a COA in any case, an outcome that Congress and our precedents have plainly foreclosed.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72253(c)(2) (COA warranted only if petitioner makes \"a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right\"); Miller-El, supra, at 337 (The \"issuance of a COA must not be pro\u00a0forma or a matter of course\").  The majority's comment that \"[u]ntil the prisoner secures a COA, the Court of Appeals may not rule on the merits of his case,\" ante, at 12, should not be taken at face value.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, after chastising the Court of Appeals for making an end run around the COA standard in order to reach the merits of petitioner's Rule 60(b) claim, the Court does precisely that.  See ante, at 26 (\"[W]e conclude that Buck has demonstrated .\u00a0.\u00a0. an entitlement to relief under Rule 60(b)(6)\").  Astonishingly, the Court also decides the merits of petitioner's Sixth Amendment claim--an issue that was not even \"addressed by the Fifth Circuit.\"  Ante, at 16; see ante, at 26 (\"Buck has demonstrated .\u00a0.\u00a0. ineffective assistance of counsel under Strickland [v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984)]\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After reaching out to adjudicate the merits, the Court relies on its merits disposition to justify reversing the Fifth Circuit's denial of a COA.  Ante, at 26 (\"It follows that the Fifth Circuit erred in denying Buck the COA required to pursue these claims on appeal\" (emphasis added)).  This unapologetic course reversal--made without so much as a hint of the irony--is striking.  The majority also has things just backwards.  It criticizes the Fifth Circuit for undertaking a merits inquiry to deny a COA (when such an inquiry is required) and then it conducts a merits inquiry to decide that petitioner's claim is debatable (when such an inquiry is inappropriate).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's application of the standard in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984), is similarly misguided.  In particular, the Court erroneously finds that petitioner's claim satisfies Strickland's second prong, which requires a defendant to show that his counsel's mistake materially prejudiced his defense.  Prejudice exists only when correcting the alleged error would have produced a \"substantial\" likelihood of a different result.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 111-112 (2011).  Here, the sentence of death hinged on the jury's finding that petitioner posed a threat of future dangerousness.  Texas' standard for making such a finding is not difficult to satisfy: \"The facts of the offense alone may be sufficient to sustain the jury's finding of future dangerousness,\" and \"[a] jury may also infer a defendant's future dangerousness from evidence showing a lack of remorse.\"  Buntion v. State, 482 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 58, 66-67 (Tex. Crim. App. 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority neglects even to mention the relevant legal standard in Texas, relying instead on rhetoric and speculation to craft a finding of prejudice.  But the prosecution's evidence of both the heinousness of petitioner's crime and his complete lack of remorse was overwhelming.  Accordingly, Dr. Quijano's \"de minimis\" racial testimony, Buck v. Stephens, 2014 WL 11310152, *5 (SD Tex., Aug. 29, 2014), did not prejudice petitioner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the facts leave no doubt that this crime was premeditated and cruel.  The Court recites defense testimony describing the killing spree here as a \"crime of passion,\" ante, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted), but the record belies that characterization.  The rampage occurred at the home of Debra Gardner, petitioner's ex-girlfriend.  Prior to the shooting, petitioner called her house.  His stepsister, Phyllis Taylor, answered, and petitioner asked to speak with Gardner.  Gardner declined, and petitioner hung up.  Petitioner then retrieved a shotgun and rifle, loaded both guns, and drove 28 miles to Gardner's house.  Upon arrival, he broke down the door and opened fire without provocation.  The shooting did not occur in the heat of the moment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to describing this as a crime of passion, the majority also parrots defense testimony that petitioner's violence was limited to \"the context of romantic relationships.\"  Ante, at 18.  But this assertion is also quite wrong.  Upon entering Gardner's house, petitioner first shot at an acquaintance, Harold Ebnezer.  He next approached his stepsister, Taylor, who was seated on the couch.  He said, \"\u00a0'I'm going to shoot your ass too.'\u00a0\"  App. 82a.  She begged him, \"\u00a0'Duane, please don't shoot me.  I'm your sister.  I don't deserve to be shot.  Remember I do have children.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 83a.  Petitioner ignored her pleas, placed the gun on her chest, and shot her.  Petitioner does not claim that he was in a romantic relationship with either Ebnezer or Taylor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After shooting Taylor, petitioner cornered one of Gardner's friends, Kenneth Butler, and shot him, as well.  He then exited the house and chased Gardner into the middle of the street.  She turned to him and pleaded, \"\u00a0'Please don't shoot me.  Please don't shoot me.  Why are you doing this in front of my kids?'\u00a0\"  Id., at 104a.  Her son, Devon, watched from the sidewalk.  Her daughter, Shennel, begged petitioner to spare her mother and even attempted to restrain him.  Petitioner pointed the gun at Gardner and said, \"\u00a0'I'm going to shoot you.  I'm going to shoot your A[ss].'\u00a0\"  Id., at 117a.  He then did so.  The flight path of the bullet suggests that Gardner was on her knees when petitioner shot her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the evidence of petitioner's lack of remorse, largely ignored by the majority, is startling.  After shooting Gardner, petitioner walked back to his car and placed the firearms in the trunk.  He then returned to taunt Gardner where she lay mortally wounded and bleeding in the street.  He said, \"\u00a0'It ain't funny now.  You ain't laughing now.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 106a.  Police arrived shortly thereafter and arrested him.  In the patrol car, petitioner was \"laughing and joking and taunting.\"  Id., at 71a.  He continued to smile and laugh during the drive to the police station.  When one of the officers informed petitioner that he did not find the situation humorous, petitioner replied that \"\u00a0'[t]he bitch got what she deserved.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 135a.  He remained happy and upbeat for the remainder of the drive, even commenting that he was going to heaven because God had already forgiven him.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the majority incorrectly concludes that the District Court erred in denying petitioner's motion under Rule 60(b)(6), which permits district courts to reopen otherwise final judgments only in \"extraordinary circumstances.\"  Ackermann v. United States, 340 U.\u00a0S. 193, 199 (1950).  Although the majority pays lip service to the fact that the District Court's decision on this point is subject to \"limited and deferential appellate review,\" Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.\u00a0S. 524, 535 (2005); see ante, at 20-21, it proceeds to conduct a de\u00a0novo review.  Indeed, the majority references the District Court's analysis only once in the entire section of its opinion addressing Rule 60(b)(6).  But the question is not whether this Court thinks the circumstances are extraordinary; the question is whether reasonable jurists would debate that the District Court abused its discretion in reaching the equitable, highly factbound conclusion that they are not.  Particularly in light of our admonition that such circumstances \"will rarely occur in the habeas context,\"  545 U.\u00a0S., at 535, I think it is not debatable that the District Court acted within its discretion in denying Rule 60(b)(6) relief here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reversing the Fifth Circuit, the centerpiece of the Court's analysis is its observation that \"\u00a0'[d]iscrimination on the basis of race, odious in all aspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of justice.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 22 (quoting Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.\u00a0S. 545, 555 (1979)).  I agree that racial classifications are categorically impermissible under the Equal Protection Clause--but petitioner is not raising an equal protection claim.  The many precedents the Court cites interpreting that Clause are therefore beside the point.  Instead, petitioner is claiming that his case presents extraordinary circumstances under Rule 60(b)(6).  The majority identifies no precedents regarding race in the Rule 60(b)(6) context.  And certainly nothing in the text or history of Rule 60(b)(6)--unlike the text and history of the Equal Protection Clause--suggests that race-based claims demand unique solicitude in this context.  At the very least, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that they do not.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a similar vein, the majority suggests that the use of race in petitioner's capital proceeding injured the public's confidence in the integrity of our judicial system.  Ante, at 22.  This argument cannot be squared with the District Court's finding that the challenged racial testimony was \"de minimis.\"  2014 WL 11310152, at *5.  It also ignores the fact that petitioner's own counsel elicited the testimony.  The majority obscures this point by citing cases concerning alleged racial discrimination by an agent of the state.  See ante, at 22 (citing, e.g., Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015) (addressing the prosecutor's use of peremptory strikes and holding that any constitutional error was harmless)).  There, the injury to public confidence derives from the fact that the government itself is discriminating against the defendant.  The same cannot be said, however, when defense counsel introduces harmful testimony or makes a bad strategic choice.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In conjunction with its observations about race, the Court notes that the Texas attorney general, in response to similar testimony from Dr. Quijano in another case, issued a press release decrying the use of race in the justice system and subsequently waived all procedural obstacles to resentencing in several cases in which Dr. Quijano testified.  But Texas had good reason for treating this case differently from the others.  Of those cases, this is the only one where \"it can be said that the responsibility for eliciting the offensive testimony lay squarely with the defense.\"  Buck v. Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 1022, 1025 (2011) (Alito, J., statement respecting denial of certiorari).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, the Court belittles Texas' claimed interest in finality.  In the majority's view, Texas effectively forfeited its finality interest when it waived its procedural defenses in purportedly similar cases.  See ante, at 24.  But Texas did not waive its procedural defenses in this case, and, in any event, Texas is not alone in possessing an interest in the finality of petitioner's sentence.  Society at large has the same interest.  Finality advances values \"essential to the operation of our criminal justice system.\"  Teague v. Lane, 489 U.\u00a0S. 288, 309 (1989) (plurality opinion).  It promotes the law's deterrent effect; it provides peace of mind to a wrongdoer's victims; it promotes public confidence in the justice system; it conserves limited public resources; and it ensures the clarity of legal rights and statuses.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's finality analysis also ignores the lengthy passage of time (nearly eight years) between the District Court's original rejection of habeas relief in this case and petitioner's filing of the instant Rule 60(b)(6) motion.  See Gonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 542, n.\u00a04 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\"In cases where significant time has elapsed between a habeas judgment and the relevant change in procedural law, it would be within a district court's discretion to leave such a judgment in repose\").  Permitting a defendant to file a Rule 60(b) motion years after the fact functionally eviscerates the statute of limitations contained in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, thereby undermining its purpose of \"lend[ing] finality to state court judgments within a reasonable time.\"  Day v. McDonough, 547 U.\u00a0S. 198, 205-206 (2006) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite its errors, today's opinion should have little effect on the broader law, for two reasons.  For one thing, the Court's reasoning is highly factbound, and the facts presented here are unlikely to arise again.  For another, although the majority misapplies settled principles, it does not purport to actually alter any of those principles.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is an unusual case, and the majority's single-minded focus on according relief to this petitioner on these facts naturally limits the reach of its decision.  In cases presenting different facts, today's decision will provide little guidance.  The Court's ultimate conclusion relies on the convergence of three critical factors that will rarely, if ever, recur.  See ante, at 19 (describing this case as involving an \"unusual confluence of factors\" that together create a \"perfect storm\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court places special weight on the fact that this is a capital case.  See, e.g., ante, at 23 (noting \"the capital nature of this case\" as a factor favoring Rule 60(b)(6) relief (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Second, the Court notes that the testimony at issue was expressly racial and suggested that petitioner was more deserving of the death penalty because he is black.  See, e.g., ante, at 21 (\"Buck may have been sentenced to death in part because of his race.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [T]his is a disturbing departure from a basic premise of our criminal justice system\").3  Third, the Court explains that the state attorney general took the \"remarkable steps,\" ante, at 23, of publicly declaring that Dr. Quijano's testimony in this case was inappropriate and waiving all procedural defenses to resentencing in similar cases.  See, e.g., ante, at 22 (\"The extraordinary nature of this case is confirmed by what the State itself did in response to Dr. Quijano's testimony\").\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The effect of today's decision is also limited for a second reason.  Although the majority misapplies many existing doctrines, it refrains from announcing any new principles of law.  In particular, it leaves untouched--and courts should accordingly continue to apply as usual--established principles governing collateral review, ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims, and Rule 60(b)(6) motions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset, the opinion leaves intact Miller-El's well-worn COA standard for habeas petitions: Courts of appeals should deny applications when the district court's ruling is not \"debatabl[y]\" wrong.  537 U.\u00a0S., at 336; see ante, at 13.  \"A prisoner seeking a COA must prove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith on his or her part.\"  537 U.\u00a0S., at 338 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Courts have substantial discretion in deciding how to structure this inquiry.  See ante, at 15 (\"We do not mean to specify what procedures may be appropriate in every case\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court also reaffirms the \"\u00a0'highly deferential'\u00a0\" character of the Strickland standard.  Harrington, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 105 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 689); see, e.g., ante, at 16 (first prong of Strickland \"sets a high bar\").  Courts applying Strickland must respect \"the constitutionally protected independence of counsel and the wide latitude counsel must have in making tactical decisions.\"  Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.\u00a0S. 170, 195 (2011) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  Counsel should be \"strongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\"  Id., at 189 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And a defendant can show prejudice only if the likelihood of a different result would have been \"substantial, not just conceivable.\"  Harrington, supra, at 112.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps most significantly, the test for reopening judgments under Rule 60(b)(6) remains the same.  A \"\u00a0'very strict interpretation of Rule 60(b) is essential if the finality of judgments is to be preserved.'\u00a0\"  Gonzalez, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 535 (quoting Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.\u00a0S. 847, 873 (1988) (Rehnquist, C. J., dissenting)).  A district court may grant relief only if the movant can show \"extraordinary circumstances,\" which \"will rarely occur in the habeas context.\"  545 U.\u00a0S., at 535. (internal quotation marks omitted); see ante, at 10.  A change in law alone is not enough.  See 545 U.\u00a0S., at 536-537.  And a district court's decision to deny relief is subject to only \"limited and deferential\" appellate review.  Id., at 535.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although petitioner argues that the change in law effected by Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2012), and Tre- vino v. Thaler, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013), is central to the Rule 60(b)(6) inquiry, see Brief for Petitioner 56; Reply Brief 19, the Court does not even count those decisions in its tally of extraordinary circumstances.  Instead, it treats a potentially viable Martinez claim as a \"precondition\" to relief.  Ante, at 25.  This makes sense: Unless petitioner has the ability to invoke Martinez and Trevino, reopening the judgment would be futile.  For those in petitioner's position, the absence of a potentially valid Martinez claim is disqualifying, but the presence of one does nothing to demonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Court's opinion does not require the lower courts to reflexively accord relief to petitioner on remand.  In order to succeed under Martinez and Trevino, petitioner must establish that his state habeas counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to raise a Strickland claim as to his trial counsel.  Today's decision does not address that showing, and the court on remand should not treat it as a foregone conclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0The Federal Courts of Appeals appear to disagree over whether a COA is needed to appeal the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion.  See Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.\u00a0S. 524, 535, and n.\u00a07 (2005).  In keeping with the approach adopted by the Fifth Circuit below and by the parties in their briefs, we assume without deciding that a COA is required here.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0That is especially true given that Dr. Quijano's testimony is relevant to the Rule 60(b)(6) inquiry, under the majority's reasoning, only insofar as it was prejudicial.  See ante, at 21 (\"[O]ur holding on prejudice makes clear that Buck may have been sentenced to death in part because of his race\").  As I have explained, the testimony was not prejudicial.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Although the prosecution on cross-examination asked Dr. Quijano a single question about his views on race, the question arose in the course of canvassing his expert report, and did not extend beyond the testimony already elicited by the defense.

Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council Constr. Industry Pension Fund, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___; see 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777k(a).  Section 13 provides two time limits for \u00a711 suits.  The first sentence states that an action \"must be brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  The second sentence provides that \"[i]n no event shall any such action be brought .\u00a0.\u00a0. more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  \u00a777m.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2007 and 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. raised capital through several public securities offerings.  Petitioner, the largest public pension fund in the country, purchased some of those securities; and it is alleged that respondents, various financial firms, are liable under the Act for their participation as underwriters in the transactions.  In 2008, a putative class action was filed against respondents in the Southern District of New York.  The complaint raised \u00a711 claims, alleging that the registration statements for certain of Lehman's 2007 and 2008 securities offerings included material misstatements or omissions.  Because the complaint was filed on behalf of all persons who purchased the identified securities, petitioner was a member of the putative class.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In February 2011, more than three years after the relevant securities offerings, petitioner filed a separate complaint against respondents in the Northern District of California, alleging violations identical to those in the class action on petitioner's own behalf.  Soon thereafter, a proposed settlement was reached in the putative class action, but petitioner opted out of the class.  Respondents then moved to dismiss petitioner's individual suit, alleging that the \u00a711 violations were untimely under the 3-year bar in the second sentence of \u00a713.  Petitioner countered that the 3-year period was tolled during the pendency of the class-action filing, relying on American Pipe & Construction Co. v. Utah, 414 U.\u00a0S. 538.  The trial court disagreed, and the Second Circuit affirmed, holding that American Pipe's tolling principle is inapplicable to the 3-year bar.  It also rejected petitioner's alternative argument that the timely filing of the class action made petitioner's individual claims timely as well.\nHeld:\u00a0Petitioner's untimely filing of its individual complaint more than three years after the relevant securities offering is ground for dismissal.  Pp.\u00a04-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Section 13's 3-year time limit is a statute of repose not subject to equitable tolling.  Pp.\u00a04-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0The two categories of statutory time bars--statutes of limitations and statutes of repose--each have \"a distinct purpose.\"  CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  Statutes of limitations are designed to encourage plaintiffs \"\u00a0'to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims,'\u00a0\" id., at ___, while statutes of repose \"effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should 'be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time,'\u00a0\" id., at ___.  For this reason, statutes of limitations begin to run \"when the cause of action accrues,\" while statutes of repose begin to run on \"the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.\"  Id., at ___.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the structure of \u00a713, and the language of its second sentence, it is evident that the 3-year bar is a statute of repose.  The instruction that \"[i]n no event\" shall an action be brought more than three years after the relevant securities offering admits of no exception.  The statute also runs from the defendant's last culpable act (the securities offering), not from the accrual of the claim (the plaintiff's discovery of the defect).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This view is confirmed by \u00a713's two-sentence structure.  The pairing of a shorter statute of limitations and a longer statute of repose is a common feature of statutory time limits.  See, e.g., Gabelli v. SEC, 568 U.\u00a0S. 442, 453.  Section 13's history also supports the classification.  The 1933 Securities Act's original 2-year discovery period and 10-year outside limit were shortened a year later.  The evident design of the shortened period was to protect defendants' financial security by reducing the open period for potential liability.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The determination that the 3-year period is a statute of repose is critical here, for the question whether a tolling rule applies to a given statutory time bar is one \"of statutory intent.\"  Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.\u00a0S. 1, ___.  In light of the purpose of a statute of repose, the provision is in general not subject to tolling.  Tolling is permissible only where there is a particular indication that the legislature did not intend the statute to provide complete repose but instead anticipated the extension of the statutory period under certain circumstances.  A statute of repose implements a \"\u00a0'legislative decisio[n] that .\u00a0.\u00a0. there should be a specific time beyond which a defendant should no longer be subjected to protracted liability.'\u00a0\"  CTS, 573 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  The unqualified nature of that determination supersedes the courts' residual authority and forecloses the extension of the statutory period based on equitable principles.  Thus, the Court repeatedly has stated that statutes of repose are not subject to equitable tolling.  See, e.g., id., at ___-___.  Pp.\u00a07-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3)\u00a0The tolling decision in American Pipe derived from equity principles and therefore cannot alter the unconditional language and purpose of the 3-year statute of repose.  The source of the tolling rule applied in American Pipe is the judicial power to promote equity, not the power to interpret and enforce statutory provisions.  Nothing in the decision suggests that its tolling rule was mandated by a statute or federal rule.  Moreover, the Court relied on cases that are paradigm applications of equitable tolling principles, see 414 U.\u00a0S., at 559.  Thus, the Court has previously referred to American Pipe as \"equitable tolling.\"  See, e.g., Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.\u00a0S. 89, 96, and n.\u00a03.  Pp.\u00a08-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(4)\u00a0Petitioner's counterarguments are unpersuasive.  First, petitioner contends that this case is indistinguishable from American Pipe, but the statute there was one of limitations, which may be tolled by equitable considerations even where a statute of repose may not.  Second, petitioner argues that the timely filing of a class-action complaint fulfills the purposes of a statutory time limit with regard to later filed suits by individual members of the class.  But by permitting a class action to splinter into individual suits, the application of American Pipe tolling here would threaten to alter and expand a defendant's accountability, contradicting the substance of a statute of repose.  Third, petitioner contends that dismissal of its individual suit as untimely would eviscerate its ability to opt out, but it does not follow from any privilege to opt out that an ensuing suit can be filed without regard to mandatory time limits.  Fourth, petitioner argues that declining to apply American Pipe tolling to statutes of repose will create inefficiencies, but this Court \"lack[s] the authority to rewrite\" the statute of repose or to ignore its plain import.  Baker Botts L. L. P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U. S. ___, ___.  And petitioner's practical concerns likely are overstated.  Pp.\u00a011-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Also unpersuasive is petitioner's alternative argument: that \u00a713's requirement that an \"action\" be \"brought\" within three years of the relevant securities offering is met here because the filing of the class-action complaint \"brought\" petitioner's individual \"action\" within the statutory time period.  This argument presumes that an \"action\" is \"brought\" when substantive claims are presented to any court, rather than when a particular complaint is filed in a particular court.  The term \"action,\" however, refers to a judicial \"proceeding,\" or perhaps a \"suit\"--not to the general content of claims.  Taken to its logical limit, petitioner's argument would make an individual action timely even if it were filed decades after the original securities offering--provided a class-action complaint had been filed within the initial 3-year period.  Congress would not have intended this result.  This argument is also inconsistent with the reasoning in American Pipe itself.  If the filing of a class action made all subsequent actions by putative class members timely, there would be no need for tolling at all.  Pp.\u00a014-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The final analysis is straightforward.  Because \u00a713's 3-year time bar is a statute of repose, it displaces the traditional power of courts to modify statutory time limits in the name of equity.  And because the American Pipe tolling rule is rooted in those equitable powers, it cannot extend the 3-year period.  Petitioner's untimely filing of its individual action is thus ground for dismissal.  Pp.\u00a016-17.\n655 Fed.

The class-action suit had been filed within the time permitted by statute.  Whether the later, separate suit was also timely is the controlling question.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Securities Act of 1933 \"protects investors by ensuring that companies issuing securities .\u00a0.\u00a0. make a 'full and fair disclosure of information' relevant to a public offering.\"  Omnicare, Inc. v. Laborers Dist. Council Constr. Industry Pension Fund, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 1) (quoting Pinter v.

Companies may offer securities to the public only after filing a registration statement, which must contain information about the company and the security for sale.

These time limits are set forth in a two-sentence section of the Act, \u00a713.  It provides as follows: \n\"No action shall be maintained to enforce any liability created under [\u00a711] unless brought within one year after the discovery of the untrue statement or the omission, or after such discovery should have been made by the exercise of reasonable diligence .\u00a0.\u00a0. . In no event shall any such action be brought to enforce a liability created under [\u00a711] more than three years after the security was bona fide offered to the public .\u00a0.\u00a0. .\" 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777m.\nSo there are two time bars in the quoted provision; and the second one, the 3-year bar, is central to this case.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. formerly was one of the largest investment banks in the United States.  In 2007 and 2008, Lehman raised capital through a number of public securities offerings.  Petitioner, California Public Employees' Retirement System (sometimes called CalPERS), is the largest public pension fund in the country.  Petitioner purchased securities in some of these Lehman offerings; and it is alleged that respondents, various financial firms, are liable under the Act for their participation as underwriters in the transactions.  The separate respondents are listed in an appendix to this opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In September 2008, Lehman filed for bankruptcy.  Around the same time, a putative class action concerning Lehman securities was filed against respondents in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  The operative complaint raised claims under \u00a711, alleging that the registration statements for certain of Lehman's 2007 and 2008 securities offerings included material misstatements or omissions.  The complaint was filed on behalf of all persons who purchased the identified securities, making petitioner a member of the putative class.  Petitioner, however, was not one of the named plaintiffs in the suit.  The class action was consolidated with other securities suits against Lehman in a single multidistrict litigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In February 2011, petitioner filed a separate complaint against respondents in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  This suit was filed more than three years after the relevant transactions occurred.  The complaint alleged identical securities law violations as the class-action complaint, but the claims were on petitioner's own behalf.  The suit was transferred and consolidated with the multidistrict litigation in the Southern District of New York.  Soon thereafter, a proposed settlement was reached in the putative class action.  Petitioner, apparently convinced it could obtain a more favorable recovery in its separate suit, opted out of the class.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents then moved to dismiss petitioner's individual suit alleging \u00a711 violations as untimely under the 3-year bar in the second sentence of \u00a713.  Petitioner countered that its individual suit was timely because that 3-year period was tolled during the pendency of the class-action filing.  The principal authority cited to support petitioner's argument that the 3-year period was tolled was American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.\u00a0S. 538 (1974).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court disagreed with petitioner's argument, holding that the 3-year bar in \u00a713 is not subject to tolling.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed.  In agreement with the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the tolling principle discussed in American Pipe is inapplicable to the 3-year time bar.  In re Lehman Brothers Securities and ERISA Litigation, 655 Fed. Appx. 13, 15 (2016).  As the Court of Appeals noted, there is disagreement about whether the tolling rule of American Pipe applies to the 3-year time bar in \u00a713.  Compare Joseph v. Wiles, 223 F.\u00a03d 1155, 1166-1168 (CA10 2000), with Stein v. Regions Morgan Keegan Select High Income Fund, Inc., 821 F.\u00a03d 780, 792-795 (CA6 2016), and Dusek v. JPMorgan Chase & Co., 832 F.\u00a03d 1243, 1246-1249 (CA11 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals also rejected petitioner's alternative argument that its individual claims were \"essentially 'filed' in the putative class complaint,\" so that the filing of the class action within three years made the individual claims timely.  655 Fed. Appx., at 15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court granted certiorari.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question then is whether \u00a713 permits the filing of an individual complaint more than three years after the relevant securities offering, when a class-action complaint was timely filed, and the plaintiff filing the individual complaint would have been a member of the class but for opting out of it.  The answer turns on the nature and purpose of the 3-year bar and of the tolling rule that petitioner seeks to invoke.  Each will be addressed in turn.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court explained in CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), statutory time bars can be divided into two categories: statutes of limitations and statutes of repose.  Both \"are mechanisms used to limit the temporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts,\" but \"each has a distinct purpose.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 5-6). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statutes of limitations are designed to encourage plaintiffs \"to pursue diligent prosecution of known claims.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In accord with that objective, limitations periods begin to run \"when the cause of action accrues\"--that is, \"when the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In a personalinjury or property-damage action, for example, more  often than not this will be \"\u00a0'when the injury occurred or was discovered.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In contrast, statutes of repose are enacted to give more explicit and certain protection to defendants.  These statutes \"effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 6-7) (internal quotation marks omitted).  For this reason, statutes of repose begin to run on \"the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 3-year time bar in \u00a713 reflects the legislative objective to give a defendant a complete defense to any suit after a certain period.  From the structure of \u00a713, and the language of its second sentence, it is evident that the 3-year bar is a statute of repose.  In fact, this Court has already described the provision as establishing \"a period of repose,\" which \"\u00a0'impose[s] an outside limit'\u00a0\" on temporal liability.  Lampf, Pleva, Lipkind, Prupis & Petigrow v. Gilbertson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 350, 363 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute provides in clear terms that \"[i]n no event\" shall an action be brought more than three years after the securities offering on which it is based.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777m.  This instruction admits of no exception and on its face creates a fixed bar against future liability.  See CTS, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 6-7); cf. United States v. Brockamp, 519 U.\u00a0S. 347, 350 (1997) (noting that a statute that \"sets forth its time limitations in unusually emphatic form .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot easily be read as containing implicit exceptions\").  The statute, furthermore, runs from the defendant's last culpable act (the offering of the securities), not from the accrual of the claim (the plaintiff's discovery of the defect in the registration statement).  Under CTS, this point is close to a dispositive indication that the statute is one of repose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This view is confirmed by the two-sentence structure of \u00a713.  In addition to the 3-year time bar, \u00a713 contains a 1-year statute of limitations.  The limitations statute runs from the time when the plaintiff discovers (or should have discovered) the securities-law violation.  The pairing of a shorter statute of limitations and a longer statute of repose is a common feature of statutory time limits.  See, e.g., Gabelli v. SEC, 568 U.\u00a0S. 442, 453 (2013) (\"[S]tatutes applying a discovery rule .\u00a0.\u00a0. often couple that rule with an absolute provision for repose\").  The two periods work together: The discovery rule gives leeway to a plaintiff who has not yet learned of a violation, while the rule of repose protects the defendant from an interminable threat of liability.  Cf. Merck & Co. v. Reynolds, 559 U.\u00a0S. 633, 650 (2010) (reasoning that 2-year discovery rule would not \"subject defendants to liability for acts taken long ago,\" because the statute also included an \"unqualified bar on actions instituted '5 years after such violation'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The history of the 3-year provision also supports its classification as a statute of repose.  It is instructive to note that the statute was not enacted in its current form.  The original version of the 1933 Securities Act featured a 2-year discovery period and a 10-year outside limit, see \u00a713, 48 Stat. 84, but Congress changed this framework just one year after its enactment.  The discovery period was changed to one year and the outside limit to three years.  See Securities Exchange Act of 1934, \u00a7207, 48 Stat. 908.  The evident design of the shortened statutory period was to protect defendants' financial security in fast-changing markets by reducing the open period for potential liability.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The determination that the 3-year period is a statute of repose is critical in this case, for the question whether a tolling rule applies to a given statutory time bar is one \"of statutory intent.\"  Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.\u00a0S. 1, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8).  The purpose of a statute of repose is to create \"an absolute bar on a defendant's temporal liability,\" CTS, 573 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted); and that purpose informs the assessment of whether, and when, tolling rules may apply.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the purpose of a statute of repose, the provision is in general not subject to tolling.  Tolling is permissible only where there is a particular indication that the legislature did not intend the statute to provide complete repose but instead anticipated the extension of the statutory period under certain circumstances.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, if the statute of repose itself contains an express exception, this demonstrates the requisite intent to alter the operation of the statutory period.  See 1 C. Corman, Limitation of Actions \u00a71.1, pp. 4-5 (1991) (Corman); see, e.g., 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71113 (establishing a 6-year statute of repose, but stipulating that, in case of fraud, the 6-year period runs from the plaintiff's discovery of the violation).  In contrast, where the legislature enacts a general tolling rule in a different part of the code--e.g., a rule that suspends time limits until the plaintiff reaches the age of majority--courts must analyze the nature and relation of the legislative purpose of each provision to determine which controls.  See 2 Corman \u00a710.2.1, at 108.  In keeping with the statute-specific nature of that analysis, courts have reached different conclusions about whether general tolling statutes govern particular periods of repose.  Ibid., n. 15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, not all tolling rules derive from legislative enactments.  Some derive from the traditional power of the courts to \"\u00a0'apply the principles .\u00a0.\u00a0. of equity jurisprudence.'\u00a0\"  Young v. United States, 535 U.\u00a0S. 43, 50 (2002) (alteration omitted).  The classic example is the doctrine of equitable tolling, which permits a court to pause a statutory time limit \"when a litigant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely action.\"  Lozano, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  Tolling rules of that kind often apply to statutes of limitations based on the presumption that Congress \"\u00a0'legislate[s] against a background of common-law adjudicatory principles.'\u00a0\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose and effect of a statute of repose, by contrast, is to override customary tolling rules arising from the equitable powers of courts.  By establishing a fixed limit, a statute of repose implements a \"\u00a0'legislative decisio[n] that as a matter of policy there should be a specific time beyond which a defendant should no longer be subjected to protracted liability.'\u00a0\"  CTS, 573 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  The unqualified nature of that determination supersedes the courts' residual authority and forecloses the extension of the statutory period based on equitable principles.  For this reason, the Court repeatedly has stated in broad terms that statutes of repose are not subject to equitable tolling.  See, e.g., id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 7-8); Lampf, Pleva, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 363.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner contends that the 3-year provision is subject to tolling based on the rationale and holding in the Court's decision in American Pipe.  The language of the 3-year statute does not refer to or impliedly authorize any exceptions for tolling.  If American Pipe had itself been grounded in a legislative enactment, perhaps an argument could be made that the enactment expressed a legislative objective to modify the 3-year period.  If, however, the tolling decision in American Pipe derived from equity principles, it cannot alter the unconditional language and purpose of the 3-year statute of repose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In American Pipe, a timely class-action complaint was filed asserting violations of federal antitrust law.  414 U.\u00a0S., at 540.  Class certification was denied because the class was not large enough, see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(a)(1), and individuals who otherwise would have been members of the class then filed motions to intervene as individual plaintiffs.  The motions were denied on the grounds that the applicable 4-year time bar had expired.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a715b.  The Court of Appeals reversed, permitting intervention.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court affirmed.  It held the individual plaintiffs' motions to intervene were timely because \"the commencement of a class action suspends the applicable statute of limitations as to all asserted members of the class.\"  American Pipe, 414 U.\u00a0S., at 554.  The Court reasoned that this result was consistent \"both with the procedures of Rule 23 and with the proper function of the limitations statute\" at issue.  Id., at 555.  First, the tolling furthered \"the purposes of litigative efficiency and economy\" served by Rule 23.  Id., at 556.  Without the tolling, \"[p]otential class members would be induced to file protective motions to intervene or to join in the event that a class was later found unsuitable,\" which would \"breed needless duplication of motions.\"  Id., at 553-554.  Second, the tolling was in accord with \"the functional operation of a statute of limitations.\"  Id., at 554.  By filing a class complaint within the statutory period, the named plaintiff \"notifie[d] the defendants not only of the substantive claims being brought against them, but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.\"  Id., at 555.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this discussion indicates, the source of the tolling rule applied in American Pipe is the judicial power to promote equity, rather than to interpret and enforce statutory provisions.  Nothing in the American Pipe opinion suggests that the tolling rule it created was mandated by the text of a statute or federal rule.  Nor could it have.  The central text at issue in American Pipe was Rule 23, and Rule 23 does not so much as mention the extension or suspension of statutory time bars.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's holding was instead grounded in the traditional equitable powers of the judiciary.  The Court described its rule as authorized by the \"judicial power to toll statutes of limitations.\"  Id., at 558; see also id., at 555 (\"the tolling rule we establish here\" (emphasis added)).  The Court also relied on cases that are paradigm applications of equitable tolling principles, explaining with approval that tolling in one such case was based on \"considerations 'deeply rooted in our jurisprudence.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 559 (quoting Glus v. Brooklyn Eastern Dist. Terminal, 359 U.\u00a0S. 231, 232 (1959); alteration omitted); see also 414 U.\u00a0S., at 559 (citing Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.\u00a0S. 392 (1946)).  The Court noted too that \"bad faith\" was not the cause of the District Court's denial of class certification.  414 U.\u00a0S., at 553 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps for these reasons, this Court has referred to American Pipe as \"equitable tolling.\"  See Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.\u00a0S. 89, 96, and n.\u00a03 (1990); see also Young, supra, at 49; Greyhound Corp. v. Mt. Hood Stages, Inc., 437 U.\u00a0S. 322, 338, n. (1978) (Burger, C.\u00a0J., concurring) (using American Pipe as an example  of \"[t]he authority of a federal court, sitting as a chancellor, to toll a statute of limitations on equitable grounds\").  It is true, however, that the American Pipe Court did not consider the criteria of the formal doctrine of equitable tolling in any direct manner.  It did not analyze, for example, whether the plaintiffs pursued their rights with special care; whether some extraordinary circumstance prevented them from intervening earlier; or whether the defendant engaged in misconduct.  See Holland v. Florida, 560 U.\u00a0S. 631, 649 (2010) (identifying these considerations); Young, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 50 (same).  The balance of the Court's reasoning nonetheless reveals a rule based on traditional equitable powers, designed to modify a statutory time bar where its rigid application would create injustice.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This analysis shows that the American Pipe tolling rule does not apply to the 3-year bar mandated in \u00a713.  As explained above, the 3-year limit is a statute of repose.  See supra, at 5-7.  And the object of a statute of repose, to grant complete peace to defendants, supersedes the application of a tolling rule based in equity.  See supra, at 7-8.  No feature of \u00a713 provides that deviation from its time limit is permissible in a case such as this one.  To the contrary, the text, purpose, structure, and history of the statute all disclose the congressional purpose to offer defendants full and final security after three years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner raises four counterarguments, but they are not persuasive.  First, petitioner contends that this case is indistinguishable from American Pipe itself.  If the 3-year bar here cannot be tolled, petitioner reasons, then there was no justification for the American Pipe Court's contrary decision to suspend the time bar in that case.  American Pipe, however, is distinguishable.  The statute in American Pipe was one of limitations, not of repose; it began to run when \"\u00a0'the cause of action accrued.'\u00a0\"  414 U.\u00a0S., at 541, n.\u00a02 (quoting 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a715b).  The statute in the instant case, however, is a statute of repose.  Consistent with the different purposes embodied in statutes of limitations and statutes of repose, it is reasonable that the former may be tolled by equitable considerations even though the latter in most circumstances may not.  See supra, at 7-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, petitioner argues that the filing of a class-action complaint within three years fulfills the purposes of a statutory time limit with regard to later filed suits by individual members of the class.  That is because, according to petitioner, the class complaint puts a defendant on notice as to the content of the claims against it and the set of potential plaintiffs who might assert those claims.  It is true that the American Pipe Court, in permitting tolling, suggested that generic notice satisfied the purposes of the statute of limitations in that case.  See 414 U.\u00a0S., at 554-555.  While this was deemed sufficient in balancing the equities to allow tolling under the antitrust statute, it must be noted that here the analysis differs because the purpose of a statute of repose is to give the defendant full protection after a certain time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the number and identity of individual suits, where they may be filed, and the litigation strategies they will use are unknown, a defendant cannot calculate its potential liability or set its own plans for litigation with much precision.  The initiation of separate individual suits may thus increase a defendant's practical burdens.  See, e.g., Cottreau, Note, The Due Process Right To Opt Out of Class Actions, 73 N.\u00a0Y. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 480, 486, and n. 29 (1998) (\"A defendant's transaction costs are likely to be reduced by having to defend just one action\").  The emergence of individual suits, furthermore, may increase a defendant's financial liability; for plaintiffs who opt out have considerable leverage and, as a result, may obtain outsized recoveries.  See, e.g., Coffee, Accountability and Competition in Securities Class Actions: Why \"Exit\" Works Better Than \"Voice,\" 30 Cardozo L.\u00a0Rev. 407, 417, 432-433 (2008); Perino, Class Action Chaos?  The Theory of the Core and an Analysis of Opt-Out Rights in Mass Tort Class Actions, 46 Emory L.\u00a0J. 85, 97 (1997).  These uncertainties can put defendants at added risk in conducting business going forward, causing destabilization in markets which react with sensitivity to these matters.  By permitting a class action to splinter into individual suits, the application of American Pipe tolling would threaten to alter and expand a defendant's accountability, contradicting the substance of a statute of repose.  All this is not to suggest how best to further equity under these circumstances but simply to support the recognition that a statute of repose supersedes a court's equitable balancing powers by setting a fixed time period for claims to end.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, petitioner contends that dismissal of its individual suit as untimely would eviscerate its ability to opt out, an ability this Court has indicated should not be disregarded.  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\u00a0S. 338, 363 (2011).  It does not follow, however, from any privilege to opt out that an ensuing suit can be filed without regard to mandatory time limits set by statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, petitioner argues that declining to apply American Pipe tolling to statutes of repose will create inefficiencies.  It contends that nonnamed class members will inundate district courts with protective filings.  Even if petitioner were correct, of course, this Court \"lack[s] the authority to rewrite\" the statute of repose or to ignore its plain import.  Baker Botts L. L. P. v. ASARCO LLC, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 12).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And petitioner's concerns likely are overstated.  Petitioner has not offered evidence of any recent influx of protective filings in the Second Circuit, where the rule affirmed here has been the law since 2013.  This is not surprising.  The very premise of class actions is that \"\u00a0'small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.'\u00a0\"  Amchem Products, Inc. v. Windsor, 521 U.\u00a0S. 591, 617 (1997).  Many individual class members may have no interest in protecting their right to litigate on an individual basis.  Even assuming that they do, the process is unlikely to be as onerous as petitioner claims.  A simple motion to intervene or request to be included as a named plaintiff in the class-action complaint may well suffice.  See, e.g., Brief for Washington Legal Foundation as Amicus Curiae 6-11 (describing procedures); Brief for Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association et al. as Amici Curiae 16, 19-20 (same).  District courts, furthermore, have ample means and methods to administer their dockets and to ensure that any additional filings proceed in an orderly fashion.  Cf. Dietz v. Bouldin, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6) (\"[D]istrict courts have the inherent authority to manage their dockets and courtrooms with a view toward the efficient and expedient resolution of cases\").\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner makes an alternative argument that does not depend on tolling.  Petitioner submits its individual suit was timely in any event.  Section 13 provides that an \"action\" must be \"brought\" within three years of the relevant securities offering.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777m.  Petitioner argues that requirement is met here because the filing of the class-action complaint \"brought\" petitioner's individual \"action\" within the statutory time period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument rests on the premise that an \"action\" is \"brought\" when substantive claims are presented to any court, rather than when a particular complaint is filed in a particular court.  The term \"action,\" however, refers to a judicial \"proceeding,\" or perhaps to a \"suit\"--not to the general content of claims.  See Black's Law Dictionary 41 (3d\u00a0ed. 1933) (defining \"action\" as, inter alia, \"an ordinary proceeding in a court of justice\"); see also id., at 43 (\"The terms 'action' and 'suit' are .\u00a0.\u00a0. nearly, if not entirely, synonymous\").  Whether or not petitioner's individual complaint alleged the same securities law violations as the class-action complaint, it defies ordinary understanding to suggest that its filing--in a separate forum, on a separate date, by a separate named party--was the same \"action,\" \"proceeding,\" or \"suit.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The limitless nature of petitioner's argument, furthermore, reveals its implausibility.  It appears that, in petitioner's view, the bringing of the class action would make any subsequent action raising the same claims timely.  Taken to its logical limit, an individual action would be timely even if it were filed decades after the original securities offering--provided a class-action complaint had been filed at some point within the initial 3-year period.  Congress would not have intended this result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner's argument also fails because it is inconsistent with the reasoning in American Pipe itself.  If the filing of a class action made all subsequent actions by putative class members timely, there would be no need for tolling at all.  Yet this Court has described American Pipe as creating a tolling rule, necessary to permit the ensuing individual actions to proceed.  See, e.g., American Pipe, 414 U.\u00a0S., at 555; Irwin, 498 U.\u00a0S., at 96, n.\u00a03; Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.\u00a0S. 345, 350 (1983).  Indeed, the American Pipe Court reasoned that the class-action complaint \"was filed with 11 days yet to run\" in the statutory period, so the motions for intervention were timely only if filed within 11 days after the denial of class certification.  414 U.\u00a0S., at 561.  If the filing of the class action \"brought\" any included individual actions, it would have sufficed for the Court to note the date on which the class action was filed and deem all subsequent individual actions proper, regardless when filed.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tolling may be of great value to allow injured persons to recover for injuries that, through no fault of their own, they did not discover because the injury or the perpetrator was not evident until the limitations period otherwise would have expired.  This is of obvious utility in the securities market, where complex transactions and events can be obscure and difficult for a market participant to analyze or apprehend.  In a similar way, tolling as allowed in American Pipe may protect plaintiffs who anticipated their interests would be protected by a class action but later learned that a class suit could not be maintained for reasons outside their control.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The purpose of a statute of repose, on the other hand, is to allow more certainty and reliability.  These ends, too, are a necessity in a marketplace where stability and reliance are essential components of valuation and expectation for financial actors.  The statute in this case reconciles these different ends by its two-tier structure: a conventional statute of limitations in the first clause and a statute of repose in the second.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute of repose transforms the analysis.  In a hypothetical case with a different statutory scheme, consisting of a single limitations period without an additional outer limit, a court's equitable power under American Pipe in many cases would authorize the relief petitioner seeks.  Here, however, the Court need not consider how equitable considerations should be formulated or balanced, for the mandate of the statute of repose takes the case outside the bounds of the American Pipe rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The final analysis, then, is straightforward.  The 3-year time bar in \u00a713 of the Securities Act is a statute of repose.  Its purpose and design are to protect defendants against future liability.  The statute displaces the traditional power of courts to modify statutory time limits in the name of equity.  Because the American Pipe tolling rule is rooted in those equitable powers, it cannot extend the 3-year period.  Petitioner's untimely filing of its individual action is ground for dismissal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDIX\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents are the following financial securities firms: ANZ Securities, Inc.; Bankia, S.\u00a0A.; BBVA Securities Inc.; BMO Capital Markets Corp.; BNP Paribas FS, LLC; BNP Paribas S.\u00a0A.; BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC; CIBC World Markets Corp.; Citigroup Global Markets Inc.; Daiwa Capital Markets Europe Limited; DZ Financial Markets LLC; HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.; HVB Capital Markets, Inc.; ING Financial Markets LLC; Mizuho Securities USA Inc.; M.\u00a0R.

That complaint informed respondents of the substance of the claims asserted against them and the identities of potential claimants.  See American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.\u00a0S. 538, 554-555 (1974); Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.\u00a0S. 345, 353 (1983).  Respondents, in other words, received what \u00a713's repose period was designed to afford them: notice of their potential liability within a fixed time window.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complaint also \"commence[d] the action for all members of the class.\"  American Pipe, 414 U.\u00a0S., at 550.  Thus, when petitioner California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) elected to exercise the right safeguarded by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(c)(2)(B)(v), i.e., the right to opt out of the class and proceed independently, CalPERS' claim remained timely.  See American Pipe, 414 U.\u00a0S., at 550 (demanding that class members \"individually meet the timeliness requirements .\u00a0.\u00a0. is simply inconsistent with Rule 23\").  Given the due process underpinning of the opt-out right, see Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\u00a0S. 338, 363 (2011), I resist rendering the right illusory for CalPERS and similarly situated class members.  I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit.  Accordingly, I dissent from today's decision, under which opting out cuts off any chance for recovery.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CalPERS' claim against respondents was timely launched when the class representative filed a complaint pursuant to \u00a711 of the Securities Act, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777k, on behalf of all members of the described class, CalPERS among them.  See American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U.\u00a0S. 538, 550 (1974) (under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, \"the filing of a timely class action complaint commences the action for all members of the class\").  See also ante, at 3 (CalPERS was part of putative class).  Filing the class complaint within three years of the date the securities specified in that complaint were offered to the public also satisfied \u00a713's statute of repose.  As the Court observes, ante, at 5, statutes of repose \"effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from [facing] liability after the legislatively determined period of time.\"  CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2014) (slip op., at 6-7) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A repose period assures a party who might be drawn into litigation that, if no action is brought within a specified time, he will be off the hook.  But whether CalPERS stayed in the class or eventually filed separately, respondents would have known, within the repose period, of their potential liability to all putative class members.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A class complaint \"notifies the defendants not only of the substantive claims being brought against them, but also of the number and generic identities of the potential plaintiffs who may participate in the judgment.\"  Crown, Cork & Seal Co. v. Parker, 462 U.\u00a0S. 345, 353 (1983) (quoting American Pipe, 414 U.\u00a0S., at 555).  The class complaint filed against respondents provided that very notice: It identified \"the essential information necessary to determine both the subject matter and size of the prospective litigation,\" id., at 555--i.e., the class of plaintiffs, the offering documents, and the alleged untrue statements and misleading omissions in those documents, see App. 50-66.  \"[A] defendant faced with [such] information about a potential liability to a class cannot be said to have reached a state of repose that should be protected.\"  Developments in the Law: Class Actions, 89 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1318, 1451 (1976).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When CalPERS elected to pursue individually the claims already stated in the class complaint against the same defendants, it simply took control of the piece of the action that had always belonged to it.  CalPERS' statement of the same allegations in an individual complaint could not disturb anyone's repose, for respondents could hardly be at rest once notified of the potential claimants and the precise false or misleading statements alleged to infect the registration statements at issue.1  CalPERS' decision to opt out did change two things: (1) CalPERS positioned itself to exercise its constitutional right to go it alone, cutting loose from a monetary settlement it deemed insufficient; and (2) respondents had to deal with CalPERS and its attorneys in addition to the named plaintiff and class counsel.  Although those changes may affect how litigation subsequently plays out, see ante, at 12-13, they do not implicate the concerns that prompted \u00a713's repose period: The class complaint disclosed the same information respondents would have received had each class member instead filed an individual complaint on the day the class complaint was filed.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's decision disserves the investing public that \u00a711 was designed to protect.  The harshest consequences will fall on those class members, often least sophisticated, who fail to file a protective claim within the repose period.  Absent a protective claim filed within that period, those members stand to forfeit their constitutionally shielded right to opt out of the class and thereby control the prosecution of their own claims for damages.  See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.\u00a0S. 338, 363 (2011) (\"In the context of a class action predominantly for money damages,\" the \"absence of .\u00a0.\u00a0. opt-out violates due process.\").  Because critical stages of securities class actions, including the class-certification decision, often occur years after the filing of a class complaint,2 the risk is high that class members failing to file a protective claim will be saddled with inadequate representation or an inadequate judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's ruling will also gum up the works of class litigation.  Defendants will have an incentive to slow walk discovery and other precertification proceedings so the clock will run on potential opt outs.  Any class member with a material stake in a \u00a711 case, including every fiduciary who must safeguard investor assets, will have strong cause to file a protective claim, in a separate complaint or in a motion to intervene, before the three-year period expires.  See Brief for Retired Federal Judges as Amici Curiae 9-14.  Such filings, by increasing the costs and complexity of the litigation, \"substantially burden the courts.\"  Id., at 13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's decision impels courts and class counsel to take on a more active role in protecting class members' opt-out rights.  See id., at 11-13.  As the repose period nears expiration, it should be incumbent on class counsel, guided by district courts, to notify class members about the consequences of failing to file a timely protective claim.  \"At minimum, when notice goes out to a class beyond [\u00a713's limitations period], a district court will need to assess whether the notice [should] alert class members that opting out .\u00a0.\u00a0. would end [their] chance for recovery.\"  Id., at 20.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, I would hold that the filing of the class complaint commenced CalPERS' action under \u00a711 of the Securities Act, thereby satisfying \u00a713's statute of repose.  Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Second Circuit.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0To rank as a continuation of an action timely brought and serving the purpose of repose, the individual complaint may raise only those claims stated in the class complaint and must be launched while the class suit is still pending.\nFootnote 2\u00a0A recent study showed, for example, that the time from the filing of a securities class complaint to the class-certification decision exceeds two years in 66% of cases and exceeds three years in 36% of cases.

By night's end, Hutton had recovered his sewing machine, Simmons was in the hospital with two gunshot wounds to the head, and Mitchell was nowhere to be found.  Simmons survived, but Mitchell was found dead a few weeks later, also having been shot twice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than 30 years ago, an Ohio jury convicted Hutton of aggravated murder, attempted murder, and kidnaping.  In connection with the aggravated murder conviction, the jury made two additional findings: that Hutton engaged in \"a course of conduct involving the .\u00a0.\u00a0. attempt to kill two or more persons,\" and that Hutton murdered Mitchell while \"committing, attempting to commit, or fleeing immediately after .\u00a0.\u00a0. kidnapping,\" Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a72929.04(A)(5), (7) (Lexis 1982).  Because of these \"aggravating circumstances,\" Ohio law required that Hutton be sentenced to \"death, life imprisonment without parole, [or] life imprisonment with parole eligibility after\" no fewer than 20 years in prison.  \u00a72929.03(C)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several days after rendering its verdict, the jury reconvened for the penalty phase of the trial.  The State argued for the death penalty.  In opposition, Hutton gave an unsworn statement professing his innocence and presented evidence about his background and psychological profile.  When the presentations concluded, the trial court instructed the jury that it could recommend a death sentence only if it unanimously found that the State had \"prove[d] beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances, of which the Defendant was found guilty, outweigh[ed] the [mitigating factors].\"  State v. Hutton, 100 Ohio St. 3d 176, 185, 2003-Ohio-5607, 797 N.\u00a0E. 2d 948, 958; see Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72929.03(D)(2).  The jury deliberated and recommended death.  The trial court accepted the recommendation after also finding, \"beyond a reasonable doubt, .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the aggravating circumstances .\u00a0.\u00a0. outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors.\"  \u00a72929.03(D)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ohio Court of Appeals and the Ohio Supreme Court affirmed Hutton's death sentence.  In doing so, both concluded that \"the evidence support[ed] the finding of the aggravating circumstances.\"  \u00a72929.05(A); see Hutton, 100 Ohio St. 3d, at 187, 797 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 961; State v. Hutton, 72 Ohio App. 3d 348, 350, 594 N.\u00a0E. 2d 692, 694 (1995).  The courts also \"independently weigh[ed] all of the facts .\u00a0.\u00a0. to determine whether the aggravating circumstances [Hutton] was found guilty of committing outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors.\"  Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \u00a72929.05(A).  Both agreed with the jury and the trial court that \"aggravating circumstances outweigh[ed] the mitigating factors,\" and that a death sentence was warranted.  Hutton, 100 Ohio St. 3d, at 191, 797 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 963-964; see Hutton, 72 Ohio App. 3d, at 352, 594 N.\u00a0E. 2d, at 695.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The case before this Court concerns Hutton's subsequent petition for federal habeas relief.  In 2005, Hutton filed such a petition pursuant to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254, arguing that the trial court violated his due process rights during the penalty phase of his trial.  According to Hutton, the court gave the jurors insufficient guidance because it failed to tell them that, when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, they could consider only the two aggravating factors they had found during the guilt phase.  Hutton, however, had not objected to the trial court's instruction or raised this argument on direct appeal, and the District Court on federal habeas concluded that his due process claim was procedurally defaulted.  Hutton v. Mitchell, 2013 WL 2476333, *64 (ND Ohio, June 7, 2013); see State v. Hutton, 53 Ohio St. 3d 36, 39, n.\u00a01, 559 N.\u00a0E. 2d 432, 437-438, n. 1 (1990) (declining to address trial court's instructions because Hutton \"specifically declined to object .\u00a0.\u00a0. at trial, and ha[d] not raised or briefed the issue\" on appeal).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  The court concluded that, notwithstanding the procedural default, it could \"reach the merits\" of Hutton's claim to \"avoid a fundamental miscarriage of justice.\"  Hutton v. Mitchell, 839 F. 3d 486, 498 (2016) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Sixth Circuit began its analysis with Sawyer v. Whitley, 505 U.\u00a0S. 333 (1992).  In that decision, this Court established that a habeas petitioner may obtain review of a defaulted claim upon \"show[ing] by clear and convincing evidence that, but for a constitutional error, no reasonable jury would have found [him] eligible for the death penalty under the applicable state law.\"  Id., at 336.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hutton had not argued that this exception to default applied to his case.  Nonetheless, the Sixth Circuit held that the exception justified reviewing his claim.  The court gave two reasons: First, Hutton was not eligible to receive a death sentence because \"the jury had not made the necessary finding of the existence of aggravating circumstances.\"  839 F.\u00a03d, at 498-499.  And second, since the trial court \"gave the jury no guidance as to what to consider as aggravating circumstances\" when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, the record did not show that the jury's death recommendation \"was actually based on a review of any valid aggravating circumstances.\"  Id., at 500.  On the merits, the court concluded that the trial court violated Hutton's constitutional rights by giving an erroneous jury instruction.  Judge Rogers dissented on the ground that Hutton could not overcome the procedural default.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Circuit was wrong to reach the merits of Hutton's claim.  The court's first reason for excusing default was that \"the jury had not [found] the existence of aggravating circumstances.\"  Id., at 498-499.  But it had, at the guilt phase of Hutton's trial.  As Judge Rogers pointed out, \"the jury found two such factors\"--engaging in a course of conduct designed to kill multiple people and committing kidnaping--\"in the process of convicting Hutton .\u00a0.\u00a0. of aggravated murder.\"  Id., at 511.  Each of those findings \"rendered Hutton eligible for the death penalty.\"  Ibid.  Hutton has not argued that the trial court improperly instructed the jury about aggravating circumstances at the guilt phase.  Nor did the Sixth Circuit identify any such error.  Instead, the instruction that Hutton contends is incorrect, and that the Sixth Circuit analyzed, was given at the penalty phase of trial.  That penalty phase instruction plainly had no effect on the jury's decision--delivered after the guilt phase and pursuant to an unchallenged instruction--that aggravating circumstances were present when Hutton murdered Mitchell.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Circuit's second reason for reaching the merits rests on a legal error.  Under Sawyer, a court may review a procedurally defaulted claim if, \"but for a constitutional error, no reasonable jury would have found the petitioner eligible for the death penalty.\"  505 U.\u00a0S., at 336 (emphasis added).  Here, the alleged error was the trial court's failure to specify that, when weighing aggravating and mitigating factors, the jury could consider only the aggravating circumstances it found at the guilt phase.  Assuming such an error can provide a basis for excusing default, the Sixth Circuit should have considered the following: Whether, given proper instructions about the two aggravating circumstances, a reasonable jury could have decided that those aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating circumstances.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the court did not ask that question.  Instead, it considered whether, given the (alleged) improper instructions, the jury might have been relying on invalid aggravating circumstances when it recommended a death sentence.  See 839 F.\u00a03d, at 500 (explaining that, because the trial court gave \"no guidance as to what to consider as aggravating circumstances,\" the court could not determine whether the death recommendation \"was actually based on a review of any valid aggravating circumstances\").  The court, in other words, considered whether the alleged error might have affected the jury's verdict, not whether a properly instructed jury could have recommended death.  That approach, which would justify excusing default whenever an instructional error could have been relevant to a jury's decision, is incompatible with Sawyer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither Hutton nor the Sixth Circuit has \"show[n] by clear and convincing evidence that\"--if properly instructed--\"no reasonable juror would have\" concluded that the aggravating circumstances in Hutton's case outweigh the mitigating circumstances.  Sawyer, 505 U. S., at 336.  In fact, the trial court, Ohio Court of Appeals, and Ohio Supreme Court each independently weighed those factors and concluded that the death penalty was justified.  On the facts of this case, the Sixth Circuit was wrong to hold that it could review Hutton's claim under the miscarriage of justice exception to procedural default.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for certiorari and motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\nCHARLOTTE JENKINS, WARDEN v.

Mitchell and Simmons denied the accusation, but Hutton remained suspicious.  On the night of September 16, 1985, he lured the pair into his car and, after pointing a gun at each, drove them around town in search of the machine.

Second, if racial considerations did predominate, the State must prove that its race-based sorting of voters serves a \"compelling interest\" and is \"narrowly tailored\" to that end, Bethune-Hill, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  This Court has long assumed that one compelling interest is compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA or Act).  When a State invokes the VRA to justify race-based districting, it must show (to meet the \"narrow tailoring\" requirement) that it had \"good reasons\" for concluding that the statute required its action.  Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  A district court's factual findings made in the course of this two-step inquiry are reviewed only for clear error.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6); Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.\u00a0S. 234, 242 (Cromartie II).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case concerns North Carolina's redrawing of two congressional districts, District 1 and District 12, after the 2010 census.  Prior to that redistricting, neither district had a majority black voting-age population (BVAP), but both consistently elected the candidates preferred by most African-American voters.  The new map significantly altered both District 1 and District 12.  The State needed to add almost 100,000 people to District 1 to comply with the one-person-one-vote principle, and it chose to take most of those people from heavily black areas of Durham--increasing the district's BVAP from 48.6% to 52.7%.  The State also reconfigured District 12, increasing its BVAP from 43.8% to 50.7%.  Registered voters in those districts (here called \"the plaintiffs\") filed suit against North Carolina officials (collectively, \"the State\" or \"North Carolina\"), complaining of impermissible racial gerrymanders.  A three-judge District Court held both districts unconstitutional.  It found that racial considerations predominated in the drawing of District 1's lines and rejected the State's claim that this action was justified by the VRA.  As for District 12, the court again found that race predominated, and it explained that the State made no attempt to justify its attention to race in designing that district.  \nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0North Carolina's victory in a similar state-court lawsuit does not dictate the disposition of this case or alter the applicable standard of review.  Before this case was filed, a state trial court rejected a claim by several civil rights groups that Districts 1 and 12 were unlawful racial gerrymanders.  The North Carolina Supreme Court affirmed that decision under the state-court equivalent of clear error review.  The State claims that the plaintiffs are members of the same organizations that brought the earlier case, and thus precluded from raising the same questions anew.  But the State never satisfied the District Court that the alleged affiliation really existed.  And because the District Court's factual finding was reasonable, it defeats North Carolina's attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State's backup argument about the proper standard of review also falls short.  The rule that a trial court's factual findings are reviewed only for clear error contains no exception for findings that diverge from those made in another court.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).  Although the state court's decision is certainly relevant, the premise of clear error review is that there are often \"two permissible views of the evidence.\"  Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.\u00a0S. 564, 574.  Even assuming that the state court's findings capture one such view, the only question here is whether the District Court's assessment represents another.  Pp.\u00a07-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The District Court did not err in concluding that race furnished the predominant rationale for District 1's redesign and that the State's interest in complying with the VRA could not justify that consideration of race.  Pp.\u00a010-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The record shows that the State purposefully established a racial target for the district and that the target \"had a direct and significant impact\" on the district's configuration, Alabama, 575 U. S., at ___, subordinating other districting criteria.  Faced with this body of evidence, the District Court did not clearly err in finding that race predominated in drawing District 1; indeed, it could hardly have concluded anything but.  Pp.\u00a010-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0North Carolina's use of race as the predominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.  The State argues that it had good reasons to believe that it had to draw a majority-minority district to avoid liability for vote dilution under \u00a72 of the VRA.  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.\u00a0S. 30, identifies three threshold conditions for proving such a vote-dilution claim: (1) A \"minority group\" must be \"sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority\" in some reasonably configured legislative district, id., at 50; (2) the minority group must be \"politically cohesive,\" id., at 51; and (3) a district's white majority must \"vote[\u00a0] sufficiently as a bloc\" to usually \"defeat the minority's preferred candidate,\" ibid.  If a State has good reason to think that all three of these conditions are met, then so too it has good reason to believe that \u00a72 requires drawing a majority-minority district.  But if not, then not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, electoral history provided no evidence that a \u00a72 plaintiff could demonstrate the third Gingles prerequisite.  For nearly 20 years before the new plan's adoption, African-Americans made up less than a majority of District 1's voters, but their preferred candidates scored consistent victories.  District 1 thus functioned as a \"crossover\" district, in which members of the majority help a \"large enough\" minority to elect its candidate of choice.  Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.\u00a0S. 1, 13 (plurality opinion).  So experience gave the State no reason to think that the VRA required it to ramp up District 1's BVAP.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State counters that because it needed to substantially increase District 1's population, the question facing the state mapmakers was not whether the then-existing District 1 violated \u00a72, but whether the future District 1 would do so if drawn without regard to race.  But that reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify the State's race-based redesign of the district.  Most important, the State points to no meaningful legislative inquiry into the key issue it identifies: whether a new, enlarged District 1, created without a focus on race, could lead to \u00a72 liability.  To have a strong basis to conclude that \u00a72 demands race-based measures to augment a district's BVAP, the State must evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the Gingles preconditions in a new district created without those measures.  Nothing in the legislative record here fits that description.  And that is no accident:  The redistricters believed that this Court's decision in Strickland mandated a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1.  They apparently reasoned that if, as Strickland held, \u00a72 does not require crossover districts (for groups insufficiently large under Gingles), then \u00a72 also cannot be satisfied by crossover districts (for groups meeting Gingles' size condition).  But, as this Court's \u00a72 jurisprudence makes clear, unless each of the three Gingles prerequisites is established, \"there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.\"  Growe v. Emison, 507 U.\u00a0S. 25, 41.  North Carolina's belief that it was compelled to redraw District 1 (a successful crossover district) as a majority-minority district thus rested on a pure error of law.  Accordingly, the Court upholds the District Court's conclusion that the State's use of race as the predominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.  Pp.\u00a012-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0The District Court also did not clearly err by finding that race predominated in the redrawing of District 12.  Pp.\u00a018-34.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The district's legality turns solely on which of two possible reasons predominantly explains its reconfiguration.  The plaintiffs contended at trial that North Carolina intentionally increased District 12's BVAP in the name of ensuring preclearance under \u00a75 of the VRA.  According to the State, by contrast, the mapmakers moved voters in and out of the district as part of a \"strictly\" political gerrymander, without regard to race.  After hearing evidence supporting both parties' accounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs'. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special challenges for a trial court, which must make \"\u00a0'a sensitive inquiry'\u00a0\" into all \"\u00a0'circumstantial and direct evidence of intent'\u00a0\" to assess whether the plaintiffs have proved that race, not politics, drove a district's lines.  Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.\u00a0S. 541, 546 (Cromartie I).  This Court's job is different--and generally easier.  It affirms a trial court's factual finding as to racial predominance so long as the finding is \"plausible\"; it reverses only when \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"  Anderson, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 573-574.  In assessing a finding's plausibility, moreover, the Court gives singular deference to a trial court's judgments about the credibility of witnesses.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).  Applying those principles here, the evidence at trial--including live witness testimony subject to credibility determinations--adequately supports the District Court's conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for District 12's reconfiguration.  And contrary to the State's view, the court had no call to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative design for District 12.  Pp.\u00a018-21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0By slimming the district and adding a couple of knobs to its snakelike body, North Carolina added 35,000 African-Americans and subtracted 50,000 whites, turning District 12 into a majority-minority district.  State Senator Robert Rucho and State Representative David Lewis--the chairs of the two committees responsible for preparing the revamped plan--publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind District 12's augmented BVAP.  Specifically, Rucho and Lewis explained that because part of Guilford County, a jurisdiction covered by \u00a75 of the VRA, lay in the district, they had increased the district's BVAP to ensure preclearance of the plan.  Dr. Thomas Hofeller, their hired mapmaker, confirmed that intent.  The State's preclearance submission to the Justice Department indicated a similar determination to concentrate black voters in District 12.  And, in testimony that the District Court found credible, Congressman Mel Watt testified that Rucho disclosed a majority-minority target to him in 2011.  Hofeller testified that he had drawn District 12's lines based on political data, and that he checked the racial data only after he drew a politics-based line between adjacent areas in Guilford County.  But the District Court disbelieved Hofeller's asserted indifference to the new district's racial composition, pointing to his contrary deposition testimony and a significant contradiction in his trial testimony.  Finally, an expert report lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs' case, showing that, regardless of party, a black voter in the region was three to four times more likely than a white voter to cast a ballot within District 12's borders.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court's assessment that all this evidence proved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error review.  Maybe this Court would have evaluated the testimony differently had it presided over the trial; or then again, maybe it would not have.  Either way, the Court is far from having a \"definite and firm conviction\" that the District Court made a mistake in concluding from the record before it that racial considerations predominated in District 12's design.  Pp.\u00a021-28.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Finally, North Carolina argues that when race and politics are competing explanations of a district's lines, plaintiffs must introduce an alternative map that achieves a State's asserted political goals while improving racial balance.  Such a map can serve as key evidence in a race-versus-politics dispute, but it is hardly the only means to disprove a State's contention that politics drove a district's lines.  In this case, the plaintiffs' introduction of mostly direct and some circumstantial evidence gave the District Court a sufficient basis, sans any map, to resolve the race-or-politics question.  Although a plaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map, as a practical matter, to make his case, such a map is merely an evidentiary tool to show that an equal protection violation has occurred; neither its presence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0North Carolina claims that a passage of this Court's opinion in Cromartie II makes an alternative map essential in cases like this one, but the reasoning of Cromartie II belies that reading.  The Court's opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or justify the categorical rule that the State claims to find there, and the entire thrust of the opinion runs counter to an inflexible counter-map requirement.  Rightly understood, the passage on which the State relies had a different and narrower point: Given the weak evidence of a racial gerrymander offered in Cromartie II, only maps that would actually show what the plaintiffs' had not could carry the day.  This case, in contrast, turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally constructed districts, but on direct evidence of the General Assembly's intent in creating the actual District 12--including many hours of trial testimony subject to credibility determinations.  That evidence, the District Court plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs' burden of debunking North Carolina's politics defense.

But it also imposes an important constraint: A State may not use race as the predominant factor in drawing district lines unless it has a compelling reason.  In this case, a three-judge District Court ruled that North Carolina officials violated that bar when they created two districts whose voting-age populations were majority black.  Applying a deferential standard of review to the factual findings underlying that decision, we affirm.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits racial gerrymanders in legislative districting plans.  It prevents a State, in the absence of \"sufficient justification,\" from \"separating its citizens into different voting districts on the basis of race.\"  Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  When a voter sues state officials for drawing such race-based lines, our decisions call for a two-step analysis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the plaintiff must prove that \"race was the predominant factor motivating the legislature's decision to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\"  Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 916 (1995).  That entails demonstrating that the legislature \"subordinated\" other factors--compactness, respect for political subdivisions, partisan advantage, what have you--to \"racial considerations.\"  Ibid.  The plaintiff may make the required showing through \"direct evidence\" of legislative intent, \"circumstantial evidence of a district's shape and demographics,\" or a mix of both.  Ibid.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, if racial considerations predominated over others, the design of the district must withstand strict scrutiny.  See Bethune-Hill, 580 U. S., at ____ (slip op., at 13).  The burden thus shifts to the State to prove that its race-based sorting of voters serves a \"compelling interest\" and is \"narrowly tailored\" to that end.  Ibid.  This Court has long assumed that one compelling interest is complying with operative provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (VRA or Act), 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710301 et seq.  See, e.g., Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899, 915 (1996) (Shaw II).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two provisions of the VRA--\u00a72 and \u00a75--are involved in this case.  \u00a7\u00a710301, 10304.  Section 2 prohibits any \"standard, practice, or procedure\" that \"results in a denial or abridgement of the right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to vote on account of race.\"  \u00a710301(a).  We have construed that ban to extend to \"vote dilution\"--brought about, most relevantly here, by the \"dispersal of [a group's members] into districts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters.\"  Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30, 46, n.\u00a011 (1986).  Section 5, at the time of the districting in dispute, worked through a different mechanism.  Before this Court invalidated its coverage formula, see Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. __ (2013), that section required certain jurisdictions (including various North Carolina counties) to pre-clear voting changes with the Department of Justice, so as to forestall \"retrogression\" in the ability of racial minorities to elect their preferred candidates, Beer v. United States, 425 U.\u00a0S. 130, 141 (1976).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a State invokes the VRA to justify race-based districting, it must show (to meet the \"narrow tailoring\" requirement) that it had \"a strong basis in evidence\" for concluding that the statute required its action.  Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 22).  Or said otherwise, the State must establish that it had \"good reasons\" to think that it would transgress the Act if it did not draw race-based district lines.  Ibid.  That \"strong basis\" (or \"good reasons\") standard gives States \"breathing room\" to adopt reasonable compliance measures that may prove, in perfect hindsight, not to have been needed.  Bethune-Hill, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 16).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A district court's assessment of a districting plan, in accordance with the two-step inquiry just described, warrants significant deference on appeal to this Court.2  We of course retain full power to correct a court's errors of law, at either stage of the analysis.  But the court's findings of fact--most notably, as to whether racial considerations predominated in drawing district lines--are subject to review only for clear error.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6); Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 242 (2001) (Cromartie II); id., at 259 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Under that standard, we may not reverse just because we \"would have decided the [matter] differently.\"  Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.\u00a0S. 564, 573 (1985).  A finding that is \"plausible\" in light of the full record--even if another is equally or more so--must govern.  Id., at 574.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case concerns North Carolina's most recent redrawing of two congressional districts, both of which have long included substantial populations of black voters.  In its current incarnation, District 1 is anchored in the northeastern part of the State, with appendages stretching both south and west (the latter into Durham).  District 12 begins in the south-central part of the State (where it takes in a large part of Charlotte) and then travels northeast, zig-zagging much of the way to the State's northern border.  (Maps showing the districts are included in an appendix to this opinion.)  Both have quite the history before this Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We first encountered the two districts, in their 1992 versions, in Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.\u00a0S. 630 (1993).  There, we held that voters stated an equal protection claim by alleging that Districts 1 and 12 were unwarranted racial gerrymanders.  See id., at 642, 649.  After a remand to the District Court, the case arrived back at our door.  See Shaw II, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899.  That time, we dismissed the challenge to District 1 for lack of standing, but struck down District 12.  The design of that \"serpentine\" district, we held, was nothing if not race-centric, and could not be justified as a reasonable attempt to comply with the VRA.  Id., at 906; see id., at 911-918.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next year, the State responded with a new districting plan, including a new District 12--and residents of that district brought another lawsuit alleging an impermissible racial gerrymander.  A District Court sustained the claim twice, but both times this Court reversed.  See Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.\u00a0S. 541 (1999) (Cromartie I); Cromartie II, 532 U. S. 234.  Racial considerations, we held, did not predominate in designing the revised District 12.  Rather, that district was the result of a political gerrymander--an effort to engineer, mostly \"without regard to race,\" a safe Democratic seat.  Id., at 245.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State redrew its congressional districts again in 2001, to account for population changes revealed in the prior year's census.  Under the 2001 map, which went unchallenged in court, neither District 1 nor District 12 had a black voting-age population (called a \"BVAP\") that was a majority of the whole: The former had a BVAP of around 48%, the latter a BVAP of around 43%.  See App. 312, 503.  Nonetheless, in five successive general elections conducted in those reconfigured districts, all the candidates preferred by most African-American voters won their contests--and by some handy margins.  In District 1, black voters' candidates of choice garnered as much as 70% of the total vote, and never less than 59%.  See 5 Record 636, 638, 641, 645, 647 (Pls. Exh. 112).  And in District 12, those candidates won with 72% of the vote at the high end and 64% at the low.  See id., at 637, 640, 643, 646, 650.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another census, in 2010, necessitated yet another congressional map--(finally) the one at issue in this case.  State Senator Robert Rucho and State Representative David Lewis, both Republicans, chaired the two committees jointly responsible for preparing the revamped plan.  They hired Dr. Thomas Hofeller, a veteran political mapmaker, to assist them in redrawing district lines.  Several hearings, drafts, and revisions later, both chambers of the State's General Assembly adopted the scheme the three men proposed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The new map (among other things) significantly altered both District 1 and District 12.  The 2010 census had revealed District 1 to be substantially underpopulated: To comply with the Constitution's one-person-one-vote principle, the State needed to place almost 100,000 new people within the district's boundaries.  See App. 2690; Evenwel v. Abbott, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 3) (explaining that \"[s]tates must draw congressional districts with populations as close to perfect equality as possible\").  Rucho, Lewis, and Hofeller chose to take most of those people from heavily black areas of Durham, requiring a finger-like extension of the district's western line.  See Appendix, infra.  With that addition, District 1's BVAP rose from 48.6% to 52.7%.  See App. 312-313.  District 12, for its part, had no need for significant total-population changes: It was overpopulated by fewer than 3,000 people out of over 730,000.  See id., at 1150.  Still, Rucho, Lewis, and Hofeller decided to reconfigure the district, further narrowing its already snakelike body while adding areas at either end--most relevantly here, in Guilford County.  See Appendix, infra; App. 1164.  Those changes appreciably shifted the racial composition of District 12: As the district gained some 35,000 African-Americans of voting age and lost some 50,000 whites of that age, its BVAP increased from 43.8% to 50.7%.  See 2 Record 349 (Fourth Affidavit of Dan Frey, Exh. 5); id., at 416 (Exh. 11).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Registered voters in the two districts (David Harris and Christine Bowser, here called \"the plaintiffs\") brought this suit against North Carolina officials (collectively, \"the State\" or \"North Carolina\"), complaining of impermissible racial gerrymanders.  After a bench trial, a three-judge District Court held both districts unconstitutional.  All the judges agreed that racial considerations predominated in the design of District 1.  See Harris v. McCrory, 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 600, 611 (MDNC 2016).  And in then applying strict scrutiny, all rejected the State's argument that it had a \"strong basis\" for thinking that the VRA compelled such a race-based drawing of District 1's lines.  Id., at 623.  As for District 12, a majority of the panel held that \"race predominated\" over all other factors, including partisanship.  Id., at 622.  And the court explained that the State had failed to put forward any reason, compelling or otherwise, for its attention to race in designing that district.  See ibid.  Judge Osteen dissented from the conclusion that race, rather than politics, drove District 12's lines--yet still characterized the majority's view as \"[e]minently reasonable.\"  Id., at 640.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State filed a notice of appeal, and we noted probable jurisdiction.  McCrory v. Harris, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We address at the outset North Carolina's contention that a victory it won in a very similar state-court lawsuit should dictate (or at least influence) our disposition of this case.  As the State explains, the North Carolina NAACP and several other civil rights groups challenged Districts 1 and 12 in state court immediately after their enactment, charging that they were unlawful racial gerrymanders.  See Brief for Appellants 19-20.  By the time the plaintiffs before us filed this action, the state trial court, in Dickson v. Rucho, had rejected those claims--finding that in District 1 the VRA justified the General Assembly's use of race and that in District 12 race was not a factor at all.  See App. 1969.  The North Carolina Supreme Court then affirmed that decision by a 4-3 vote, applying the state-court equivalent of clear error review.  See Dickson v. Rucho, 368 N.\u00a0C. 481, 500, 781 S. E. 2d 404, 419 (2015), modified on denial of reh'g, 368 N.\u00a0C. 673, 789 S.\u00a0E. 2d 436 (2016), cert. pending, No. 16-24.  In this Court, North Carolina makes two related arguments based on the Dickson litigation: first, that the state trial court's judgment should have barred this case altogether, under familiar principles of claim and issue preclusion; and second, that the state court's conclusions should cause us to conduct a \"searching review\" of the decision below, rather than deferring (as usual) to its factual findings.  Reply Brief 6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State's preclusion theory rests on an assertion about how the plaintiffs in the two cases are affiliated.  As the State acknowledges, one person's lawsuit generally does not bar another's, no matter how similar they are in substance.  See Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U. S. 880, 892-893 (2008) (noting the \"deep-rooted historic tradition that everyone should have his own day in court\").  But when plaintiffs in two cases have a special relationship, a judgment against one can indeed bind both.  See id., at 893-895 (describing six categories of qualifying relationships).  The State contends that Harris and Bowser, the plaintiffs here, are members of organizations that were plaintiffs in Dickson.  And according to North Carolina, that connection prevents the pair from raising anew the questions that the state court previously resolved against those groups.  See Brief for Appellants 20-21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But North Carolina never satisfied the District Court that the alleged affiliation really existed.  When the State argued that its preclusion theory entitled it to summary judgment, Harris and Bowser responded that they were not members of any of the organizations that had brought the Dickson suit.  See 3 Record 1577-1582 (Defs. Motion for Summary Judgment); 4 Record 101-106 (Pls. Opposition to Motion for Summary Judgment).  The parties' dueling contentions turned on intricate issues about those groups' membership policies (e.g., could Harris's payment of dues to the national NAACP, or Bowser's financial contribution to the Mecklenburg County NAACP, have made either a member of the state branch?).  Because of those unresolved \"factual disputes,\" the District Court denied North Carolina's motion for summary judgment.  4 Record 238 (July 29, 2014 Order).  And nothing in the subsequent trial supported the State's assertion about Harris's and Bowser's organizational ties: Indeed, the State chose not to present any further evidence relating to the membership issue.  Based on the resulting record, the District Court summarily rejected the State's claim that Harris and Bowser were something other than independent plaintiffs.  See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 609.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion defeats North Carolina's attempt to argue for claim or issue preclusion here.  We have no basis for assessing the factual assertions underlying the State's argument any differently than the District Court did.  Nothing in the State's evidence clearly rebuts Harris's and Bowser's testimony that they never joined any of the Dickson groups.  We need not decide whether the alleged memberships would have supported preclusion if they had been proved.  It is enough that the District Court reasonably thought they had not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State's back-up argument about our standard of review also falls short.  The rule that we review a trial court's factual findings for clear error contains no exception for findings that diverge from those made in another court.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6) (\"Findings of fact .\u00a0.\u00a0. must not be set aside unless clearly erroneous\"); see also Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.\u00a0S. 352, 369 (1991) (plurality opinion) (applying the same standard to a state court's findings).  Whatever findings are under review receive the benefit of deference, without regard to whether a court in a separate suit has seen the matter differently.  So here, we must ask not which court considering Districts 1 and 12 had the better view of the facts, but simply whether the court below's view is clearly wrong.  That does not mean the state court's decision is wholly irrelevant: It is common sense that, all else equal, a finding is more likely to be plainly wrong if some judges disagree with it.  Cf. Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 17) (noting that we are even less likely to disturb a factual determination when \"multiple trial courts have reached the same finding\").  But the very premise of clear error review is that there are often \"two permissible\"--because two \"plausible\"--\"views of the evidence.\"  Anderson, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 574; see supra, at 4.  Even assuming the state court's findings capture one such view, the District Court's assessment may yet represent another.  And the permissibility of the District Court's account is the only question before us.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With that out of the way, we turn to the merits of this case, beginning (appropriately enough) with District 1.  As noted above, the court below found that race furnished the predominant rationale for that district's redesign.  See supra, at 6-7.  And it held that the State's interest in complying with the VRA could not justify that consideration of race.  See supra, at 7.  We uphold both conclusions.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Uncontested evidence in the record shows that the State's mapmakers, in considering District 1, purposefully established a racial target: African-Americans should make up no less than a majority of the voting-age population.  See 159 F. Supp. 3d, at 611-614.  Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis were not coy in expressing that goal.  They repeatedly told their colleagues that District 1 had to be majority-minority, so as to comply with the VRA.  During a Senate debate, for example, Rucho explained that District 1 \"must include a sufficient number of  African-Americans\" to make it \"a majority black district.\"  App. 689-690.  Similarly, Lewis informed the House and Senate redistricting committees that the district must have \"a majority black voting age population.\"  Id., at 610.  And that objective was communicated in no uncertain terms to the legislators' consultant.  Dr. Hofeller testified multiple times at trial that Rucho and Lewis instructed him \"to draw [District 1] with a [BVAP] in excess of 50 percent.\"  159 F. Supp. 3d, at 613; see, e.g., ibid. (\"Once again, my instructions [were] that the district had to be drawn at above 50 percent\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hofeller followed those directions to the letter, such that the 50%-plus racial target \"had a direct and significant impact\" on District 1's configuration.  Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at __ (slip op., at 17).  In particular, Hofeller moved the district's borders to encompass the heavily black parts of Durham (and only those parts), thus taking in tens of thousands of additional African-American voters.  That change and similar ones, made (in his words) to ensure that the district's racial composition would \"add[\u00a0] up correctly,\" deviated from the districting practices he otherwise would have followed.  App. 2802.  Hofeller candidly admitted that point: For example, he testified, he sometimes could not respect county or precinct lines as he wished because \"the more important thing\" was to create a majority-minority district.  Id., at 2807; see id., at 2809.  The result is a district with stark racial borders: Within the same counties, the portions that fall inside District 1 have black populations two to three times larger than the portions placed in neighboring districts.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 19; cf. Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 17-18) (relying on similar evidence to find racial predominance).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faced with this body of evidence--showing an announced racial target that subordinated other districting criteria and produced boundaries amplifying divisions between blacks and whites--the District Court did not clearly err in finding that race predominated in drawing District 1.  Indeed, as all three judges recognized, the court could hardly have concluded anything but.  See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 611 (calling District 1 a \"textbook example\" of race-based districting).3\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The more substantial question is whether District 1 can survive the strict scrutiny applied to racial gerrymanders.  As noted earlier, we have long assumed that complying with the VRA is a compelling interest.  See supra, at 2.  And we have held that race-based districting is narrowly tailored to that objective if a State had \"good reasons\" for thinking that the Act demanded such steps.  See supra, at 3.  North Carolina argues that District 1 passes muster under that standard: The General Assembly (so says the State) had \"good reasons to believe it needed to draw [District 1] as a majority-minority district to avoid Section 2 liability\" for vote dilution.  Brief for Appellants 52.  We now turn to that defense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court identified, in Thornburg v. Gingles, three threshold conditions for proving vote dilution under \u00a72 of the VRA.  See 478 U.\u00a0S., at 50-51.  First, a \"minority group\" must be \"sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority\" in some reasonably configured legislative district.  Id., at 50.  Second, the minority group must be \"politically cohesive.\"  Id., at 51.  And third, a district's white majority must \"vote[\u00a0] sufficiently as a bloc\" to usually \"defeat the minority's preferred candidate.\"  Ibid.  Those three showings, we have explained, are needed to establish that \"the minority [group] has the potential to elect a representative of its own choice\" in a possible district, but that racially polarized voting prevents it from doing so in the district as actually drawn because it is \"submerg[ed] in a larger white voting population.\"  Growe v. Emison, 507 U.\u00a0S. 25, 40 (1993).  If a State has good reason to think that all the \"Gingles preconditions\" are met, then so too it has good reason to believe that \u00a72 requires drawing a majority-minority district.  See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S. 952, 978 (1996) (plurality opinion).  But if not, then not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, electoral history provided no evidence that a \u00a72 plaintiff could demonstrate the third Gingles prerequisite--effective white bloc-voting.4  For most of the twenty years prior to the new plan's adoption, African-Americans had made up less than a majority of District 1's voters; the district's BVAP usually hovered between 46% and 48%.  See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 606; App. 312.  Yet throughout those two decades, as the District Court noted, District 1 was \"an extraordinarily safe district for African-American preferred candidates.\"  159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 626.  In the closest election during that period, African-Americans' candidate of choice received 59% of the total vote; in other years, the share of the vote garnered by those candidates rose to as much as 70%.  See supra, at 5.  Those victories (indeed, landslides) occurred because the district's white population did not \"vote[\u00a0] sufficiently as a bloc\" to thwart black voters' preference, Gingles, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 51; rather, a meaningful number of white voters joined a politically cohesive black community to elect that group's favored candidate.  In the lingo of voting law, District 1 functioned, election year in and election year out, as a \"crossover\" district, in which members of the majority help a \"large enough\" minority to elect its candidate of choice.  Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U. S. 1, 13 (2009) (plurality opinion).  When voters act in that way, \"[i]t is difficult to see how the majority-bloc-voting requirement could be met\"--and hence how \u00a72 liability could be established.  Id., at 16.  So experience gave the State no reason to think that the VRA required it to ramp up District 1's BVAP.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State counters that, in this context, past performance is no guarantee of future results.  See Brief for Appellants 57-58; Reply Brief 19-20.  Recall here that the State had to redraw its whole congressional map following the 2010 census.  See supra, at 5.  And in particular, the State had to add nearly 100,000 new people to District 1 to meet the one-person-one-vote standard.  See supra, at 6.  That meant about 13% of the voters in the new district would never have voted there before.  See App. 2690; Reply Brief 20.  So, North Carolina contends, the question facing the state mapmakers was not whether the then-existing District 1 violated \u00a72.  Rather, the question was whether the future District 1 would do so if drawn without regard to race.  And that issue, the State claims, could not be resolved by \"focusing myopically on past elections.\"  Id., at 19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that reasoning, taken alone, cannot justify North Carolina's race-based redesign of District 1.  True enough, a legislature undertaking a redistricting must assess whether the new districts it contemplates (not the old ones it sheds) conform to the VRA's requirements.  And true too, an inescapable influx of additional voters into a district may suggest the possibility that its former track record of compliance can continue only if the legislature intentionally adjusts its racial composition.  Still, North Carolina too far downplays the significance of a longtime pattern of white crossover voting in the area that would form the core of the redrawn District 1.  See Gingles, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 57 (noting that longtime voting patterns are highly probative of racial polarization).  And even more important, North Carolina can point to no meaningful legislative inquiry into what it now rightly identifies as the key issue: whether a new, enlarged District 1, created without a focus on race but however else the State would choose, could lead to \u00a72 liability.  The prospect of a significant population increase in a district only raises--it does not answer--the question whether \u00a72 requires deliberate measures to augment the district's BVAP.  (Indeed, such population growth could cut in either direction, depending on who comes into the district.)  To have a strong basis in evidence to conclude that \u00a72 demands such race-based steps, the State must carefully evaluate whether a plaintiff could establish the Gingles preconditions--including effective white bloc-voting--in a new district created without those measures.  We see nothing in the legislative record that fits that description.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And that absence is no accident: Rucho and Lewis proceeded under a wholly different theory--arising not from Gingles but from Bartlett v. Strickland--of what \u00a72 demanded in drawing District 1.  Strickland involved a geographic area in which African-Americans could not form a majority of a reasonably compact district.  See 556 U.\u00a0S., at 8 (plurality opinion).  The African-American community, however, was sizable enough to enable the formation of a crossover district, in which a substantial bloc of black voters, if receiving help from some white ones, could elect the candidates of their choice.  See supra, at 14.  A plurality of this Court, invoking the first Gingles precondition, held that \u00a72 did not require creating that district: When a minority group is not sufficiently large to make up a majority in a reasonably shaped district, \u00a72 simply does not apply.  See 556 U.\u00a0S., at 18-20.  Over and over in the legislative record, Rucho and Lewis cited Strickland as mandating a 50%-plus BVAP in District 1.  See App. 355-356, 363-364, 472-474, 609-610, 619, 1044.  They apparently reasoned that if, as Strickland held, \u00a72 does not require crossover districts (for groups insufficiently large under Gingles), then \u00a72 also cannot be satisfied by crossover districts (for groups in fact meeting Gingles' size condition).  In effect, they concluded, whenever a legislature can draw a majority-minority district, it must do so--even if a crossover district would also allow the minority group to elect its favored candidates.  See 1 Tr. 21-22 (counsel's explanation that \"the [S]tate interpreted\" Strickland to say that, in order to protect African-Americans' electoral strength and thus avoid \u00a72 liability, the BVAP in District 1 \"need[ed] to be above 50 percent\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That idea, though, is at war with our \u00a72 jurisprudence--Strickland included.  Under the State's view, the third Gingles condition is no condition at all, because even in the absence of effective white bloc-voting, a \u00a72 claim could succeed in a district (like the old District 1) with an under-50% BVAP.  But this Court has made clear that unless each of the three Gingles prerequisites is established, \"there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy.\"  Growe, 507 U.\u00a0S., at 41.  And Strickland, far from supporting North Carolina's view, underscored the necessity of demonstrating effective white bloc-voting to prevail in a \u00a72 vote-dilution suit.  The plurality explained that \"[i]n areas with substantial crossover voting,\" \u00a72 plaintiffs would not \"be able to establish the third Gingles precondition\" and so \"majority-minority districts would not be required.\"  556 U.\u00a0S., at 24; see also ibid. (noting that States can \"defend against alleged \u00a72 violations by pointing to crossover voting patterns and to effective crossover districts\").  Thus, North Carolina's belief that it was compelled to redraw District 1 (a successful crossover district) as a majority-minority district rested not on a \"strong basis in evidence,\" but instead on a pure error of law.  Alabama, 575 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 22).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum: Although States enjoy leeway to take race-based actions reasonably judged necessary under a proper interpretation of the VRA, that latitude cannot rescue District 1.  We by no means \"insist that a state legislature, when redistricting, determine precisely what percent minority population [\u00a72 of the VRA] demands.\"  Ibid.  But neither will we approve a racial gerrymander whose necessity is supported by no evidence and whose raison d'\u00eatre is a legal mistake.  Accordingly, we uphold the District Court's conclusion that North Carolina's use of race as the predominant factor in designing District 1 does not withstand strict scrutiny.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now look west to District 12, making its fifth(!) appearance before this Court.  This time, the district's legality turns, and turns solely, on which of two possible reasons predominantly explains its most recent reconfiguration.  The plaintiffs contended at trial that the General Assembly chose voters for District 12, as for District 1, because of their race; more particularly, they urged that the Assembly intentionally increased District 12's BVAP in the name of ensuring preclearance under the VRA's \u00a75.  But North Carolina declined to mount any defense (similar to the one we have just considered for District 1) that \u00a75's requirements in fact justified race-based changes to District 12--perhaps because \u00a75 could not reasonably be understood to have done so, see n.\u00a010, infra.  Instead, the State altogether denied that racial considerations accounted for (or, indeed, played the slightest role in) District 12's redesign.  According to the State's version of events, Senator Rucho, Representative Lewis, and Dr. Hofeller moved voters in and out of the district as part of a \"strictly\" political gerrymander, without regard to race.  6 Record 1011.  The mapmakers drew their lines, in other words, to \"pack\" District 12 with Democrats, not African-Americans.  After hearing evidence supporting both parties' accounts, the District Court accepted the plaintiffs'.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Getting to the bottom of a dispute like this one poses special challenges for a trial court.  In the more usual case alleging a racial gerrymander--where no one has raised a partisanship defense--the court can make real headway by exploring the challenged district's conformity to traditional districting principles, such as compactness and respect for county lines.  In Shaw II, for example, this Court emphasized the \"highly irregular\" shape of then-District 12 in concluding that race predominated in its design.  517 U.\u00a0S., at 905 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But such evidence loses much of its value when the State asserts partisanship as a defense, because a bizarre shape--as of the new District 12--can arise from a \"political motivation\" as well as a racial one.  Cromartie I, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 547, n.\u00a03.  And crucially, political and racial reasons are capable of yielding similar oddities in a district's boundaries.  That is because, of course, \"racial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation.\"  Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 243.  As a result of those redistricting realities, a trial court has a formidable task: It must make \"a sensitive inquiry\" into all \"circumstantial and direct evidence of intent\" to assess whether the plaintiffs have managed to disentangle race from politics and prove that the former drove a district's lines.  Cromartie I, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 546 (internal quotation marks omitted).7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our job is different--and generally easier.  As described earlier, we review a district court's finding as to racial predominance only for clear error, except when the court made a legal mistake.  See supra, at 3-4.  Under that standard of review, we affirm the court's finding so long as it is \"plausible\"; we reverse only when \"left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\"  Anderson, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 573-574; see supra, at 4.  And in deciding which side of that line to come down on, we give singular deference to a trial court's judgments about the credibility of witnesses.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 52(a)(6).  That is proper, we have explained, because the various cues that \"bear so heavily on the listener's understanding of and belief in what is said\" are lost on an appellate court later sifting through a paper record.  Anderson, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 575.8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of those principles, we uphold the District Court's finding of racial predominance respecting District 12.  The evidence offered at trial, including live witness testimony subject to credibility determinations, adequately supports the conclusion that race, not politics, accounted for the district's reconfiguration.  And no error of law infected that judgment: Contrary to North Carolina's view, the District Court had no call to dismiss this challenge just because the plaintiffs did not proffer an alternative design for District 12 as circumstantial evidence of the legislature's intent.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Begin with some facts and figures, showing how the redistricting of District 12 affected its racial composition.  As explained above, District 12 (unlike District 1) was approximately the right size as it was: North Carolina did not--indeed, could not--much change its total population.  See supra, at 6.  But by further slimming the district and adding a couple of knobs to its snakelike body (including in Guilford County), the General Assembly incorporated tens of thousands of new voters and pushed out tens of thousands of old ones.  And those changes followed racial lines: To be specific, the new District 12 had 35,000 more African-Americans of voting age and 50,000 fewer whites of that age.  (The difference was made up of voters from other racial categories.)  See ibid.  Those voter exchanges produced a sizable jump in the district's BVAP, from 43.8% to 50.7%.  See ibid.  The Assembly thus turned District 12 (as it did District 1, see supra, at 10-11) into a majority-minority district.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the plaintiffs pointed out at trial, Rucho and Lewis had publicly stated that racial considerations lay behind District 12's augmented BVAP.  In a release issued along with their draft districting plan, the two legislators ascribed that change to the need to achieve preclearance of the plan under \u00a75 of the VRA.  See App. 358.  At that time, \u00a75 covered Guilford County and thus prohibited any \"retrogression in the [electoral] position of racial minorities\" there.  Beer, 425 U.\u00a0S., at 141; see 31 Fed. Reg. 5081 (1966).  And part of Guilford County lay within District 12, which meant that the Department of Justice would closely scrutinize that district's new lines.  In light of those facts, Rucho and Lewis wrote: \"Because of the presence of Guilford County in the Twelfth District, we have drawn our proposed Twelfth District at a [BVAP] level that is above the percentage of [BVAP] found in the current Twelfth District.\"  App. 358.  According to the two legislators, that race-based \"measure w[ould] ensure preclearance of the plan.\"  Ibid.  Thus, the District Court found, Rucho's and Lewis's own account \"evince[d] intentionality\" as to District 12's racial composition: Because of the VRA, they increased the number of African-Americans.  159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 617.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hofeller confirmed that intent in both deposition testimony and an expert report.  Before the redistricting, Hofeller testified, some black residents of Guilford County fell within District 12 while others fell within neighboring District 13.  The legislators, he continued, \"decided to reunite the black community in Guilford County into the Twelfth.\"  App. 558; see id., at 530-531.  Why?  Hofeller responded, in language the District Court emphasized: \"[I]n order to be cautious and draw a plan that would pass muster under the Voting Rights Act.\"  Id., at 558; see 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 619.  Likewise, Hofeller's expert report highlighted the role of the VRA in altering District 12's lines.  \"[M]indful that Guilford County was covered\" by \u00a75, Hofeller explained, the legislature \"determined that it was prudent to reunify [the county's] African-American community\" into District 12.  App. 1103.  That change caused the district's compactness to decrease (in expert-speak, it \"lowered the Reock Score\"), but that was a sacrifice well worth making: It would \"avoid the possibility of a [VRA] charge\" that would \"inhibit[\u00a0] preclearance.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State's preclearance submission to the Justice Department indicated a similar determination to concentrate black voters in District 12.  \"One of the concerns of the Redistricting Chairs,\" North Carolina there noted, had to do with the Justice Department's years-old objection to \"a failure by the State to create a second majority minority district\" (that is, in addition to District 1).  Id., at 478.  The submission then went on to explain that after considering alternatives, the redistricters had designed a version of District 12 that would raise its BVAP to 50.7%.  Thus, concluded the State, the new District 12 \"increases[\u00a0] the African-American community's ability to elect their candidate of choice.\"  Id., at 479.  In the District Court's view, that passage once again indicated that making District 12 majority-minority was no \"mere coincidence,\" but a deliberate attempt to avoid perceived obstacles to preclearance.  159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 617.9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And still there was more: Perhaps the most dramatic testimony in the trial came when Congressman Mel Watt (who had represented District 12 for some 20 years) recounted a conversation he had with Rucho in 2011 about the district's future make-up.  According to Watt, Rucho said that \"his leadership had told him that he had to ramp the minority percentage in [District 12] up to over 50 percent to comply with the Voting Rights Law.\"  App. 2369; see id., at 2393.  And further, that it would then be Rucho's \"job to go and convince the African-American community\" that such a racial target \"made sense\" under the Act.  Ibid.; see id., at 2369.10  The District Court credited Watt's testimony about the conversation, citing his courtroom demeanor and \"consistent recollection\" under \"probing cross-examination.\"  159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 617-618.11  In the court's view, Watt's account was of a piece with all the other evidence--including the redistricters' on-the-nose attainment of a 50% BVAP--indicating that the General Assembly, in the name of VRA compliance, deliberately redrew District 12 as a majority-minority district.  See id., at 618.12\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State's contrary story--that politics alone drove decisionmaking--came into the trial mostly through Hofeller's testimony.  Hofeller explained that Rucho and Lewis instructed him, first and foremost, to make the map as a whole \"more favorable to Republican candidates.\"  App. 2682.  One agreed-on stratagem in that effort was to pack the historically Democratic District 12 with even more Democratic voters, thus leaving surrounding districts more reliably Republican.  See id., at 2682-2683, 2696-2697.  To that end, Hofeller recounted, he drew District 12's new boundaries based on political data--specifically, the voting behavior of precincts in the 2008 Presidential election between Barack Obama and John McCain.  See id., at 2701-2702.  Indeed, he claimed, he displayed only this data, and no racial data, on his computer screen while mapping the district.  See id., at 2721.  In part of his testimony, Hofeller further stated that the Obama-McCain election data explained (among other things) his incorporation of the black, but not the white, parts of Guilford County then located in District 13.  See id., at 2824.  Only after he drew a politics-based line between those adjacent areas, Hofeller testified, did he \"check[\u00a0]\" the racial data and \"f[ind] out\" that the resulting configuration of District 12 \"did not have a [\u00a75] issue.\"  Id., at 2822.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court, however, disbelieved Hofeller's asserted indifference to the new district's racial composition.  The court recalled Hofeller's contrary deposition testimony--his statement (repeated in only slightly different words in his expert report) that Rucho and Lewis \"decided\" to shift African-American voters into District 12 \"in order to\" ensure preclearance under \u00a75.  See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 619-620; App. 558.  And the court explained that even at trial, Hofeller had given testimony that undermined his \"blame it on politics\" claim.  Right after asserting that Rucho and Lewis had told him \"[not] to use race\" in designing District 12, Hofeller added a qualification: \"except perhaps with regard to Guilford County.\"  Id., at 2791; see id., at 2790.  As the District Court understood, that is the kind of \"exception\" that goes pretty far toward swallowing the rule.  District 12 saw a net increase of more than 25,000 black voters in Guilford County, relative to a net gain of fewer than 35,000 across the district: So the newly added parts of that county played a major role in pushing the district's BVAP over 50%.  See id., at 384, 500-502.13  The District Court came away from Hofeller's self-contradictory testimony unpersuaded that this decisive influx of black voters was an accident.  Whether the racial make-up of the county was displayed on his computer screen or just fixed in his head, the court thought, Hofeller's denial of race-based districting \"r[ang] hollow.\"  159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 620, n.\u00a08.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, an expert report by Dr. Stephen Ansolabehere lent circumstantial support to the plaintiffs' race-not-politics case.  Ansolabehere looked at the six counties overlapping with District 12--essentially the region from which the mapmakers could have drawn the district's population.  The question he asked was: Who from those counties actually ended up in District 12?  The answer he found was: Only 16% of the region's white registered voters, but 64% of the black ones.  See App. 321-322.  Ansolabehere next controlled for party registration, but discovered that doing so made essentially no difference: For example, only 18% of the region's white Democrats wound up in District 12, whereas 65% of the black Democrats did.  See id., at 332.  The upshot was that, regardless of party, a black voter was three to four times more likely than a white voter to cast his ballot within District 12's borders.  See ibid.  Those stark disparities led Ansolabehere to conclude that \"race, and not party,\" was \"the dominant factor\" in District 12's design.  Id., at 337.14  His report, as the District Court held, thus tended to confirm the plaintiffs' direct evidence of racial predominance.  See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 620-621.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court's assessment that all this evidence proved racial predominance clears the bar of clear error review.  The court emphasized that the districting plan's own architects had repeatedly described the influx of African-Americans into District 12 as a \u00a75 compliance measure, not a side-effect of political gerrymandering.  And those contemporaneous descriptions comported with the court's credibility determinations about the trial testimony--that Watt told the truth when he recounted Rucho's resolve to hit a majority-BVAP target; and conversely that Hofeller skirted the truth (especially as to Guilford County) when he claimed to have followed only race-blind criteria in drawing district lines.  We cannot disrespect such credibility judgments.  See Anderson, 470 U.\u00a0S., at 575 (A choice to believe \"one of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence,\" can \"virtually never be clear error\").  And more generally, we will not take it upon ourselves to weigh the trial evidence as if we were the first to hear it.  See id., at 573 (A \"reviewing court oversteps\" under Rule 52(a) \"if it undertakes to duplicate the role of the lower court\").  No doubt other interpretations of that evidence were permissible.  Maybe we would have evaluated the testimony differently had we presided over the trial; or then again, maybe we would not have.  Either way--and it is only this which matters--we are far from having a \"definite and firm conviction\" that the District Court made a mistake in concluding from the record before it that racial considerations predominated in District 12's design.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State mounts a final, legal rather than factual, attack on the District Court's finding of racial predominance.  When race and politics are competing explanations of a district's lines, argues North Carolina, the party challenging the district must introduce a particular kind of circumstantial evidence: \"an alternative [map] that achieves the legislature's political objectives while improving racial balance.\"  Brief for Appellants 31 (emphasis deleted).  That is true, the State says, irrespective of what other evidence is in the case--so even if the plaintiff offers powerful direct proof that the legislature adopted the map it did for racial reasons.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 8.  Because the plaintiffs here (as all agree) did not present such a counter-map, North Carolina concludes that they cannot prevail.  The dissent echoes that argument.  See post, at 6-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have no doubt that an alternative districting plan, of the kind North Carolina describes, can serve as key evidence in a race-versus-politics dispute.  One, often highly persuasive way to disprove a State's contention that politics drove a district's lines is to show that the legislature had the capacity to accomplish all its partisan goals without moving so many members of a minority group into the district.  If you were really sorting by political behavior instead of skin color (so the argument goes) you would have done--or, at least, could just as well have done--this.  Such would-have, could-have, and (to round out the set) should-have arguments are a familiar means of undermining a claim that an action was based on a permissible, rather than a prohibited, ground.  See, e.g., Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U.\u00a0S. 231, 249 (2005) (\"If that were the [real] explanation for striking [juror] Warren[,] the prosecutors should have struck [juror] Jenkins\" too).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But they are hardly the only means.  Suppose that the plaintiff in a dispute like this one introduced scores of leaked emails from state officials instructing their mapmaker to pack as many black voters as possible into a district, or telling him to make sure its BVAP hit 75%.  Based on such evidence, a court could find that racial rather than political factors predominated in a district's design, with or without an alternative map.  And so too in cases lacking that kind of smoking gun, as long as the evidence offered satisfies the plaintiff's burden of proof.  In Bush v. Vera, for example, this Court upheld a finding of racial predominance based on \"substantial direct evidence of the legislature's racial motivations\"--including credible testimony from political figures and statements made in a \u00a75 preclearance submission--plus circumstantial evidence that redistricters had access to racial, but not political, data at the \"block-by-block level\" needed to explain their \"intricate\" designs.  See 517 U.\u00a0S., at 960-963 (plurality opinion).  Not a single Member of the Court thought that the absence of a counter-map made any difference.  Similarly, it does not matter in this case, where the plaintiffs' introduction of mostly direct and some circumstantial evidence--documents issued in the redistricting process, testimony of government officials, expert analysis of demographic patterns--gave the District Court a sufficient basis, sans any map, to resolve the race-or-politics question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A plaintiff's task, in other words, is simply to persuade the trial court--without any special evidentiary prerequisite--that race (not politics) was the \"predominant consideration in deciding to place a significant number of voters within or without a particular district.\"  Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Bethune-Hill, 580 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 8, 10) (rejecting a similar effort to elevate one form of \"persuasive circumstantial evidence\" in a dispute respecting racial predominance to a \"mandatory precondition\" or \"threshold requirement\" of proof).  That burden of proof, we have often held, is \"demanding.\"  E.g., Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 241.  And because that is so, a plaintiff will sometimes need an alternative map, as a practical matter, to make his case.  But in no area of our equal protection law have we forced plaintiffs to submit one particular form of proof to prevail.  See Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U.\u00a0S. 252, 266-268 (1977) (offering a varied and non-exhaustive list of \"subjects of proper inquiry in determining whether racially discriminatory intent existed\").  Nor would it make sense to do so here.  The Equal Protection Clause prohibits the unjustified drawing of district lines based on race.  An alternative map is merely an evidentiary tool to show that such a substantive violation has occurred; neither its presence nor its absence can itself resolve a racial gerrymandering claim.15\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0North Carolina insists, however, that we have already said to the contrary--more particularly, that our decision in Cromartie II imposed a non-negotiable \"alternative-map requirement.\"  Brief for Appellants 31.  As the State observes, Cromartie II reversed as clearly erroneous a trial court's finding that race, rather than politics, predominated in the assignment of voters to an earlier incarnation of District 12.  See 532 U.\u00a0S., at 241; supra, at 5.  And as the State emphasizes, a part of our opinion faulted the Cromartie plaintiffs for failing to offer a convincing account of how the legislature could have accomplished its political goals other than through the map it chose.  See 532 U.\u00a0S., at 257-258.  We there stated:\n\"In a case such as this one where majority-minority districts .\u00a0.\u00a0. are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles.  That party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance.\"  Id., at 258.\nAccording to North Carolina, that passage alone settles this case, because it makes an alternative map \"essential\" to a finding that District 12 (a majority-minority district in which race and partisanship are correlated) was a racial gerrymander.  Reply Brief 11.  Once again, the dissent says the same.  See post, at 7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the reasoning of Cromartie II belies that reading.  The Court's opinion nowhere attempts to explicate or justify the categorical rule that the State claims to find there.  (Certainly the dissent's current defense of that rule, see post, at 8-11, was nowhere in evidence.)  And given the strangeness of that rule--which would treat a mere form of evidence as the very substance of a constitutional claim, see supra, at 29-31--we cannot think that the Court adopted it without any explanation.  Still more, the entire thrust of the Cromartie II opinion runs counter to an inflexible counter-map requirement.  If the Court had adopted that rule, it would have had no need to weigh each piece of evidence in the case and determine whether, taken together, they were \"adequate\" to show \"the predominance of race in the legislature's line-drawing process.\"  532 U. S., at 243-244.  But that is exactly what Cromartie II did, over a span of 20 pages and in exhaustive detail.  Item by item, the Court discussed and dismantled the supposed proof, both direct and circumstantial, of race-based redistricting.  All that careful analysis would have been superfluous--that dogged effort wasted--if the Court viewed the absence or inadequacy of a single form of evidence as necessarily dooming a gerrymandering claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rightly understood, the passage from Cromartie II had a different and narrower point, arising from and reflecting the evidence offered in that case.  The direct evidence of a racial gerrymander, we thought, was extremely weak: We said of one piece that it \"says little or nothing about whether race played a predominant role\" in drawing district lines; we said of another that it \"is less persuasive than the kinds of direct evidence we have found significant in other redistricting cases.\"  Id., at 253-254 (emphasis deleted).  Nor did the report of the plaintiffs' expert impress us overmuch: In our view, it \"offer[ed] little insight into the legislature's true motive.\"  Id., at 248.  That left a set of arguments of the would-have-could-have variety.  For example, the plaintiffs offered several maps purporting to \"show how the legislature might have swapped\" some mostly black and mostly white precincts to obtain greater racial balance \"without harming [the legislature's] political objective.\"  Id., at 255 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the Court determined that none of those proposed exchanges would have worked as advertised--essentially, that the plaintiffs' \"you could have redistricted differently\" arguments failed on their own terms.  See id., at 254-257.  Hence emerged the demand quoted above, for maps that would actually show what the plaintiffs' had not.  In a case like Cromartie II--that is, one in which the plaintiffs had meager direct evidence of a racial gerrymander and needed to rely on evidence of forgone alternatives--only maps of that kind could carry the day.  Id., at 258.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this case is most unlike Cromartie II, even though it involves the same electoral district some twenty years on.  This case turned not on the possibility of creating more optimally constructed districts, but on direct evidence of the General Assembly's intent in creating the actual District 12, including many hours of trial testimony subject to credibility determinations.  That evidence, the District Court plausibly found, itself satisfied the plaintiffs' burden of debunking North Carolina's \"it was really politics\" defense; there was no need for an alternative map to do the same job.  And we pay our precedents no respect when we extend them far beyond the circumstances for which they were designed.\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying a clear error standard, we uphold the District Court's conclusions that racial considerations predominated in designing both District 1 and District 12.  For District 12, that is all we must do, because North Carolina has made no attempt to justify race-based districting there.  For District 1, we further uphold the District Court's decision that \u00a72 of the VRA gave North Carolina no good reason to reshuffle voters because of their race.  We accordingly affirm the judgment of the District Court.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nCongressional District 1 (Enacted 2011) \nCongressional District 12 (Enacted 2011)\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1262\nROY COOPER, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA, et\u00a0al., APPELLANTS v.

I write briefly to explain the additional grounds on which I would affirm the three-judge District Court and to note my agreement, in particular, with the Court's clear-error analysis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to District 1, I think North Carolina's concession that it created the district as a majority-black district is by itself sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny.  See Brief for Appellants 44; see also, e.g., Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 1-2) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  I also think that North Carolina cannot satisfy strict scrutiny based on its efforts to comply with \u00a72 of the VRA.  See ante, at 12.  In my view, \u00a72 does not apply to redistricting and therefore cannot justify a racial gerrymander.  See Holder v. Hall, 512 U.\u00a0S. 874, 922-923 (1994) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to District 12, I agree with the Court that the District Court did not clearly err when it determined that race was North Carolina's predominant motive in drawing the district.  See ante, at 21.  This is the same conclusion I reached when we last reviewed District 12.  Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.\u00a0S. 234, 267 (2001) (Cromartie II) (dissenting opinion).  The Court reached the contrary conclusion in Cromartie II only by misapplying our deferential standard for reviewing factual findings.  See id., at 259-262.  Today's decision does not repeat Cromartie II's error, and indeed it confines that case to its particular facts.  It thus represents a welcome course correction to this Court's application of the clear-error standard.\n\nOpinion of Alito, J.\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1262\nROY COOPER, GOVERNOR OF NORTH CAROLINA, et\u00a0al., APPELLANTS v.

But that is what the Court does today in its decision regarding North Carolina's 12th Congressional District: The Court junks a rule adopted in a prior, remarkably similar challenge to this very same congressional district.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U.\u00a0S. 234 (2001) (Cromartie II\u00a0), the Court considered the constitutionality of the version of District 12 that was adopted in 1997.  Id., at 238.  That district had the same basic shape as the district now before us, and the challengers argued that the legislature's predominant reason for adopting this configuration was race.  Ibid.  The State responded that its motive was not race but politics.  Id., at 241.  Its objective, the State insisted, was to create a district in which the Democratic candidate would win.  See ibid.; Brief for State Appellants in Easley v. Cromartie,  O.\u00a0T. 2000, Nos. 99-1864, 99-1865, p. 25.  Rejecting that explanation, a three-judge court found that the legislature's predominant motive was racial, specifically to pack African-Americans into District 12.  See Cromartie v. Hunt, 133 F. Supp. 2d 407, 420 (EDNC 2000).  But this Court held that this finding of fact was clearly erroneous.  Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 256.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A critical factor in our analysis was the failure of those challenging the district to come forward with an alternative redistricting map that served the legislature's political objective as well as the challenged version without producing the same racial effects.  Noting that race and party affiliation in North Carolina were \"highly correlated,\" id., at 243, we laid down this rule:\n\"In a case such as this one .\u00a0.\u00a0. , the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles.  That party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance.  Appellees failed to make any such showing here.\"  Id., at 258.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, District 12 is back before us.  After the 2010 census, the North Carolina Legislature, with the Republicans in the majority, drew the present version of District 12.  The challengers contend that this version violates equal protection because the predominant motive of the legislature was racial: to pack the district with African-American voters.  The legislature responds that its objective was political: to pack the district with Democrats and thus to increase the chances of Republican candidates in neighboring districts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You might think that the Cromartie II rule would be equally applicable in this case, which does not differ in any relevant particular, but the majority executes a stunning about-face.  Now, the challengers' failure to produce an alternative map that meets the Cromartie II test is inconsequential.  It simply \"does not matter.\"  Ante, at 30.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not the treatment of precedent that state legislatures have the right to expect from this Court.  The failure to produce an alternative map doomed the challengers in Cromartie II, and the same should be true now.  Partisan gerrymandering is always unsavory, but that is not the issue here.  The issue is whether District 12 was drawn predominantly because of race.  The record shows that it was not.1\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Constitution, state legislatures have \"the initial power to draw districts for federal elections.\"  Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.\u00a0S. 267, 275 (2004) (plurality opinion).2  This power, of course, must be exercised in conformity with the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  And because the Equal Protection Clause's \"central mandate is racial neutrality in governmental decisionmaking,\" Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 904 (1995), \"effort[s] to separate voters into different districts on the basis of race\" must satisfy the rigors of strict scrutiny.  Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.\u00a0S. 630, 649, 653 (1993) (Shaw I\u00a0).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have stressed, however, that courts are obligated to \"exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis of race.\"  Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 916.  \"Federal-court review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions,\" and \"the good faith of a state legislature must be presumed.\"  Id., at 915.  A legislature will \"almost always be aware of racial demographics\" during redistricting, but evidence of such awareness does not show that the legislature violated equal protection.  Id., at 916.  Instead, the Court has held, \"[r]ace must not simply have been a motivation for the drawing of a majority-minority district, but the predominant factor motivating the legislature's districting decision.\"  Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 241 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis in original).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This evidentiary burden \"is a demanding one.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Thus, although \"[t]he legislature's motivation is .\u00a0.\u00a0. a factual question,\" Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.\u00a0S. 541, 549 (1999) (Cromartie I\u00a0), an appellate court conducting clear-error review must always keep in mind the heavy evidentiary obligation borne by those challenging a districting plan.  See Cromartie II, supra, at 241, 257.  Recognizing \"the intrusive potential of judicial intervention into the legislative realm,\" Miller, supra, at 916, we have warned that courts must be very cautious about imputing a racial motive to a State's redistricting plan.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That caution \"is especially appropriate .\u00a0.\u00a0. where the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision, and the voting population is one in which race and political affiliation are highly correlated.\"  Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 242.  We have repeatedly acknowledged the problem of distinguishing between racial and political motivations in the redistricting context.  See id., at 242, 257-258; Cromartie I, supra, at 551-552; Bush v. Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S. 952, 967-968 (1996) (plurality opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem arises from the confluence of two factors.  The first is the status under the Constitution of partisan gerrymandering.  As we have acknowledged, \"[p]olitics and political considerations are inseparable from districting and apportionment,\" Gaffney v. Cummings, 412 U.\u00a0S. 735, 753 (1973), and it is well known that state legislative majorities very often attempt to gain an electoral advantage through that process.  See Davis v. Bandemer, 478 U.\u00a0S. 109, 129 (1986).  Partisan gerrymandering dates back to the founding, see Vieth, supra, at 274-276 (plurality opinion), and while some might find it distasteful, \"[o]ur prior decisions have made clear that a jurisdiction may engage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even if it so happens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be black Democrats and even if the State were conscious of that fact.\"  Cromartie I, supra, at 551 (emphasis in original); Vera, supra, at 964 (plurality opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second factor is that \"racial identification is highly correlated with political affiliation\" in many jurisdictions.  Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 243 (describing correlation in North Carolina).  This phenomenon makes it difficult to distinguish between political and race-based decisionmaking.  If around 90% of African-American voters cast their ballots for the Democratic candidate, as they have in recent elections,3 a plan that packs Democratic voters will look very much like a plans that packs African-American voters.  \"[A] legislature may, by placing reliable Democratic precincts within a district without regard to race, end up with a district containing more heavily African-American precincts, but the reasons would be political rather than racial.\"  Id., at 245.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We addressed this knotty problem in Cromartie II, which, as noted, came to us after the District Court had held a trial and found as a fact that the legislature's predominant reason for drawing District 12 was race, not politics.  Id., at 239-241.  Our review for clear error in that case did not exhibit the same diffidence as today's decision.  We carefully examined each piece of direct and circumstantial evidence on which the District Court had relied and conceded that this evidence provided support for the court's finding.  Id., at 257.  Then, at the end of our opinion, we stated:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We can put the matter more generally as follows: In a case such as this one where majority-minority districts (or the approximate equivalent) are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation, the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries must show at the least that the  legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles.  That party must also show that those districting alternatives would have brought about significantly greater racial balance.\"  Id., at 258.\nBecause the plaintiffs had \"failed to make any such showing,\" we held that the District Court had clearly erred in finding that race predominated in drawing District 12.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cromartie II plainly meant to establish a rule for use in a broad class of cases and not a rule to be employed one time only.  We stated that we were \"put[ting] the matter more generally\" and were describing what must be shown in cases \"where majority-minority districts (or the approximate equivalent) are at issue and where racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation.\"  Ibid.  We identified who would carry the burden of the new rule (\"the party attacking the legislatively drawn boundaries\") and what that party must show (that \"the legislature could have achieved its legitimate political objectives in alternative ways that are comparably consistent with traditional districting principles\" while achieving \"significantly greater racial balance\").  Ibid.  And we reversed the finding of racial predominance due to the plaintiffs' failure to carry the burden established by this evidentiary rule.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, too, the plaintiffs failed to carry that burden.  In this case, as in Cromartie II, the plaintiffs allege a racial gerrymander, and the State's defense is that political motives explain District 12's boundaries.  In such a case, Cromartie II instructed, plaintiffs must submit an alternative redistricting map demonstrating that the legislature could have achieved its political goals without the racial effects giving rise to the racial gerrymandering allegation.  But in spite of this instruction, plaintiffs in this case failed to submit such a map.4  See Brief for Appellees 31-36.  Based on what we said in Cromartie II about the same type of claim involving the same congressional district, reversal should be a foregone conclusion.  It turns out, however, that the Cromartie II rule was good for one use only.  Even in a case involving the very same district, it is tossed aside.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The alternative-map requirement deserves better.  It is a logical response to the difficult problem of distinguishing between racial and political motivations when race and political party preference closely correlate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is a problem with serious institutional and federalism implications.  When a federal court says that race was a legislature's predominant purpose in drawing a district, it accuses the legislature of \"offensive and demeaning\" conduct.  Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 912.  Indeed, we have said that racial gerrymanders \"bea[r] an uncomfortable resemblance to political apartheid.\"  Shaw I, 509 U.\u00a0S.,  at 647.  That is a grave accusation to level against a state legislature.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, \"[f]ederal-court review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions\" because \"[i]t is well settled that reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State.\"  Miller, supra, at 915 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 242.  When a federal court finds that race predominated in the redistricting process, it inserts itself into that process.  That is appropriate--indeed, constitutionally required--if the legislature truly did draw district boundaries on the basis of race.  But if a court mistakes a political gerrymander for a racial gerrymander, it illegitimately invades a traditional domain of state authority, usurping the role of a State's elected representatives.  This does violence to both the proper role of the Judiciary and the powers reserved to the States under the Constitution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a final, often-unstated danger where race and politics correlate: that the federal courts will be transformed into weapons of political warfare.  Unless courts \"exercise extraordinary caution\" in distinguishing race-based redistricting from politics-based redistricting, Miller, supra, at 916, they will invite the losers in the redistricting process to seek to obtain in court what they could not achieve in the political arena.  If the majority party draws districts to favor itself, the minority party can deny the majority its political victory by prevailing on a racial gerrymandering claim.  Even if the minority party loses in court, it can exact a heavy price by using the judicial process to engage in political trench warfare for years on end.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although I do not imply that this is what occurred here, this case does reflect what litigation of this sort can look like.  This is the fifth time that North Carolina's 12th Congressional District has come before this Court since 1993, and we have almost reached a new redistricting cycle without any certainty as to the constitutionality of North Carolina's current redistricting map.  Given these dangers, Cromartie II was justified in crafting an evidentiary rule to prevent false positives.5\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority nevertheless absolves the challengers of their failure to submit an alternative map.  It argues that an alternative map cannot be \"the only means\" of proving racial predominance, and it concludes from this that an alternative map \"does not matter in this case.\"  Ante, at 29-30 (emphasis in original).  But even if there are cases in which a plaintiff could prove a racial gerrymandering claim without an alternative map, they would be exceptional ones in which the evidence of racial predominance is overwhelming.  This most definitely is not one of those cases, see Part III-C, infra, and the plaintiffs' failure to produce an alternative map mandates reversal.  Moreover, even in an exceptional case, the absence of such a map would still be strong evidence that a district's boundaries were determined by politics rather than race.6  The absence of a map would \"matter.\"  Cf. ante, at 30.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority questions the legitimacy of the alternative-map requirement, ante, at 29-31, and n.\u00a015, but the rule is a sound one.  It rests on familiar principles regarding the allocation of the burdens of production and persuasion and the assessment of evidence.  First, in accordance with the general rule in civil cases, plaintiffs in a case like this bear the burden of proving that the legislature's motive was unconstitutional.  Second, what must be shown is not simply that race played a part in the districting process but that it played the predominant role.  Third, a party challenging a districting plan must overcome the strong presumption that the plan was drawn for constitutionally permissible reasons.  Miller, supra, at 915.  Fourth, when those responsible for adopting a challenged plan contend that the plan was devised for partisan political ends, they are making an admission that may not sit well with voters, so the explanation should not be lightly dismissed.  Cf. Fed. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3).  And finally, the Cromartie II rule takes into account the difficulty of proving a negative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For challengers like those in the present case, producing a map that meets the Cromartie II test should not be hard if the predominant reason for a challenged plan really was race and not politics.  Plaintiffs mounting a challenge to a districting plan are almost always sophisticated litigants who have the assistance of experts, and that is certainly true in the present case.  Today, an expert with a computer can easily churn out redistricting maps that control for any number of specified criteria, including prior voting patterns and political party registration.  Therefore, if it is indeed possible to find a map that meets the Cromartie II test, it should not be too hard for the challengers to do so.  The State, on the other hand, cannot prove that no map meeting the Cromartie II test can be drawn.  Even if a State submits, say, 100 alternative maps that fail the test, that would not prove that no such map could pass it.  The relative ease with which the opposing parties can gather evidence is a familiar consideration in allocating the burden of production.  See 1 C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a763, p. 316 (2d ed. 1994); 21 C. Wright & K. Graham, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a75122, pp. 556-557 (1977).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if we set aside the challengers' failure to submit an alternative map, the District Court's finding that race predominated in the drawing of District 12 is clearly erroneous.  The State offered strong and coherent evidence that politics, not race, was the legislature's predominant aim, and the evidence supporting the District Court's contrary finding is weak and manifestly inadequate in light of the high evidentiary standard that our cases  require challengers to meet in order to prove racial  predominance.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My analysis will proceed in three steps.  First, I will discuss what the legislature's mapmaker did and why this approach is entirely consistent with his stated political objectives.  Then, I will explain why this approach inevitably had the racial effect to which the challengers object.  Finally, I will address the evidence of racial predominance on which the majority relies and show why it is inadequate to sustain the District Court's judgment.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order to understand the mapmaker's approach, the first element to be kept in mind is that the basic shape of District 12 was legitimately taken as a given.  When a new census requires redistricting, it is a common practice to start with the plan used in the prior map and to change the boundaries of the prior districts only as needed to comply with the one-person, one-vote mandate and to achieve other desired ends.  This approach honors settled expectations and, if the prior plan survived legal challenge, minimizes the risk that the new plan will be overturned.  And that is the approach taken by the veteran mapmaker in the present case, Dr. Thomas Hofeller.  App. 523 (\"the normal starting point is always from the existing districts\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Hofeller began with the prior version of District 12 even though that version had a strange, serpentine shape.  Cromartie I, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 544; App. 1163.  That design has a long history.  It was first adopted in 1992, and subsequent redistricting plans have built on the 1992 plan.  Ibid.  In Cromartie II, we sustained the constitutionality of the 1997 version of District 12, which featured the same basic shape.  See 532 U.\u00a0S., at 258.  And retention of this same basic shape is not challenged in this case.8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using the prior design as his starting point, Dr. Hofeller assumed that District 12 would remain a \"strong Democratic distric[t].\"  App. 521.  He stated that he drew \"the [overall redistricting] plan to .\u00a0.\u00a0. have an increased number of competitive districts for GOP candidates,\" id., at 520, and that he therefore moved more Democratic voters into District 12 in order to \"increase Republican opportunities in the surrounding districts,\" id., at 1606.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the map now before us, District 12 is bordered by four districts.9  Running counterclockwise, they are: District 5 to the northwest; District 9 to the southwest; District 8 to the southeast; and District 6 to the northeast.  See Appendix, ante.  According to Dr. Hofeller, the aim was to make these four districts--considered as a whole--more secure for Republicans.  App. 1606, 2696.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To do this, Dr. Hofeller set out in search of pockets of Democratic voters that could be moved into District 12 from areas adjoining or very close to District 12's prior boundaries.  Of the six counties through which District 12 passes, the three most heavily Democratic (and also the most populous) are Forsyth, Guilford, and Mecklenburg, which contain the major population centers of Winston-Salem, Greensboro, and Charlotte, respectively.  See 7 Record 480-482; App. 1141.  As a measure of voting preferences, Dr. Hofeller used the results of the then-most recent Presidential election, i.e., the election of 2008.  Id., at 1149, 2697, 2721-2722.  In that election, these three counties voted strongly for the Democratic candidate, then-Senator Barack Obama, while the other three counties, Cabarrus, Davidson, and Rowan, all voted for the Republican candidate, Senator John McCain.  See 4 Record 1341-1342.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two of the three Democratic counties, Forsyth and Guilford, are located at the northern end of District 12, while the other Democratic county, Mecklenburg, is on the southern end.  See Appendix, ante.  The middle of the district (often called the \"corridor\") passes through the three more Republican-friendly counties--Cabarrus, Davidson, and Rowan.  Ibid.  Thus, if a mapmaker sat down to increase the proportion of Democrats in District 12 and to reduce the proportion in neighboring districts, the most obvious way to do that was to pull additional Democrats into the district from the north and south (the most populous and heavily Democratic counties) while shifting Republican voters out of the corridor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That, in essence, is what Dr. Hofeller did--as the majority acknowledges.  Ante, at 6 (Dr. Hofeller \"narrow[ed District 12's] already snakelike body while adding areas at either end\"); App. 1150 (Table 1), 1163.  Dr. Hofeller testified that he sought to shift parts of Mecklenburg County out of Districts 8 and 9 (in order to reduce the percentage of Democrats in these two districts) and that this required him to increase the coverage of Mecklenburg County in District 12.  Id., at 1142-1143, 1607, 2753.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Hofeller testified that he also had political plans for the current map's District 6, which differed substantially from the version in the prior map.  Dr. Hofeller wanted to improve the Republicans' prospects in this new district by minimizing its coverage of Guilford County's Democratic population.  Id., at 1143, 1607, 2693, 2697, 2752.  That also meant increasing the population of Guilford County Democrats in District 12.  Id., at 1143, 1607, 2697.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This influx of Democratic voters from the two most populous counties in District 12 required shedding voters elsewhere in order to comply with this Court's mandate of one-person, one-vote, see Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.\u00a0S. 526, 530-531 (1969),10 and the population removed had to be added to a bordering district.  App. 523.  Parts of  Davidson and Rowan Counties were therefore shifted to District 5, id., at 1143, 1150 (Table 1), but Dr. Hofeller testified that this would not have been sufficient to satisfy the one-person, one-vote standard, so he also had to move voters from heavily Democratic Forsyth County into District 5, id., at 1143, 2697, 2752-2753.  Doing so did not undermine his political objective, he explained, because District 5 \"was stronger [for Republicans] to begin with and could take those [Forsyth] Democratic precincts\" without endangering Republican chances in the district.  Id., at 2753; see also id., at 2697.  The end result was that, under the new map now at issue, the three major counties in the north and south constitute a larger percentage of District 12's total population, while the corridor lost population.  See id., at 1150 (Table 1), 2149 (Finding 187).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A comparison of the 2008 Presidential election vote under the old and new versions of the districts shows the effect of Dr. Hofeller's map.  District 8 (which, of the four districts bordering District 12 under the 2011 map, was the most Democratic district) saw a drop of almost 11% in the Democratic vote under the new map.  See 2 Record 354, 421.  District 9 saw a drop in the percentage of registered Democrats, id., at 350, 417, although the vote percentage for the Democratic Presidential candidate remained essentially the same (increasing by 0.39%).  Id., at 354, 421.  District 5, which was heavily Republican under the prior map and was redrawn to absorb Democrats from Forsyth County, saw about a 7-point swing in favor of the Democratic candidate, but it remained a strong Republican district.  Ibid.  New District 6 is less susceptible to comparison because its boundaries are completely different from the district bearing that number under the old plan, but the new District 6 was solidly Republican, with a Republican Presidential vote percentage of nearly 56%.  Ibid.  As stated by the state court that considered and rejected the same constitutional challenge now before us:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"By increasing the number of Democratic voters in the 2011 Twelfth Congressional District located in Mecklenburg and Guilford Counties, the 2011 Congressional Plan created other districts that were more competitive for Republican candidates as compared to the 2001 versions of these districts .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  App. 2150 (Finding 191).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The results of subsequent congressional elections show that Dr. Hofeller's plan achieved its goal.  In 2010, prior to the adoption of the current plan, Democrats won 7 of the 13 districts, including District 8.11  But by 2016, Republicans controlled 10 of the 13 districts, including District 8, and all the Republican candidates for the House of Representatives won their races with at least 56% of the vote.12  In accordance with the map's design, the only Democratic seats remaining after 2016 were in Districts 1, 4, and 12.  Id., at 521.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, there is strong evidence in the record to support  Dr. Hofeller's testimony that the changes made to the 2001 map were designed to maximize Republican opportunities.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I now turn to the connection between the mapmaker's strategy and the effect on the percentage of African-Americans in District 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we recognized in Cromartie II, political party preference and race are highly correlated in North Carolina generally and in the area of Congressional District 12 in particular.  App. 2022 (state trial court finding that \"racial identification correlates highly with political affiliation\" in North Carolina).  The challenger's expert, Dr. Stephen Ansolabehere, corroborated this important point.  Dr. Ansolabehere calculated the statewide correlation between race and voting in 200813 and found a correlation of 0.8, which is \"very high.\"  Id., at 342, 352 (Table 1).  See also J. Levin, J. Fox, & D. Forde, Elementary Statistics in Social Research 370 (12th ed. 2014); R. Witte & J. Witte, Statistics 138 (10th ed. 2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the area of District 12, the correlation is even higher.  There, Dr. Ansolabehere found that the correlation \"approach[ed] 1,\" App. 342, that is, almost complete overlap.  These black Democrats also constitute a supermajority of Democrats in the area covered by the district.  Under the 2001 version of District 12--which was drawn by Democrats and was never challenged as a racial gerrymander--black registered voters constituted 71.44% of Democrats in the district.  2 Record 350; see also App. 2145 (Finding 173).14  What this means is that a mapmaker seeking to pull Democrats into District 12 would unavoidably pull in a very large percentage of African-Americans.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The distribution of Democratic voters magnified this effect.  Dr. Hofeller's plan required the identification of areas of Democratic strength that were near District 12's prior boundaries.  Dr. Hofeller prepared maps showing the distribution of Democratic voters by precinct,15  see id., at 1148-1149, 1176-1177, 1181, and those maps show that these voters were highly concentrated around the major urban areas of Winston-Salem (in Forsyth County), Greensboro (in Guilford County), and Charlotte (in Mecklenberg County).  Dr. Ansolabehere, the challengers' expert, prepared maps showing the distribution of black registered voters in these same counties, see id., at 322-328; 1 Record 128-133, and a comparison of these two sets of maps reveals that the clusters of Democratic voters generally overlap with those of registered black voters.  In other words, the population of nearby Democrats who could be moved into District 12 was heavily black.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The upshot is that, so long as the legislature chose to retain the basic shape of District 12 and to increase the number of Democrats in the district, it was inevitable that the Democrats brought in would be disproportionately black.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of this should come as a surprise.  After all, when the basic shape of District 12 was created after the 1990 census, the express goal of the North Carolina Legislature was to create a majority-minority district.  See Shaw I, 509 U.\u00a0S., at 633-636.  It has its unusual shape because it was originally designed to capture pockets of black voters.  See Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.\u00a0S. 899, 905-906 (1996) (Shaw II).  Although the legislature has modified the district since then, see Cromartie I, 526 U.\u00a0S., at 544 (describing changes from the 1991 version to the 1997 version), \"it retains its basic 'snakelike' shape and continues to track Interstate 85.\"  Ibid.; 1 Record 35 (Appellees' Complaint) (\"Congressional District 12 has existed in roughly its current form since 1992, when it was drawn as a majority African-American district .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0\"); see also App. 1163 (showing the 1997, 2001, and 2011 versions of District 12).  The original design of the district was devised to ensure a high concentration of black voters, and as long as the basic design is retained (as it has been), one would expect that to continue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While plaintiffs failed to offer any alternative map, Dr. Hofeller produced a map showing what District 12 would have looked like if his computer was programmed simply to maximize the Democratic vote percentage in the district, while still abiding by the requirement of one-person, one-vote.  Id., at 1148.  The result was a version of District 12 that is very similar to the version approved by the North Carolina Legislature.  See id., at 1175; id., at 1615-1618.  Indeed, this maximum-Democratic plan had a black voting age population of 50.73%, which is actually higher than District 12's black voting age population of 50.66%.  Id., at 1154 (Table 5).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, the increase in the black voting age population of District 12 is easily explained by a coherent (and generally successful) political strategy.  Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 245 (\"[A] legislature may, by placing reliable Democratic precincts within a district without regard to race, end up with a district containing more heavily African-American precincts, but the reasons would be political rather than racial\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amazingly, a reader of the majority opinion (and the opinion of the District Court) would remain almost entirely ignorant of the legislature's political strategy and the relationship between that strategy and the racial composition of District 12.16  The majority's analysis is like Hamlet without the prince.17\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority focuses almost all its attention on a few references to race by those responsible for the drafting and adoption of the redistricting plan.  But the majority reads far too much into these references.  First, what the plaintiffs had to prove was not simply that race played some role in the districting process but that it was the legislature's predominant consideration.  Second, as I have explained, a court must exercise \"extraordinary caution\" before finding that a state legislature's predominant reason for a districting plan was racial.  Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 916.  This means that comments should not be taken out of context and given the most sinister possible meaning.  Third, the findings of the state courts in a virtually identical challenge to District 12 are entitled to respectful consideration.  A North Carolina trial court, after hearing much the same evidence as the court below, found that the legislature's predominant motive was political, not racial.  That decision was affirmed by the North Carolina Supreme Court.  Dickson v. Rucho, 367 N.\u00a0C. 542, 766 S.\u00a0E. 2d 238 (2014), vacated and remanded, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, aff\u00a0'd on remand, 368 N.\u00a0C. 481, 781 S.\u00a0E. 2d 404 (2015), cert. pending, No. 16-24.  Even if the judgment in the state case does not bar the present case under the doctrine of res judicata, see ante, at 7-9, the state-court finding illustrates the thinness of the plaintiffs' proof.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, it must be kept in mind that references to race by those responsible for drawing or adopting a redistricting plan are not necessarily evidence that the plan was adopted for improper racial reasons.  Under our precedents, it is unconstitutional for the government to consider race in almost any context, and therefore any mention of race by the decisionmakers may be cause for suspicion.  We have said, however, that that is not so in the redistricting context.  For one thing, a State like North Carolina that was either wholly or partially within the coverage of \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 could not redistrict without heeding that provision's prohibition against racial retrogression, see 52 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a710304(b); Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 3-4), and therefore race had to be kept in mind.  In addition, all legislatures must also take into account the possibility of a challenge under \u00a72 of the Voting Rights Act claiming that a plan illegally dilutes the voting strength of a minority community.  See League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U.\u00a0S. 399, 425 (2006).  If a State ultimately concludes that it must take race into account in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act, it must show that it had a \"\u00a0'strong basis in evidence' in support of the (race-based) choice that it has made.\"  Alabama Legislative Black Caucus, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 22).  But those involved in the redistricting process may legitimately make statements about Voting Rights Act compliance before deciding that the Act does not provide a need for race-based districting.  And it is understandable for such individuals to explain that a race-neutral plan happens to satisfy the criteria on which Voting Rights Act challengers might insist.  In short, because of the Voting Rights Act, consideration and discussion of the racial effects of a plan may be expected.\n1\nThe June 17, 2011, Statement\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I begin with a piece of evidence that the majority does not mention, namely, the very first item cited by the District Court in support of its racial-predominance finding.  This evidence consisted of a June 17, 2001, statement by Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis, the state legislators who took the lead in the adoption of the current map.  In that statement, Rucho and Lewis referred to \"constructing [Voting Rights Act] majority black districts.\"  App. 1025.  Seizing upon the use of the plural term \"districts,\" the court below seemed to think that it had found a smoking gun.  Harris v. McCrory, 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 600, 616 (MDNC 2016).  The State had insisted that its plan drew only one majority-minority congressional district, District 1, but since the June 17 statement \"clearly refers to multiple districts that are now majority minority,\" ibid., the court below viewed the statement as telling evidence that an additional congressional district, presumably District 12, had been intentionally designed to be a majority-minority district and was thus based on race.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a glaring problem with this analysis: The June 17 statement was about state legislative districts, not federal congressional districts.  See App. 1024-1033.  The United States, as amicus curiae in support of plaintiffs, concedes that the District Court made a mistake by relying on the June 17 statement.  Brief for United States 27, n.\u00a013.  The majority, by contrast, tries to ignore this error. But the District Court gave the June 17 statement pride-of-place in its opinion, mentioning it first in its analysis, and the District Court seemed to think that this evidence was particularly significant, stating that the reference to multiple districts was not \"the result of happenstance, a mere slip of the pen.\"  159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 616.  The District Court's error shows a troubling lack of precision.\n2\nThe \u00a75 Preclearance Request\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act, North Carolina requested preclearance from the Department of Justice shortly after the Legislature approved the new congressional plan.  Id., at 608.  In its preclearance application, the State noted that \"[o]ne of the concerns of the Redistricting Chairs was that in 1992, the Justice Department had objected to the 1991 Congressional Plan because of a failure by the State to create a second majority minority district.\"  App. 478.  The application says that the Redistricting Chairs \"sought input from Congressman [Mel] Watt[, the African-American incumbent who represented District 12,] regarding options for re-drawing his district,\" and that after this consultation, \"the Chairs had the impression that Congressman Watt would oppose any redrawing of the Twelfth District .\u00a0.\u00a0. as originally contemplated by the 1992 Justice Department objection.\"  Ibid.  The Chairs drew District 12 \"[b]ased in part on this input from Congressman Watt.\"  Id., at 478-479. Two sentences later in the same paragraph, the application observed that the black voting age population for District 12 went up from 43.77% to 50.66% and that therefore the district \"maintains, and in fact increases, the African-American community's ability to elect their candidate of choice in District 12.\"  Id., at 479.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the majority, this statement shows a \"determination to concentrate black voters in District 12.\"  Ante, at 23.  In fact, it shows no such thing.  The statement explains that Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis decided not to construct District 12 as a majority-minority district--as the 1992 Justice Department had demanded--\"[b]ased in part on\" the input they received from Congressman Watt, whom they thought \"would oppose\" drawing the district \"as originally contemplated by the 1992 Justice Department objection.\"  App. 478-479.  If anything, this document cuts against a finding of racial predominance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statement's matter-of-fact reference to the increase in District 12's black voting age population hardly shows that the legislature altered District 12 for the purpose of causing this increase.  An entirely natural interpretation is that the Redistricting Chairs simply reported this fact so that it would be before the Justice Department in the event that the Department had renewed Voting Rights Act concerns.  Only by reading a great deal between the lines and adopting the most sinister possible interpretation can the statement be viewed as pointed evidence of a predominantly racial motive.\n3\nThe Mel Watt Testimony\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In both the District Court and the state trial court, Congressman Watt testified that, while the redistricting plan was being developed, Senator Rucho invited him to his home to discuss the new boundaries of District 12.  Id., at 2368-2369, 1343-1344.  According to Congressman Watt, Senator Rucho said that the Republican leadership wanted him to \"ramp the 12th Congressional District up to over 50 percent black\" because \"they believed it was required .\u00a0.\u00a0. by the Voting Rights Act.\"  Id., at 1344, 2369, 2393.  In the state proceedings, Senator Rucho denied making any such statement, id., at 1703, and another state legislator present at the meeting, Representative Ruth Samuelson, gave similar testimony, id., at 1698.  Neither Senator Rucho nor Representative Samuelson testified in federal court (although their state court testimony was made part of the federal record).  See id., at 2847.  But the District Court credited Congressman Watt's testimony based on its assessment of his demeanor and the consistency of his recollection, 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 617-618, and I accept that credibility finding for purposes of our review.18\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even assuming that Congressman Watt's recollection was completely accurate, all that his testimony shows is that legislative leaders at one point in the process thought that they had to draw District 12 as a majority-minority district in order to comply with the Voting Rights Act; it does not show that they actually did draw District 12 with the goal of creating a majority-minority district.  And as explained in the discussion of the preclearance request above, Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis stated that they ultimately turned away from the creation of a majority-minority district after consulting with Congressman Watt.  \"Based in part on this input from Congressman Watt,\" they said they decided not to draw the district as the 1992 Department of Justice had suggested--that is, as a majority-minority district.  App. 478-479.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This account is fully consistent with Congressman Watt's testimony about his meeting with Senator Rucho.  Congressman Watt noted that Senator Rucho was uncomfortable with the notion of increasing the black voting age population, id., at 2369, 2393, and Congressman Watt testified that he told Senator Rucho that he was opposed to the idea,  id., at 1345, 2369, 2393.  So it makes sense that Senator Rucho was dissuaded from taking that course by Congressman Watt's reaction.  And Dr. Hofeller consistently testified that he was never asked to meet a particular black voting age population target, see Part III-C-5, infra, and that the only data displayed on his screen when he drew District 12 was political data.  See infra, at 27, n. 19.  Thus, Congressman Watt's testimony, even if taken at face value, is entirely consistent with what the preclearance request recounts: After initially contemplating the possibility of drawing District 12 as a majority-minority district, the legislative leadership met with Congressman Watt, who convinced them not to do so.\n4\nDr. Hofeller's Statements About Guilford County\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the prior map, both Guilford County and the Greensboro African-American community were divided between the 12th and 13th Districts.  This had been done, Dr. Hofeller explained, \"to make both the Old 12th and 13th Districts strongly Democratic.\"  App. 1103; see also id., at 555, 2821; 1 Record 132-133 (showing racial demographics of Guilford precincts under 2001 and 2011 maps).  But the Republican legislature wanted to make the area surrounding District 12 more Republican.  The new map eliminated the old 13th District and created a new district bearing that number farther to the east.  The territory to the north of Greensboro that had previously been in the 13th District was placed in a new district, District 6, which was constructed to be a Republican-friendly district, and the new map moved more of the Greensboro area into the new District 12.  This move was entirely consistent with the legislature's stated goal of concentrating Democrats in the 12th District and making the surrounding districts hospitable to Republican candidates.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Hofeller testified that the placement of the Greensboro African-American community in the 12th District was the result of this political strategy.  He stated that the portion of Guilford County absorbed by District 12 \"wasn't moved into CD\u00a012 because it had a substantial black population.  It was moved into CD\u00a012 because it had a substantial Democratic political voting record\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  App. 2824.  And Dr. Hofeller maintained that he was never instructed to draw District 12 as a majority-minority district or to increase the district's black voting age population.  See, e.g., id., at 520, 556-558, 1099, 1603-1604, 2682-2683, 2789.  Instead, he testified that political considerations determined the boundaries of District 12 and that the only data displayed on his computer screen when he drew the challenged map was voting data from the 2008 Presidential election.19 Id., at 1149, 2697, 2721-2722.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Hofeller acknowledged, however, that there had been concern about the possibility of a Voting Rights Act challenge to this treatment of the Greensboro African-American community.  Guilford County was covered by \u00a75 of the Voting Rights Act, and as noted, \u00a75 prohibits retrogression.  Under the old map, the Guilford County African-American community was split between the old District 13 and District 12, and in both of those districts, black voters were able to elect the candidates of their choice by allying with white Democratic voters.  Under the new map, however, if the Greensboro black community had been split between District 12 and the new Republican-friendly District 6, the black voters in the latter district would be unlikely to elect the candidate of their choice.  Placing the African-American community in District 12 avoided this consequence.  Even Congressman Watt conceded that there were potential \u00a75 concerns relating to the black community in Guilford County.  Id., at 2387-2388.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The thrust of many of Dr. Hofeller's statements about the treatment of Guilford County was that the reuniting of the Greensboro black community in District 12 was nothing more than a welcome byproduct of his political strategy.  He testified that he first drew the district based on political considerations and then checked to ensure that Guilford County's black population was not fractured.  Id., at 2822 (\"[W]hen we checked it, we found that we did not have an issue in Guilford County with fracturing the black .\u00a0.\u00a0. community\"); see also id., at 556, 2821, 2823.  This testimony is entirely innocuous.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no doubt, however, that Dr. Hofeller also made a few statements that may be read to imply that concern about Voting Rights Act litigation was part of the motivation for the treatment of Guilford County.  He testified at trial that he \"was instructed [not] to use race in any form except perhaps with regard to Guilford County.\"  Id., at 2791 (emphasis added).  See id., at 1103 (the legislature \"determined that it was prudent to reunify the African-American community in Guilford County\"); id., at 558 (\"[I]t was decided to reunite the black community in Guilford County into the Twelfth\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These statements by Dr. Hofeller convinced the District Court that the drawing of District 12 was not a \"purely .\u00a0.\u00a0. politically driven affair.\"  159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 619.  But in order to prevail, the plaintiffs had to show much more--that race was the predominant reason for the drawing of District 12, and these few bits of testimony fall far short of that showing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Cromartie II illustrates this point.  In that case, the legislature's mapmaker made a statement that is remarkably similar to Dr. Hofeller's.  Gerry Cohen, the \"legislative staff member responsible for drafting districting plans,\" reported: \"\u00a0'I have moved Greensboro Black community into the 12th, and now need to take [about] 60,000 out of the 12th.  I await your direction on this.'\u00a0\"  532 U.\u00a0S., at 254.  This admission did not persuade the Court that the legislature's predominant motive was racial.  The majority ignores this obvious parallel with Cromartie II.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, in an attempt to magnify the importance of the treatment of Guilford County, the majority plays games with statistics.  It states that \"District 12 saw a net increase of more than 25,000 black voters in Guilford County, relative to a net gain of fewer than 35,000 across the district: So the newly added parts of that county played a major role in pushing the district's BVAP over 50%.\"  Ante, at 26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is highly misleading.  First, since the black voting age population of District 12 is just barely over 50%--specifically, 50.66%--almost any decision that increased the number of voting age blacks in District 12 could be said to have \"played a major role in pushing the district's BVAP over 50%.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the majority provides the total number of voting age blacks added to District 12 from Guilford County (approximately 25,000) alongside the total number of voting age blacks added to the district (approximately 35,000), and this has the effect of making Guilford County look like it is the overwhelming contributor to the district's net increase in black voting age population.  In truth, Mecklenburg County was by far the greatest contributor of voting age blacks to District 12 in both absolute terms (approximately 147,000) and in terms of new voting age blacks (approximately 37,000).  See App. 384, 500-502.  Indeed, if what matters to the majority is how much individual counties increased District 12's black voting age population percentage, Davidson County deserves attention as well, since the portion of the county within District 12 lost over 26,000 more voting age whites than blacks.  Ibid.  That is greater than the net number of voting age blacks added to the district by Guilford County or Mecklenburg County.  Ibid.  As with so much in the majority opinion, the issue here is more nuanced--and much more favorable to the State--than the majority would have it seem.\n5\nThe July 1, 2011, Statement\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For reasons similar to those just explained, the majority makes far too much of a statement issued by Senator Rucho and Representative Lewis on July 1, 2011, when the new districting plan was proposed.  Particularly in light of Dr. Hofeller's later testimony about the legislature's partisan objectives, it is apparent that this statement does not paint an entirely reliable picture of the legislature's aims.  The statement begins with this proclamation: \"From the beginning, our goal has remained the same: the development of fair and legal congressional and legislative districts,\" id., at 353, and the statement seriously downplays the role of politics in the map-drawing process, acknowledging only that \"we have not been ignorant of the partisan impacts of the districts we have  created,\" id., at 361.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statement discusses the treatment of Guilford County in a section with the heading \"Compliance with the Voting Rights Act.\"  Id., at 355-358.  In that section, Rucho and Lewis state: \"Because of the presence of Guilford County in the Twelfth District, we have drawn our proposed Twelfth District at a black voting age level that is above the percentage of black voting age population found in the current Twelfth District.  We believe that this measure will ensure preclearance of the plan.\"  Id., at 358.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority and the District Court interpret this passage to say that Rucho and Lewis decided to move black voters from Guilford County into District 12 in order to ward off Voting Rights Act liability.  Ante, at 22 (\"Because of the VRA, [Rucho and Lewis] increased the number of African-Americans\" in District 12 (citing 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 617; emphasis in original)).  But that is hardly the only plausible interpretation.  The statement could just as easily be understood as \"an explanation by [the] legislature that because they chose to add Guilford County back into CD\u00a012, the district ended up with an increased ability to elect African-American candidates, rather than the legislature explaining that they chose to add Guilford County back into CD\u00a012 because of the [racial] results that addition created.\"  Id., at 635 (Osteen, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis in original).  And because we are obligated to presume the good faith of the North Carolina Legislature, this latter interpretation is the appropriate one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even if one adopts the majority's interpretation, it adds little to the analysis.  The majority's close and incriminating reading of a statement issued to win public support for the new plan may represent poetic justice: Having attempted to blur the partisan aim of the new District 12, the legislature is hoisted on its own petard.  But poetic justice is not the type of justice that we are supposed to dispense.  This statement is some evidence that race played a role in the drawing of District 12, but it is a mistake to give this political statement too much weight.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again, we made precisely this point in Cromartie II.  There, the \"legislative redistricting leader,\" then-Senator Roy Cooper, testified before a legislative committee that the proposed plan \"\u00a0'provides for .\u00a0.\u00a0. racial and partisan balance.'\u00a0\"  532 U.\u00a0S., at 253 (emphasis added).  The District Court read the statement literally and concluded that the district had been drawn with a racial objective.  Ibid.  But this Court dismissed the statement, reasoning that although \"the phrase shows that the legislature considered race, along with other partisan and geographic considerations; .\u00a0.\u00a0. it says little or nothing about whether race played a predominant role comparatively speaking.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What was good in Cromartie II should also be good here.\n6\nDr. Ansolabehere's Testimony\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the majority cites Dr. Ansolabehere's testimony that black registered voters in the counties covered by District 12 were more likely to be drawn into District 12 than white registered voters and that black registered Democrats were more likely to be pulled in than white registered Democrats.  Ante, at 26-27.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is an obvious flaw in Dr. Ansolabehere's analysis.  He assumed that, if race was not the driving force behind the drawing of District 12, \"white and black registered voters would have approximately the same likelihood of inclusion in a given Congressional District.\"  App. 2597 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that would be true only if black and white voters were evenly distributed throughout the region, and his own maps showed that this was not so.  See id., at 322-328; 1 Record 128-133.  Black voters were concentrated in the cities located at the north and south ends of the district and constituted a supermajority of Democrats in the area covered by District 12.  See Part III-B, supra. As long as the basic shape of the district was retained, moving Democrats from areas outside but close to the old district boundaries naturally picked up far more black Democrats than white Democrats.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This explanation eluded Dr. Ansolabehere because he refused to consider either the implications of the political strategy that the legislature claimed to have pursued or the effects of the changes to District 12 on the surrounding districts.  App. 2578-2582.  The result was a distorted--and largely useless--analysis.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reviewing the evidence outlined above,20 two themes emerge.  First, District 12's borders and racial composition are readily explained by political considerations and the effects of the legislature's political strategy on the demographics of District 12.  Second, the majority largely ignores this explanation, as did the court below, and instead adopts the most damning interpretation of all available evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both of these analytical maneuvers violate our clearly established precedent.  Our cases say that we must \"\u00a0'exercise extraordinary caution'\u00a0\" \"\u00a0'where the State has articulated a legitimate political explanation for its districting decision,'\u00a0\" Cromartie II, supra, at 242 (emphasis deleted); the majority ignores that political explanation.  Our cases say that \"the good faith of a state legislature must be presumed,\" Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 915; the majority presumes the opposite.  And Cromartie II held that plaintiffs in a case like this are obligated to produce a map showing that the legislature could have achieved its political objectives without the racial effect seen in the challenged plan; here, the majority junks that rule and says that the plaintiffs' failure to produce such a map simply \"does not matter.\"  Ante, at 30.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment below regarding District 12 should be reversed, and I therefore respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0A plaintiff succeeds at this stage even if the evidence reveals that a legislature elevated race to the predominant criterion in order to advance other goals, including political ones.  See Bush v. Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S. 952, 968-970 (1996) (plurality opinion) (holding that race predominated when a legislature deliberately \"spread[\u00a0] the Black population\" among several districts in an effort to \"protect[\u00a0] Democratic incumbents\"); Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 914 (1995) (stating that the \"use of race as a proxy\" for \"political interest[s]\" is \"prohibit[ed]\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0Challenges to the constitutionality of congressional districts are heard by three-judge district courts, with a right of direct appeal to this Court.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72284(a), 1253.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The State's argument to the contrary rests on a legal proposition that was foreclosed almost as soon as it was raised in this Court.  According to the State, racial considerations cannot predominate in drawing district lines unless there is an \"actual conflict\" between those lines and \"traditional districting principles.\"  Brief for Appellants 45.  But we rejected that view earlier this Term, holding that when (as here) race furnished \"the overriding reason for choosing one map over others,\" a further showing of \"inconsistency between the enacted plan and traditional redistricting criteria\" is unnecessary to a finding of racial predominance.  Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10).  And in any event, the evidence recounted in the text indicates that District 1's boundaries did conflict with traditional districting principles--for example, by splitting numerous counties and precincts.  See supra, at 11.  So we would uphold the District Court's finding of racial predominance even under the (incorrect) legal standard the State proposes.\nFootnote 4\u00a0In the District Court, the parties also presented arguments relating to the first Gingles prerequisite, contesting whether the African-American community in the region was sufficiently large and compact to form a majority of a reasonably shaped district.  The court chose not to decide that fact-intensive question.  And aside from the State's unelaborated assertion that \"[t]here is no question that the first factor was satisfied,\" Brief for Appellants 52, the parties have not briefed or argued the issue before us.  We therefore have no occasion to address it.\nFootnote 5\u00a0North Carolina calls our attention to two expert reports on voting patterns throughout the State, but neither casts light on the relevant issue.  The first (by Dr. Thomas Brunell) showed that some elections in many of the State's counties exhibited \"statistically significant\" racially polarized voting.  App. 1001.  The second (by Dr. Ray Block) found that in various elections across the State, white voters were \"noticeably\" less likely than black voters to support black candidates.  Id., at 959.  From those far-flung data points--themselves based only on past elections--the experts opined (to no one's great surprise) that in North Carolina, as in most States, there are discernible, non-random relationships between race and voting.  But as the District Court found, see Harris v. McCrory, 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 600, 624 (MDNC 2016), that generalized conclusion fails to meaningfully (or indeed, at all) address the relevant local question: whether, in a new version of District 1 created without a focus on race, black voters would encounter \"sufficient[\u00a0]\" white bloc-voting to \"cancel [their] ability to elect representatives of their choice,\" Gingles, 478 U.\u00a0S., at 56.  And so the reports do not answer whether the legislature needed to boost District 1's BVAP to avoid potential \u00a72 liability.\nFootnote 6\u00a0Justice Alito charges us with \"ignor[ing]\" the State's political-gerrymander defense, making our analysis \"like Hamlet without the prince.\"  Post, at 20 (opinion concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent); see post, at 20, 34.  But we simply take the State's account for what it is: one side of a thoroughly two-sided case (and, as we will discuss, the side the District Court rejected, primarily on factual grounds).  By contrast, the dissent consistently treats the State's version of events (what it calls \"the Legislature's political strategy and the relationship between that strategy and [District 12's] racial composition,\" post, at 20) as if it were a simple \"fact of the matter\"--the premise of, rather than a contested claim in, this case.  See post, at 12-14, 16, 20, 26, 27-29, 33.  The dissent's narrative thus tracks, top-to-bottom and point-for-point, the testimony of Dr. Hofeller, the State's star witness at trial--so much so that the dissent could just have block-quoted that portion of the transcript and saved itself a fair bit of trouble.  Compare post, at 12-20, with App. 2671-2755.  Imagine (to update the dissent's theatrical reference) Inherit the Wind retold solely from the perspective of William Jennings Bryan, with nary a thought given to the competing viewpoint of Clarence Darrow.\nFootnote 7\u00a0As earlier noted, that inquiry is satisfied when legislators have \"place[d] a significant number of voters within or without\" a district predominantly because of their race, regardless of their ultimate objective in taking that step.  See supra, at 2, and n.\u00a01.  So, for example, if legislators use race as their predominant districting criterion with the end goal of advancing their partisan interests--perhaps thinking that a proposed district is more \"sellable\" as a race-based VRA compliance measure than as a political gerrymander and will accomplish much the same thing--their action still triggers strict scrutiny.  See Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S., at 968-970 (plurality opinion).  In other words, the sorting of voters on the grounds of their race remains suspect even if race is meant to function as a proxy for other (including political) characteristics.  See Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 914.\nFootnote 8\u00a0Undeterred by these settled principles, the dissent undertakes to refind the facts of this case at every turn.  See post, at 11-33.  Indeed, the dissent repeatedly flips the appropriate standard of review--arguing, for example, that the District Court's is not \"the only plausible interpretation\" of one piece of contested evidence and that the State offered an \"entirely natural\" view of another.  Post, at 24, 31; see also post, at 20, 26, 27, 33.  Underlying that approach to the District Court's factfinding is an elemental error: The dissent mistakes the rule that a legislature's good faith should be presumed \"until a claimant makes a showing sufficient to support th[e] allegation\" of \"race-based decisionmaking,\" Miller, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 915, for a kind of super-charged, pro-State presumption on appeal, trumping clear-error review.  See post, at 11-12, n.\u00a07.\nFootnote 9\u00a0The dissent's contrary reading of the preclearance submission--as reporting the redistricters' \"decis[ion] not to construct District 12 as a majority-minority district,\" post, at 24--is difficult to fathom.  The language the dissent cites explains only why Rucho and Lewis rejected one particular way of creating such a district; the submission then relates their alternative (and, of course, successful) approach to attaining an over-50% BVAP.  See App. 478-479.\nFootnote 10\u00a0Watt recalled that he laughed in response because the VRA required no such target.  See id., at 2369.  And he told Rucho that \"the African-American community will laugh at you\" too.  Ibid.  Watt explained to Rucho: \"I'm getting 65 percent of the vote in a 40 percent black district.  If you ramp my [BVAP] to over 50 percent, I'll probably get 80 percent of the vote, and[\u00a0] that's not what the Voting Rights Act was designed to do.\"  Ibid.\nFootnote 11\u00a0The court acknowledged that, in the earlier state-court trial involving District 12, Rucho denied making the comments that Watt recalled.  See 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 617-618.  But the court explained that it could not \"assess [the] credibility\" of Rucho's contrary account because even though he was listed as a defense witness and present in the courtroom throughout the trial, the State chose not to put him on the witness stand.  Id., at 618.\nFootnote 12\u00a0The dissent conjures a different way of explaining Watt's testimony.  Perhaps, the dissent suggests, Rucho disclosed a majority-minority target to Watt, but Watt then changed Rucho's mind--and perhaps it was just a coincidence (or a mistake?) that Rucho still created a 50.7%-BVAP district.  See post, at 25-26.  But nothing in the record supports that hypothesis.  See ibid. (relying exclusively on the State's preclearance submission to back up this story); supra, at 23, and n.\u00a09 (correcting the dissent's misreading of that submission).  And the State, lacking the dissent's creativity, did not think to present it at trial.\nFootnote 13\u00a0The dissent charges that this comparison is misleading, but offers no good reason why that is so.  See post, at 29-30.  It is quite true, as the dissent notes, that another part of District 12 (in Mecklenburg County) experienced a net increase in black voters even larger than the one in Guilford County.  See post, at 30.  (The net increases in the two counties thus totaled more than 35,000; they were then partially offset by net decreases in other counties in District 12.)  But that is irrelevant to the point made here: Without the numerous black voters added to District 12 in Guilford County--where the evidence most clearly indicates voters were chosen based on race--the district would have fallen well shy of majority-minority status.\nFootnote 14\u00a0Hofeller did not dispute Ansolabehere's figures, but questioned his inference.  Those striking patterns, the mapmaker claimed, were nothing more than the result of his own reliance on voting data from the 2008 Presidential election--because that information (i.e., who voted for Obama and who for McCain) tracked race better than it did party registration.  See App. 1101, 1111-1114; cf. Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S. 234, 245 (2001) (recognizing that \"party registration and party preference do not always correspond\").  As we have just recounted, however, the District Court had other reasons to disbelieve Hofeller's testimony that he used solely that electoral data to draw District 12's lines.  See supra, at 25-26.  And Ansolabehere contended that even if Hofeller did so, that choice of data could itself suggest an intent to sort voters by race.  Voting results from a \"single [Presidential] election with a Black candidate,\" Ansolabehere explained, would be a \"problematic and unusual\" indicator of future party preference, because of the racial dynamics peculiar to such a match-up.  App. 341; see id., at 342-343.  That data would, indeed, be much more useful as a reflection of an area's racial composition: \"The Obama vote,\" Ansolabehere found, is \"an extremely strong positive indicator of the location of Black registered voters\" and, conversely, an \"extremely strong negative indicator of the location of White registered voters.\"  Id., at 342; see id., at 2546-2550.\nFootnote 15\u00a0The dissent responds that an alternative-map requirement \"should not be too hard\" for plaintiffs (or at least \"sophisticated\" litigants \"like those in the present case\") to meet.  Post, at 10-11.  But if the plaintiffs have already proved by a preponderance of the evidence that race predominated in drawing district lines, then we have no warrant to demand that they jump through additional evidentiary hoops (whether the exercise would cost a hundred dollars or a million, a week's more time or a year's).  Or at least that would be so if we followed the usual rules.  Underlying the dissent's view that we should not--that we should instead create a special evidentiary burden--is its belief that \"litigation of this sort\" often seeks to \"obtain in court what [a political party] could not achieve in the political arena,\" post, at 9, and so that little is lost by making suits like this one as hard as possible.  But whatever the possible motivations for bringing such suits (and the dissent says it is not questioning \"what occurred here,\" ibid.), they serve to prevent legislatures from taking unconstitutional districting action--which happens more often than the dissent must suppose.  State lawmakers sometimes misunderstand the VRA's requirements (as may have occurred here with respect to \u00a75), leading them to employ race as a predominant districting criterion when they should not.  See supra, at 22-24, and n.\u00a010.  Or they may resort to race-based districting for ultimately political reasons, leveraging the strong correlation between race and voting behavior to advance their partisan interests.  See nn. 1, 7, supra.  Or, finally--though we hope less commonly--they may simply seek to suppress the electoral power of minority voters.  When plaintiffs meet their burden of showing that such conduct has occurred, there is no basis for subjecting them to additional--and unique--evidentiary hurdles, preventing them from receiving the remedy to which they are entitled.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0I concur in the judgment of the Court regarding Congressional District 1.  The State concedes that the district was intentionally created as a majority-minority district.  See Brief for Appellants 44.  And appellants have not satisfied strict scrutiny.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Article I, \u00a74, of the Constitution reserves to state legislatures the power to prescribe \"[t]he Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives,\" subject to Congress's authority to \"make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators.\"\nFootnote 3\u00a0According to polling data, around 90% of African-American  voters have voted for the Democratic candidate for President in  recent years.  See https:\/\/ropercenter.cornell.edu\/polls\/us-elections\/how-groups-voted\/groups-voted-2016\/ (all Internet materials as last visited May 19, 2017) (in 2016, 88%); https:\/\/ropercenter.cornell.edu\/polls\/us-elections\/how-groups-voted\/how-groups-voted-2012\/ (in 2012, 93%); https:\/\/ropercenter.cornell.edu\/polls\/us-elections\/how-groups-voted\/how-groups-voted-2008\/ (in 2008, 95%); https:\/\/ropercenter.cornell.edu\/ polls\/us-elections\/how-groups-voted\/how-groups-voted-2004\/ (in 2004, 88%); https:\/\/\u00a0ropercenter.cornell.edu\u00a0\/polls\u00a0\/us-elections\u00a0\/how-groups-voted\/how-groups-voted-2000\/ (in 2000, 90%).\nFootnote 4\u00a0The challengers' failure to do so is especially glaring given that at least two alternative maps were introduced during the legislative debates over the 2011 map, see 2 Record 357-366, 402-411; App. 883-887, though neither party contends that those maps met the legislature's political goals.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Ignoring all of these well-founded reasons supporting the alternative-map requirement, the majority mischaracterizes my argument as, at bottom, resting on the proposition that \"little is lost by making suits like this one as hard as possible.\"  Ante, at 31, n.\u00a015.  That is not my view, and it is richly ironic for the Court that announced the alternative-map requirement to accuse those who defend the requirement of erecting illegitimate and unnecessary barriers to the vindication of constitutional rights.\nFootnote 6\u00a0The majority cites Bush v. Vera, 517 U.\u00a0S. 952 (1996), as proof that the lack of an alternative-map requirement has not \"made any difference\" in our past cases.  Ante, at 30.  Vera was decided before Cromartie II, 532 U.\u00a0S. 234 (2001), announced the alternative-map requirement, so its failure to mention that requirement is hardly surprising.\nFootnote 7\u00a0The majority accuses me of failing to accord proper deference to the District Court's factual findings and of disregarding the clear-error standard of review, ante, at 20, n.\u00a08, but that is nonsense.  Unlike the majority, I simply follow Cromartie II by evaluating the District Court's findings in light of the plaintiffs' burden.  See 532 U.\u00a0S., at 241, 257.  The heavier a plaintiffs' evidentiary burden, the harder it is to find that plaintiffs have carried their burden--and the more likely that it would be clearly erroneous to find that they have.  In this context, we are supposed to presume that the North Carolina Legislature acted in good faith and exercise \"extraordinary caution\" before rejecting the legislature's political explanation.  Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.\u00a0S. 900, 915-916 (1995).  Given that the State has offered a coherent and persuasive political explanation for District 12's boundaries, plaintiffs bear a \"demanding\" burden in attempting to prove racial predominance.  Cromartie II, supra, at 241, 257.  Because the evidence they have put forward is so weak, see Part III-C, infra, they have failed to carry that burden, and it was clear error for the District Court to hold otherwise.  See Cromartie II, supra, at 241, 257 (applying the same clear-error analysis that I apply here).\nFootnote 8\u00a0This same basic shape was retained in the map proposed in the state legislature by the Democratic leadership and in the map submitted by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice.  See 2 Record 402, 357.\nFootnote 9\u00a0A fifth district, District 2, appears to touch District 12 at the border of Guilford and Randolph Counties, but only to a de minimis extent.\nFootnote 10\u00a0District 12 was overpopulated by 2,847 people heading into the 2011 redistricting cycle.  App. 1115; 2 Record 347.\nFootnote 11\u00a0North Carolina State Board of Elections, 11\/02\/2010 Official General Election Results--Statewide, http:\/\/er.ncsbe.gov\/?election_dt= 11\/02\/2010&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=0.\nFootnote 12\u00a0North Carolina State Board of Elections, 11\/08\/2016 Official General Election Results--Statewide, http:\/\/er.ncsbe.gov\/?election_dt= 11\/08\/2016&county_id=0&office=FED&contest=0.\nFootnote 13\u00a0As noted, Dr. Hofeller used the results of the 2008 Presidential election as a measure of party preference.  In 2008, the Democratic candidate for President was then-Senator Barack Obama, the first black major party Presidential nominee, and it is true that President Obama won a higher percentage of the nationwide African-American vote in 2008 (95%) than did the Democratic Presidential candidates in 2000 (90%), 2004 (88%), and 2016 (88%).  See supra, at 5, n. 3.  But as these figures show, the correlation between race and political party preference was very high in all these elections.  Therefore, the use of 2008 statistics does not appear to have substantially affected the analysis.\nFootnote 14\u00a0Even two alternative redistricting plans offered prior to the enactment of the 2011 map--one submitted by the Southern Coalition for Social Justice and the other submitted by Democratic leaders in the state legislature--retained the basic shape of District 12 and resulted in black voters constituting 71.53% and 69.14% of registered Democrats, respectively.  2 Record 361 (Southern Coalition for Social Justice map), 406 (Congressional Fair and Legal map); see also App. 883-887, 2071 (Finding 34), 2145 (Finding 173).\nFootnote 15\u00a0To minimize jargon, I will use the term \"precincts\" to refer to vote tabulation districts (VTDs).  See id., at 1609-1610, for an explanation of VTDs.\nFootnote 16\u00a0The District Court's description of the legislature's political strategy was cursory, and it spent no time analyzing the demographics of the region.  See Harris v. McCrory, 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 600, 618-619 (MDNC 2016).\nFootnote 17\u00a0The majority concedes that this is a \"thoroughly two-sided case,\" ante, at 18, n.\u00a06, yet the majority's opinion is thoroughly one sided.  It offers no excuse for its failure to meaningfully describe--much less engage with--the State's political explanation for District 12's boundaries.  Instead, it tries to change the subject, accusing me of treating the State's account as essentially uncontested.  Ante, at 19, n.\u00a06.  This is a hollow accusation.  In this opinion, I lay out the evidence supporting the State's political explanation in Parts III-A and III-B, but I do not accept that account at face value.  Instead, I go on to  demonstrate that the plaintiffs' contrary arguments are exceedingly weak (Part III-C).  Only after considering the evidence on both sides do I conclude that the State's explanation holds up.\nFootnote 18\u00a0That being said, Congressman Watt's testimony was double-hearsay: Congressman Watt testified about what Senator Rucho said someone else said.  See App. 1345 (state trial court evidentiary ruling).  For unknown reasons, Appellants failed to raise this objection below, but that only means that the testimony was admitted.  The weight of that testimony is a different matter, and in general, hearsay should be viewed with great skepticism.  Ellicott v. Pearl, 10 Pet. 412, 436 (1836) (majority opinion of Story, J.) (hearsay is \"exceedingly infirm, unsatisfactory and intrinsically weak in its very nature and character\"); Queen v. Hepburn, 7 Cranch 290, 296 (1813) (majority opinion of Marshall, C.\u00a0J.) (\"Its intrinsic weakness, its incompetency to satisfy the mind of the existence of the fact, and the frauds which might be practiced under its cover, combine to support the rule that hearsay evidence is totally inadmissible\"); see also Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.\u00a0S. 284, 298 (1973).\nFootnote 19\u00a0Significantly, while the District Court doubted Dr. Hofeller's contention that politics, not race, dictated the boundaries of District 12 and that Dr. Hofeller was unaware of the relevant racial demographics in the region, see 159 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d, at 619-620, and n.\u00a08, it did not dispute that only political data was displayed on his screen when he drew the district.  The state trial court expressly found that only political data was displayed on Dr. Hofeller's screen.  See App. 2150 (Finding 188).\nFootnote 20\u00a0The District Court relied on other evidence as well, but its probative value is so weak that even the majority does not cite it.\n\n\n","15":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOUNTY OF LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, ET AL. v. MENDEZ ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-369\nArgued: March 22, 2017Decided: May 30, 2017\n\n\nThe Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department received word from a confidential informant that a potentially armed and dangerous parolee-at-large had been seen at a certain residence.  While other officers searched the main house, Deputies Conley and Pederson searched the back of the property where, unbeknownst to the deputies, respondents Mendez and Garcia were napping inside a shack where they lived.  Without a search warrant and without announcing their presence, the deputies opened the door of the shack.  Mendez rose from the bed, holding a BB gun that he used to kill pests.  Deputy Conley yelled, \"Gun!\" and the deputies immediately opened fire, shooting Mendez and Garcia multiple times.  Officers did not find the parolee in the shack or elsewhere on the property.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mendez and Garcia sued Deputies Conley and Pederson and the County under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, pressing three Fourth Amendment claims: a warrantless entry claim, a knock-and-announce claim, and an excessive force claim.  On the first two claims, the District Court awarded Mendez and Garcia nominal damages.  On the excessive force claim, the court found that the deputies' use of force was reasonable under Graham v. Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386, but held them liable nonetheless under the Ninth Circuit's provocation rule, which makes an officer's otherwise reasonable use of force unreasonable if (1) the officer \"intentionally or recklessly provokes a violent confrontation\" and (2) \"the provocation is an independent Fourth Amendment violation,\" Billington v. Smith, 292 F.\u00a03d 1177, 1189.  On appeal, the Ninth Circuit held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on the knock-and-announce claim and that the warrantless entry violated clearly established law.  It also affirmed the District Court's application of the provocation rule, and held, in the alternative, that basic notions of proximate cause would support liability even without the provocation rule.\nHeld:\u00a0The Fourth Amendment provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit's \"provocation rule.\"  Pp.\u00a05-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The provocation rule is incompatible with this Court's excessive force jurisprudence, which sets forth a settled and exclusive framework for analyzing whether the force used in making a seizure complies with the Fourth Amendment.  See Graham, supra, at 395.  The operative question in such cases is \"whether the totality of the circumstances justifie[s] a particular sort of search or seizure.\"  Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.\u00a0S. 1, 8-9.  When an officer carries out a seizure that is reasonable, taking into account all relevant circumstances, there is no valid excessive force claim.  The provocation rule, however, instructs courts to look back in time to see if a different Fourth Amendment violation was somehow tied to the eventual use of force, an approach that mistakenly conflates distinct Fourth Amendment claims.  The proper framework is set out in Graham.  To the extent that a plaintiff has other Fourth Amendment claims, they should be analyzed separately.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit attempts to cabin the provocation rule by defining a two-prong test: First, the separate constitutional violation must \"creat[e] a situation which led to\" the use of force; and second, the separate constitutional violation must be committed recklessly or intentionally.  815 F.\u00a03d 1178, 1193.  Neither limitation, however, solves the fundamental problem: namely, that the provocation rule is an unwarranted and illogical expansion of Graham.  In addition, each limitation creates problems of its own.  First, the rule relies on a vague causal standard.  Second, while the reasonableness of a search or seizure is almost always based on objective factors, the provocation rule looks to the subjective intent of the officers who carried out the seizure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no need to distort the excessive force inquiry in this way in order to hold law enforcement officers liable for the foreseeable consequences of all their constitutional torts.  Plaintiffs can, subject to qualified immunity, generally recover damages that are proximately caused by any Fourth Amendment violation.  See, e.g., Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477, 483.  Here, if respondents cannot recover on their excessive force claim, that will not foreclose recovery for injuries proximately caused by the warrantless entry.  Pp.\u00a05-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Ninth Circuit's proximate-cause holding is similarly tainted.  Its analysis appears to focus solely on the risks foreseeably associated with the failure to knock and announce--the claim on which the court concluded that the deputies had qualified immunity--rather than the warrantless entry.  On remand, the court should revisit the question whether proximate cause permits respondents to recover damages for their injuries based on the deputies' failure to secure a warrant at the outset.

The Ninth Circuit has adopted a \"provocation rule\" that imposes liability in such a situation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that the Fourth Amendment provides no basis for such a rule.  A different Fourth Amendment violation cannot transform a later, reasonable use of force into an unreasonable seizure.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In October 2010, deputies from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department were searching for a parolee-at-large named Ronnie O'Dell.  A felony arrest warrant had been issued for O'Dell, who was believed to be armed and dangerous and had previously evaded capture.  Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, No. 2:11-cv-04771 (CD Cal.), App. to Pet. for Cert. 56a, 64a.  Deputies Christopher Conley and Jennifer Pederson were assigned to assist the task force searching for O'Dell.  Id., at 57a-58a.  The task force received word from a confidential informant that O'Dell had been seen on a bicycle at a home in Lancaster, California, owned by Paula Hughes, and the officers then mapped out a plan for apprehending O'Dell.  Id., at 58a.  Some officers would approach the front door of the Hughes residence, while Deputies Conley and Pederson would search the rear of the property and cover the back door of the residence.  Id., at 59a.  During this briefing, it was announced that a man named Angel Mendez lived in the backyard of the Hughes home with a pregnant woman named Jennifer Garcia (now Mrs. Jennifer Mendez).  Ibid.  Deputy Pederson heard this announcement, but at trial Deputy Conley testified that he did not remember it.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the officers reached the Hughes residence around midday, three of them knocked on the front door while Deputies Conley and Pederson went to the back of the property.  Id., at 63a.  At the front door, Hughes asked if the officers had a warrant.  Ibid.  A sergeant responded that they did not but were searching for O'Dell and had a warrant for his arrest.  Ibid.  One of the officers heard what he thought were sounds of someone running inside the house.  Id., at 64a.  As the officers prepared to open the door by force, Hughes opened the door and informed them that O'Dell was not in the house.  Ibid.  She was placed under arrest, and the house was searched, but O'Dell was not found.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, Deputies Conley and Pederson, with guns drawn, searched the rear of the residence, which was cluttered with debris and abandoned automobiles.  Id., at 60a, 65a.  The property included three metal storage sheds and a one-room shack made of wood and plywood.  Id., at 60a.  Mendez had built the shack, and he and Garcia had lived inside for about 10 months.  Id., at 61a.  The shack had a single doorway covered by a blue blanket.  Ibid.  Amid the debris on the ground, an electrical cord ran into the shack, and an air conditioner was mounted on the side.  Id., at 62a.  A gym storage locker and clothes and other possessions were nearby.  Id., at 61a.  Mendez kept a BB rifle in the shack for use on rats and other pests.  Id., at 62a.  The BB gun \"closely resembled a small caliber rifle.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Deputies Conley and Pederson first checked the three metal sheds and found no one inside.  Id., at 65a.  They then approached the door of the shack.  Id., at 66a.  Unbeknownst to the officers, Mendez and Garcia were in the shack and were napping on a futon.  Id., at 67a.  The deputies did not have a search warrant and did not knock and announce their presence.  Id., at 66a.  When Deputy Conley opened the wooden door and pulled back the blanket, Mendez thought it was Ms. Hughes and rose from the bed, picking up the BB gun so he could stand up and place it on the floor.  Id., at 68a.  As a result, when the deputies entered, he was holding the BB gun, and it was \"point[ing] somewhat south towards Deputy Conley.\"  Id., at 69a.  Deputy Conley yelled, \"Gun!\" and the deputies immediately opened fire, discharging a total of 15 rounds.  Id., at 69a-70a.  Mendez and Garcia \"were shot multiple times and suffered severe injuries,\" and Mendez's right leg was later amputated below the knee.  Id., at 70a.  O'Dell was not in the shack or anywhere on the property.  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mendez and his wife (respondents here) filed suit under Rev. Stat. \u00a71976, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, against petitioners, the County of Los Angeles and Deputies Conley and Pederson.  As relevant here, they pressed three Fourth Amendment claims.  First, they claimed that the deputies executed an unreasonable search by entering the shack without a warrant (the \"warrantless entry claim\"); second, they asserted that the deputies performed an unreasonable search because they failed to announce their presence before entering the shack (the \"knock-and-announce claim\"); and third, they claimed that the deputies effected an unreasonable seizure by deploying excessive force in opening fire after entering the shack (the \"excessive force claim\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a bench trial, the District Court ruled largely in favor of respondents.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 135a-136a.  The court found Deputy Conley liable on the warrantless entry claim, and the court also found both deputies liable on the knock-and-announce claim.  But the court awarded nominal damages for these violations because \"the act of pointing the BB gun\" was a superseding cause \"as far as damage [from the shooting was] concerned.\"  App. 238.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court then addressed respondents' excessive force claim.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 105a-127a.  The court began by evaluating whether the deputies used excessive force under Graham v. Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386 (1989).  The court held that, under Graham, the deputies' use of force was reasonable \"given their belief that a man was holding a firearm rifle threatening their lives.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 108a.  But the court did not end its excessive force analysis at this point.  Instead, the court turned to the Ninth Circuit's provocation rule, which holds that \"an officer's otherwise reasonable (and lawful) defensive use of force is unreasonable as a matter of law, if (1) the officer intentionally or recklessly provoked a violent response, and (2) that provocation is an independent constitutional violation.\"  Id., at 111a.  Based on this rule, the District Court held the deputies liable for excessive force and awarded respondents around $4 million in damages.  Id., at 135a-136a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  815 F.\u00a03d 1178 (CA9 2016).  Contrary to the District Court, the Court of Appeals held that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on the knock-and-announce claim.  Id., at 1191-1193.  But the court concluded that the warrantless entry of the shack violated clearly established law and was attributable to both deputies.  Id., at 1191, 1195.  Finally, and most important for present purposes, the court affirmed the application of the provocation rule.  The Court of Appeals did not disagree with the conclusion that the shooting was reasonable under Graham; instead, like the District Court, the Court of Appeals applied the provocation rule and held the deputies liable for the use of force on the theory that they had intentionally and recklessly brought about the shooting by entering the shack without a warrant in violation of clearly established law.  815 F.\u00a03d, at 1193.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals also adopted an alternative rationale for its judgment.  It held that \"basic notions of proximate cause\" would support liability even without the provocation rule because it was \"reasonably foreseeable\" that the officers would meet an armed homeowner when they \"barged into the shack unannounced.\"  Id., at 1194-1195.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit's provocation rule permits an excessive force claim under the Fourth Amendment \"where an officer intentionally or recklessly provokes a violent confrontation, if the provocation is an independent Fourth Amendment violation.\"  Billington v. Smith, 292 F.\u00a03d 1177, 1189 (CA9 2002).  The rule comes into play after a forceful seizure has been judged to be reasonable under Graham.  Once a court has made that determination, the rule instructs the court to ask whether the law enforcement officer violated the Fourth Amendment in some other way in the course of events leading up to the seizure.  If so, that separate Fourth Amendment violation may \"render the officer's otherwise reasonable defensive use of force unreasonable as a matter of law.\"  Id., at 1190-1191.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provocation rule, which has been \"sharply questioned\" outside the Ninth Circuit, City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a04 (2015) (slip op., at 14, n.\u00a04), is incompatible with our excessive force jurisprudence.  The rule's fundamental flaw is that it uses another constitutional violation to manufacture an excessive force claim where one would not otherwise exist.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fourth Amendment prohibits \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\"  \"[R]easonableness is always the touchstone of Fourth Amendment analysis,\" Birchfield v. North Dakota, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 37), and reasonableness is generally assessed by carefully weighing \"the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests alleged to justify the intrusion.\"  Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.\u00a0S. 1, 8 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our case law sets forth a settled and exclusive framework for analyzing whether the force used in making a seizure complies with the Fourth Amendment.  See Graham, 490 U.\u00a0S., at 395.  As in other areas of our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, \"[d]etermining whether the force used to effect a particular seizure is 'reasonable'\u00a0\" requires balancing of the individual's Fourth Amendment interests against the relevant government interests.  Id., at 396.  The operative question in excessive force cases is \"whether the totality of the circumstances justifie[s] a particular sort of search or seizure.\"  Garner, supra, at 8-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reasonableness of the use of force is evaluated under an \"objective\" inquiry that pays \"careful attention to the facts and circumstances of each particular case.\"  Graham, supra, at 396.  And \"[t]he 'reasonableness' of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20\/20 vision of hindsight.\"  Ibid.  \"Excessive force claims .\u00a0.\u00a0. are evaluated for objective reasonableness based upon the information the officers had when the conduct occurred.\"  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.\u00a0S. 194, 207 (2001).  That inquiry is dispositive: When an officer carries out a seizure that is reasonable, taking into account all relevant circumstances, there is no valid excessive force claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The basic problem with the provocation rule is that it fails to stop there.  Instead, the rule provides a novel and unsupported path to liability in cases in which the use of force was reasonable.  Specifically, it instructs courts to look back in time to see if there was a different Fourth Amendment violation that is somehow tied to the eventual use of force.  That distinct violation, rather than the forceful seizure itself, may then serve as the foundation of the plaintiff's excessive force claim.  Billington, supra, at 1190 (\"The basis of liability for the subsequent use of force is the initial constitutional violation .\u00a0.\u00a0. \").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This approach mistakenly conflates distinct Fourth Amendment claims.  Contrary to this approach, the objective reasonableness analysis must be conducted separately for each search or seizure that is alleged to be unconstitutional.  An excessive force claim is a claim that a law enforcement officer carried out an unreasonable seizure through a use of force that was not justified under the relevant circumstances.  It is not a claim that an officer used reasonable force after committing a distinct Fourth Amendment violation such as an unreasonable entry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By conflating excessive force claims with other Fourth Amendment claims, the provocation rule permits excessive force claims that cannot succeed on their own terms.  That is precisely how the rule operated in this case.  The District Court found (and the Ninth Circuit did not dispute) that the use of force by the deputies was reasonable under Graham.  However, respondents were still able to recover damages because the deputies committed a separate constitutional violation (the warrantless entry into the shack) that in some sense set the table for the use of force.  That is wrong.  The framework for analyzing excessive force claims is set out in Graham.  If there is no excessive force claim under Graham, there is no excessive force claim at all.  To the extent that a plaintiff has other Fourth Amendment claims, they should be analyzed  separately.*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit's efforts to cabin the provocation rule only undermine it further.  The Ninth Circuit appears to recognize that it would be going entirely too far to suggest that any Fourth Amendment violation that is connected to a reasonable use of force should create a valid excessive force claim.  See, e.g., Beier v. Lewiston, 354 F.\u00a03d 1058, 1064 (CA9 2004) (\"Because the excessive force and false arrest factual inquiries are distinct, establishing a lack of probable cause to make an arrest does not establish an excessive force claim, and vice-versa\").  Instead, that court has endeavored to limit the rule to only those distinct Fourth Amendment violations that in some sense \"provoked\" the need to use force.  The concept of provocation, in turn, has been defined using a two-prong test.  First, the separate constitutional violation must \"creat[e] a situation which led to\" the use of force; second, the separate constitutional violation must be committed recklessly or intentionally.  815 F.\u00a03d, at 1193 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither of these limitations solves the fundamental problem of the provocation rule: namely, that it is an unwarranted and illogical expansion of Graham.  But in addition, each of the limitations creates problems of its own.  First, the rule includes a vague causal standard.  It applies when a prior constitutional violation \"created a situation which led to\" the use of force.  The rule does not incorporate the familiar proximate cause standard.  Indeed, it is not clear what causal standard is being applied.  Second, while the reasonableness of a search or seizure is almost always based on objective factors, see Whren v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 806, 814 (1996), the provocation rule looks to the subjective intent of the officers who carried out the seizure.  As noted, under the Ninth Circuit's rule, a prior Fourth Amendment violation may be held to have provoked a later, reasonable use of force only if the prior violation was intentional or reckless.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provocation rule may be motivated by the notion that it is important to hold law enforcement officers liable for the foreseeable consequences of all of their constitutional torts.  See Billington, 292 F.\u00a03d, at 1190 (\"[I]f an officer's provocative actions are objectively unreasonable under the Fourth Amendment, .\u00a0.\u00a0. liability is established, and the question becomes .\u00a0.\u00a0. what harms the constitutional violation proximately caused\").  However, there is no need to distort the excessive force inquiry in order to accomplish this objective.  To the contrary, both parties accept the principle that plaintiffs can--subject to qualified immunity--generally recover damages that are proximately caused by any Fourth Amendment violation.  See, e.g., Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477, 483 (1994) (\u00a71983 \"creates a species of tort liability\" informed by tort principles regarding \"damages and the prerequisites for their recovery\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); Memphis Community School Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.\u00a0S. 299, 306 (1986) (\"[W]hen \u00a71983 plaintiffs seek damages for violations of constitutional rights, the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to principles derived from the common law of torts\").  Thus, there is no need to dress up every Fourth Amendment claim as an excessive force claim.  For example, if the plaintiffs in this case cannot recover on their excessive force claim, that will not foreclose recovery for injuries proximately caused by the warrantless entry.  The harm proximately caused by these  two torts may overlap, but the two claims should not be confused.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals also held that \"even without relying on [the] provocation theory, the deputies are liable for the shooting under basic notions of proximate cause.\"  815 F.\u00a03d, at 1194.  In other words, the court apparently concluded that the shooting was proximately caused by the deputies' warrantless entry of the shack.  Proper analysis of this proximate cause question required consideration of the \"foreseeability or the scope of the risk created by the predicate conduct,\" and required the court to conclude that there was \"some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\"  Paroline v. United States, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals' proximate cause analysis appears to have been tainted by the same errors that cause us to reject the provocation rule.  The court reasoned that when officers make a \"startling entry\" by \"barg[ing] into\" a home \"unannounced,\" it is reasonably foreseeable that violence may result.  815 F.\u00a03d, at 1194-1195 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But this appears to focus solely on the risks foreseeably associated with the failure to knock and announce, which could not serve as the basis for liability since the Court of Appeals concluded that the officers had qualified immunity on that claim.  By contrast, the Court of Appeals did not identify the foreseeable risks associated with the relevant constitutional violation (the warrantless entry); nor did it explain how, on these facts, respondents' injuries were proximately caused by the warrantless entry.  In other words, the Court of Appeals' proximate cause analysis, like the provocation rule, conflated distinct Fourth Amendment claims and required only a murky causal link between the warrantless entry and the injuries attributed to it.  On remand, the court should revisit the question whether proximate cause permits respondents to recover damages for their shooting injuries based on the deputies' failure to secure a warrant at the outset.  See Bank of America Corp. v. Miami, ante, at 12 (declining to \"draw the precise boundaries of proximate cause\" in the first instance).  The arguments made on this point by the parties and by the United States as amicus provide a useful starting point for this inquiry.  See Brief for Petitioners 42-56; Brief for Respondents 20-31, 51-59; Reply Brief 17-24; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26-32.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0Respondents do not attempt to defend the provocation rule.  Instead, they argue that the judgment below should be affirmed under Graham itself.  Graham commands that an officer's use of force be assessed for reasonableness under the \"totality of the circumstances.\"  490 U.\u00a0S., at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted).  On respondents' view, that means taking into account unreasonable police conduct prior to the use of force that foreseeably created the need to use it.  Brief for Respondents 42-43.  We did not grant certiorari on that question, and the decision below did not address it.  Accordingly, we decline to address it here.  See, e.g., McLane Co. v. EEOC, ante, at 11 (\"[W]e are a court of review, not of first view\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  All we hold today is that once a use of force is deemed reasonable under Graham, it may not be found unreasonable by reference to some separate constitutional violation.  Any argument regarding the District Court's application of Graham in this case should be addressed to the Ninth Circuit on remand.\n\n\n","16":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCOVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MISSOURI, INC., FKA GROUP HEALTH PLAN, INC. v. NEVILS(2017)\nNo. 16-149\nArgued: March 1, 2017Decided: April 18, 2017\n\n\nThe Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) authorizes the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to contract with private carriers for federal employees' health insurance.  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a78902(a), (d).  FEHBA contains an express-preemption provision, \u00a78902(m)(1), which states that the \"terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law .\u00a0.\u00a0. which relates to health insurance or plans.\"  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OPM's contracts have long required private carriers to seek subrogation and reimbursement.  Accordingly, OPM's regulations make a carrier's \"right to pursue and receive subrogation and reimbursement recoveries .\u00a0.\u00a0. a condition of and a limitation on the nature of benefits or benefit payments and on the provision of benefits under the plan's coverage.\"  5 CFR \u00a7890.106(b)(1).  In 2015, OPM published a new rule confirming that a carrier's subrogation and reimbursement rights and responsibilities \"relate to the nature, provision, and extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) within the meaning of\" \u00a78902(m)(1), and \"are\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. effective notwithstanding any state or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.\"  \u00a7890.106(h).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Jodie Nevils was insured under a FEHBA plan offered by petitioner Coventry Health Care of Missouri.  When Nevils was injured in an automobile accident, Coventry paid his medical expenses.  Coventry subsequently asserted a lien against part of the settlement Nevils recovered from the driver who caused his injuries.  Nevils satisfied the lien, then filed a class action in Missouri state court, alleging that, under Missouri law, which does not permit subrogation or reimbursement in this context, Coventry had unlawfully obtained reimbursement.  Coventry countered that \u00a78902(m)(1) preempted the state law.  The trial court granted summary judgment in Coventry's favor, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Missouri Supreme Court reversed.  Finding \u00a78902(m)(1) susceptible to diverse plausible readings, the court invoked a \"presumption against preemption\" to conclude that the federal statute's preemptive scope excluded subrogation and reimbursement.  On remand from this Court for further consideration in light of OPM's 2015 rule, the Missouri Supreme Court adhered to its earlier decision.  A majority of the Missouri Supreme Court also held that \u00a78902(m)(1) violates the Supremacy Clause.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Because contractual subrogation and reimbursement prescriptions plainly \"relate to .\u00a0.\u00a0. payments with respect to benefits,\" \u00a78902(m)(1), they override state laws barring subrogation and reimbursement.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This reading best comports with \u00a78902(m)(1)'s text, context, and purpose.  Contractual provisions for subrogation and reimbursement \"relate to .\u00a0.\u00a0. payments with respect to benefits\" because subrogation and reimbursement rights yield just such payments.  When a carrier exercises its right to either reimbursement or subrogation, it receives from either the beneficiary or a third party \"payment\" respecting the benefits the carrier had previously paid.  The carrier's very provision of benefits triggers the right to payment.  Congress' use of the expansive phrase \"relate to,\" which \"express[es] a broad pre-emptive purpose,\" Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.\u00a0S. 374, 383, weighs against Nevils' effort to narrow the term \"payments\" to exclude payments that occur \"long after\" a carrier's provision of benefits.  Nevils' argument that Congress intended to preempt only state coverage requirements, e.g., inclusion of acupuncture and chiropractic services, also miscarries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutory context and purpose reinforce this conclusion.  FEHBA concerns \"benefits from a federal health insurance plan for federal employees that arise from a federal law.\"  Bell v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Okla., 823 F.\u00a03d 1198, 1202.  Strong and \"distinctly federal interests are involved,\" Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547 U.\u00a0S. 677, 696, in uniform administration of the program, free from state interference, particularly in regard to coverage, benefits, and payments.  The Federal Government also has a significant financial stake in subrogation and reimbursement.  Pp.\u00a06-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0 McVeigh's suggestion that \u00a78902(m)(1) has two \"plausible\" interpretations, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 698, Nevils asserts, supports application of the presumption against preemption here.  But the Court never chose between the two readings set out in McVeigh, because doing so was not pertinent to the discrete question whether federal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over FEHBA reimbursement actions.  Having decided in McVeigh that \u00a78902(m)(1) is a \"choice-of-law prescription,\" not a \"jurisdiction-conferring provision,\" id., at 697, the Court had no cause to consider \u00a78902(m)(1)'s text, context, and purpose, as it does here.  Pp.\u00a08-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The regime Congress enacted is compatible with the Supremacy Clause.  The statute itself, not a contract, strips state law of its force.  FEHBA contract terms have preemptive force only if they fall within \u00a78902(m)(1)'s preemptive scope.  Many other federal statutes found to preempt state law, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Federal Arbitration Act, leave the context-specific scope of preemption to contractual terms.  While \u00a78902(m)(1)'s phrasing may differ from those other statutes', FEHBA's express-preemption provision manifests the same intent to preempt state law.

JODIE NEVILS\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of missouri\n[April 18, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA), 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a78901 et\u00a0seq., Congress authorized the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) to contract with private carriers for federal employees' health insurance.  \u00a78902(a), (d).  FEHBA contains a provision expressly preempting state law.  \u00a78902(m)(1).  That provision reads:\n\"The terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.\"\nContracts OPM negotiates with private carriers provide for reimbursement and subrogation.  Reimbursement requires an insured employee who receives payment from another source (e.g., the proceeds yielded by a tort claim) to return healthcare costs earlier paid out by the carrier.  Subrogation involves transfer of the right to a third-party payment from the insured employee to the carrier, who can then pursue the claim against the third party.  Several States, however, Missouri among them, bar enforcement of contractual subrogation and reimbursement provisions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The questions here presented: Does FEHBA's express-preemption prescription, \u00a78902(m)(1), override state law prohibiting subrogation and reimbursement; and if \u00a78902(m)(1) has that effect, is the statutory prescription consistent with the Supremacy Clause, U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2?  We hold, contrary to the decision of the Missouri Supreme Court, that contractual subrogation and reimbursement prescriptions plainly \"relate to .\u00a0.\u00a0. payments with respect to benefits,\" \u00a78902(m)(1); therefore, by statutory instruction, they override state law barring subrogation and reimbursement.  We further hold, again contrary to the Missouri Supreme Court, that the regime Congress enacted is compatible with the Supremacy Clause.  Section 8902(m)(1) itself, not the contracts OPM negotiates, triggers the federal preemption.  As Congress directed, where FEHBA contract terms \"relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits),\" \u00a78902(m)(1) ensures that those terms will be uniformly enforceable nationwide, free from state interference.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0FEHBA \"establishes a comprehensive program of health insurance for federal employees.\"  Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547 U.\u00a0S. 677, 682 (2006).  As just noted, supra, at 1, FEHBA contains an express-preemption provision, \u00a78902(m)(1).  FEHBA assigns to OPM broad administrative and rulemaking authority over the program.  See \u00a7\u00a78901-8913.  OPM contracts with private insurance carriers to offer a range of healthcare plans.  \u00a7\u00a78902, 8903.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0OPM's contracts with private carriers have long included provisions requiring those carriers to seek subrogation and reimbursement.  Accordingly, OPM has issued detailed regulations governing subrogation and reimbursement clauses in FEHBA contracts.  See 5 CFR \u00a7890.106 (2016).  Under those regulations, a carrier's \"right to pursue and receive subrogation and reimbursement recoveries constitutes a condition of and a limitation on the nature of benefits or benefit payments and on the provision of benefits under the plan's coverage.\"  \u00a7890.106(b)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2015, after notice and comment, OPM published a rule confirming that \"[a] carrier's rights and responsibilities pertaining to subrogation and reimbursement under any [FEHBA] contract relate to the nature, provision, and extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) within the meaning of\" \u00a78902(m)(1).  \u00a7890.106(h).  Such \"rights and responsibilities,\" OPM's rule provides, \"are .\u00a0.\u00a0. effective notwithstanding any state or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.\"  Ibid.  Its rule, OPM explained, \"comports with longstanding Federal policy and furthers Congres[s'] goals of reducing health care costs and enabling uniform, nationwide application of [FEHBA] contracts.\"  80 Fed. Reg. 29203 (2015) (final rule).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Jodie Nevils is a former federal employee who enrolled in and was insured under a FEHBA plan offered by petitioner Coventry Health Care of Missouri.1 Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 418 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 451, 453 (Mo. 2014) (Nevils I\u00a0).  When Nevils was injured in an automobile accident, Coventry paid his medical expenses.  Ibid.  Nevils sued the driver who caused his injuries and recovered a settlement award.  Ibid.  Based on its contract with OPM, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a-130a, Coventry asserted a lien for $6,592.24 against part of the settlement proceeds to cover medical bills it had paid.  Nevils I, 418 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 453.  Nevils repaid that amount, thereby satisfying the lien.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevils then filed this class action against Coventry in Missouri state court, alleging that Coventry had unlawfully obtained reimbursement.  Ibid.  Nevils premised his claim on Missouri law, which does not permit subrogation or reimbursement in this context, see, e.g., Benton House, LLC v. Cook & Younts Ins., Inc., 249 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 878, 881-882 (Mo. App. 2008).  Coventry countered that \u00a78902(m)(1) makes subrogation and reimbursement clauses in FEHBA contracts enforceable notwithstanding state law.  The trial court granted summary judgment in Coventry's favor, Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., No. 11SL-CC00535 (Cir. Ct., St.\u00a0Louis Cty., Mo., May 21, 2012), App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a, 32a, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed, Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 2012 WL 6689542, *5 (Dec. 26, 2012).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Missouri Supreme Court reversed.  Nevils I, 418 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 457.  That court began with \"the assumption that the historic police powers of the States [are] not to be superseded by .\u00a0.\u00a0. Federal Act unless that [is] the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\"  Id., at 454 (quoting Cipollone v. Liggett Group, Inc., 505 U.\u00a0S. 504, 516 (1992)) (alterations in original).  Finding \u00a78902(m)(1) susceptible to diverse \"plausible readings,\" the court invoked a \"presumption against preemption\" to conclude that the federal statute's preemptive scope excluded subrogation and reimbursement.  418 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 455.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Wilson, joined by Judge Breckenridge, concurred in the judgment.  Id., at 457.  Observing that \"it defies logic to insist that benefit repayment terms do not relate to the nature or extent of Nevils' benefits,\" id., at 460 (emphasis deleted), Judge Wilson concluded that \"Congress plainly intended for \u00a78902(m)(1) to apply to the benefit repayment terms in [Coventry's] contract,\" id., at 462.  He nevertheless concurred, reasoning that the Supremacy Clause did not authorize preemption based on the terms of FEHBA contracts.  Id., at 462-465.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coventry sought our review, and we invited the Solicitor General to file a brief expressing the views of the United States.  Coventry Health Care of Mo., Inc. v. Nevils, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).  While Coventry's petition was pending, OPM finalized its rule governing subrogation and reimbursement.  See supra, at 3.  This Court granted certiorari, vacated the Missouri Supreme Court's judgment, and remanded for further consideration in light of OPM's recently adopted rule.  Coventry Health Care of Mo., Inc. v. Nevils, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, the Missouri Supreme Court adhered to its earlier decision.  Nevils v. Group Health Plan, Inc., 492 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 918, 920, 925 (2016).  OPM's rule, the court maintained, \"does not overcome the presumption against preemption and demonstrate Congress' clear and manifest intent to preempt state law.\"  Id., at 920.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Wilson again concurred, this time joined by a majority of the judges of the Missouri Supreme Court.  Id., at 925.2  In their view, Congress' \"attempt to give preemptive effect to the provisions of a contract between the federal government and a private party is not a valid application of the Supremacy Clause\" and, \"therefore, does not displace Missouri law here.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve conflicting interpretations of \u00a78902(m)(1).  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  Compare 492 S.\u00a0W.\u00a02d, at 925 (majority opinion), with Bell v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Okla., 823 F.\u00a03d 1198, 1199 (CA8 2016) (\u00a78902(m)(1) preempts state antisubrogation law); Helfrich v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield Assn., 804 F.\u00a03d 1090, 1092 (CA10 2015) (same).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 8902(m)(1) places two preconditions on federal preemption.  See supra, at 1.  The parties agree that Missouri's law prohibiting subrogation and reimbursement meets one of the two limitations, i.e., the State's law \"relates to health insurance or plans.\"  \u00a78902(m)(1).  They dispute only whether the subrogation and reimbursement requirements in OPM's contract with Coventry \"relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits,\" \"including payments with respect to benefits.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Coventry contends that \u00a78902(m)(1) unambiguously covers the contractual terms at issue here.  In any event, Coventry, joined by the United States as amicus curiae, urges that the rule published by OPM in 2015 leaves no room for doubt that insurance-contract terms providing for subrogation and reimbursement fall within \u00a78902(m)(1)'s preemptive scope.  See supra, at 3.  Deference is due to OPM's reading, Coventry and the United States assert, under Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984).  In Nevils' view, by contrast, \u00a78902(m)(1) does not preempt state antisubrogation and antireimbursement laws in light of the presumption against preemption.  Given that presumption, Nevils maintains, OPM's rule is not entitled to deference.  Though we have called Nevils' construction \"plausible,\" McVeigh, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 698, the reading advanced by Coventry and the United States best comports with \u00a78902(m)(1)'s text, context, and purpose.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contractual provisions for subrogation and reimbursement \"relate to .\u00a0.\u00a0. payments with respect to benefits\" because subrogation and reimbursement rights yield just such payments.  When a carrier exercises its right to either reimbursement or subrogation, it receives from either the beneficiary or a third party \"payment\" respecting the benefits the carrier had previously paid.  The carrier's very provision of benefits triggers the right to payment.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; Helfrich, 804 F.\u00a03d, at 1106; Bell, 823 F.\u00a03d, at 1204.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress' use of the expansive phrase \"relate to\" shores up that understanding.  We have \"repeatedly recognized\" that the phrase \"relate to\" in a preemption clause \"express[es] a broad pre-emptive purpose.\"  Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.\u00a0S. 374, 383 (1992); accord Northwest, Inc. v. Ginsberg, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 5, 9).  Congress characteristically employs the phrase to reach any subject that has \"a connection with, or reference to,\" the topics the statute enumerates.  Morales, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 384.  The phrase therefore weighs against Nevils' effort to narrow the term \"payments\" to exclude payments that occur \"long after\" a carrier's provision of benefits (Brief for Respondent 27 (quoting McVeigh, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 697)).  See Nevils I, 418 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 460 (Wilson, J., concurring); cf. Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 10) (in the Federal Employees' Group Life Insurance Act context, it \"makes no difference\" whether state law withholds benefits in the first instance or instead takes them away after they have been paid).  Given language notably \"expansive [in] sweep,\" Morales, 504 U.\u00a0S., at 384 (internal quotation marks omitted), Nevils' argument that Congress intended to preempt only state coverage requirements (e.g., for acupuncture and chiropractic services, see Brief for Respondent 36) also miscarries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutory context and purpose reinforce our conclusion.  FEHBA concerns \"benefits from a federal health insurance plan for federal employees that arise from a federal law\" in an area with a \"long history of federal involvement.\"  Bell, 823 F.\u00a03d, at 1202.  Strong and \"distinctly federal interests are involved,\" McVeigh, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 696, in uniform administration of the program, free from state interference, particularly in regard to coverage, benefits, and payments.  The Federal Government, moreover, has a significant financial stake.  OPM estimates that, in 2014 alone, FEHBA \"carriers were reimbursed by approximately $126 million in subrogation recoveries.\"  80 Fed. Reg. 29203.  Such \"recoveries translate to premium cost savings for the federal government and [FEHBA] enrollees.\"  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Invoking our suggestion in McVeigh that \u00a78902(m)(1) has two \"plausible\" interpretations, 547 U.\u00a0S., at 698, Nevils nonetheless urges us to apply a presumption against preemption because \u00a78902(m)(1) does not clearly cover contractual terms pertaining to subrogation and reimbursement.  This argument is blind to McVeigh's context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In McVeigh, we considered the discrete question whether 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71331 gives federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over FEHBA reimbursement actions.  See 547 U.\u00a0S., at 683.  Our principal holding was that \u00a71331 did not confer federal jurisdiction.  Ibid.; see Bell, 823 F.\u00a03d, at 1205.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The carrier in McVeigh, as part of its argument in favor of federal jurisdiction, asserted that \u00a78902(m)(1) itself conferred federal jurisdiction.  See 547 U.\u00a0S., at 697.  In responding to that assertion, we summarized competing interpretations of \u00a78902(m)(1) advanced in briefing, readings that map closely onto the parties' positions here.  See ibid. (carrier and United States as amicus curiae urged interpretation similar to Coventry's; an amicus brief in support of beneficiary offered interpretation similar to Nevils').\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We made no choice between the two interpretations set out in McVeigh, however, because the answer made no difference to the question there presented.  Id., at 698.  \"[E]ven if FEHBA's preemption provision reaches contract-based reimbursement claims,\" we explained, \"that provision is not sufficiently broad to confer federal jurisdiction.\"  Ibid.  Because \u00a78902(m)(1) is a \"choice-of-law prescription,\" not a \"jurisdiction-conferring provision,\" id., at 697, we had no cause to consider \u00a78902(m)(1)'s text, context, and purpose, as we do today, see supra, at 6-8.3\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevils further contends that, if \u00a78902(m)(1) covers subrogation and reimbursement clauses in OPM contracts, then the statute itself would violate the Supremacy Clause by assigning preemptive effect to the terms of a contract, not to the laws of the United States.  We conclude, however, that the statute, not a contract, strips state law of its force.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without \u00a78902(m)(1), there would be no preemption of state insurance law.  FEHBA contract terms have preemptive force only as they \"relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits),\" \u00a78902(m)(1)--i.e., when the contract terms fall within the statute's preemptive scope.  It is therefore the statute that \"ensures that [FEHBA contract] terms will be uniformly enforceable nationwide, notwithstanding any state law relating to health insurance or plans.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many other federal statutes preempt state law in this way, leaving the context-specific scope of preemption to contractual terms.  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71001 et\u00a0seq., for example, preempts \"any and all State laws insofar as they\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. relate to any employee benefit plan.\"  \u00a71144(a).  And the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71 et\u00a0seq., limits the grounds for denying enforcement of \"written provision[s] in .\u00a0.\u00a0. contract[s]\" providing for arbitration, thereby preempting state laws that would otherwise interfere with such contracts.  \u00a72.  This Court has several times held that those statutes preempt state law, see, e.g., Gobeille v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (slip op., at 5-12) (ERISA); Marmet Health Care Center, Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.\u00a0S. 530, 532-534 (2012) (per curiam) (FAA), and Nevils does not contend that those measures violate the Supremacy Clause, see Brief for Respondent 22.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nevils instead attempts to distinguish those other statutes by highlighting a particular textual feature of \u00a78902(m)(1): Section 8902(m)(1) states that the \"terms of any contract\" between OPM and a carrier \"shall supersede and preempt\" certain state or local laws.  (Emphasis added.)  That formulation, Nevils asserts, violates the Supremacy Clause's mandate that only the \"Laws of the United States\" may reign supreme over state law.  U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. VI, cl.\u00a02 (emphasis added).  Nevils' argument elevates semantics over substance.  While Congress' formulation might differ from the phrasing of other statutes, \u00a78902(m)(1) manifests the same intent to preempt state law.4  Because we do not require Congress to employ a particular linguistic formulation when preempting state law, Nevils' Supremacy Clause challenge fails.5\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-149\nCOVENTRY HEALTH CARE OF MISSOURI, INC., fka GROUP HEALTH PLAN, INC., PETITIONER v.

A statute that confers on an executive agency the power to enter into contracts that pre-empt state law--such as the Federal Employee Health Benefits Act of 1959, 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a78902--might unlawfully delegate legislative power to the President insofar as the statute fails sufficiently to constrain the President's contracting discretion.  See Department of Transportation v. Association of American Railroads, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 11-22); see also Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.\u00a0S. 457, 472 (2001).  Respondent, however, failed to make that argument.  The Court therefore appropriately leaves that issue to be decided, if at all, on remand.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Coventry was formerly known as Group Health Plan, Inc.  Pet. for Cert. ii.  We refer to both the current and former entities as \"Coventry.\"\nFootnote 2\u00a0Under Missouri law, a \"concurring opinion\" in which \"a majority of the court concur[s]\" is binding precedent.  Mueller v. Burchfield, 359 Mo. 876, 880, 224 S.\u00a0W.\u00a02d 87, 89 (1949).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Because the statute alone resolves this dispute, we need not consider whether Chevron deference attaches to OPM's 2015 rule.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Congress' choice of language is not unique to \u00a78902(m)(1).  Several related statutes governing federal-employee and military-member benefits employ similar formulations.  See \u00a78959 (\"The terms of any contract that relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to dental benefits, insurance, plans, or contracts.\"); \u00a78989 (same for vision); \u00a79005(a) (same for long-term care); 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71103(a) (certain state laws \"shall not apply to any contract entered into pursuant to this chapter\").\nFootnote 5\u00a0Nevils' speculation about the Government's outsourcing preemption to private entities, see Brief for Respondent 24, is far afield from the matter before us.  This case involves only Congress' preemption of state insurance laws to ensure that the terms in contracts negotiated by OPM, a federal agency, operate free from state interference.\n\n\n","17":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nCZYZEWSKI ET AL. v. JEVIC HOLDING CORP. ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-649\nArgued: December 7, 2016Decided: March 22, 2017\n\n\nThere are three possible conclusions to a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  First, debtor and creditors may negotiate a plan to govern the distribution of the estate's value.  See, e.g., 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71121, 1123, 1129, 1141.  Second, the bankruptcy court may convert the case to Chapter 7 for liquidation of the business and distribution of its assets to creditors.  \u00a7\u00a71112(a), (b), 726.  Finally, the bankruptcy court may dismiss the case.  \u00a71112(b).  A court ordering a dismissal ordinarily attempts to restore the prepetition financial status quo.  \u00a7349(b)(3).  Yet if perfect restoration proves difficult or impossible, the court may, \"for cause,\" alter the dismissal's normal restorative consequences, \u00a7349(b)--i.e., it may order a \"structured dismissal.\"  The Bankruptcy Code also establishes basic priority rules for determining the order in which the court will distribute an estate's assets.  The Code makes clear that distributions in a Chapter 7 liquidation must follow this prescribed order.  \u00a7\u00a7725, 726.  Chapter 11 permits some flexibility, but a court still cannot confirm a plan that contains priority-violating distributions over the objection of an impaired creditor class.  \u00a7\u00a71129(a)(7), (b)(2).  The Code does not explicitly state what priority rules--if any--apply to the distribution of assets in a structured dismissal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Jevic Transportation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after being purchased in a leveraged buyout.  The bankruptcy prompted two lawsuits.  In the first, a group of former Jevic truckdrivers, petitioners here, was awarded a judgment against Jevic for Jevic's failure to provide proper notice of termination in violation of state and federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Acts.  Part of that judgment counted as a priority wage claim under \u00a7507(a)(4), entitling the workers to payment ahead of general unsecured claims against the Jevic estate.  In the second suit, a court-authorized committee representing Jevic's unsecured creditors sued Sun Capital and CIT Group, respondents here, for fraudulent conveyance in connection with the leveraged buyout of Jevic.  These parties negotiated a settlement agreement that called for a structured dismissal of Jevic's Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  Under the proposed structured dismissal, petitioners would receive nothing on their WARN claims, but lower-priority general unsecured creditors would be paid.  Petitioners argued that the distribution scheme accordingly violated the Code's priority rules by paying general unsecured claims ahead of their own.  The Bankruptcy Court nevertheless approved the settlement agreement and dismissed the case, reasoning that because the proposed payouts would occur pursuant to a structured dismissal rather than an approved plan, the failure to follow ordinary priority rules did not bar approval.  The District Court and the Third Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Petitioners have Article III standing.  Respondents argue that petitioners have not \"suffered an injury in fact,\" or at least one \"likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision,\" Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, because petitioners would have gotten nothing even if the Bankruptcy Court had never approved the structured dismissal and will still get nothing if the structured dismissal is undone now.  That argument rests upon the assumptions that (1) without a violation of ordinary priority rules, there will be no settlement, and (2) without a settlement, the fraudulent-conveyance lawsuit has no value.  The record, however, indicates both that a settlement that respects ordinary priorities remains a reasonable possibility and that the fraudulent-conveyance claim could have litigation value.  Therefore, as a consequence of the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the structured dismissal, petitioners lost a chance to obtain a settlement that respected their priorities or, if not that, the power to assert the fraudulent-conveyance claim themselves.  A decision in their favor is likely to redress that loss.  Pp.\u00a09-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.  Bankruptcy courts may not approve structured dismissals that provide for distributions that do not follow ordinary priority rules without the consent of affected creditors.  Pp.\u00a011-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Given the importance of the priority system, this Court looks for an affirmative indication of intent before concluding that Congress means to make a major departure.  See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.\u00a0S. 457, 468.  Nothing in the statute evinces such intent.  Insofar as the dismissal sections of Chapter 11 foresee any transfer of assets, they seek a restoration of the prepetition financial status quo.  Read in context, \u00a7349(b), which permits a bankruptcy judge, \"for cause, [to] orde[r] otherwise,\" seems designed to give courts the flexibility to protect reliance interests acquired in the bankruptcy, not to make general end-of-case distributions that would be flatly impermissible in a Chapter 11 plan or Chapter 7 liquidation.  Precedent does not support a contrary position.  E.g., In\u00a0re Iridium Operating LLC, 478 F.\u00a03d 452 (CA2), distinguished.  Cases in which courts have approved deviations from ordinary priority rules generally involve interim distributions serving significant Code-related objectives.  That is not the case here, where, e.g., the priority-violating distribution is attached to a final disposition, does not preserve the debtor as a going concern, does not make the disfavored creditors better off, does not promote the possibility of a confirmable plan, does not help to restore the status quo ante, and does not protect reliance interests.  Pp.\u00a011-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) Congress did not authorize a \"rare case\" exception that permits courts to disregard priority in structured dismissals for \"sufficient reasons.\"  The fact that it is difficult to give precise content to the concept of \"sufficient reasons\" threatens to turn the court below's exception into a more general rule, resulting in uncertainty that has potentially serious consequences--e.g., departure from the protections granted particular classes of creditors, changes in the bargaining power of different classes of creditors even in bankruptcies that do not end in structured dismissals, risks of collusion, and increased difficulty in achieving settlements.  Courts cannot deviate from the strictures of the Code, even in \"rare cases.\"  Pp.\u00a016-18.\n787 F.\u00a03d 173, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Breyer, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\u00a0J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71123, 1129, 1141.  But sometimes the parties cannot agree on a plan.  If so, the bankruptcy court may decide to dismiss the case. \u00a71112(b).  The Code then ordinarily provides for what is, in effect, a restoration of the prepetition financial status quo.  \u00a7349(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the case before us, a Bankruptcy Court dismissed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  But the court did not simply restore the prepetition status quo.  Instead, the court ordered a distribution of estate assets that gave money to high-priority secured creditors and to low-priority general unsecured creditors but which skipped certain dissenting mid-priority creditors.  The skipped creditors would have been entitled to payment ahead of the general unsecured creditors in a Chapter 11 plan (or in a Chapter 7 liquidation).  See \u00a7\u00a7507, 725, 726, 1129. The question before us is whether a bankruptcy court has the legal power to order this priority-skipping kind of distribution scheme in connection with a Chapter 11 dismissal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In our view, a bankruptcy court does not have such a power.  A distribution scheme ordered in connection with the dismissal of a Chapter 11 case cannot, without the consent of the affected parties, deviate from the basic priority rules that apply under the primary mechanisms the Code establishes for final distributions of estate value in business bankruptcies.\nI\nA\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with a few fundamentals: A business may file for bankruptcy under either Chapter 7 or Chapter 11.  In Chapter 7, a trustee liquidates the debtor's assets and distributes them to creditors.  See \u00a7701 et\u00a0seq.  In Chapter 11, debtor and creditors try to negotiate a plan that will govern the distribution of valuable assets from the debtor's estate and often keep the business operating as a going concern.  See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a71121, 1123, 1129, 1141 (setting out the framework in which the parties negotiate).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy has several relevant legal consequences.  First, an estate is created comprising all property of the debtor.  \u00a7541(a)(1).  Second, a fiduciary is installed to manage the estate in the interest of the creditors.  \u00a7\u00a71106, 1107(a).  This fiduciary, often the debtor's existing management team, acts as \"debtor in possession.\"  \u00a7\u00a71101(1), 1104.  It may operate the business, \u00a7\u00a7363(c)(1), 1108, and perform certain bankruptcy-related functions, such as seeking to recover for the estate preferential or fraudulent transfers made to other persons, \u00a7547 (transfers made before bankruptcy that unfairly preferred particular creditors); \u00a7548 (fraudulent transfers, including transfers made before bankruptcy for which the debtor did not receive fair value).  Third, an \"automatic stay\" of all collection proceedings against the debtor takes effect.  \u00a7362(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is important to keep in mind that Chapter 11 foresees three possible outcomes. The first is a bankruptcy-court-confirmed plan.  Such a plan may keep the business operating but, at the same time, help creditors by providing for payments, perhaps over time.  See \u00a7\u00a71123, 1129, 1141.  The second possible outcome is conversion of the case to a Chapter 7 proceeding for liquidation of the business and a distribution of its remaining assets.  \u00a7\u00a71112(a), (b), 726.  That conversion in effect confesses an inability to find a plan.  The third possible outcome is dismissal of the Chapter 11 case.  \u00a71112(b).  A dismissal typically \"revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of the case\"--in other words, it aims to return to the prepetition financial status quo.  \u00a7349(b)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, recognizing that conditions may have changed in ways that make a perfect restoration of the status quo difficult or impossible, the Code permits the bankruptcy court, \"for cause,\" to alter a Chapter 11 dismissal's ordinary restorative consequences.  \u00a7349(b).  A dismissal that does so (or which has other special conditions attached) is often referred to as a \"structured dismissal,\" defined by the American Bankruptcy Institute as a\n\"hybrid dismissal and confirmation order .\u00a0.\u00a0. that .\u00a0.\u00a0. typically dismisses the case while, among other things, approving certain distributions to creditors, granting certain third-party releases, enjoining certain conduct by creditors, and not necessarily vacating orders or unwinding transactions undertaken during the case.\"  American Bankruptcy Institute Commission To Study the Reform of Chapter 11, 2012-2014 Final Report and Recommendations 270 (2014).\nAlthough the Code does not expressly mention structured dismissals, they \"appear to be increasingly common.\"  Ibid., n.\u00a0973.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Code also sets forth a basic system of priority, which ordinarily determines the order in which the bankruptcy court will distribute assets of the estate.  Secured creditors are highest on the priority list, for they must receive the proceeds of the collateral that secures their debts.  11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7725.  Special classes of creditors, such as those who hold certain claims for taxes or wages, come next in a listed order.  \u00a7\u00a7507, 726(a)(1).  Then come low-priority creditors, including general unsecured creditors.  \u00a7726(a)(2).  The Code places equity holders at the bottom of the priority list.  They receive nothing until all previously listed creditors have been paid in full.  \u00a7726(a)(6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Code makes clear that distributions of assets in a Chapter 7 liquidation must follow this prescribed order.  \u00a7\u00a7725, 726.  It provides somewhat more flexibility for distributions pursuant to Chapter 11 plans, which may impose a different ordering with the consent of the affected parties.  But a bankruptcy court cannot confirm a plan that contains priority-violating distributions over the objection of an impaired creditor class.  \u00a7\u00a71129(a)(7), 1129(b)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question here concerns the interplay between the Code's priority rules and a Chapter 11 dismissal.  Here, the Bankruptcy Court neither liquidated the debtor under Chapter 7 nor confirmed a Chapter 11 plan.  But the court, instead of reverting to the prebankruptcy status quo, ordered a distribution of the estate assets to creditors by attaching conditions to the dismissal (i.e., it ordered a structured dismissal).  The Code does not explicitly state what priority rules--if any--apply to a distribution in these circumstances.  May a court consequently provide for distributions that deviate from the ordinary priority rules that would apply to a Chapter 7 liquidation or a Chapter 11 plan?  Can it approve conditions that give estate assets to members of a lower priority class while skipping objecting members of a higher priority class?\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2006, Sun Capital Partners, a private equity firm, acquired Jevic Transportation Corporation with money borrowed from CIT Group in a \"leveraged buyout.\"  In a leveraged buyout, the buyer (B) typically borrows from a third party (T) a large share of the funds needed to purchase a company (C).  B then pays the money to C's shareholders.  Having bought the stock, B owns C.  B then pledges C's assets to T so that T will have security for its loan.  Thus, if the selling price for C is $50 million, B might use $10 million of its own money, borrow $40 million from T, pay $50 million to C's shareholders, and then pledge C assets worth $40 million (or more) to T as security for T's $40 million loan.  If B manages C well, it might make enough money to pay T back the $40 million and earn a handsome profit on its own $10 million investment.  But, if the deal sours and C descends into bankruptcy, beware of what might happen: Instead of C's $40 million in assets being distributed to its existing creditors, the money will go to T to pay back T's loan--the loan that allowed B to buy C.  (T will receive what remains of C's assets because T is now a secured creditor, putting it at the top of the priority list).  Since C's shareholders receive money while C's creditors lose their claim to C's remaining assets, unsuccessful leveraged buyouts often lead to fraudulent conveyance suits alleging that the purchaser (B) transferred the company's assets without receiving fair value in return.  See Lipson & Vandermeuse, Stern, Seriously: The Article I Judicial Power, Fraudulent Transfers, and Leveraged Buyouts, 2013 Wis. L.\u00a0Rev. 1161, 1220-1221.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is precisely what happened here.  Just two years after Sun's buyout, Jevic (C in our leveraged buyout example) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy.  At the time of filing, it owed $53 million to senior secured creditors Sun and CIT (B and T in our example), and over $20 million to tax and general unsecured creditors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The circumstances surrounding Jevic's bankruptcy led to two lawsuits.  First, petitioners, a group of former Jevic truckdrivers, filed suit in bankruptcy court against Jevic and Sun.  Petitioners pointed out that, just before entering bankruptcy, Jevic had halted almost all its operations and had told petitioners that they would be fired.  Petitioners claimed that Jevic and Sun had thereby violated state and federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Acts--laws that require a company to give workers at least 60 days' notice before their termination.  See 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72102; N. J. Stat. Ann. \u00a734:21-2 (West 2011).  The Bankruptcy Court granted summary judgment for petitioners against Jevic, leaving them (and this is the point to remember) with a judgment that petitioners say is worth $12.4 million.  See In\u00a0re Jevic Holding Corp., 496 B.\u00a0R. 151 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del. 2013).  Some $8.3 million of that judgment counts as a priority wage claim under 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7507(a)(4), and is therefore entitled to payment ahead of general unsecured claims against the Jevic estate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners' WARN suit against Sun continued throughout most of the litigation now before us.  But eventually Sun prevailed on the ground that Sun was not the workers' employer at the relevant times.  See In\u00a0re Jevic Holding Corp., 656 Fed. Appx. 617 (CA3 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Bankruptcy Court authorized a committee representing Jevic's unsecured creditors to sue Sun and CIT.  The Bankruptcy Court and the parties were aware that any proceeds from such a suit would belong not to the unsecured creditors, but to the bankruptcy estate.  See \u00a7\u00a7541(a)(1), (6); Official Comm. of Unsecured Creditors of Cybergenics Corp. v. Chinery, 330 F.\u00a03d 548, 552-553 (CA3 2003) (en banc) (holding that a creditor's committee can bring a derivative action on behalf of the estate).  The committee alleged that Sun and CIT, in the course of their leveraged buyout, had \"hastened Jevic's bankruptcy by saddling it with debts that it couldn't service.\"  In\u00a0re Jevic Holding Corp., 787 F.\u00a03d 173, 176 (CA3 2015).  In 2011, the Bankruptcy Court held that the committee had adequately pleaded claims of preferential transfer under \u00a7547 and of fraudulent transfer under \u00a7548.  In\u00a0re Jevic Holding Corp., 2011 WL 4345204 (Bkrtcy. Ct. Del., Sept. 15, 2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sun, CIT, Jevic, and the committee then tried to negotiate a settlement of this \"fraudulent-conveyance\" lawsuit.  By that point, the depleted Jevic estate's only remaining assets were the fraudulent-conveyance claim itself and $1.7 million in cash, which was subject to a lien held by Sun.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties reached a settlement agreement.  It provided (1) that the Bankruptcy Court would dismiss the fraudulent-conveyance action with prejudice; (2) that CIT would deposit $2 million into an account earmarked to pay the committee's legal fees and administrative expenses; (3) that Sun would assign its lien on Jevic's remaining $1.7 million to a trust, which would pay taxes and administrative expenses and distribute the remainder on a pro\u00a0rata basis to the low-priority general unsecured creditors, but which would not distribute anything to petitioners (who, by virtue of their WARN judgment, held an $8.3 million mid-level-priority wage claim against the estate); and (4) that Jevic's Chapter 11 bankruptcy would be dismissed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apparently Sun insisted on a distribution that would skip petitioners because petitioners' WARN suit against Sun was still pending and Sun did not want to help finance that litigation.  See 787 F.\u00a03d, at 177-178, n.\u00a04 (Sun's counsel acknowledging before the Bankruptcy Court that \"\u00a0'Sun probably does care where the money goes because you can take judicial notice that there's a pending WARN action against Sun by the WARN plaintiffs.  And if the money goes to the WARN plaintiffs, then you're funding someone who is suing you who otherwise doesn't have funds and is doing it on a contingent fee basis'\u00a0\").  The essential point is that, regardless of the reason, the proposed settlement called for a structured dismissal that provided for distributions that did not follow ordinary priority rules.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sun, CIT, Jevic, and the committee asked the Bankruptcy Court to approve the settlement and dismiss the case.  Petitioners and the U.\u00a0S. Trustee objected, arguing that the settlement's distribution plan violated the Code's priority scheme because it skipped petitioners--who, by virtue of their WARN judgment, had mid-level priority claims against estate assets--and distributed estate money to low-priority general unsecured creditors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bankruptcy Court agreed with petitioners that the settlement's distribution scheme failed to follow ordinary priority rules.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a.  But it held that this did not bar approval.  Ibid.  That, in the Bankruptcy Court's view, was because the proposed payouts would occur pursuant to a structured dismissal of a Chapter 11 petition rather than an approval of a Chapter 11 plan.  Ibid.  The court accordingly decided to grant the motion in light of the \"dire circumstances\" facing the estate and its creditors.  Id., at 57a.  Specifically, the court predicted that without the settlement and dismissal, there was \"no realistic prospect\" of a meaningful distribution for anyone other than the secured creditors.  Id., at 58a.  A confirmable Chapter 11 plan was unattainable.  And there would be no funds to operate, investigate, or litigate were the case converted to a proceeding in Chapter 7.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court.  It recognized that the settlement distribution violated ordinary priority rules.  But those rules, it wrote, were \"not a bar to the approval of the settlement as [the settlement] is not a reorganization plan.\"  In\u00a0re Jevic Holding Corp., 2014 WL 268613, *3 (D Del., Jan. 24, 2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Third Circuit affirmed the District Court by a vote of 2 to 1.  787 F.\u00a03d, at 175; id., at 186 (Scirica, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The majority held that structured dismissals need not always respect priority.  Congress, the court explained, had only \"codified the absolute priority rule .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the specific context of plan confirmation.\" Id., at 183.  As a result, courts could, \"in rare instances like this one, approve structured dismissals that do not strictly adhere to the Bankruptcy Code's priority scheme.\"  Id., at 180.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners (the workers with the WARN judgment) sought certiorari.  We granted their petition.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents initially argue that petitioners lack standing because they have suffered no injury, or at least no injury that will be remedied by a decision in their favor.  See Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6) (explaining that, for Article III standing, a plaintiff must have \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision\").  Respondents concede that the structured dismissal approved by the Bankruptcy Court contained  distribution conditions that skipped over petitioners, ensuring that petitioners received nothing on their multimillion-dollar WARN claim against the Jevic estate.  But respondents still assert that petitioners suffered no loss.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reason, respondents say, is that petitioners would have gotten nothing even if the Bankruptcy Court had never approved the structured dismissal in the first place, and will still get nothing if the structured dismissal is undone now.  Reversal will eliminate the settlement of the committee's fraudulent-conveyance lawsuit, which was conditioned on the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the priority-violating structured dismissal.  If the Bankruptcy Court cannot approve that dismissal, respondents contend, Sun and CIT will no longer agree to settle.  Nor will petitioners ever be able to obtain a litigation recovery.  Hence there will be no lawsuit money to distribute.  And in the absence of lawsuit money, Jevic's assets amount to about $1.7 million, all pledged to Sun, leaving nothing for anyone else, let alone petitioners.  Thus, even if petitioners are right that the structured dismissal was impermissible, it cost them nothing.  And a judicial decision in their favor will gain them nothing.  No loss.  No redress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument, however, rests upon respondents' claims (1) that, without a violation of ordinary priority rules, there will be no settlement, and (2) that, without a settlement, the fraudulent-conveyance lawsuit has no value.   In our view, the record does not support either of these propositions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the first, the record indicates that a settlement that respects ordinary priorities remains a reasonable possibility.  It makes clear (as counsel made clear before our Court, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 58) that Sun insisted upon a settlement that gave petitioners nothing only because it did not want to help fund petitioners' WARN lawsuit against it.  See 787 F.\u00a03d, at 177-178, n.\u00a04.  But, Sun has now won that lawsuit.  See 656 Fed. Appx. 617.  If Sun's given reason for opposing distributions to petitioners has disappeared, why would Sun not settle while permitting some of the settlement money to go to petitioners?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the second, the record indicates that the fraudulent-conveyance claim could have litigation value.  CIT and  Sun, after all, settled the lawsuit for $3.7 million,  which would make little sense if the action truly had no chance of success.  The Bankruptcy Court could convert the case to Chapter 7, allowing a Chapter 7 trustee to pursue the suit against Sun and CIT.  Or the court could simply dismiss the Chapter 11 bankruptcy, thereby allowing petitioners to assert the fraudulent-conveyance claim themselves.  Given these possibilities, there is no reason to believe that the claim could not be pursued with counsel obtained on a contingency basis.  Of course, the lawsuit--like any lawsuit--might prove fruitless, but the mere possibility of failure does not eliminate the value of the claim or petitioners' injury in being unable to bring it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the structured dismissal cost petitioners something.  They lost a chance to obtain a settlement that respected their priority.  Or, if not that, they lost the power to bring their own lawsuit on a claim that had a settlement value of $3.7 million.  For standing purposes, a loss of even a small amount of money is ordinarily an \"injury.\"  See, e.g., McGowan v. Maryland, 366 U.\u00a0S. 420, 430-431 (1961) (finding that appellants fined $5 plus costs had standing to assert an Establishment Clause challenge).  And the ruling before us could well have cost petitioners considerably more.  See Clinton v. City of New York, 524 U.\u00a0S. 417, 430-431 (1998) (imposition of a \"substantial contingent liability\" qualifies as an injury).  A decision in petitioners' favor is likely to redress that loss.  We accordingly conclude that petitioners have standing.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We turn to the basic question presented: Can a bankruptcy court approve a structured dismissal that provides for distributions that do not follow ordinary priority rules without the affected creditors' consent?  Our simple answer to this complicated question is \"no.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Code's priority system constitutes a basic underpinning of business bankruptcy law.  Distributions of estate assets at the termination of a business bankruptcy normally take place through a Chapter 7 liquidation or a Chapter 11 plan, and both are governed by priority.  In Chapter 7 liquidations, priority is an absolute command--lower priority creditors cannot receive anything until higher priority creditors have been paid in full.  See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7725, 726.  Chapter 11 plans provide somewhat more flexibility, but a priority-violating plan still cannot be confirmed over the objection of an impaired class of creditors.  See \u00a71129(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The priority system applicable to those distributions has long been considered fundamental to the Bankruptcy Code's operation.  See H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 103-835, p. 33 (1994) (explaining that the Code is \"designed to enforce a distribution of the debtor's assets in an orderly manner .\u00a0.\u00a0. in accordance with established principles rather than on the basis of the inside influence or economic leverage of a particular creditor\"); Roe & Tung, Breaking Bankruptcy Priority: How Rent-Seeking Upends The Creditors' Bargain, 99 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 1235, 1243, 1236 (2013) (arguing that the first principle of bankruptcy is that \"distribution conforms to predetermined statutory and contractual priorities,\" and that priority is, \"quite appropriately, bankruptcy's most important and famous rule\"); Markell, Owners, Auctions, and Absolute Priority in Bankruptcy Reorganizations, 44 Stan. L.\u00a0Rev. 69, 123 (1991) (stating that a fixed priority scheme is recognized as \"the cornerstone of reorganization practice and theory\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The importance of the priority system leads us to expect more than simple statutory silence if, and when, Congress were to intend a major departure.  See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc., 531 U.\u00a0S. 457, 468 (2001) (\"Congress .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes\").  Put somewhat more directly, we would expect to see some affirmative indication of intent if Congress actually meant to make structured dismissals a backdoor means to achieve the exact kind of nonconsensual priority-violating final distributions that the Code prohibits in Chapter 7 liquidations and Chapter 11 plans.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We can find nothing in the statute that evinces this intent.  The Code gives a bankruptcy court the power to \"dismiss\" a Chapter 11 case.  \u00a71112(b).  But the word \"dismiss\" itself says nothing about the power to make nonconsensual priority-violating distributions of estate value.  Neither the word \"structured,\" nor the word \"conditions,\" nor anything else about distributing estate value to creditors pursuant to a dismissal appears in any relevant part of the Code.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Insofar as the dismissal sections of Chapter 11 foresee any transfer of assets, they seek a restoration of the prepetition financial status quo.  See \u00a7349(b)(1) (dismissal ordinarily reinstates a variety of avoided transfers and voided liens); \u00a7349(b)(2) (dismissal ordinarily vacates certain types of bankruptcy orders); \u00a7349(b)(3) (dismissal ordinarily \"revests the property of the estate in the entity in which such property was vested immediately before the commencement of the case\"); see also H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 95-595, p. 338 (1977) (dismissal's \"basic purpose .\u00a0.\u00a0. is to undo the bankruptcy case, as far as practicable, and to restore all property rights to the position in which they were found at the commencement of the case\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 349(b), we concede, also says that a bankruptcy judge may, \"for cause, orde[r] otherwise.\"  But, read in context, this provision appears designed to give courts the flexibility to \"make the appropriate orders to protect rights acquired in reliance on the bankruptcy case.\"  H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 338; cf., e.g., Wiese v. Community Bank of Central Wis., 552 F.\u00a03d 584, 590 (CA7 2009) (upholding, under \u00a7349(b), a Bankruptcy Court's decision not to reinstate a debtor's claim against a bank that gave up a lien in reliance on the claim being released in the debtor's reorganization plan).  Nothing else in the Code authorizes a court ordering a dismissal to make general end-of-case distributions of estate assets to creditors of the kind that normally take place in a Chapter 7 liquidation or Chapter 11 plan--let alone final distributions that do not help to restore the status quo ante or protect reliance interests acquired in the bankruptcy, and that would be flatly impermissible in a Chapter 7 liquidation or a Chapter 11 plan because they violate priority without the impaired creditors' consent.  That being so, the word \"cause\" is too weak a reed upon which to rest so weighty a power.  See United Sav. Assn. of Tex. v. Timbers of Inwood Forest Associates, Ltd., 484 U.\u00a0S. 365, 371 (1988) (noting that \"[s]tatutory construction .\u00a0.\u00a0. is a holistic endeavor\" and that a court should select a \"meanin[g that] produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law\"); Kelly v. Robinson, 479 U.\u00a0S. 36, 43 (1986) (in interpreting a statute, a court \"must not be guided by a single sentence or member of a sentence, but look to the provisions of the whole law, and to its object and policy\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); cf. In\u00a0re Sadler, 935 F.\u00a02d 918, 921 (CA7 1991) (\"\u00a0'Cause' under \u00a7349(b) means an acceptable reason.  Desire to make an end run around a statute is not an adequate reason\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have found no contrary precedent, either from this Court, or, for that matter, from lower court decisions reflecting common bankruptcy practice.  The Third Circuit referred briefly to In\u00a0re Buffet Partners, L. P., 2014 WL 3735804 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Tex., July 28, 2014).  The court in that case approved a structured dismissal.  (We express no view about the legality of structured dismissals in general.)  But at the same time it pointed out \"that not one party with an economic stake in the case has objected to the dismissal in this manner.\"  Id., at *4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Third Circuit also relied upon In\u00a0re Iridium Operating LLC, 478 F.\u00a03d 452 (CA2 2007).  But Iridium did not involve a structured dismissal.  It addressed an interim distribution of settlement proceeds to fund a litigation trust that would press claims on the estate's behalf.  See id., at 459-460.  The Iridium court observed that, when evaluating this type of preplan settlement, \"[i]t is difficult to employ the rule of priorities\" because \"the nature and extent of the Estate and the claims against it are not yet fully resolved.\"  Id., at 464 (emphasis added).  The decision does not state or suggest that the Code authorizes nonconsensual departures from ordinary priority rules in the context of a dismissal--which is a final distribution of estate value--and in the absence of any further unresolved bankruptcy issues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We recognize that Iridium is not the only case in which a court has approved interim distributions that violate ordinary priority rules.  But in such instances one can generally find significant Code-related objectives that the priority-violating distributions serve.  Courts, for example, have approved \"first-day\" wage orders that allow payment of employees' prepetition wages, \"critical vendor\" orders that allow payment of essential suppliers' prepetition invoices, and \"roll-ups\" that allow lenders who continue financing the debtor to be paid first on their prepetition claims.  See Cybergenics, 330 F.\u00a03d, at 574, n.\u00a08; D. Baird, Elements of Bankruptcy 232-234 (6th ed. 2014); Roe, 99 Va. L.\u00a0Rev., at 1250-1264.  In doing so, these courts have usually found that the distributions at issue would \"enable a successful reorganization and make even the disfavored creditors better off.\"  In\u00a0re Kmart Corp., 359 F.\u00a03d 866, 872 (CA7 2004) (discussing the justifications for critical-vendor orders); see also Toibb v. Radloff, 501 U.\u00a0S. 157, 163-164 (1991) (recognizing \"permitting business debtors to reorganize and restructure their debts in order to revive the debtors' businesses\" and \"maximizing the value of the bankruptcy estate\" as purposes of the Code).  By way of contrast, in a structured dismissal like the one ordered below, the priority-violating distribution is attached to a final disposition; it does not preserve the debtor as a going concern; it does not make the disfavored creditors better off; it does not promote the possibility of a confirmable plan; it does not help to restore the status quo ante; and it does not protect reliance interests.  In short, we cannot find in the violation of ordinary priority rules that occurred here any significant offsetting bankruptcy-related justification.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rather, the distributions at issue here more closely resemble proposed transactions that lower courts have refused to allow on the ground that they circumvent the Code's procedural safeguards.  See, e.g., In\u00a0re Braniff Airways, Inc., 700 F.\u00a02d 935, 940 (CA5 1983) (prohibiting an attempt to \"short circuit the requirements of Chapter 11 for confirmation of a reorganization plan by establishing the terms of the plan sub\u00a0rosa in connection with a sale of assets\"); In\u00a0re Lionel Corp., 722 F.\u00a02d 1063, 1069 (CA2 1983) (reversing a Bankruptcy Court's approval of an asset sale after holding that \u00a7363 does not \"gran[t] the bankruptcy judge carte blanche\" or \"swallo[w] up Chapter 11's safeguards\"); In\u00a0re Biolitec, Inc., 528 B. R. 261, 269 (Bkrtcy. Ct. NJ 2014) (rejecting a structured dismissal because it \"seeks to alter parties' rights without their consent and lacks many of the Code's most important safeguards\"); cf. In\u00a0re Chrysler LLC, 576 F.\u00a03d 108, 118 (CA2 2009) (approving a \u00a7363 asset sale because the bankruptcy court demonstrated \"proper solicitude for the priority between creditors and deemed it essential that the [s]ale in no way upset that priority\"), vacated as moot, 592 F.\u00a03d 370 (CA2 2010) (per curiam).\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We recognize that the Third Circuit did not approve nonconsensual priority-violating structured dismissals in general.  To the contrary, the court held that they were permissible only in those \"rare case[s]\" in which courts could find \"sufficient reasons\" to disregard priority.  787 F.\u00a03d, at 175, 186.  Despite the \"rare case\" limitation, we still cannot agree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, it is difficult to give precise content to the concept \"sufficient reasons.\"  That fact threatens to turn a \"rare case\" exception into a more general rule.  Consider the present case.  The Bankruptcy Court feared that (1) without the worker-skipping distribution, there would be no settlement, (2) without a settlement, all the unsecured creditors would receive nothing, and consequently (3) its distributions would make some creditors (high- and low-priority creditors) better off without making other (mid-priority) creditors worse off (for they would receive nothing regardless).  But, as we have pointed out, the record provides equivocal support for the first two propositions.  See supra, at 9-11.  And, one can readily imagine other cases that turn on comparably dubious predictions.  The result is uncertainty.  And uncertainty will lead to similar claims being made in many, not just a few, cases.  See Rudzik, A Priority Is a Priority Is a Priority--Except When It Isn't, 34 Am. Bankr. Inst. J. 16, 79 (2015) (\"[O]nce the floodgates are opened, debtors and favored creditors can be expected to make every case that 'rare case'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consequences are potentially serious.  They include departure from the protections Congress granted particular classes of creditors.  See, e.g., United States v. Embassy Restaurant, Inc., 359 U.\u00a0S. 29, 32 (1959) (Congress established employee wage priority \"to alleviate in some degree the hardship that unemployment usually brings to workers and their families\" when an employer files for bankruptcy); H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 95-595, at 187 (explaining the importance of ensuring that employees do not \"abandon a failing business for fear of not being paid\").  They include changes in the bargaining power of different classes of creditors even in bankruptcies that do not end in structured dismissals.  See Warren, A Theory of Absolute Priority, 1991 Ann. Survey Am. L. 9, 30.  They include risks of collusion, i.e., senior secured creditors and general unsecured creditors teaming up to squeeze out priority unsecured creditors.  See Bank of America Nat. Trust and Sav. Assn. v. 203 North LaSalle Street Partnership, 526 U.\u00a0S. 434, 444 (1999) (discussing how the absolute priority rule was developed in response to \"concern with 'the ability of a few insiders, whether representatives of management or major creditors, to use the reorganization process to gain an unfair advantage'\u00a0\" (quoting H.\u00a0R. Doc. No. 93-137, pt. I, p. 255 (1973))).  And they include making settlement more difficult to achieve.  See Landes & Posner, Legal Precedent: A Theoretical and Empirical Analysis, 19 J.\u00a0Law & Econ. 249, 271 (1976) (arguing that \"the ratio of lawsuits to settlements is mainly a function of the amount of uncertainty, which leads to divergent estimates by the parties of the probable outcome\"); see also RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.\u00a0S. 639, 649 (2012) (noting the importance of clarity and predictability in light of the fact that the \"Bankruptcy Code standardizes an expansive (and sometimes unruly) area of law\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, as well as those set forth in Part III, we conclude that Congress did not authorize a \"rare case\" exception.  We cannot \"alter the balance struck by the statute,\" Law v. Siegel, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11), not even in \"rare cases.\"  Cf. Norwest Bank Worthington v. Ahlers, 485 U.\u00a0S. 197, 207 (1988) (explaining that courts cannot deviate from the procedures \"specified by the Code,\" even when they sincerely \"believ[e] that .\u00a0.\u00a0. creditors would be better off\").  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-649\nCASIMIR CZYZEWSKI, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

Unfortunately, it does so without the benefit of any reasoned opinions on the dispositive issue from the courts of appeals (apart from the Court of Appeals' opinion in this case) and with briefing on that issue from only one of the parties.  That is because, having persuaded us to grant certiorari on one question, petitioners chose to argue a different question on the merits.  In light of that switch, I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to decide \"[w]hether a bankruptcy court may authorize the distribution of settlement proceeds in a manner that violates the statutory priority scheme.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  According to petitioners, the decision below \"deepened an existing .\u00a0.\u00a0. split\" among the Courts of Appeals on this question.  Id., at 8; see id., at 15-16 (citing In\u00a0re AWECO, Inc., 725 F.\u00a02d 293, 298 (CA5 1984), and In\u00a0re Iridium Operating LLC, 478 F.\u00a03d 452, 464 (CA2 2007)).  After we granted certiorari, however, petitioners recast the question presented to ask \"[w]hether a Chapter 11 case may be terminated by a 'structured dismissal' that distributes estate property in violation of the Bankruptcy Code's priority scheme.\"  Brief for Petitioners i.  Although both questions involve priority-skipping distributions of estate assets, the recast question is narrower--and different--than the one on which we granted certiorari.  It is also not the subject of a circuit conflict.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think it is unwise for the Court to decide the reformulated question today, for two reasons.  First, it is a \"novel question of bankruptcy law\" arising in the rapidly developing field of structured dismissals.  In\u00a0re Jevic Holding Corp., 787 F.\u00a03d 173, 175 (CA3 2015).  Experience shows that we would greatly benefit from the views of additional courts of appeals on this question.  We also would have benefited from full, adversarial briefing.  In reliance on this Court's Rules prohibiting parties from changing the substance of the question presented, see Rule 24.1(a); see also Rule 14.1(a), respondents declined to brief the question that the majority now decides, see Brief for Respondents 52.  Second, deciding this question may invite future petitioners to seek review of a circuit conflict only then to change the question to one that seems more favorable.  \"I would not reward such bait-and-switch tactics.\"  City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ 2015) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (slip op., at 3); see also Visa, Inc. v.

UNITED STATES(2017)\nNo. 16-5454\nArgued: Decided: March 6, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Constitution, through the Foreign Commerce Clause, grants Congress authority to \"regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.\"  Art. I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a03.  Without guidance from this Court as to the proper scope of Congress' power under this Clause, the courts of appeals have construed it expansively, to permit Congress to regulate economic activity abroad if it has a substantial effect on this Nation's foreign commerce.  In this case, the Court of Appeals declared constitutional a restitution award against a non-U.\u00a0S. citizen based upon conduct that occurred in Australia.  The facts are not sympathetic, but the principle involved is fundamental.  We should grant certiorari and reaffirm that our Federal Government is one of limited and enumerated powers, not the world's lawgiver.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Petitioner Damion St. Patrick Baston is a citizen of Jamaica.  He forced numerous women to prostitute for him through violence, threats, and humiliation.  One of his victims, K. L., was a citizen of Australia.  She prostituted for petitioner in Australia, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates before escaping from his control.  While in the United States, petitioner was arrested and charged with the sex trafficking of K. L. by force, fraud, or coercion, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71591(a), \"\u00a0'in the Southern District of Florida, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and elsewhere.'\u00a0\"  818 F.\u00a03d 651, 658 (CA11 2016).  As relevant here, \u00a71591(a)(1) states that the sex trafficking must \"affec[t] interstate or foreign commerce.\"  Congress has granted federal courts \"extra-territorial jurisdiction\" over sex trafficking if the \"alleged offender is present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the alleged offender.\"  \u00a71596(a)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a jury convicted petitioner, the District Court ordered him to pay K. L. $78,000 in restitution, which included the money she earned while prostituting for petitioner in the United States.  See \u00a71593 (requiring sentencing courts to order restitution in \"the full amount of the victim's losses\" for offenses under \u00a71591).  But the court refused to include in the restitution award the $400,000 that K. L. earned while prostituting in Australia.  In the court's view, the Foreign Commerce Clause did not permit an award of restitution based on petitioner's extraterritorial conduct.  818 F.\u00a03d, at 657, 660.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals vacated the order of restitution and remanded with instructions to increase the award by $400,000 to account for K. L.'s prostitution in Australia.  The court reasoned that whatever the outer bounds of the Foreign Commerce Clause might be, this Court has suggested that it has at least the same scope as the Interstate Commerce Clause.  Relying on our Interstate Commerce Clause precedents, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Foreign Commerce Clause grants Congress power to regulate \"activities that have a 'substantial effect' on commerce between the United States and other countries,\" including sex trafficking overseas.  Id., at 668 (citing Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.\u00a0S. 1, 16-17 (2005)).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals correctly noted that this Court has never \"thoroughly explored the scope of the Foreign Commerce Clause.\"  818 F.\u00a03d, at 667; accord, e.g., Goodno, When the Commerce Clause Goes International: A Proposed Legal Framework for the Foreign Commerce Clause, 65 Fla. L.\u00a0Rev. 1139, 1148-1149 (2013) (\"The U.\u00a0S. Supreme Court has not yet articulated the extent of Congress's power under the Foreign Commerce Clause to enact laws with extraterritorial reach.  Because of this lack of guidance .\u00a0.\u00a0. lower courts are at a loss for how  to analyze Foreign Commerce Clause issues\").  The few decisions from this Court addressing the scope of the Clause have generally been confined to laws regulating conduct with a significant connection to the United States.  See, e.g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U.\u00a0S. 48, 57 (1933) (\"The Congress may determine what articles may be imported into this country and the terms upon which importation is permitted\"); United States ex rel. Turner v. Williams, 194 U.\u00a0S. 279, 290 (1904) (\"[T]he power to regulate commerce with foreign nations .\u00a0.\u00a0. includes the entrance of ships, the importation of goods, and the bringing of persons into the ports of the United States\").  This Court has also articulated limits on the power of the States to regulate commerce with foreign nations under the so-called dormant Foreign Commerce Clause.  See, e.g., Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U.\u00a0S. 434, 449-454 (1979).  We have not, however, considered the limits of Congress' power under the Clause to regulate conduct occurring entirely within the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of specific guidance, the courts of appeals--including the court below--have understandably extended this Court's Interstate Commerce Clause precedents abroad.  In United States v. Lopez, 514 U.\u00a0S. 549, 558-559 (1995), we held that Congress is limited to regulating three categories of interstate activity: \"the use of the channels of interstate commerce,\" \"the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,\" and \"activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\"  Some courts of appeals \"have imported the Lopez categories directly into the foreign context,\" some \"have applied Lopez generally but recognized that Congress has greater power to regulate foreign commerce,\" and others have gone further still, \"holding that Congress has authority to legislate under the Foreign Commerce Clause when the text of a statute has a constitutionally tenable nexus with foreign commerce.\"  United States v. Bollinger, 798 F.\u00a03d 201, 215 (CA4 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id., at 215-216 (\"Instead of requiring that an activity have a substantial effect on foreign commerce, we hold that the Foreign Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate activities that demonstrably affect such commerce\").\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that language in some of this Court's precedents has led the courts of appeals into error.  At the very least, the time has come for us to clarify the scope of Congress' power under the Foreign Commerce Clause to regulate extraterritorially.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts of appeals have relied upon statements by this Court comparing the foreign commerce power to the interstate commerce power, but have removed those statements from their context.  In certain contexts, this Court has described the foreign commerce power as \"exclusive and plenary,\" Board of Trustees, supra, at 56-57 (citing Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196-200 (1824)), explaining that Congress' commerce power \"when exercised in respect of foreign commerce may be broader than when exercised as to interstate commerce,\" Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U.\u00a0S. 427, 434 (1932); see also Brolan v. United States, 236 U.\u00a0S. 216, 218-220 (1915). None of these opinions, however, \"involve[d] legislation of extraterritorial operation which purports to regulate conduct inside foreign nations.\"  Colangelo, The Foreign Commerce Clause, 96 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 949, 1001 (2010).  This Court's statements about the comparative breadth of the Foreign Commerce Clause are of questionable relevance where the issue is Congress' power to regulate, or even criminalize, conduct within another nation's sovereign territory.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, this Court's comparative statements about the breadth of the Foreign Commerce Clause have relied on some \"evidence that the Founders intended the scope of the foreign commerce power to be greater\" than Congress' power to regulate commerce among the States.  Japan Line, supra, at 448.  Whatever the Founders' intentions might have been in this respect, they were grounded in the original understanding of the Interstate Commerce Clause.  But this Court's modern doctrine has \"drifted far from the original understanding.\"  Lopez, supra, at 584 (Thomas, J., concurring).  For one thing, the \"Clause's text, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the term '\u00a0\"commerce\" consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes.'\u00a0\"  Raich, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 58 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Lopez, supra, at 585 (opinion of Thomas, J.)).  For another, \"the very notion of a 'substantial effects' test under the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress' powers and with this Court's early Commerce Clause cases.\"  United States  v. Morrison, 529 U.\u00a0S. 598, 627 (2000) (Thomas, J.,  concurring).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, even if the foreign commerce power were broader than the interstate commerce power as understood at the founding, it would not follow that the foreign commerce power is broader than the interstate commerce power as this Court now construes it.  But rather than interpreting the Foreign Commerce Clause as it was originally understood, the courts of appeals have taken this Court's modern interstate commerce doctrine and assumed that the foreign commerce power is at least as broad.  The result is a doctrine justified neither by our precedents nor by the original understanding.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taken to the limits of its logic, the consequences of the Court of Appeals' reasoning are startling.  The Foreign Commerce Clause would permit Congress to regulate any economic activity anywhere in the world, so long as Congress had a rational basis to conclude that the activity has a substantial effect on commerce between this Nation and any other.  Congress would be able not only to criminalize prostitution in Australia, but also to regulate working conditions in factories in China, pollution from powerplants in India, or agricultural methods on farms in France.  I am confident that whatever the correct interpretation of the foreign commerce power may be, it does not confer upon Congress a virtually plenary power over  global economic activity.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We should grant certiorari in this case to consider the proper scope of Congress' Foreign Commerce Clause power.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nDAMION ST.

Without guidance from this Court as to the proper scope of Congress' power under this Clause, the courts of appeals have construed it expansively, to permit Congress to regulate economic activity abroad if it has a substantial effect on this Nation's foreign commerce.  In this case, the Court of Appeals declared constitutional a restitution award against a non-U.\u00a0S. citizen based upon conduct that occurred in Australia.  The facts are not sympathetic, but the principle involved is fundamental.  We should grant certiorari and reaffirm that our Federal Government is one of limited and enumerated powers, not the world's lawgiver.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Petitioner Damion St. Patrick Baston is a citizen of Jamaica.  He forced numerous women to prostitute for him through violence, threats, and humiliation.  One of his victims, K. L., was a citizen of Australia.  She prostituted for petitioner in Australia, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates before escaping from his control.  While in the United States, petitioner was arrested and charged with the sex trafficking of K. L. by force, fraud, or coercion, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71591(a), \"\u00a0'in the Southern District of Florida, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, and elsewhere.'\u00a0\"  818 F.\u00a03d 651, 658 (CA11 2016).  As relevant here, \u00a71591(a)(1) states that the sex trafficking must \"affec[t] interstate or foreign commerce.\"  Congress has granted federal courts \"extra-territorial jurisdiction\" over sex trafficking if the \"alleged offender is present in the United States, irrespective of the nationality of the alleged offender.\"  \u00a71596(a)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a jury convicted petitioner, the District Court ordered him to pay K. L. $78,000 in restitution, which included the money she earned while prostituting for petitioner in the United States.  See \u00a71593 (requiring sentencing courts to order restitution in \"the full amount of the victim's losses\" for offenses under \u00a71591).  But the court refused to include in the restitution award the $400,000 that K. L. earned while prostituting in Australia.  In the court's view, the Foreign Commerce Clause did not permit an award of restitution based on petitioner's extraterritorial conduct.  818 F.\u00a03d, at 657, 660.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals vacated the order of restitution and remanded with instructions to increase the award by $400,000 to account for K. L.'s prostitution in Australia.  The court reasoned that whatever the outer bounds of the Foreign Commerce Clause might be, this Court has suggested that it has at least the same scope as the Interstate Commerce Clause.  Relying on our Interstate Commerce Clause precedents, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Foreign Commerce Clause grants Congress power to regulate \"activities that have a 'substantial effect' on commerce between the United States and other countries,\" including sex trafficking overseas.  Id., at 668 (citing Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.\u00a0S. 1, 16-17 (2005)).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals correctly noted that this Court has never \"thoroughly explored the scope of the Foreign Commerce Clause.\"  818 F.\u00a03d, at 667; accord, e.g., Goodno, When the Commerce Clause Goes International: A Proposed Legal Framework for the Foreign Commerce Clause, 65 Fla. L.\u00a0Rev. 1139, 1148-1149 (2013) (\"The U.\u00a0S. Supreme Court has not yet articulated the extent of Congress's power under the Foreign Commerce Clause to enact laws with extraterritorial reach.  Because of this lack of guidance .\u00a0.\u00a0. lower courts are at a loss for how  to analyze Foreign Commerce Clause issues\").  The few decisions from this Court addressing the scope of the Clause have generally been confined to laws regulating conduct with a significant connection to the United States.  See, e.g., Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ill. v. United States, 289 U.\u00a0S. 48, 57 (1933) (\"The Congress may determine what articles may be imported into this country and the terms upon which importation is permitted\"); United States ex rel. Turner v. Williams, 194 U.\u00a0S. 279, 290 (1904) (\"[T]he power to regulate commerce with foreign nations .\u00a0.\u00a0. includes the entrance of ships, the importation of goods, and the bringing of persons into the ports of the United States\").  This Court has also articulated limits on the power of the States to regulate commerce with foreign nations under the so-called dormant Foreign Commerce Clause.  See, e.g., Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 441 U.\u00a0S. 434, 449-454 (1979).  We have not, however, considered the limits of Congress' power under the Clause to regulate conduct occurring entirely within the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of specific guidance, the courts of appeals--including the court below--have understandably extended this Court's Interstate Commerce Clause precedents abroad.  In United States v. Lopez, 514 U.\u00a0S. 549, 558-559 (1995), we held that Congress is limited to regulating three categories of interstate activity: \"the use of the channels of interstate commerce,\" \"the instrumentalities of interstate commerce,\" and \"activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\"  Some courts of appeals \"have imported the Lopez categories directly into the foreign context,\" some \"have applied Lopez generally but recognized that Congress has greater power to regulate foreign commerce,\" and others have gone further still, \"holding that Congress has authority to legislate under the Foreign Commerce Clause when the text of a statute has a constitutionally tenable nexus with foreign commerce.\"  United States v. Bollinger, 798 F.\u00a03d 201, 215 (CA4 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also id., at 215-216 (\"Instead of requiring that an activity have a substantial effect on foreign commerce, we hold that the Foreign Commerce Clause allows Congress to regulate activities that demonstrably affect such commerce\").\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that language in some of this Court's precedents has led the courts of appeals into error.  At the very least, the time has come for us to clarify the scope of Congress' power under the Foreign Commerce Clause to regulate extraterritorially.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts of appeals have relied upon statements by this Court comparing the foreign commerce power to the interstate commerce power, but have removed those statements from their context.  In certain contexts, this Court has described the foreign commerce power as \"exclusive and plenary,\" Board of Trustees, supra, at 56-57 (citing Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 196-200 (1824)), explaining that Congress' commerce power \"when exercised in respect of foreign commerce may be broader than when exercised as to interstate commerce,\" Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U.\u00a0S. 427, 434 (1932); see also Brolan v. United States, 236 U.\u00a0S. 216, 218-220 (1915). None of these opinions, however, \"involve[d] legislation of extraterritorial operation which purports to regulate conduct inside foreign nations.\"  Colangelo, The Foreign Commerce Clause, 96 Va. L.\u00a0Rev. 949, 1001 (2010).  This Court's statements about the comparative breadth of the Foreign Commerce Clause are of questionable relevance where the issue is Congress' power to regulate, or even criminalize, conduct within another nation's sovereign territory.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, this Court's comparative statements about the breadth of the Foreign Commerce Clause have relied on some \"evidence that the Founders intended the scope of the foreign commerce power to be greater\" than Congress' power to regulate commerce among the States.  Japan Line, supra, at 448.  Whatever the Founders' intentions might have been in this respect, they were grounded in the original understanding of the Interstate Commerce Clause.  But this Court's modern doctrine has \"drifted far from the original understanding.\"  Lopez, supra, at 584 (Thomas, J., concurring).  For one thing, the \"Clause's text, structure, and history all indicate that, at the time of the founding, the term '\u00a0\"commerce\" consisted of selling, buying, and bartering, as well as transporting for these purposes.'\u00a0\"  Raich, 545 U.\u00a0S., at 58 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting Lopez, supra, at 585 (opinion of Thomas, J.)).  For another, \"the very notion of a 'substantial effects' test under the Commerce Clause is inconsistent with the original understanding of Congress' powers and with this Court's early Commerce Clause cases.\"  United States  v. Morrison, 529 U.\u00a0S. 598, 627 (2000) (Thomas, J.,  concurring).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus, even if the foreign commerce power were broader than the interstate commerce power as understood at the founding, it would not follow that the foreign commerce power is broader than the interstate commerce power as this Court now construes it.  But rather than interpreting the Foreign Commerce Clause as it was originally understood, the courts of appeals have taken this Court's modern interstate commerce doctrine and assumed that the foreign commerce power is at least as broad.  The result is a doctrine justified neither by our precedents nor by the original understanding.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taken to the limits of its logic, the consequences of the Court of Appeals' reasoning are startling.  The Foreign Commerce Clause would permit Congress to regulate any economic activity anywhere in the world, so long as Congress had a rational basis to conclude that the activity has a substantial effect on commerce between this Nation and any other.  Congress would be able not only to criminalize prostitution in Australia, but also to regulate working conditions in factories in China, pollution from powerplants in India, or agricultural methods on farms in France.  I am confident that whatever the correct interpretation of the foreign commerce power may be, it does not confer upon Congress a virtually plenary power over  global economic activity.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We should grant certiorari in this case to consider the proper scope of Congress' Foreign Commerce Clause power.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n","19":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDAVILA v. DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION(2017)\nNo. 16-6219\nArgued: April 24, 2017Decided: June 26, 2017\n\n\nIn petitioner's state capital murder trial, the trial court overruled counsel's objection to a proposed jury instruction and submitted the instruction to the jury, which convicted petitioner.  Appellate counsel did not challenge the jury instruction, and petitioner's conviction and sentence were affirmed.  Petitioner's state habeas counsel did not raise the instructional issue or challenge appellate counsel's failure to raise it on appeal, and the state habeas court denied relief.  Petitioner then sought federal habeas relief.  Invoking Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.\u00a0S. 1, and Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.\u00a0S. 413, petitioner argued that his state habeas counsel's ineffective assistance in failing to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claim provided cause to excuse the procedural default of that claim.  The District Court denied relief, concluding that Martinez and Trevino apply exclusively to ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims.  The Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability.\nHeld:\u00a0The ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel does not provide cause to excuse the procedural default of ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims.  Pp.\u00a04-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0In Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722, this Court held that attorney error committed in the course of state postconviction proceedings--for which the Constitution does not guarantee the right to counsel--cannot supply cause to excuse a procedural default that occurs in those proceedings.  Id., at 755.  In Martinez, the Court announced an \"equitable .\u00a0.\u00a0. qualification\" of Coleman's rule that applies where state law requires a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel to be raised in an \"initial-review collateral proceeding,\" rather than on direct appeal.  566 U.\u00a0S., at 16, 17.  In those situations, \"a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if\" the default results from the ineffective assistance of the prisoner's counsel in the collateral proceeding.  Id., at 17.  The Court clarified in Trevino that Martinez's exception also applies where the State's \"procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise\" the claim on direct appeal.  569 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0This Court declines to extend the Martinez exception to allow a federal court to hear a substantial, but procedurally defaulted, claim of appellate ineffectiveness when a prisoner's state postconviction counsel provides ineffective assistance by failing to raise it.  Pp.\u00a07-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0Martinez itself does not support extending this exception to new categories of procedurally defaulted claims.  The Martinez Court did not purport to displace Coleman as the general rule governing procedural default.  Rather, it \"qualifie[d] Coleman by recognizing a narrow exception,\" 566 U.\u00a0S., at 9, and made clear that \"[t]he rule of Coleman governs in all but th[ose] limited circumstances,\" id., at 16.  Applying Martinez's highly circumscribed, equitable exception to new categories of procedurally defaulted claims would do precisely what this Court disclaimed in that case.  P.\u00a07.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0Martinez's underlying rationale does not support extending its exception to appellate-ineffectiveness claims.  Petitioner argues that his situation is analogous to Martinez, where the Court expressed concern that trial-ineffectiveness claims might completely evade review.  The Court in Martinez made clear, however, that it exercised its equitable discretion in view of the unique importance of protecting a defendant's trial rights, particularly the right to effective assistance of trial counsel.  Declining to expand Martinez to the appellate-ineffectiveness context does no more than respect that judgment.  Nor is petitioner's rule required to ensure that meritorious claims of trial error receive review by at least one state or federal court--Martinez's chief concern.  See 566 U.\u00a0S., at 10, 12.  A claim of trial error, preserved by trial counsel but not raised by counsel on appeal, will have been addressed by the trial court.  If an unpreserved trial error was so obvious that appellate counsel was constitutionally required to raise it on appeal, then trial counsel likely provided ineffective assistance by failing to raise it at trial.  In that circumstance, the prisoner likely could invoke Martinez or Coleman to obtain review of trial counsel's failure to object.  Similarly, if the underlying, defaulted claim of trial error was ineffective assistance of trial counsel premised on something other than the failure to object, then Martinez and Coleman again already provide a vehicle for obtaining review of that error in most circumstances.  Pp.\u00a07-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3)\u00a0The equitable concerns addressed in Martinez do not apply to appellate-ineffectiveness claims.  In Martinez and Trevino, the States deliberately chose to make postconviction process the only means for raising trial-ineffectiveness claims.  The Court determined that it would be inequitable to refuse to hear a defaulted claim when the State had channeled that claim to a forum where the prisoner might lack the assistance of counsel in raising it.  The States have not made a similar choice with respect to appellate-ineffectiveness claims--nor could they, since such claims generally cannot be presented until after the termination of direct appeal.  The fact that appellate-ineffectiveness claims are considered in proceedings in which counsel is not constitutionally guaranteed is a function of the nature of the claim, not of the States' deliberate choices.  Pp.\u00a011-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(4)\u00a0The Martinez decision was also grounded in part on the belief that its narrow exception was unlikely to impose significant systemic costs.  See 566 U.\u00a0S., at 15-16.  But adopting petitioner's proposed extension could flood the federal courts with defaulted appellate-ineffectiveness claims, and potentially serve as a gateway to federal review of a host of defaulted claims of trial error.  It would also aggravate the harm to federalism that federal habeas review of state convictions necessarily causes.  Not only would these burdens on the federal courts and federal system be severe, but the systemic benefit would be small, as claims heard in federal court solely by virtue of petitioner's proposed rule would likely be largely meritless.

LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONSDIVISION\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit\n[June 26, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal habeas courts reviewing convictions from state courts will not consider claims that a state court refused to hear based on an adequate and independent state procedural ground.  A state prisoner may be able to overcome this bar, however, if he can establish \"cause\" to excuse the procedural default and demonstrate that he suffered actual prejudice from the alleged error.  An attorney error does not qualify as \"cause\" to excuse a procedural default unless the error amounted to constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.  Because a prisoner does not have a constitutional right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings, ineffective assistance in those proceedings does not qualify as cause to excuse a procedural default.  See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2012), and Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.\u00a0S. 413 (2013), this Court announced a narrow exception to Coleman's general rule.  That exception treats ineffective assistance by a prisoner's state postconviction counsel as cause to overcome the default of a single claim--ineffective assistance of trial counsel--in a single context--where the State effectively requires a defendant to bring that claim in state postconviction proceedings rather than on direct appeal.  The question in this case is whether we should extend that exception to allow federal courts to consider a different kind of defaulted claim--ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  We decline to do so.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 6, 2008, a group of family and friends gathered at Annette Stevenson's home to celebrate her granddaughter's birthday.  Petitioner Erick Daniel Davila, believing he had seen a member of a rival street gang at the celebration, fired a rifle at the group while they were eating cake and ice cream.  He shot and killed Annette and her 5-year-old granddaughter Queshawn, and he wounded three other children and one woman.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the police arrested petitioner, he confessed to the killings.  He stated that he \"wasn't aiming at the kids or the woman,\" but that he was trying to kill Annette's son (and Queshawn's father) Jerry Stevenson and the other \"guys on the porch.\"  App. 38.  The other \"guys on the porch\" were, apparently, women.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State indicted petitioner for capital murder under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a719.03(a)(7)(A) (West 2016), which makes it a capital crime to \"murde[r] more than one person .\u00a0.\u00a0. during the same criminal transaction.\"  In response to the jury's request for clarification during deliberations, the trial court proposed instructing the jury on transferred intent.  Under that doctrine, the jury could find petitioner guilty of murder if it determined that he intended to kill one person but instead killed a different person.  Petitioner's counsel objected to the additional instruction, arguing that the trial judge should \"wait\" to submit it \"until the jury indicates that they can't reach .\u00a0.\u00a0. a resolution.\"  App. 51.  The trial court overruled the objection and submitted the instruction to the jury.  The jury convicted petitioner of capital murder, and the trial court sentenced petitioner to death.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner appealed his conviction and sentence.  Although his appellate counsel argued that the State presented insufficient evidence to show that he acted with the requisite intent, counsel did not challenge the instruction about transferred intent.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction and sentence.  Davila v. State, 2011 WL 303265 (Jan. 26, 2011), cert. denied, 565 U.\u00a0S. 885 (2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner next sought habeas relief in Texas state court.  His counsel did not challenge the instruction about transferred intent, nor did he challenge the failure of his appellate counsel to raise the alleged instructional error on direct appeal.  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals denied relief.  Ex\u00a0parte Davila, 2013 WL 1655549 (Apr. 17, 2013), cert. denied, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner then sought habeas relief in Federal District Court under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254.  As relevant here, he argued that his appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to challenge the jury instruction about transferred intent.  Petitioner conceded that he had failed to raise his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel in his state habeas petition, but argued that the failure was the result of his state habeas counsel's ineffective assistance.  Petitioner invoked this Court's decisions in Martinez and Trevino to argue that his state habeas attorney's ineffective assistance provided cause to excuse the procedural default of his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court denied petitioner's \u00a72254 petition.  It concluded that Martinez and Trevino did not supply cause to excuse the procedural default of petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel because those decisions applied exclusively to claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  See Davila v. Stephens, 2015 WL 1808689, *20 (ND Tex., Apr. 21, 2015).  The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied a certificate of appealability on the same ground.  650 Fed.\u00a0Appx. 860, 867-868 (2016).  Petitioner then sought a writ of certiorari, asking us to reverse the Fifth Circuit on the ground that Martinez and Trevino should be extended to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  We granted certiorari, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), and now affirm.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in this case is guided by two fundamental tenets of federal review of state convictions.  First, a state prisoner must exhaust available state remedies before presenting his claim to a federal habeas court.  \u00a72254(b)(1)(A).  The exhaustion requirement is designed to avoid the \"unseemly\" result of a federal court \"upset[ting] a state court conviction without\" first according the state courts an \"opportunity to .\u00a0.\u00a0. correct a constitutional violation,\" Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.\u00a0S. 509, 518 (1982) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, a federal court may not review federal claims that were procedurally defaulted in state court--that is, claims that the state court denied based on an adequate and independent state procedural rule.  E.g., Beard v. Kindler, 558 U.\u00a0S. 53, 55 (2009).  This is an important \"corollary\" to the exhaustion requirement.  Dretke v. Haley, 541 U.\u00a0S. 386, 392 (2004).  \"Just as in those cases in which a state prisoner fails to exhaust state remedies, a habeas petitioner who has failed to meet the State's procedural requirements for presenting his federal claims has deprived the state courts of an opportunity to address\" the merits of \"those claims in the first instance.\"  Coleman, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 731-732.1  The procedural default doctrine thus advances the same comity, finality, and federalism interests advanced by the exhaustion doctrine.  See McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.\u00a0S. 467, 493 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A state prisoner may overcome the prohibition on reviewing procedurally defaulted claims if he can show \"cause\" to excuse his failure to comply with the state procedural rule and \"actual prejudice resulting from the alleged constitutional violation.\"  Wainwright v. Sykes, 433 U.\u00a0S. 72, 84 (1977); Coleman, supra, at 750.  To establish \"cause\"--the element of the doctrine relevant in this case--the prisoner must \"show that some objective factor external to the defense impeded counsel's efforts to comply with the State's procedural rule.\"  Murray v. Carrier, 477 U.\u00a0S. 478, 488 (1986).  A factor is external to the defense if it \"cannot fairly be attributed to\" the prisoner.  Coleman, supra, at 753.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It has long been the rule that attorney error is an objective external factor providing cause for excusing a procedural default only if that error amounted to a deprivation of the constitutional right to counsel.  See Edwards v. Carpenter, 529 U.\u00a0S. 446, 451 (2000).  An error amounting to constitutionally ineffective assistance is \"imputed to the State\" and is therefore external to the prisoner.  Murray, supra, at 488.  Attorney error that does not violate the Constitution, however, is attributed to the prisoner \"under well-settled principles of agency law.\"  Coleman, supra, at 754.  It follows, then, that in proceedings for which the Constitution does not guarantee the assistance of counsel at all, attorney error cannot provide cause to excuse a default.  Thus, in Coleman, this Court held that attorney error committed in the course of state postconviction proceedings--for which the Constitution does not guarantee the right to counsel, see Murray v. Giarratano, 492 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1989) (plurality opinion)--cannot supply cause to excuse a procedural default that occurs in those proceedings.  501 U.\u00a0S., at 755.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Martinez, this Court announced a narrow, \"equitable .\u00a0.\u00a0. qualification\" of the rule in Coleman that applies where state law requires prisoners to raise claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel \"in an initial-review collateral proceeding,\" rather than on direct appeal.  Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 16, 17.  It held that, in those situations, \"a procedural default will not bar a federal habeas court from hearing a substantial claim of ineffective assistance at trial if\" the default results from the ineffective assistance of the prisoner's counsel in the collateral proceeding.  Id., at 17.  In Trevino, the Court clarified that this exception applies both where state law explicitly prohibits prisoners from bringing claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal and where the State's \"procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise\" that claim on direct appeal.  569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner asks us to extend Martinez to allow a federal court to hear a substantial, but procedurally defaulted, claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel when a prisoner's state postconviction counsel provides ineffective assistance by failing to raise that claim.  We decline to do so.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On its face, Martinez provides no support for extending its narrow exception to new categories of procedurally defaulted claims.  Martinez did not purport to displace Coleman as the general rule governing procedural default.  Rather, it \"qualifie[d] Coleman by recognizing a narrow exception\" that applies only to claims of \"ineffective assistance of counsel at trial\" and only when, \"under state law,\" those claims \"must be raised in an initial-review collateral proceeding.\"  Martinez, supra, at 9, 17.  And Trevino merely clarified that the exception applies whether state law explicitly or effectively forecloses review of the claim on direct appeal.  569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op. at 2, 13).  In all but those \"limited circumstances,\" Martinez made clear that \"[t]he rule of Coleman governs.\"  566 U.\u00a0S., at 16.  Applying Martinez's highly circumscribed, equitable exception to new categories of procedurally defaulted claims would thus do precisely what this Court disclaimed in Martinez: Replace the rule of Coleman with the exception of Martinez.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner also finds no support in the underlying rationale of Martinez.  Petitioner's primary argument is that his claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel might never be reviewed by any court, state or federal, without expanding the exception to the rule in Coleman.  He argues that this situation is analogous to Martinez, where the Court expressed that same concern about claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  But the Court in Martinez was principally concerned about trial errors--in particular, claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel is not a trial error.  Nor is petitioner's rule necessary to ensure that a meritorious trial error (of any kind) receives review.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner argues that allowing a claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel to evade review is just as concerning as allowing a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel to evade review.  Brief for Petitioner 12; see also id., at 18-26.  We do not agree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The criminal trial enjoys pride of place in our criminal justice system in a way that an appeal from that trial does not.  The Constitution twice guarantees the right to a criminal trial, see Art. III, \u00a72; Amdt. 6, but does not guarantee the right to an appeal at all, Halbert v. Michigan, 545 U.\u00a0S. 605, 610 (2005).  The trial \"is the main event at which a defendant's rights are to be determined,\" McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.\u00a0S. 849, 859 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted), \"and not simply a tryout on the road to appellate review,\" Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.\u00a0S. 868, 895 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And it is where the stakes for the defendant are highest, not least because it is where a presumptively innocent defendant is adjudged guilty, see Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.\u00a0S. 600, 610 (1974); Wainwright, 433 U.\u00a0S., at 90, and where the trial judge or jury makes factual findings that nearly always receive deference on appeal and collateral review, see Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.\u00a0S. 307, 318-319 (1979); see also Cavazos v. Smith, 565 U.\u00a0S. 1, 2 (2011) (per curiam) (under deferential standard of review, \"judges will sometimes encounter convictions that they believe to be mistaken, but that they must nevertheless uphold\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Martinez made clear that it exercised its equitable discretion in view of the unique importance of protecting a defendant's trial rights, particularly the right to effective assistance of trial counsel.  As the Court explained, \"the limited nature\" of its holding \"reflect[ed] the importance of the right to the effective assistance of trial counsel,\" which is \"a bedrock principle in our justice system.\" 566 U.\u00a0S., at 12, 16 (emphasis added).  In declining to expand the Martinez exception to the distinct context of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, we do no more than respect that judgment.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner's rule also is not required to ensure that meritorious claims of trial error receive review by at least one state or federal court--the chief concern identified by this Court in Martinez.  See id., at 10, 12.  Martinez was concerned that a claim of trial error--specifically, ineffective assistance of trial counsel--might escape review in a State that required prisoners to bring the claim for the first time in state postconviction proceedings rather than on direct appeal.  Because it is difficult to assess a trial attorney's performance until the trial has ended, a trial court ordinarily will not have the opportunity to rule on such a claim.  And when the State requires a prisoner to wait until postconviction proceedings to raise the claim, the appellate court on direct appeal also will not have the opportunity to review it.  If postconviction counsel then fails to raise the claim, no state court will ever review it.  Finally, because attorney error in a state postconviction proceeding does not qualify as cause to excuse procedural default under Coleman, no federal court could consider the claim either.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, however, do not pose the same risk that a trial error--of any kind--will escape review altogether, at least in a way that could be remedied by petitioner's proposed rule.  This is true regardless of whether trial counsel preserved the alleged error at trial.  If trial counsel preserved the error by properly objecting, then that claim of trial error \"will have been addressed by .\u00a0.\u00a0. the trial court.\"  Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 11.  A claim of appellate ineffectiveness premised on a preserved trial error thus does not present the same concern that animated the Martinez exception because at least \"one court\" will have considered the claim on the merits.  Ibid.; see also Coleman, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 755-756.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If trial counsel failed to preserve the error at trial, then petitioner's proposed rule ordinarily would not give the prisoner access to federal review of the error, anyway.  Effective appellate counsel should not raise every nonfrivolous argument on appeal, but rather only those arguments most likely to succeed.  Smith v. Murray, 477 U.\u00a0S. 527, 536 (1986); Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.\u00a0S. 745, 751-753 (1983).  Declining to raise a claim on appeal, therefore, is not deficient performance unless that claim was plainly stronger than those actually presented to the appellate court.  See Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.\u00a0S. 259, 288 (2000).  In most cases, an unpreserved trial error will not be a plainly stronger ground for appeal than preserved errors.  See 2 B. Means, Postconviction Remedies \u00a735:19, p. 627, and n.\u00a016 (2016).  Thus, in most instances in which the trial court did not rule on the alleged trial error (because it was not preserved), the prisoner could not make out a substantial claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel and therefore could not avail himself of petitioner's expanded Martinez exception.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adopting petitioner's proposed rule would be unnecessary to ensure review of a claim of trial error even when a prisoner has a legitimate claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel based on something other than a preserved trial error.  If an unpreserved trial error was so obvious that appellate counsel was constitutionally required to raise it on appeal, then trial counsel likely provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to it in the first instance.  In that circumstance, the prisoner likely could invoke Martinez or Coleman to obtain review of trial counsel's failure to object.  Similarly, if the underlying, defaulted claim of trial error was ineffective assistance of trial counsel premised on something other than the failure to object, then Martinez and Coleman again already provide a vehicle for obtaining review of that error in most circumstances.  Petitioner's proposed rule is thus unnecessary for ensuring that trial errors are reviewed by at least one court.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Martinez also was responding to an equitable consideration that is unique to claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel and accordingly inapplicable to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  In Martinez, the State \"deliberately cho[se] to move trial-ineffectiveness claims outside of the direct-appeal process, where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed,\" into the postconviction review process, where we have never held that the Constitution guarantees a right to counsel.  566 U.\u00a0S., at 13; id., at 9.  By doing so, \"the State significantly diminishe[d] prisoners' ability to file such claims.\"  Id., at 13.  Similarly, in Trevino, the State had chosen a procedural framework pursuant to which collateral review was, \"as a practical matter, the onl[y] method for raising an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.\"  569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although this Court acknowledged in Martinez that there was nothing inappropriate about the State's choice, it explained that the choice was \"not without consequences for the State's ability to assert a procedural default\" in subsequent federal habeas proceedings.  566 U.\u00a0S., at 13.  Specifically, the Court concluded that it would be inequitable to refuse to hear a defaulted claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel when the State had channeled that claim to a forum where the prisoner might lack the assistance of counsel in raising it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The States have not made a similar choice with respect to claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel--nor could they.  By their very nature, such claims generally cannot be presented until after the termination of direct appeal.  Put another way, they necessarily must be heard in collateral proceedings, where counsel is not constitutionally guaranteed.  The fact that claims of appellate ineffectiveness are considered in proceedings in which counsel is not constitutionally guaranteed is a function of the nature of the claim, not of the State's \"deliberat[e] cho[ice] to move .\u00a0.\u00a0. claims outside of the direct-appeal process.\"  Ibid.  The equitable concerns raised in Martinez therefore do not apply.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Court in Martinez grounded its decision in part on the belief that its narrow exception was unlikely to impose significant systemic costs.  See id., at 15-16.  The same cannot be said of petitioner's proposed extension.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Adopting petitioner's argument could flood the federal courts with defaulted claims of appellate ineffectiveness.  For one thing, every prisoner in the country could bring these claims.  Martinez currently applies only to States that deliberately choose to channel claims of ineffective assistance of trial counsel into collateral proceedings.  See, e.g., Lee v. Corsini, 777 F.\u00a03d 46, 60-61 (CA1 2015) (Martinez and Trevino do not apply to Massachusetts); Henness v. Bagley, 766 F.\u00a03d 550, 557 (CA6 2014) (Martinez does not apply to Ohio).  If we applied Martinez to claims of appellate ineffectiveness, however, we would bring every State within Martinez's ambit, because claims of appellate ineffectiveness necessarily must be heard in collateral proceedings.  See supra, at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Extending Martinez to defaulted claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel would be especially troublesome because those claims could serve as the gateway to federal review of a host of trial errors, while Martinez covers only one trial error (ineffective assistance of trial counsel).  If a prisoner can establish ineffective assistance of trial counsel under Martinez, he ordinarily is entitled to a new trial.  See United States v. Morrison, 449 U.\u00a0S. 361, 364-365 (1981); see also Hagens v. State, 979 S.\u00a0W. 2d 788, 792 (Tex. App. 1998).  But if he cannot, Martinez provides no avenue for litigating other defaulted trial errors.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An expanded Martinez exception, however, would mean that any defaulted trial error could result in a new trial.  In Carpenter, this Court held that, when a prisoner can show cause to excuse a defaulted claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, he can in turn rely on that claim as cause to litigate an underlying claim of trial error that was defaulted due to appellate counsel's ineffectiveness.  529 U.\u00a0S., at 453.  Expanding Martinez as petitioner suggests would thus produce a domino effect: Prisoners could assert their postconviction counsel's inadequacy as cause to excuse the default of their appellate ineffectiveness claims, and use those newly reviewable appellate ineffectiveness claims as cause to excuse the default of their underlying claims of trial error.  Petitioner's rule thus could ultimately knock down the procedural barriers to federal habeas review of nearly any defaulted claim of trial error.  The scope of that review would exceed anything the Martinez Court envisioned when it established its narrow exception to Coleman.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner insists that these concerns are overstated because many of the newly raised claims will be meritless.  See Brief for Petitioner 28.  But even if that were true, courts would still have to undertake the task of separating the wheat from the chaff.  And we are not reassured by petitioner's suggestion that extending Martinez would increase only the number of claims in each petition rather than the number of federal habeas petitions themselves.  Reply Brief 14.  Each additional claim would require the district court to review the prisoner's trial record, appellate briefing, and state postconviction record to determine the claim's viability.  This effort could be repeated at each level of federal review.  We cannot \"assume that these costs would be negligible,\" Murray, 477 U.\u00a0S., at 487, and we are loath to further \"burden .\u00a0.\u00a0. scarce federal judicial resources\" in this way, McCleskey, 499 U.\u00a0S., at 491.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Expanding Martinez would not only impose significant costs on the federal courts, but would also aggravate the harm to federalism that federal habeas review necessarily causes.  Federal habeas review of state convictions \"entails significant costs,\" Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.\u00a0S. 107, 126 (1982), \"\u00a0'and intrudes on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority,'\u00a0\" Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 103 (2011) (quoting Harris v. Reed, 489 U.\u00a0S. 255, 282 (1989) (Kennedy, J., dissenting)).  It \"frustrates both the States' sovereign power to punish offenders and their good-faith attempts to honor constitutional rights.\"  Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.\u00a0S. 538, 555-556 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).  It \"degrades the prominence of the [State] trial,\" Engle, supra, at 127, and it \"disturbs the State's significant interest in repose for concluded litigation [and] denies society the right to punish some admitted offenders,\" Harrington, supra, at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Apart from increasing the sheer frequency of federal intrusion into state criminal affairs, petitioner's proposed rule would also undermine the doctrine of procedural default and the values it serves.  That doctrine, like the federal habeas statute generally, is designed to ameliorate the injuries to state sovereignty that federal habeas review necessarily inflicts by giving state courts the first opportunity to address challenges to convictions in state court, thereby \"promoting comity, finality, and federalism.\"  Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.\u00a0S. 170, 185 (2011); McCleskey, supra, at 493.  Expanding the narrow exception announced in Martinez would unduly aggravate the \"special costs on our federal system\" that federal habeas review already imposes.  Engle, supra, at 128.\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only would these burdens on the federal courts and our federal system be severe, but the benefit would--as a systemic matter--be small.  To be sure, permitting a state prisoner to bring a meritorious constitutional claim that could not otherwise be heard is beneficial to that prisoner.  Petitioner's counsel concedes, however, that relief is granted in, \"[i]f any, a very minute number\" of \"post-conviction ineffective assistance of appellate counsel cases.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  Indeed, he concedes that the number of meritorious cases is \"infinitesimally small.\"  Ibid.  We think it is likely that the claims heard in federal court because of petitioner's proposed rule would also be largely meritless, given that the proposed rule would generally affect only those cases in which the trial court already adjudicated, and rejected, the prisoner's argument regarding the alleged underlying trial error.  See supra, at 11.  Given that petitioner's proposed rule would likely generate high systemic costs and low systemic benefits, and that the unique concerns of Martinez are not implicated in cases like his, we do not think equity requires an expansion of Martinez.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-6219\nERICK DANIEL DAVILA, PETITIONER v. LORIE DAVIS, DIRECTOR, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE, CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit\n[June 26, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court explains, normally a federal habeas court cannot hear a state prisoner's claim that his trial lawyer was, constitutionally speaking, \"ineffective\" if the prisoner failed to assert that claim in state court at the appropriate time, that is, if he procedurally defaulted the claim.  See ante, at 1 (the prisoner's failure to raise his federal claim at the initial-review state collateral proceeding amounts to an \"adequate and independent state procedural ground\" for denying habeas relief).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But there are equitable exceptions.  In Martinez v. Ryan, 566 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2012), and later in Trevino v. Thaler, 569 U.\u00a0S. 413 (2013), we held that, despite the presence of a procedural default, a federal court can nonetheless hear a prisoner's claim that his trial counsel was ineffective, where (1) the framework of state procedural law \"makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel on direct appeal,\" id., at 429; (2) in the state \"\u00a0'initial-review collateral proceeding, there was no counsel or counsel in that proceeding was ineffective,'\u00a0\" ibid. (quoting Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 17); and (3) \"the underlying ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim is a substantial one, which is to say that the prisoner must demonstrate that the claim has some merit,\" id., at 14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, this same exception (with the same qualifications) should apply when a prisoner raises a constitutional claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  See, e.g., Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.\u00a0S. 387, 396 (1985) (Constitution guarantees a defendant an effective appellate counsel, just as it guarantees a defendant an effective trial counsel).\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two simple examples help make clear why I believe Martinez and Trevino should govern the outcome of this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Example One: Ineffective assistance of trial counsel.  The prisoner claims that his trial lawyer was ineffective, say, because counsel failed to object to an obviously unfair jury selection, failed to point out that the prosecution had promised numerous benefits to its main witness in return for the witness' testimony, or failed to object to an erroneous jury instruction that made conviction and imposition of the death penalty far more likely.  Next suppose the prisoner appeals but, per state law, may not bring his ineffective-assistance claim until collateral review in state court (i.e., state habeas corpus), where the prisoner will have a better opportunity to develop his claim and the attorney will be better able to explain his (perhaps strategic) reasons for his actions at trial.  Suppose that, on collateral review, the prisoner fails to bring up his ineffective-assistance claim, perhaps because he is no longer represented by counsel or because his counsel there is ineffective.  Under these circumstances, if his ineffective-assistance claim is a \"substantial\" one, i.e., it has \"some merit,\" then Martinez and Trevino hold that a federal court can hear the claim even though the state habeas court did not consider it.  See Trevino, supra, at 429; Martinez, supra, at 14.  The fact that the prisoner had no lawyer in the initial state habeas proceeding (or his lawyer in that proceeding was ineffective) constitutes grounds for excusing the procedural default.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Example Two: Ineffective assistance of appellate counsel. Now suppose that a prisoner claims that the trial court made an important error of law, say, improperly instructing the jury, or that the prosecution engaged in misconduct.  He believes his lawyer on direct appeal should have raised those errors because they led to his conviction or (as here) a death sentence.  The appellate lawyer's failure to do so, the prisoner might claim, amounts to ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  The prisoner cannot make this argument on direct appeal, for the direct appeal is the very proceeding in which he is represented by the lawyer he says was ineffective.  Next suppose the prisoner fails to raise his appellate lawyer's ineffectiveness at the initial state habeas proceeding, either because he was not represented by counsel in that proceeding or because his counsel there also was ineffective.  When he brings his case to the federal habeas court, the State contends that the prisoner's failure to present his claim during the initial state habeas proceeding constitutes a procedural default that precludes federal review of his claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given Martinez and Trevino, the prisoner in the first example who complains about his trial counsel can overcome the procedural default but, in the Court's view today, the prisoner in the second example who complains about his appellate counsel cannot.  Why should the law treat the second prisoner differently?  Why should the Court not apply the rules of Martinez and Trevino to claims of ineffective assistance of both trial and appellate counsel?\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have said, the Constitution applies similarly to both prisoners: It guarantees them effective assistance of counsel at both trial and during an initial appeal.  See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, 686 (1984) (trial); Evitts, supra, at 396 (appeal).  Moreover, the reasoning of Martinez and Trevino applies similarly to both situations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four features of the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel led the Martinez Court to its conclusion.  Each equally applies here.  First, the Court stressed the importance of the underlying constitutional right to effective assistance of trial counsel, describing it as \"a bedrock principle in our justice system.\"  566 U.\u00a0S., at 12.  Our cases make clear that the constitutional right to effective assistance of appellate counsel is also critically important.  The Court wrote in Douglas v. California, 372 U.\u00a0S. 353, 357 (1963), that \"where the merits of the one and only appeal .\u00a0.\u00a0. as of right are decided without benefit of counsel, we think an unconstitutional line has been drawn between rich and poor.\"  The Court held in Evitts that \"[a] first appeal as of right .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not adjudicated in accord with due process of law if the appellant does not have the effective assistance of an attorney.\"  469 U.\u00a0S., at 396.  The Court added that \"the promise of Gideon [v. Wainwright, 372 U.\u00a0S. 335 (1963),] that a criminal defendant has a right to counsel at trial .\u00a0.\u00a0. would be a futile gesture unless it comprehended the right to the effective assistance of counsel\" \"on appeal.\"  Id., at 397.  And we stated in Martinez itself that \"if the attorney appointed by the State to pursue the direct appeal is ineffective, the prisoner has been denied fair process.\"  566 U.\u00a0S., at 11 (citing Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.\u00a0S. 722, 754 (1991); Evitts, supra, at 396; Douglas, supra, at 357-358).  The fact that, according to Department of Justice statistics, nearly a third of convictions or sentences in capital cases are overturned at some stage of review suggests the practical importance of the appeal right, particularly in a capital case such as this one.  See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Capital Punishment, 2013-Statistical Tables, p. 19, (rev. Dec. 2014) (Table 16); see also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, we pointed out in Martinez that the \"initial\" state collateral review proceeding \"is the first designated proceeding for a prisoner to raise a claim of ineffective assistance at trial.\"  566 U.\u00a0S., at 11.  We added that it \"is in many ways the equivalent of a prisoner's direct appeal as to the ineffective-assistance claim.\"  Ibid.  In Trevino, we applied Martinez despite the theoretical possibility that a prisoner might raise an ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim on direct appeal.  We wrote that the State's procedural system denied prisoners a \"meaningful opportunity\" to bring ineffective-assistance claims on appeal; in effect, it required them to raise the claim for the first time in state collateral review proceedings.  569 U.\u00a0S., at 429.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This consideration applies a fortiori where the constitutional claim at issue is ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  The prisoner cannot raise that kind of claim in the very appeal in which he claims his counsel was ineffective.  See Ha Van Nguyen v. Curry, 736 F.\u00a03d 1287, 1294-1295 (CA9 2013).  It makes no difference that the nature of the claim, rather than the State's express rule, makes that so.  See Trevino, supra, at 429 (extending Martinez where the \"state procedural framework, by reason of its design and operation, makes it highly unlikely in a typical case that a defendant will have a meaningful opportunity to raise\" the claim on direct appeal); Trevino, supra, at 424 (referring to \"the\u00a0inherent nature of most ineffective assistance of trial counsel claims\u00a0\" (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 19-20, n.\u00a01 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (There is no \"relevant difference between cases in which the State says that certain claims can only be brought on collateral review and cases in which those claims by their nature can only be brought on collateral review\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, Martinez pointed out that, unless \"counsel's errors in an initial-review collateral proceeding .\u00a0.\u00a0. establish cause to excuse the procedural default in a federal habeas proceeding, no court will review the prisoner's claims.\"  Id., at 10-11 (majority opinion).  The same is true when the prisoner claims ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court argues to the contrary.  It says that at least one court--namely, the trial court--will have considered the underlying legal error.  Ante, at 11.  (If not, perhaps trial counsel was ineffective.)  But I believe the Court here misses the point.  The prisoner's complaint is about the ineffectiveness of his appellate counsel.  That ineffectiveness could consist, for example, in counsel's failure to appeal 10 different erroneous decisions of the trial court.  The fact that the trial court made those decisions (assuming they are erroneous) does not help the prisoner.  To the contrary, it forms the basis of his ineffectiveness claim.  In the absence of a Martinez-like rule, the prisoner here (and prisoners in similar cases) would receive no review of their ineffective-assistance claims.  Moreover, there will be cases in which no court will consider the underlying trial error, either.  Suppose that, during the pendency of the appeal, appellate counsel learns of a Brady violation, juror misconduct, judicial bias, or some similar violation whose basis was not known during the trial.  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.\u00a0S. 83 (1963).  And suppose appellate counsel fails to pursue the claim in the manner prescribed by state law.  Without the exception petitioner here seeks, no court will hear either the appellate-ineffective-assistance claim or the underlying Brady, misconduct, or bias claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, the Martinez Court believed that its decision would \"not .\u00a0.\u00a0. put a significant strain on state resources.\"  566 U.\u00a0S., at 15.  That is because Martinez imposed limiting conditions: It excuses only those defaults that (1) occur at the initial-review collateral proceeding; (2) where prisoner had no counsel, or ineffective counsel, in that proceeding; and (3) where the underlying claim of ineffective assistance is \"substantial,\" i.e., has \"some merit.\"  Id., at 14-16.  Moreover, as the Court pointed out, because many States provide prisoners with counsel in initial-review collateral proceedings (or at least when the prisoner seems to have a meritorious claim), it is unlikely that prisoners will default substantial ineffective-assistance claims.  See id., at 14-15 (providing examples).  Finally, there is no evidence before us that Martinez has produced a greater-than-expected increase in courts' workload, even though Martinez applies, as Texas concedes, \"in most States.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 38.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It therefore seems unlikely that applying Martinez to ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims will \"put a significant strain on\" state or federal resources.  As I have said, the same limitations as the Court placed upon the assertion of a Martinez claim would apply here.  And the Court's fear of triggering federal second-guessing of many, if not all, trial errors is of no greater concern here than it was in Martinez, for both trial- and appellate-level ineffectiveness claims \"could serve as the gateway to federal review of a host of trial errors.\"  Ante, at 13.  Given a natural judicial hesitation to second-guess counsels' decisions, it is not surprising that we have no significant evidence of defaulted claims of ineffective assistance with \"some merit\" flooding the federal courts, either in respect to trial counsel (as in Martinez) or in respect to appellate counsel (as here).  See Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 690-691 (To prevail on an ineffective-assistance claim, the defendant must show that his attorney's actions \"were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance,\" rather than strategic decisions to which the court must defer, and that those actions had an \"effect on the judgment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In fact, Texas has supplied some empirical evidence, but that evidence suggests that courts can manage a Martinez exception expanded to include claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  Texas says that in the Ninth Circuit, which has applied Martinez to ineffective-assistance-of-appellate-counsel claims since late 2013, petitioners have used the expanded version of Martinez \"in dozens\" of federal habeas cases.  Brief for Respondent 37.  (Texas specifically refers to 10 cases, in only 1 of which the petitioner prevailed.  Ibid., n.\u00a013.)  During that period, state prisoners filed at least 7,500 federal habeas petitions in the Ninth Circuit.  See Ninth Circuit Ann. Rep. 71 (2015) (2,468 cases referred to magistrate judges in 2014; 2,693 in 2015).  Hence, Texas' estimate of added workload comes down to an increase of \"dozens\" of cases out of 7,500 cases in total.  That figure represents an increase, but not an increase significant enough to warrant depriving a prisoner of any forum to adjudicate a substantial claim that he was deprived of his constitutional right to effective assistance of appellate counsel.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, the Court's effort to distinguish Martinez comes down to the following points: (1) Martinez concerned only claims of ineffective trial counsel; (2) Martinez involved trial errors that, at least sometimes, would have escaped review, while here at least one court (the trial court) may have reviewed the underlying legal error; (3) Martinez involved cases in which the State itself prevented its appellate courts from reviewing the claim of trial counsel's ineffectiveness, whereas here it is the nature of the ineffectiveness claim that prevents the appellate courts from reviewing it; and (4) extending Martinez could flood the federal system with normally meritless claims.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have explained why I believe the last mentioned empirical prediction does not distinguish Martinez and why, in any event, it is unlikely to prove correct.  See supra, at 7-8.  And I have explained why the second and third points do not successfully distinguish Martinez.  The second fails to focus on the relevant claim: ineffective assistance of counsel.  See supra, at 6.  And it fails to acknowledge that there may be cases in which the trial court will not have considered the legal error underlying the ineffective-assistance claim.  Ibid.  The third has little to do with the matter.  It overlooks the fact that there is no \"relevant difference\" between cases in which the State requires that certain claims be brought only on collateral review and \"cases in which those claims by their nature can only be brought on collateral review,\" such as claims of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  See supra, at 5-6 (quoting Martinez, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 19-20, n.\u00a01 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).  In both cases, the State's scheme deprives a prisoner from having his substantial constitutional claim heard, through no fault of his own.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the first point, the Court is of course right.  Martinez had to do only with the ineffectiveness of trial counsel.  But our cases make clear that due process requires a criminal defendant to have effective assistance of appellate counsel as well.  See supra, at 4.  Indeed, effective trial counsel and appellate counsel are inextricably connected elements of a fair trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The basic legal principle that should determine the outcome of this case is the principle that requires courts to treat like cases alike.  To put the matter more familiarly, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  The dissent in Martinez wrote that there \"is not a dime's worth of difference in principle between [ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel] cases and many other cases in which initial state habeas will be the first opportunity for a particular claim to be raised,\" including \"claims asserting ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.\"  566 U.\u00a0S., at 19 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  I agree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, I dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The Fifth Circuit treats unexhausted claims as procedurally defaulted if \"the court to which the petitioner would be required to present his claims in order to meet the exhaustion requirement would now find the claims procedurally barred.\"  Bagwell v. Dretke, 372 F.\u00a03d 748, 755 (2004) (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Coleman, 501 U.\u00a0S., at 735, n.  Relying on this doctrine, the District Court concluded that petitioner's federal claim was procedurally defaulted (even though a state court had never actually found it procedurally barred) because Texas law would likely bar a Texas court from deciding the claim on the merits if petitioner were to present it in a successive habeas petition.  Davila v. Stephens, 2015 WL 1808689, *19-*20 (ND Tex., Apr. 21, 2015) (citing Davila v. Stephens, 2014 WL 5879879, *2 (ND Tex., Nov. 10, 2014)); see also Davila v. Stephens, 2014 WL 6057907, *2 (ND Tex., Nov. 10, 2014).  Petitioner did not seek a certificate of appealability regarding that holding, and neither petitioner nor the State disputes in this Court that the claim was procedurally defaulted.  Accordingly, we assume that it was procedurally defaulted for purposes of this case.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The dissent argues that Martinez already provides a gateway to the review of underlying trial errors no differently than would petitioner's proposed rule.  See post, at 7 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  That is not so.  If a prisoner succeeds on his claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel under Martinez, the federal habeas court would not need to consider any other claim of trial error since the successful claim of trial ineffectiveness--unlike a successful claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel--entitles the prisoner to a new trial.  See 7 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a728.4(d), p.\u00a0258, n.\u00a075 (4th ed. 2015).\n\n\n","20":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nDEAN v. UNITED STATES(2017)\nNo. 15-9260\nArgued: February 28, 2017Decided: April 3, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Dean and his brother committed two robberies of drug dealers.  During each robbery, Dean's brother threatened and assaulted the victim with a gun, while Dean searched the premises for valuables.  Dean was convicted of multiple robbery and firearms counts, as well as two counts of possessing a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(c).  Section 924(c) criminalizes using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of such an underlying crime.  That provision mandates a distinct penalty to be imposed \"in addition to the punishment provided for [the predicate] crime,\" \u00a7924(c)(1)(A).  Further, \u00a7924(c) says that any sentence mandated by that provision must run consecutively to \"any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person,\" including any sentence for the predicate crime, \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  A first conviction under \u00a7924(c) carries a five-year mandatory minimum penalty, \u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), while a second conviction carries an additional 25-year mandatory minimum, \u00a7924(c)(1)(C)(i).  For Dean, that meant a 30-year mandatory minimum, to be served after and in addition to any sentence he received for his other counts of conviction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At sentencing, Dean urged the District Court to consider his lengthy mandatory minimum sentences when calculating the sentences for his other counts and to impose concurrent one-day sentences for those counts.  The judge said he would have agreed to Dean's request but understood \u00a7924(c) to preclude a sentence of 30 years plus one day.  On appeal, Dean argued that the District Court had erred in concluding that it could not vary from the Guidelines range based on the mandatory minimum sentences he would receive under \u00a7924(c).  The Court of Appeals ruled that Dean's argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent and that his sentence was otherwise substantively reasonable.\nHeld:\u00a0Section 924(c) does not prevent a sentencing court from considering a mandatory minimum imposed under that provision when calculating an appropriate sentence for the predicate offense.  Pp.\u00a03-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Sentencing courts have long enjoyed discretion in the sort of information they may consider when setting an appropriate sentence, and they continue to do so even as federal laws have required them to evaluate certain factors when exercising their discretion.  Pepper v. United States, 562 U.\u00a0S. 476, 487-489.  Section 3553(a) specifies the factors courts are to consider when imposing a sentence.  They include \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" as well as \"the need for the sentence imposed\" to serve the four overarching aims of sentencing: just punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation.  The \u00a73553(a) factors are used to set both the length of separate prison terms, \u00a73582(a), and an aggregate prison term comprising separate sentences for multiple counts of conviction, \u00a73584(b).  As a general matter, these sentencing provisions permit a court imposing a sentence on one count of conviction to consider sentences imposed on other counts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government argues that district courts should calculate the appropriate term of imprisonment for each individual offense, disregarding whatever sentences a defendant may face on other counts.  Only when determining an aggregate prison sentence, the Government maintains, should a district court consider the effect of those other sentences.  Nothing in the law requires such an approach.  There is no reason that the \u00a73553(a) factors may not also be considered when determining a prison sentence for each individual offense in a multicount case.  The Government's interpretation is at odds not only with the text of those provisions but also with the Government's own practice in \"sentencing package cases.\"  Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.\u00a0S. 237, 253.  Pp.\u00a03-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) The Government points to two limitations in \u00a7924(c) that, in its view, restrict the authority of sentencing courts to consider a sentence imposed under \u00a7924(c) when calculating a just sentence for the predicate count.  Neither limitation supports the Government's position.  First, that a mandatory sentence under \u00a7924(c) must be imposed \"in addition to the punishment provided\" for the predicate crime says nothing about the length of a non-\u00a7924(c) sentence, much less about what information a court may consider in determining that sentence.  Second, nothing in the requirement of consecutive sentences prevents a district court from imposing a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7924(c) and a one-day sentence for the predicate crime, provided those terms run one after the other.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government would, in effect, have this Court read into \u00a7924(c) the limitation explicitly made in \u00a71028A(b)(3), which provides that in determining the appropriate length of imprisonment for a predicate felony, \"a court shall not in any way reduce the term to be imposed for such crime so as to compensate for, or otherwise take into account, any separate term of imprisonment imposed or to be imposed for a violation of this section.\"  But \"[d]rawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate\" where, as demonstrated in \u00a71028A, \"Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms.\"  Kimbrough v.

UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[April 3, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress has made it a separate offense to use or possess a firearm in connection with a violent or drug trafficking crime.  18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7924(c).  That separate firearm offense carries a mandatory minimum sentence of five years for the first conviction and 25 years for a second.  Those sentences must be in addition to and consecutive to the sentence for the underlying predicate offense.  The question presented is whether, in calculating the sentence for the predicate offense, a judge must ignore the fact that the defendant will serve the mandatory minimums imposed under \u00a7924(c).\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Levon Dean, Jr., and his brother robbed a methamphetamine dealer in a Sioux City motel room.  Less than two weeks later, they robbed another drug dealer at his home.  During each robbery, Dean's brother threatened the victim with a modified semiautomatic rifle, later using that rifle to club the victim on the head.  Dean, meanwhile, ransacked the area for drugs, money, and other valuables.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A federal grand jury returned a multicount indictment charging Dean and his brother with a host of crimes related to the two robberies.  Following a joint trial, a jury convicted Dean of one count of conspiracy to commit robbery, two counts of robbery, and one count of possessing a firearm as a convicted felon.  He was also convicted of two counts of possessing and aiding and abetting the possession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence, in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72 and 924(c).  Section 924(c) criminalizes using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, or possessing a firearm in furtherance of such an underlying crime.  There is no dispute that Dean's two robbery convictions qualified as predicate crimes of violence for purposes of \u00a7924(c).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 924(c) does more than create a distinct offense.  It also mandates a distinct penalty, one that must be imposed \"in addition to the punishment provided for [the predicate] crime of violence or drug trafficking crime.\"  \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  A first-time offender under \u00a7924(c) receives a five-year mandatory minimum.  A \"second or subsequent conviction\" under \u00a7924(c) carries an additional 25-year mandatory minimum.  \u00a7\u00a7924(c)(1)(A)(i), (C)(i).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sentence imposed under \u00a7924(c) must run consecutively to \"any other term of imprisonment imposed on the  person,\" including any sentence for the predicate crime \"during which the firearm was used, carried, or possessed.\"  \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  For Dean, this meant a 30-year mandatory minimum, to be served after and in addition to any sentence he received for his other counts of conviction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At sentencing Dean did not dispute that each of his four other counts resulted in a sentencing range of 84-105 months under the Sentencing Guidelines.  He argued, however, that the court should consider his lengthy mandatory minimum sentences when calculating the sentences for his other counts, and impose concurrent one-day sentences for those counts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finding that Dean was \"clearly the follower\" and that he lacked \"any significant history of any violence,\" the District Judge agreed that 30 years plus one day was \"more than sufficient for a sentence in this case.\"  App. 26.  Yet the judge understood \u00a7924(c) to preclude such a sentence.  In his view, he was required to disregard Dean's 30-year mandatory minimum when determining the appropriate sentences for Dean's other counts of conviction.  Viewed on their own--and not as part of a combined package--those counts plainly warranted sentences longer than one day.  In the end, the judge still granted a significant downward variance from the 84-105 month Guidelines range.  Dean received concurrent sentences of 40 months for each non-\u00a7924(c) conviction, which, when added to his 360-month mandatory minimum, yielded a total sentence of 400 months.  Dean appealed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the Eighth Circuit, Dean argued that the District Court had erred in concluding that it could not vary from the Guidelines range based on the mandatory minimum sentences he would receive under \u00a7924(c).  The Court of Appeals disagreed, ruling that Dean's argument was foreclosed by Circuit precedent and that his sentence was otherwise substantively reasonable. 810 F.\u00a03d 521 (2015).  We granted certiorari.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sentencing courts have long enjoyed discretion in the sort of information they may consider when setting an appropriate sentence.  Pepper v. United States, 562 U.\u00a0S. 476, 487-489 (2011).  This durable tradition remains, even as federal laws have required sentencing courts to evaluate certain factors when exercising their discretion.  Ibid.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3553(a) of Title 18 specifies the factors courts are to consider in imposing a sentence.  The list of factors is preceded by what is known as the parsimony principle, a broad command that instructs courts to \"impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with\" the four identified purposes of sentencing: just punishment, deterrence, protection of the public, and rehabilitation.  Ibid.  A sentencing court is then directed to take into account \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant,\" as well as \"the need for the sentence imposed\" to serve the four overarching aims of sentencing.  \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(1), (2)(A)-(D); see Gall v. United States, 552 U.\u00a0S. 38, 50, n.\u00a06 (2007).  The court must also consider the pertinent guidelines and policies adopted by the Sentencing Commission.  \u00a7\u00a73553(a)(4), (5); see id., at 50, n.\u00a06.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \u00a73553(a) factors are used to set both the length of separate prison terms and an aggregate prison term comprising separate sentences for multiple counts of conviction.  Under \u00a73582 a court, \"in determining whether to impose a term of imprisonment, and, if a term of imprisonment is to be imposed, in determining the length of the term, shall consider the factors set forth in section 3553(a).\"  \u00a73582(a).  And \u00a73584 provides: \"[I]n determining whether the terms imposed are to be ordered to run concurrently or consecutively, [the court] shall consider, as to each offense for which a term of imprisonment is being imposed, the factors set forth in section 3553(a).\"  \u00a73584(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a general matter, the foregoing provisions permit a court imposing a sentence on one count of conviction to consider sentences imposed on other counts.  Take the directive that a court assess \"the need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\"  \u00a73553(a)(2)(C).  Dean committed the two robberies at issue here when he was 23 years old.  That he will not be released from prison until well after his fiftieth birthday because of the \u00a7924(c) convictions surely bears on whether--in connection with his predicate crimes--still more incarceration is necessary to protect the public.  Likewise, in considering \"the need for the sentence imposed .\u00a0.\u00a0. to afford adequate deterrence,\" \u00a73553(a)(2)(B), the District Court could not reasonably ignore the deterrent effect of Dean's 30-year mandatory minimum.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the Government, this is not how sentencing is meant to work.  Rather, district courts should calculate the appropriate term of imprisonment for each individual offense.  That determination, insists the Government, disregards whatever sentences the defendant may also face on other counts.  Not until deciding whether to run sentences consecutively or concurrently--i.e., not until applying \u00a73584--should a district court consider the effect of those other sentences.  Brief for United States 21-26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in the law requires such an approach.  The Government states that the \u00a73553(a) factors are \"normally relevant in determining the total length of imprisonment\" under \u00a73584.  Id., at 28.  No doubt they are.  But there is no reason they may not also be considered at the front end, when determining a prison sentence for each individual offense in a multicount case.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 At odds with the text, the Government's interpretation is also at odds with its own practice in \"sentencing package cases.\"  Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.\u00a0S. 237, 253 (2008).  \"Those cases typically involve multicount indictments and a successful attack by a defendant on some but not all of the counts of conviction.\"  Ibid.  In those cases--including ones where \u00a7924(c) convictions are invalidated--the Government routinely argues that an appellate court should vacate the entire sentence so that the district court may increase the sentences for any remaining counts up to the limit set by the original aggregate sentence.  See United States v. Smith, 756 F.\u00a03d 1179, 1188-1189, and n. 5 (CA10 2014) (collecting cases).  And appellate courts routinely agree.  Id., at 1189, and n.\u00a06 (same).  As we understand it, the Government's theory in those cases is that the district court may have relied on a now-vacated conviction when imposing sentences for the other counts.  But that theory of course directly contradicts the position the Government now advances--that district courts must determine sentences independently of one another, accounting for multiple sentences only when deciding whether to stack them or run them concurrently.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in \u00a7924(c) restricts the authority conferred on sentencing courts by \u00a73553(a) and the related provisions to consider a sentence imposed under \u00a7924(c) when calculating a just sentence for the predicate count.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government points to two limitations in \u00a7924(c).  First, the Government notes, a mandatory sentence under \u00a7924(c) must be imposed \"in addition to the punishment provided\" for the predicate crime.  \u00a7924(c)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  This limitation says nothing about the length of a non-\u00a7924(c) sentence, much less about what information a court may consider in determining that sentence.  Whether the sentence for the predicate offense is one day or one decade, a district court does not violate the terms of \u00a7924(c) so long as it imposes the mandatory minimum \"in addition to\" the sentence for the violent or drug trafficking crime.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, \u00a7924(c) states that \"no term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person, including any term of imprisonment imposed for the [predicate] crime during which the firearm was used, carried, or possessed.\"  \u00a7924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  Nothing in that language prevents a district court from imposing a 30-year mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7924(c) and a one-day sentence for the predicate violent or drug trafficking crime, provided those terms run one after the other.  The Government emphasizes that the requirement of consecutive sentences removes the discretion to run sentences concurrently that district courts exercise under \u00a73584.  We agree.  So does Dean, for that matter.  But we fail to see the significance of the point.  The bar on imposing concurrent sentences does not affect a court's discretion to consider a mandatory minimum when calculating each individual sentence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government would, in effect, have us read an additional limitation into \u00a7924(c): Where \u00a7924(c) says \"in addition to the punishment provided for [the predicate] crime of violence,\" what the statute really means is \"in addition to the punishment provided for [the predicate] crime of violence in the absence of a Section 924(c) conviction.\"  See Reply Brief 2.  We have said that \"[d]rawing meaning from silence is particularly inappropriate\" where \"Congress has shown that it knows how to direct sentencing practices in express terms.\"  Kimbrough v. United States, 552 U.\u00a0S. 85, 103 (2007).  Congress has shown just that in another statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71028A.  That section, which criminalizes the commission of identity theft \"during and in relation to\" certain predicate felonies, imposes a mandatory minimum sentence \"in addition to the punishment provided for\" the underlying offense.  \u00a71028A(a)(1).  It also says that the mandatory minimum must be consecutive to the sentence for the underlying offense.  \u00a71028A(b)(2).  So far, \u00a71028A tracks \u00a7924(c) in relevant respects.  But \u00a71028A goes further: It provides that in determining the appropriate length of imprisonment for the predicate felony \"a court shall not in any way reduce the term to be imposed for such crime so as to compensate for, or otherwise take into account, any separate term of imprisonment imposed or to be imposed for a violation of this section.\"  \u00a71028A(b)(3).  Section 1028A says just what the Government reads \u00a7924(c) to say--of course, without actually saying it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government responds that \u00a71028A was passed in 2004, long after Congress enacted the 1984 amendments creating the current sentencing regime in \u00a7924(c).  Brief for United States 46.  True.  But \u00a71028A confirms that it would have been easy enough to make explicit what the Government argues is implicit in \u00a7924(c).  It also underscores that for over a decade Congress has been aware of a clear way to bar consideration of a mandatory minimum, but never during that time changed the language of \u00a7924(c) to mirror that of \u00a71028A, even as it has amended other aspects of \u00a7924(c).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government speaks of Congress's intent to prevent district courts from bottoming out sentences for predicate \u00a7924(c) offenses whenever they think a mandatory minimum under \u00a7924(c) is already punishment enough.  But no such intent finds expression in the language of \u00a7924(c).  That language simply requires any mandatory minimum under \u00a7924(c) to be imposed \"in addition to\" the sentence for the predicate offense, and to run consecutively to that sentence.  Nothing in those requirements prevents a sentencing court from considering a mandatory minimum under \u00a7924(c) when calculating an appropriate sentence for the predicate offense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n","21":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEDWARD PERUTA, ET AL.  v.

Neither party disputes that the issue is one of national importance or that the courts of appeals have already weighed in extensively.  I would therefore grant the petition for a writ of certiorari.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0California generally prohibits the average citizen from carrying a firearm in public spaces, either openly or concealed.  With a few limited exceptions, the State prohibits open carry altogether.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a725850, 26350 (West 2012).  It proscribes concealed carry unless a resident obtains a license by showing \"good cause,\" among other criteria, \u00a7\u00a726150, 26155, and it authorizes counties to set rules for when an applicant has shown good cause, \u00a726160.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the county where petitioners reside, the sheriff has interpreted \"good cause\" to require an applicant to show that he has a particularized need, substantiated by documentary evidence, to carry a firearm for self-defense.  The sheriff's policy specifies that \"concern for one's personal safety\" does not \"alone\" satisfy this requirement.  Peruta v. County of San Diego, 742 F.\u00a03d 1144, 1148 (CA9 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, an applicant must show \"a set of circumstances that distinguish the applicant from the mainstream and cause him to be placed in harm's way.\"  Id., at 1169 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  \"[A] typical citizen fearing for his personal safety--by definition--cannot distinguish himself from the mainstream.\"  Ibid. (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  As a result, ordinary, \"law-abiding, responsible citizens,\" District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.\u00a0S. 570, 635 (2008), may not obtain a permit for concealed carry of a firearm in public spaces.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners are residents of San Diego County (plus an association with numerous county residents as members) who are unable to obtain a license for concealed carry due to the county's policy and, because the State generally bans open carry, are thus unable to bear firearms in public in any manner.  They sued under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, alleging that this near-total prohibition on public carry violates their Second Amendment right to bear arms.  They requested declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the sheriff from denying licenses based on his restrictive interpretation of \"good cause,\" as well as other \"relief as the Court deems just and proper.\"  First Amended Complaint in No. 3:09-cv-02371, (SD Cal.) \u00b6\u00b6149, 150, 152.  The District Court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, and petitioners appealed to the Ninth Circuit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a thorough opinion, a panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.  742 F.\u00a03d 1144.  The panel examined the constitutional text and this Court's precedents, as well as historical sources from before the founding era through the end of the 19th century.  Id., at 1150-1166.  Based on these sources, the court concluded that \"the carrying of an operable handgun outside the home for the lawful purpose of self-defense .\u00a0.\u00a0. constitutes 'bear[ing] Arms' within the meaning of the Second Amendment.\"  Id., at 1166.  It thus reversed the District Court and held that the sheriff's interpretation of \"good cause\" in combination with the other aspects of the State's regime violated the Second Amendment's command that a State \"permit some form of carry for self-defense outside the home.\"  Id., at 1172.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit sua sponte granted rehearing en banc and, by a divided court, reversed the panel decision.  In the en banc court's view, because petitioners specifically asked for the invalidation of the sheriff's \"good cause\" interpretation, their legal challenge was limited to that aspect of the applicable regulatory scheme.  The court thus declined to \"answer the question of whether or to what degree the Second Amendment might or might not protect a right of a member of the general public to carry firearms openly in public.\"  Peruta v. County of San Diego, 824 F.\u00a03d 919, 942 (2016).  It instead held only that \"the Second Amendment does not preserve or protect a right of a member of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.\"  Id., at 924 (emphasis added).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We should have granted certiorari in this case.  The approach taken by the en banc court is indefensible, and the petition raises important questions that this Court should address.  I see no reason to await another case.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The en banc court's decision to limit its review to whether the Second Amendment protects the right to concealed carry--as opposed to the more general right to public carry--was untenable.  Most fundamentally, it was not justified by the terms of the complaint, which called into question the State's regulatory scheme as a whole.  See First Amended Complaint \u00b663 (\"Because California does not permit the open carriage of loaded firearms, concealed carriage with a [concealed carry] permit is the only means by which an individual can bear arms in public places\"); id., \u00b674 (\"States may not completely ban the carrying of handguns for self-defense\").  And although the complaint specified the remedy that intruded least on the State's overall regulatory regime--declaratory relief and an injunction against the sheriff's restrictive interpretation of \"good cause\"--it also requested \"[a]ny further relief as the Court deems just and proper.\"  Id., \u00b6152.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor was the Ninth Circuit's approach justified by the history of this litigation.  The District Court emphasized that \"the heart of the parties' dispute\" is whether the Second Amendment protects \"the right to carry a loaded handgun in public, either openly or in a concealed manner.\"  Peruta v. County of San Diego, 758 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1106, 1109 (SD Cal. 2010).  As the Ninth Circuit panel pointed out, \"[petitioners] argue that the San Diego County policy in light of the California licensing scheme as a whole violates the Second Amendment because it precludes a responsible, law-abiding citizen from carrying a weapon in public for the purpose of lawful self-defense in any manner.\"  742 F.\u00a03d, at 1171.  The panel further observed that although petitioners \"focu[s]\" their challenge on the \"licensing scheme for concealed carry,\" this is \"for good reason: acquiring such a license is the only practical avenue by which [they] may come lawfully to carry a gun for self-defense in San Diego County.\"  Ibid.  Even the en banc court acknowledged that petitioners \"base their argument on the entirety of California's statutory scheme\" and \"do not contend that there is a free-standing Second Amendment right to carry concealed firearms.\"  824 F.\u00a03d, at 927.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had the en banc Ninth Circuit answered the question actually at issue in this case, it likely would have been compelled to reach the opposite result.  This Court has already suggested that the Second Amendment protects the right to carry firearms in public in some fashion.  As we explained in Heller, to \"bear arms\" means to \"\u00a0'wear, bear, or carry upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.'\u00a0\"  554 U.\u00a0S., at 584 (quoting Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.\u00a0S. 125, 143 (1998) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); alterations and some internal quotation marks omitted).  The most natural reading of this definition encompasses public carry.  I find it extremely improbable that the Framers understood the Second Amendment to protect little more than carrying a gun from the bedroom to the kitchen.  See Drake v. Filko, 724 F.\u00a03d 426, 444 (CA3 2013) (Hardiman, J., dissenting) (\"To speak of 'bearing' arms solely within one's home not only would conflate 'bearing' with 'keeping,' in derogation of the [Heller] Court's holding that the verbs codified distinct rights, but also would be awkward usage given the meaning assigned the terms by the Supreme Court\"); Moore v. Madigan, 702 F.\u00a03d 933, 936 (CA7 2012) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant history appears to support this understanding.  The panel opinion below pointed to a wealth of cases and secondary sources from England, the founding era, the antebellum period, and Reconstruction, which together strongly suggest that the right to bear arms includes the right to bear arms in public in some manner.  See 742 F.\u00a03d, at 1153-1166 (canvassing the relevant history in detail); Brief for National Rifle Association as Amicus Curiae 6-16.  For example, in Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243 (1846)--a decision the Heller Court discussed extensively as illustrative of the proper understanding of the right, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 612--the Georgia Supreme Court struck down a ban on open carry although it upheld a ban on concealed carry.  1 Ga., at 251.  Other cases similarly suggest that, although some regulation of public carry is permissible, an effective ban on all forms of public carry is not.  See, e.g., State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616-617 (1840) (\"A statute which, under the pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right, or which requires arms to be so borne as to render them wholly useless for the purpose of defence, would be clearly unconstitutional\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Second Amendment's core purpose further supports the conclusion that the right to bear arms extends to public carry.  The Court in Heller emphasized that \"self-defense\" is \"the central component of the [Second Amendment] right itself.\"  554 U.\u00a0S., at 599.  This purpose is not limited only to the home, even though the need for self-defense may be \"most acute\" there.  Id., at 628.  \"Self-defense has to take place wherever the person happens to be,\" and in some circumstances a person may be more vulnerable in a public place than in his own house.  Volokh, Implementing the Right To Keep and Bear Arms for Self-Defense: An Analytical Framework and a Research Agenda, 56 UCLA L.\u00a0Rev. 1443, 1515 (2009).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if other Members of the Court do not agree that the Second Amendment likely protects a right to public carry, the time has come for the Court to answer this important question definitively.  Twenty-six States have asked us to resolve the question presented, see Brief for Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae, and the lower courts have fully vetted the issue.  At least four other Courts of Appeals and three state courts of last resort have decided cases regarding the ability of States to regulate the public carry of firearms.  Those decisions (plus the one below) have produced thorough opinions on both sides of the issue.  See Drake, 724 F.\u00a03d 426, cert. denied sub\u00a0nom. Drake v. Jerejian, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014); 724 F.\u00a03d, at 440 (Hardiman, J., dissenting); Woollard v. Gallagher, 712 F.\u00a03d 865 (CA4), cert. denied, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013); Kachalsky v.

United States, 6 A.\u00a03d 1224, 1236 (D.\u00a0C. 2010).  Hence, I do not see much value in waiting for additional courts to weigh in, especially when constitutional rights are at stake.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision to deny certiorari in this case reflects a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right.  See Friedman v. Highland Park, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 6) (\"The Court's refusal to review a decision that flouts two of our Second Amendment precedents stands in marked contrast to the Court's willingness to summarily reverse courts that disregard our other constitutional decisions\"); Jackson v. City and County of San Francisco, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (same).  The Constitution does not rank certain rights above others, and I do not think this Court should impose such a hierarchy by selectively enforcing its preferred rights.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (\"Second Amendment rights are no less protected by our Constitution than other rights enumerated in that document\").  The Court has not heard argument in a Second Amendment case in over seven years--since March 2, 2010, in McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742.  Since that time, we have heard argument in, for example, roughly 35 cases where the question presented turned on the meaning of the First Amendment and 25 cases that turned on the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  This discrepancy is inexcusable, especially given how much less developed our jurisprudence is with respect to the Second Amendment as compared to the First and Fourth Amendments.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous.  But the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense.  I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.  I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nEDWARD PERUTA, et\u00a0al. v.

County of San Diego, 758 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1106, 1109 (SD Cal. 2010).  As the Ninth Circuit panel pointed out, \"[petitioners] argue that the San Diego County policy in light of the California licensing scheme as a whole violates the Second Amendment because it precludes a responsible, law-abiding citizen from carrying a weapon in public for the purpose of lawful self-defense in any manner.\"  742 F.\u00a03d, at 1171.  The panel further observed that although petitioners \"focu[s]\" their challenge on the \"licensing scheme for concealed carry,\" this is \"for good reason: acquiring such a license is the only practical avenue by which [they] may come lawfully to carry a gun for self-defense in San Diego County.\"  Ibid.  Even the en banc court acknowledged that petitioners \"base their argument on the entirety of California's statutory scheme\" and \"do not contend that there is a free-standing Second Amendment right to carry concealed firearms.\"  824 F.\u00a03d, at 927.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had the en banc Ninth Circuit answered the question actually at issue in this case, it likely would have been compelled to reach the opposite result.  This Court has already suggested that the Second Amendment protects the right to carry firearms in public in some fashion.  As we explained in Heller, to \"bear arms\" means to \"\u00a0'wear, bear, or carry upon the person or in the clothing or in a pocket, for the purpose of being armed and ready for offensive or defensive action in a case of conflict with another person.'\u00a0\"  554 U.\u00a0S., at 584 (quoting Muscarello v. United States, 524 U.\u00a0S. 125, 143 (1998) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting); alterations and some internal quotation marks omitted).  The most natural reading of this definition encompasses public carry.  I find it extremely improbable that the Framers understood the Second Amendment to protect little more than carrying a gun from the bedroom to the kitchen.  See Drake v. Filko, 724 F.\u00a03d 426, 444 (CA3 2013) (Hardiman, J., dissenting) (\"To speak of 'bearing' arms solely within one's home not only would conflate 'bearing' with 'keeping,' in derogation of the [Heller] Court's holding that the verbs codified distinct rights, but also would be awkward usage given the meaning assigned the terms by the Supreme Court\"); Moore v. Madigan, 702 F.\u00a03d 933, 936 (CA7 2012) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant history appears to support this understanding.  The panel opinion below pointed to a wealth of cases and secondary sources from England, the founding era, the antebellum period, and Reconstruction, which together strongly suggest that the right to bear arms includes the right to bear arms in public in some manner.  See 742 F.\u00a03d, at 1153-1166 (canvassing the relevant history in detail); Brief for National Rifle Association as Amicus Curiae 6-16.  For example, in Nunn v. State, 1 Ga. 243 (1846)--a decision the Heller Court discussed extensively as illustrative of the proper understanding of the right, 554 U.\u00a0S., at 612--the Georgia Supreme Court struck down a ban on open carry although it upheld a ban on concealed carry.  1 Ga., at 251.  Other cases similarly suggest that, although some regulation of public carry is permissible, an effective ban on all forms of public carry is not.  See, e.g., State v. Reid, 1 Ala. 612, 616-617 (1840) (\"A statute which, under the pretence of regulating, amounts to a destruction of the right, or which requires arms to be so borne as to render them wholly useless for the purpose of defence, would be clearly unconstitutional\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Second Amendment's core purpose further supports the conclusion that the right to bear arms extends to public carry.  The Court in Heller emphasized that \"self-defense\" is \"the central component of the [Second Amendment] right itself.\"  554 U.\u00a0S., at 599.  This purpose is not limited only to the home, even though the need for self-defense may be \"most acute\" there.  Id., at 628.  \"Self-defense has to take place wherever the person happens to be,\" and in some circumstances a person may be more vulnerable in a public place than in his own house.  Volokh, Implementing the Right To Keep and Bear Arms for Self-Defense: An Analytical Framework and a Research Agenda, 56 UCLA L.\u00a0Rev. 1443, 1515 (2009).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if other Members of the Court do not agree that the Second Amendment likely protects a right to public carry, the time has come for the Court to answer this important question definitively.  Twenty-six States have asked us to resolve the question presented, see Brief for Alabama et al. as Amici Curiae, and the lower courts have fully vetted the issue.  At least four other Courts of Appeals and three state courts of last resort have decided cases regarding the ability of States to regulate the public carry of firearms.  Those decisions (plus the one below) have produced thorough opinions on both sides of the issue.  See Drake, 724 F.\u00a03d 426, cert. denied sub\u00a0nom. Drake v. Jerejian, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014); 724 F.\u00a03d, at 440 (Hardiman, J., dissenting); Woollard v. Gallagher, 712 F.\u00a03d 865 (CA4), cert. denied, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013); Kachalsky v. County of Westchester, 701 F.\u00a03d 81 (CA2 2012), cert. denied sub\u00a0nom. Kachalsky v. Cacace, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013); Madigan, 702 F.\u00a03d 933; id., at 943 (Williams, J., dissenting); Commonwealth v. Gouse, 461 Mass. 787, 800-802, 965 N.\u00a0E. 2d 774, 785-786 (2012); Williams v. State, 417 Md. 479, 496, 10 A.\u00a03d 1167, 1177 (2011); Mack v. United States, 6 A.\u00a03d 1224, 1236 (D.\u00a0C. 2010).  Hence, I do not see much value in waiting for additional courts to weigh in, especially when constitutional rights are at stake.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision to deny certiorari in this case reflects a distressing trend: the treatment of the Second Amendment as a disfavored right.  See Friedman v. Highland Park, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (slip op., at 6) (\"The Court's refusal to review a decision that flouts two of our Second Amendment precedents stands in marked contrast to the Court's willingness to summarily reverse courts that disregard our other constitutional decisions\"); Jackson v. City and County of San Francisco, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (same).  The Constitution does not rank certain rights above others, and I do not think this Court should impose such a hierarchy by selectively enforcing its preferred rights.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1) (\"Second Amendment rights are no less protected by our Constitution than other rights enumerated in that document\").  The Court has not heard argument in a Second Amendment case in over seven years--since March 2, 2010, in McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742.  Since that time, we have heard argument in, for example, roughly 35 cases where the question presented turned on the meaning of the First Amendment and 25 cases that turned on the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  This discrepancy is inexcusable, especially given how much less developed our jurisprudence is with respect to the Second Amendment as compared to the First and Fourth Amendments.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For those of us who work in marbled halls, guarded constantly by a vigilant and dedicated police force, the guarantees of the Second Amendment might seem antiquated and superfluous.  But the Framers made a clear choice: They reserved to all Americans the right to bear arms for self-defense.  I do not think we should stand by idly while a State denies its citizens that right, particularly when their very lives may depend on it.  I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n","22":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nENDREW F., A MINOR, BY AND THROUGH HIS PARENTS AND NEXT FRIENDS, JOSEPH F. ET AL. v. DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT RE-1(2017)\nNo. 15-827\nArgued: January 11, 2017Decided: March 22, 2017\n\n\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) offers States federal funds to assist in educating children with disabilities.  The Act conditions that funding on compliance with certain statutory requirements, including the requirement that States provide every eligible child a \"free appropriate public education,\" or FAPE, by means of a uniquely tailored \"individualized education program,\" or IEP.  20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71401(9)(D), 1412(a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court first addressed the FAPE requirement in Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S. 176.  The Court held that the Act guarantees a substantively adequate program of education to all eligible children, and that this requirement is satisfied if the child's IEP sets out an educational program that is \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\"  Id., at 207.  For children fully integrated in the regular classroom, this would typically require an IEP \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\"  Id., at 204.  Because the IEP challenged in Rowley plainly met this standard, the Court declined \"to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits conferred upon all children covered by the Act,\" instead \"confin[ing] its analysis\" to the facts of the case before it.  Id., at 202. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Endrew F., a child with autism, received annual IEPs in respondent Douglas County School District from preschool through fourth grade.  By fourth grade, Endrew's parents believed his academic and functional progress had stalled.  When the school district proposed a fifth grade IEP that resembled those from past years, Endrew's parents removed him from public school and enrolled him in a specialized private school, where he made significant progress.  School district representatives later presented Endrew's parents with a new fifth grade IEP, but they considered it no more adequate than the original plan.  They then sought reimbursement for Endrew's private school tuition by filing a complaint under the IDEA with the Colorado Department of Education.  Their claim was denied, and a Federal District Court affirmed that determination.  The Tenth Circuit also affirmed.  That court interpreted Rowley to establish a rule that a child's IEP is adequate as long as it is calculated to confer an \"\u00a0educational benefit [that is] merely .\u00a0.\u00a0. more than de minimis,\" 798 F.\u00a03d 1329, 1338 (internal quotation marks omitted), and concluded that Endrew's IEP had been \"\u00a0reasonably calculated to enable [him] to make some progress,\u00a0\" id., at 1342 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The court accordingly held that Endrew had received a FAPE.  \nHeld:\u00a0To meet its substantive obligation under the IDEA, a school must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.  Pp.\u00a09-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Rowley and the language of the IDEA point to the approach adopted here.  The \"reasonably calculated\" qualification reflects a recognition that crafting an appropriate program of education requires a prospective judgment by school officials, informed by their own expertise and the views of a child's parents or guardians; any review of an IEP must appreciate that the question is whether the IEP is reasonable, not whether the court regards it as ideal.  An IEP must aim to enable the child to make progress; the essential function of an IEP is to set out a plan for pursuing academic and functional advancement.  And the degree of progress contemplated by the IEP must be appropriate in light of the child's circumstances, which should come as no surprise.  This reflects the focus on the particular child that is at the core of the IDEA, and the directive that States offer instruction \"specially designed\" to meet a child's \"unique needs\" through an \"[i]ndividualized education program.\"  \u00a7\u00a71401(29), (14) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rowley sheds light on what appropriate progress will look like in many cases: For a child fully integrated in the regular classroom, an IEP typically should be \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\"  458 U.\u00a0S., at 204.  This guidance is grounded in the statutory definition of a FAPE.  One component of a FAPE is \"special education,\" defined as \"specially designed instruction .\u00a0.\u00a0. to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability.\"  \u00a7\u00a71401(9), (29).  In determining what it means to \"meet the unique needs\" of a child with a disability, the provisions of the IDEA governing the IEP development process provide guidance.  These provisions reflect what the Court said in Rowley by focusing on \"progress in the general education curriculum.\"  \u00a7\u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i) (I)(aa), (II)(aa), (IV)(bb).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rowley did not provide concrete guidance with respect to a child who is not fully integrated in the regular classroom and not able to achieve on grade level.  A child's IEP need not aim for grade-level advancement if that is not a reasonable prospect.  But that child's educational program must be appropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances, just as advancement from grade to grade is appropriately ambitious for most children in the regular classroom.  The goals may differ, but every child should have the chance to meet challenging objectives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This standard is more demanding than the \"merely more than de minimis\" test applied by the Tenth Circuit.  It cannot be right that the IDEA generally contemplates grade-level advancement for children with disabilities who are fully integrated in the regular classroom, but is satisfied with barely more than de minimis progress for children who are not.  Pp.\u00a09-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Endrew's parents argue that the Act goes even further and requires States to provide children with disabilities educational opportunities that are \"substantially equal to the opportunities afforded children without disabilities.\"  Brief for Petitioner 40.  But the lower courts in Rowley adopted a strikingly similar standard, and this Court rejected it in clear terms.  Mindful that Congress has not materially changed the statutory definition of a FAPE since Rowley was decided, this Court declines to interpret the FAPE provision in a manner so plainly at odds with the Court's analysis in that case.  P.\u00a015.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The adequacy of a given IEP turns on the unique circumstances of the child for whom it was created.  This absence of a bright-line rule should not be mistaken for \"an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.\"  Rowley, 458 U. S., at 206.  At the same time, deference is based on the application of expertise and the exercise of judgment by school authorities.  The nature of the IEP process ensures that parents and school representatives will fully air their respective opinions on the degree of progress a child's IEP should pursue; thus, by the time any dispute reaches court, school authorities will have had the chance to bring their expertise and judgment to bear on areas of disagreement.  See \u00a7\u00a71414, 1415; Rowley, 458 U. S., at 208-209.  At that point, a reviewing court may fairly expect those authorities to be able to offer a cogent and responsive explanation for their decisions that shows the IEP is reasonably calculated to enable the child to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances.

DOUGLAS COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT RE-1\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit\n[March 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thirty-five years ago, this Court held that the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act establishes a substantive right to a \"free appropriate public education\" for certain children with disabilities.  Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S. 176 (1982).  We declined, however, to endorse any one standard for determining \"when handicapped children are receiving sufficient educational benefits to satisfy the requirements of the Act.\"  Id., at 202.  That \"more difficult problem\" is before us today.  Ibid.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA or Act) offers States federal funds to assist in educating children with disabilities.  84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71400 et\u00a0seq.; see Arlington Central School Dist. Bd. of Ed. v. Murphy, 548 U.\u00a0S. 291, 295 (2006).  In exchange for the funds, a State pledges to comply with a number of statutory conditions.  Among them, the State must provide a free appropriate public education--a FAPE, for short--to all eligible children.  \u00a71412(a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A FAPE, as the Act defines it, includes both \"special education\" and \"related services.\"  \u00a71401(9).  \"Special education\" is \"specially designed instruction .\u00a0.\u00a0. to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability\"; \"related services\" are the support services \"required to assist a child .\u00a0.\u00a0. to benefit from\" that instruction.  \u00a7\u00a71401(26), (29).  A State covered by the IDEA must provide a disabled child with such special education and related services \"in conformity with the [child's] individualized education program,\" or IEP.  \u00a71401(9)(D).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IEP is \"the centerpiece of the statute's education delivery system for disabled children.\"  Honig v. Doe, 484 U.\u00a0S. 305, 311 (1988).  A comprehensive plan prepared by a child's \"IEP Team\" (which includes teachers, school officials, and the child's parents), an IEP must be drafted in compliance with a detailed set of procedures.  \u00a71414(d)(1)(B) (internal quotation marks omitted).  These procedures emphasize collaboration among parents and educators and require careful consideration of the child's individual circumstances.  \u00a71414.  The IEP is the means by which special education and related services are \"tailored to the unique needs\" of a particular child.  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 181.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IDEA requires that every IEP include \"a statement of the child's present levels of academic achievement and functional performance,\" describe \"how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum,\" and set out \"measurable annual goals, including academic and functional goals,\" along with a \"description of how the child's progress toward meeting\" those goals will be gauged.  \u00a7\u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)-(III).  The IEP must also describe the \"special education and related services .\u00a0.\u00a0. that will be provided\" so that the child may \"advance appropriately toward attaining the annual goals\" and, when possible, \"be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum.\"  \u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Parents and educators often agree about what a child's IEP should contain.  But not always.  When disagreement arises, parents may turn to dispute resolution procedures established by the IDEA.  The parties may resolve their differences informally, through a \"[p]reliminary meeting,\" or, somewhat more formally, through mediation.  \u00a7\u00a71415(e), (f\u00a0)(1)(B)(i).  If these measures fail to produce accord, the parties may proceed to what the Act calls a \"due process hearing\" before a state or local educational agency.  \u00a7\u00a71415(f)(1)(A), (g).  And at the conclusion of the administrative process, the losing party may seek redress in state or federal court.  \u00a71415(i)(2)(A).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court first addressed the FAPE requirement in Rowley.1  Plaintiff Amy Rowley was a first grader with impaired hearing.  Her school district offered an IEP under which Amy would receive instruction in the regular classroom and spend time each week with a special tutor and a speech therapist.  The district proposed that Amy's classroom teacher speak into a wireless transmitter and that Amy use an FM hearing aid designed to amplify her teacher's words; the district offered to supply both components of this system.  But Amy's parents argued that the IEP should go further and provide a sign-language interpreter in all of her classes.  Contending that the school district's refusal to furnish an interpreter denied Amy a FAPE, Amy's parents initiated administrative proceedings, then filed a lawsuit under the Act.  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 184-185.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court agreed that Amy had been denied a FAPE.  The court acknowledged that Amy was making excellent progress in school: She was \"perform[ing] better than the average child in her class\" and \"advancing easily from grade to grade.\"  Id., at 185 (internal quotation marks omitted).  At the same time, Amy \"under[stood] considerably less of what goes on in class than she could if she were not deaf.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Concluding that \"it has been left entirely to the courts and the hearings officers to give content to the requirement of an 'appropriate education,'\u00a0\" 483 F.\u00a0Supp. 528, 533 (SDNY 1980), the District Court ruled that Amy's education was not \"appropriate\" unless it provided her \"an opportunity to achieve [her] full potential commensurate with the opportunity provided to other children.\"  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 185-186 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Second Circuit agreed with this analysis and affirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this Court, the parties advanced starkly different understandings of the FAPE requirement.  Amy's parents defended the approach of the lower courts, arguing that the school district was required to provide instruction and services that would provide Amy an \"equal educational opportunity\" relative to children without disabilities.  Id., at 198 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The school district, for its part, contended that the IDEA \"did not create substantive individual rights\"; the FAPE provision was instead merely aspirational.  Brief for Petitioners in Rowley, O. T. 1981, No. 80-1002, pp. 28, 41.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither position carried the day.  On the one hand, this Court rejected the view that the IDEA gives \"courts carte blanche to impose upon the States whatever burden their various judgments indicate should be imposed.\"  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 190, n.\u00a011.  After all, the statutory phrase \"free appropriate public education\" was expressly defined in the Act, even if the definition \"tend[ed] toward the cryptic rather than the comprehensive.\"  Id., at 188.  This Court went on to reject the \"equal opportunity\" standard adopted by the lower courts, concluding that \"free appropriate public education\" was a phrase \"too complex to be captured by the word 'equal' whether one is speaking of opportunities or services.\"  Id., at 199.  The Court also viewed the standard as \"entirely unworkable,\" apt to require \"impossible measurements and comparisons\" that courts were ill suited to make.  Id., at 198.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, the Court also rejected the school district's argument that the FAPE requirement was actually no requirement at all.  Id., at 200.  Instead, the Court carefully charted a middle path.  Even though \"Congress was rather sketchy in establishing substantive requirements\" under the Act, id., at 206, the Court nonetheless made clear that the Act guarantees a substantively adequate program of education to all eligible children, id., at 200-202, 207; see id., at 193, n.\u00a015 (describing the \"substantive standard .\u00a0.\u00a0. implicit in the Act\").  We explained that this requirement is satisfied, and a child has received a FAPE, if the child's IEP sets out an educational program that is \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educational benefits.\"  Id., at 207.  For children receiving instruction in the regular classroom, this would generally require an IEP \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\"  Id., at 204; see also id., at 203, n. 25.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of Amy Rowley's excellent progress and the \"substantial\" suite of specialized instruction and services offered in her IEP, we concluded that her program satisfied the FAPE requirement.  Id., at 202.  But we went no further.  Instead, we expressly \"confine[d] our analysis\" to the facts of the case before us.  Ibid.  Observing that the Act requires States to \"educate a wide spectrum\" of children with disabilities and that \"the benefits obtainable by children at one end of the spectrum will differ dramatically from those obtainable by children at the other end,\" we declined \"to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits conferred upon all children covered by the Act.\"  Ibid.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Endrew F. was diagnosed with autism at age two.  Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder generally marked by impaired social and communicative skills, \"engagement in repetitive activities and stereotyped movements, resistance to environmental change or change in daily routines, and unusual responses to sensory experiences.\"  34 CFR \u00a7300.8(c)(1)(i) (2016); see Brief for Petitioner 8.  A child with autism qualifies as a \"[c]hild with a disability\" under the IDEA, and Colorado (where Endrew resides) accepts IDEA funding.  \u00a71401(3)(A).  Endrew is therefore entitled to the benefits of the Act, including a FAPE provided by the State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Endrew attended school in respondent Douglas County School District from preschool through fourth grade.  Each year, his IEP Team drafted an IEP addressed to his educational and functional needs.  By Endrew's fourth grade year, however, his parents had become dissatisfied with his progress.  Although Endrew displayed a number of strengths--his teachers described him as a humorous child with a \"sweet disposition\" who \"show[ed] concern[\u00a0] for friends\"--he still \"exhibited multiple behaviors that inhibited his ability to access learning in the classroom.\"  Supp. App. 182a; 798 F.\u00a03d 1329, 1336 (CA10 2015).  Endrew would scream in class, climb over furniture and other students, and occasionally run away from school.  Id., at 1336.  He was afflicted by severe fears of commonplace things like flies, spills, and public restrooms.  As Endrew's parents saw it, his academic and functional progress had essentially stalled: Endrew's IEPs largely carried over the same basic goals and objectives from one year to the next, indicating that he was failing to make meaningful progress toward his aims. His parents believed that only a thorough overhaul of the school district's approach to Endrew's behavioral problems could reverse the trend.  But in April 2010, the school district presented Endrew's parents with a proposed fifth grade IEP that was, in their view, pretty much the same as his past ones.  So his parents removed Endrew from public school and enrolled him at Firefly Autism House, a private school that specializes in educating children with autism.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Endrew did much better at Firefly.  The school developed a \"behavioral intervention plan\" that identified Endrew's most problematic behaviors and set out particular strategies for addressing them.  See Supp. App. 198a-201a.  Firefly also added heft to Endrew's academic goals.  Within months, Endrew's behavior improved significantly, permitting him to make a degree of academic progress that had eluded him in public school.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In November 2010, some six months after Endrew started classes at Firefly, his parents again met with representatives of the Douglas County School District.  The district presented a new IEP.  Endrew's parents considered the IEP no more adequate than the one proposed in April, and rejected it.  They were particularly concerned that the stated plan for addressing Endrew's behavior did not differ meaningfully from the plan in his fourth grade IEP, despite the fact that his experience at Firefly suggested that he would benefit from a different approach.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In February 2012, Endrew's parents filed a complaint with the Colorado Department of Education seeking reimbursement for Endrew's tuition at Firefly.  To qualify for such relief, they were required to show that the school district had not provided Endrew a FAPE in a timely manner prior to his enrollment at the private school.  See \u00a71412(a)(10)(C)(ii).  Endrew's parents contended that the final IEP proposed by the school district was not \"reason-ably calculated to enable [Endrew] to receive educational benefits\" and that Endrew had therefore been denied a FAPE.  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 207.  An Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) disagreed and denied relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Endrew's parents sought review in Federal District Court.  Giving \"due weight\" to the decision of the ALJ, the District Court affirmed.  2014 WL 4548439, *5 (D Colo., Sept. 15, 2014) (quoting Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 206).  The court acknowledged that Endrew's performance under past IEPs \"did not reveal immense educational growth.\"  2014 WL 4548439, at *9.  But it concluded that annual modifications to Endrew's IEP objectives were \"sufficient to show a pattern of, at the least, minimal progress.\"  Ibid.  Because Endrew's previous IEPs had enabled him to make this sort of progress, the court reasoned, his latest, similar IEP was reasonably calculated to do the same thing.  In the court's view, that was all Rowley demanded.  2014 WL 4548439, at *9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tenth Circuit affirmed.  The Court of Appeals recited language from Rowley stating that the instruction and services furnished to children with disabilities must be calculated to confer \"some educational benefit.\"  798 F.\u00a03d, at 1338 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 200; emphasis added by Tenth Circuit).  The court noted that it had long interpreted this language to mean that a child's IEP is adequate as long as it is calculated to confer an \"educational benefit [that is] merely .\u00a0.\u00a0. more than de minimis.\"  798 F.\u00a03d, at 1338 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying this standard, the Tenth Circuit held that Endrew's IEP had been \"reasonably calculated to enable [him] to make some progress.\"  Id., at 1342 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, he had not been denied a FAPE.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Rowley declined \"to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits conferred upon all children covered by the Act.\"  458 U.\u00a0S., at 202.  The school district, however, contends that Rowley nonetheless established that \"an IEP need not promise any particular level of benefit,\" so long as it is \"\u00a0'\u00a0reasonably calculated' to provide some benefit, as opposed to none.\"  Brief for Respondent 15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The district relies on several passages from Rowley to make its case.  It points to our observation that \"any substantive standard prescribing the level of education to be accorded\" children with disabilities was \"[n]oticeably absent from the language of the statute.\"  458 U.\u00a0S., at 189; see Brief for Respondent 14.  The district also emphasizes the Court's statement that the Act requires States to provide access to instruction \"sufficient to confer some educational benefit,\" reasoning that any benefit, however minimal, satisfies this mandate.  Brief for Respondent 15 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 200).  Finally, the district urges that the Court conclusively adopted a \"some educational benefit\" standard when it wrote that \"the intent of the Act was more to open the door of public education to handicapped children .\u00a0.\u00a0. than to guarantee any particular level of education.\"  Id., at 192; see Brief for Respondent 14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These statements in isolation do support the school district's argument.  But the district makes too much of them.  Our statement that the face of the IDEA imposed no explicit substantive standard must be evaluated alongside our statement that a substantive standard was \"implicit in the Act.\"  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 193, n.\u00a015.  Similarly, we find little significance in the Court's language concerning the requirement that States provide instruction calculated to \"confer some educational benefit.\"  Id., at 200.  The Court had no need to say anything more particular, since the case before it involved a child whose progress plainly demonstrated that her IEP was designed to deliver more than adequate educational benefits.  See id., at 202, 209-210.  The Court's principal concern was to correct what it viewed as the surprising rulings below: that the IDEA effectively empowers judges to elaborate a federal common law of public education, and that a child performing better than most in her class had been denied a FAPE.  The Court was not concerned with precisely articulating a governing standard for closer cases.  See id., at 202.  And the statement that the Act did not \"guarantee any particular level of education\" simply reflects the unobjectionable proposition that the IDEA cannot and does not promise \"any particular [educational] outcome.\"  Id., at 192 (internal quotation marks omitted).  No law could do that--for any child.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More important, the school district's reading of these isolated statements runs headlong into several points on which Rowley is crystal clear.  For instance--just after saying that the Act requires instruction that is \"sufficient to confer some educational benefit\"--we noted that \"[t]he determination of when handicapped children are receiving sufficient educational benefits .\u00a0.\u00a0. presents a .\u00a0.\u00a0. difficult problem.\"  Id., at 200, 202 (emphasis added).  And then we expressly declined \"to establish any one test for determining the adequacy of educational benefits\" under the Act.  Id., at 202 (emphasis added).  It would not have been \"difficult\" for us to say when educational benefits are sufficient if we had just said that any educational benefit was enough.  And it would have been strange to refuse to set out a test for the adequacy of educational benefits if we had just done exactly that.  We cannot accept the school district's reading of Rowley.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Rowley declined to articulate an overarching standard to evaluate the adequacy of the education provided under the Act, the decision and the statutory language point to a general approach: To meet its substantive obligation under the IDEA, a school must offer an IEP reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"reasonably calculated\" qualification reflects a recognition that crafting an appropriate program of education requires a prospective judgment by school officials.  Id., at 207.  The Act contemplates that this fact-intensive exercise will be informed not only by the expertise of school officials, but also by the input of the child's parents or guardians.  Id., at 208-209.  Any review of an IEP must appreciate that the question is whether the IEP is reasonable, not whether the court regards it as ideal.  Id., at 206-207.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IEP must aim to enable the child to make progress.  After all, the essential function of an IEP is to set out a plan for pursuing academic and functional advancement.  See \u00a7\u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)-(IV).  This reflects the broad purpose of the IDEA, an \"ambitious\" piece of legislation enacted \"in response to Congress' perception that a majority of handicapped children in the United States 'were either totally excluded from schools or [were] sitting idly in regular classrooms awaiting the time when they were old enough to \"drop out.\"\u00a0'\u00a0\"  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 179 (quoting H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 94-332, p.\u00a02 (1975)).  A substantive standard not focused on student progress would do little to remedy the pervasive and tragic academic stagnation that prompted Congress to act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That the progress contemplated by the IEP must be appropriate in light of the child's circumstances should come as no surprise.  A focus on the particular child is at the core of the IDEA.  The instruction offered must be \"specially designed\" to meet a child's \"unique needs\" through an \"[i]ndividualized education program.\"  \u00a7\u00a71401(29), (14) (emphasis added).  An IEP is not a form document.  It is constructed only after careful consideration of the child's present levels of achievement, disability, and potential for growth.  \u00a7\u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)-(IV), (d)(3)(A)(i)-(iv).  As we observed in Rowley, the IDEA \"requires participating States to educate a wide spectrum of handicapped children,\" and \"the benefits obtainable by children at one end of the spectrum will differ dramatically from those obtainable by children at the other end, with infinite variations in between.\"  458 U.\u00a0S., at 202.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rowley sheds light on what appropriate progress will look like in many cases.  There, the Court recognized that the IDEA requires that children with disabilities receive education in the regular classroom \"whenever possible.\"  Ibid. (citing \u00a71412(a)(5)).  When this preference is met, \"the system itself monitors the educational progress of the child.\"  Id., at 202-203.  \"Regular examinations are administered, grades are awarded, and yearly advancement to higher grade levels is permitted for those children who attain an adequate knowledge of the course material.\"  Id., at 203.  Progress through this system is what our society generally means by an \"education.\"  And access to an \"education\" is what the IDEA promises.  Ibid.  Accordingly, for a child fully integrated in the regular classroom, an IEP typically should, as Rowley put it, be \"reasonably calculated to enable the child to achieve passing marks and advance from grade to grade.\"  Id., at 203-204.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This guidance is grounded in the statutory definition of a FAPE.  One of the components of a FAPE is \"special education,\" defined as \"specially designed instruction .\u00a0.\u00a0. to meet the unique needs of a child with a disability.\"  \u00a7\u00a71401(9), (29).  In determining what it means to \"meet the unique needs\" of a child with a disability, the provisions governing the IEP development process are a natural source of guidance: It is through the IEP that \"[t]he 'free appropriate public education' required by the Act is tailored to the unique needs of\" a particular child.  Id., at 181.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IEP provisions reflect Rowley's expectation that, for most children, a FAPE will involve integration in the regular classroom and individualized special education calculated to achieve advancement from grade to grade.  Every IEP begins by describing a child's present level of achievement, including explaining \"how the child's disability affects the child's involvement and progress in the general education curriculum.\"  \u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)(aa).  It then sets out \"a statement of measurable annual goals .\u00a0.\u00a0. designed to .\u00a0.\u00a0. enable the child to be involved in and make progress in the general education curriculum,\" along with a description of specialized instruction and services that the child will receive.  \u00a7\u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II), (IV).  The instruction and services must likewise be provided with an eye toward \"progress in the general education curriculum.\"  \u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(IV)(bb).  Similar IEP requirements have been in place since the time the States began accepting funding under the IDEA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The school district protests that these provisions impose only procedural requirements--a checklist of items the IEP must address--not a substantive standard enforce-able in court.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 50-51.  But the procedures are there for a reason, and their focus provides insight into what it means, for purposes of the FAPE definition, to \"meet the unique needs\" of a child with a disability.  \u00a7\u00a71401(9), (29).  When a child is fully integrated in the regular classroom, as the Act prefers, what that typically means is providing a level of instruction reasonably calculated to permit advancement through the general curriculum.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rowley had no need to provide concrete guidance with respect to a child who is not fully integrated in the regular classroom and not able to achieve on grade level.  That case concerned a young girl who was progressing smoothly through the regular curriculum.  If that is not a reason-able prospect for a child, his IEP need not aim for grade-level advancement.  But his educational program must be appropriately ambitious in light of his circumstances, just as advancement from grade to grade is appropriately ambitious for most children in the regular classroom.  The goals may differ, but every child should have the chance to meet challenging objectives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course this describes a general standard, not a formula.  But whatever else can be said about it, this standard is markedly more demanding than the \"merely more than de minimis\" test applied by the Tenth Circuit.  It cannot be the case that the Act typically aims for grade-level advancement for children with disabilities who can be educated in the regular classroom, but is satisfied with barely more than de minimis progress for those who cannot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When all is said and done, a student offered an educational program providing \"merely more than de minimis\" progress from year to year can hardly be said to have been offered an education at all.  For children with disabilities, receiving instruction that aims so low would be tantamount to \"sitting idly .\u00a0.\u00a0. awaiting the time when they were old enough to 'drop out.'\u00a0\"  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 179 (some internal quotation marks omitted).  The IDEA demands more.  It requires an educational program reasonably calculated to enable a child to make progress appropriate in light of the child's circumstances.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Endrew's parents argue that the Act goes even further.  In their view, a FAPE is \"an education that aims to provide a child with a disability opportunities to achieve academic success, attain self-sufficiency, and contribute to society that are substantially equal to the opportunities afforded children without disabilities.\"  Brief for Petitioner 40.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This standard is strikingly similar to the one the lower courts adopted in Rowley, and it is virtually identical to the formulation advanced by Justice Blackmun in his separate writing in that case.  See 458 U.\u00a0S., at 185-186; id., at 211 (opinion concurring in judgment) (\"[T]he question is whether Amy's program .\u00a0.\u00a0. offered her an opportunity to understand and participate in the classroom that was substantially equal to that given her non-handicapped classmates\").  But the majority rejected any such standard in clear terms.  Id., at 198 (\"The requirement that States provide 'equal' educational opportunities would .\u00a0.\u00a0. seem to present an entirely unworkable standard requiring impossible measurements and comparisons\").  Mindful that Congress (despite several intervening amendments to the IDEA) has not materially changed the statutory definition of a FAPE since Rowley was decided, we decline to interpret the FAPE provision in a manner so plainly at odds with the Court's analysis in that case.  Compare \u00a71401(18) (1976 ed.) with \u00a71401(9) (2012 ed.).\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We will not attempt to elaborate on what \"appropriate\" progress will look like from case to case.  It is in the nature of the Act and the standard we adopt to resist such an effort: The adequacy of a given IEP turns on the unique circumstances of the child for whom it was created.  This absence of a bright-line rule, however, should not be mistaken for \"an invitation to the courts to substitute their own notions of sound educational policy for those of the school authorities which they review.\"  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 206.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, deference is based on the application of expertise and the exercise of judgment by school authorities.  The Act vests these officials with responsibility for decisions of critical importance to the life of a disabled child.  The nature of the IEP process, from the initial consultation through state administrative proceedings, ensures that parents and school representatives will fully air their respective opinions on the degree of progress a child's IEP should pursue.  See \u00a7\u00a71414, 1415; id., at 208-209.  By the time any dispute reaches court, school authorities will have had a complete opportunity to bring their expertise and judgment to bear on areas of disagreement.  A reviewing court may fairly expect those authorities to be able to offer a cogent and responsive explanation for their decisions that shows the IEP is reasonably calculated to enable the child to make progress appropriate in light of his circumstances.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The requirement was initially set out in the Education of the Handicapped Act, which was later amended and renamed the IDEA.  See Pub. L. 101-476, \u00a7901(a), 104 Stat. 1141.  For simplicity's sake--and to avoid \"acronym overload\"--we use the latter title throughout this opinion.  Fry v.

SESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL(2017)\nNo. 16-54\nArgued: February 27, 2017Decided: May 30, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner, a citizen of Mexico and lawful permanent resident of the United States, pleaded no contest in a California court to a statutory rape offense criminalizing \"unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator.\"  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7261.5(c).  For purposes of that offense, California defines \"minor\" as \"a person under the age of 18.\"  \u00a7261.5(a).  Based on this conviction, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), which makes removable \"[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony,\" 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), including \"sexual abuse of a minor,\" \u00a71101(a)(43)(A).  An Immigration Judge ordered petitioner removed to Mexico.  The Board of Immigration Appeals agreed that petitioner's crime constituted sexual abuse of a minor and dismissed his appeal.  A divided Court of Appeals denied his petition for review.\nHeld:\u00a0In the context of statutory rape offenses that criminalize sexual intercourse based solely on the ages of the participants, the generic federal definition of \"sexual abuse of a minor\" requires the age of the victim to be less than 16.  Pp.\u00a02-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Under the categorical approach employed to determine whether an alien's conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony, the Court asks whether \"\u00a0'the state statute defining the crime of conviction' categorically fits within the 'generic' federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.\"  Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.\u00a0S. 184, 190.  Petitioner's state conviction is thus an \"aggravated felony\" only if the least of the acts criminalized by the state statute falls within the generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor.  Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133, 137.  Pp.\u00a02-3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The least of the acts criminalized by Cal. Penal Code \u00a7261.5(c) would be consensual sexual intercourse between a victim who is almost 18 and a perpetrator who just turned 21.  Regardless of the actual facts of the case, this Court presumes that petitioner's conviction was based on those acts.  Pp.\u00a03-4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0In the context of statutory rape offenses that criminalize sexual intercourse based solely on the ages of the participants, the generic federal definition of \"sexual abuse of a minor\" requires that the victim be younger than 16.  The Court begins, as always, with the text.  Pp.\u00a04-7.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0Congress added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA in 1996.  At that time, the ordinary meaning of \"sexual abuse\" included \"the engaging in sexual contact with a person who is below a specified age or who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity.\"  Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 454.  By providing that the abuse must be \"of a minor,\" the INA focuses on age, rather than mental or physical incapacity.  Accordingly, to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor, the statute of conviction must prohibit certain sexual acts based at least in part on the age of the victim.  Statutory rape laws, which are one example of this category of crimes, generally provide that an older person may not engage in sexual intercourse with a younger person under the \"age of consent.\"  Reliable dictionaries indicate that the \"generic\" age of consent in 1996 was 16, and it remains so today.  Pp.\u00a04-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The Government argues that sexual abuse of a minor includes any conduct that is illegal, involves sexual activity, and is directed at a person younger than 18.  For support, it points to the 1990 Black's Law Dictionary, which defined sexual abuse of a minor as \"[i]llegal sex acts performed against a minor by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance\" and defined \"[m]inor\" as \"[a]n infant or person who is under the age of legal competence,\" which in \"most states\" was \"18.\"  But the generic federal offense does not correspond to the Government's definition, for three reasons.  First, the Government's definition is inconsistent with its own dictionary's requirement that a special relationship of trust exist between the victim and offender.  Second, in the statutory rape context, \"of a minor\" refers to the age of consent, not the age of legal competence.  Third, the Government's definition turns the categorical approach on its head by defining the generic federal offense as whatever is illegal under the law of the State of conviction.  Pp.\u00a06-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d) The structure of the INA, a related federal statute, and evidence from state criminal codes confirm that, for a statutory rape offense based solely on the age of the participants to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor under the INA, the victim must be younger than 16.  The INA lists sexual abuse of a minor as an \"aggravated\" felony, \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), and lists it in the same subparagraph as \"murder\" and \"rape,\" \u00a71101(a)(43)(A), suggesting that it encompasses only especially egregious felonies.  A different statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72243, criminalizes \"[s]exual abuse of a minor or ward.\"  Section 2243 was amended to protect anyone under age 16 in the same omnibus law that added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA, suggesting that Congress understood that phrase to cover victims under (but not over) age 16.  Finally, a significant majority of state criminal codes set the age of consent at 16 for statutory rape offenses predicated exclusively on the age of the participants.  Pp.\u00a07-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0This Court does not decide whether the generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor requires a particular age differential between the victim and the perpetrator or whether it encompasses sexual intercourse involving victims over 16 that is abusive because of the nature of the relationship between the participants.

JEFFERSON B. SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[May 30, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 163, as amended, provides that \"[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony after admission\" to the United States may be removed from the country by the Attorney General.  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  One of the many crimes that constitutes an aggravated felony under the INA is \"sexual abuse of a minor.\"  \u00a71101(a)(43)(A).  A conviction for sexual abuse of a minor is an aggravated felony regardless of whether it is for a \"violation of Federal or State law.\"  \u00a71101(a)(43).  The INA does not expressly define sexual abuse of a minor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We must decide whether a conviction under a state statute criminalizing consensual sexual intercourse between a 21-year-old and a 17-year-old qualifies as sexual abuse of a minor under the INA.  We hold that it does not.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Juan Esquivel-Quintana is a native and citizen of Mexico.  He was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident in 2000.  In 2009, he pleaded no contest in the Superior Court of California to a statutory rape offense: \"unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator,\" Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7261.5(c) (West 2014); see also \u00a7261.5(a) (\"Unlawful sexual intercourse is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person who is not the spouse of the perpetrator, if the person is a minor\").  For purposes of that offense, California defines \"minor\" as \"a person under the age of 18 years.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against petitioner based on that conviction.  An Immigration Judge concluded that the conviction qualified as \"sexual abuse of a minor,\" 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(A), and ordered petitioner removed to Mexico.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (Board) dismissed his appeal.  26 I.\u00a0&\u00a0N. Dec. 469 (2015).  \"[F]or a statutory rape offense involving a 16- or 17-year-old victim\" to qualify as \"\u00a0'sexual abuse of a minor,'\u00a0\" it reasoned, \"the statute must require a meaningful age difference between the victim and the perpetrator.\"  Id., at 477.  In its view, the 3-year age difference required by Cal. Penal Code \u00a7261.5(c) was meaningful.  Id., at 477.  Accordingly, the Board concluded that petitioner's crime of conviction was an aggravated felony, making him removable under the INA.  Ibid.  A divided Court of Appeals denied Esquivel-Quintana's petition for review, deferring to the Board's interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor under Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837 (1984).  810 F.\u00a03d 1019 (CA6 2016); see also id., at 1027 (Sutton, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  We granted certiorari, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii) makes aliens removable based on the nature of their convictions, not based on their actual conduct.  See Mellouli v. Lynch, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7).  Accordingly, to determine whether an alien's conviction qualifies as an aggravated felony under that section, we \"employ a categorical approach by looking to the statute .\u00a0.\u00a0. of conviction, rather than to the specific facts underlying the crime.\"  Kawashima v. Holder, 565 U.\u00a0S. 478, 483 (2012); see, e.g., Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\u00a0S. 183, 186 (2007) (applying the categorical approach set forth in Taylor v. United States, 495 U.\u00a0S. 575 (1990), to the INA).  Under that approach, we ask whether \"\u00a0'the state statute defining the crime of conviction' categorically fits within the 'generic' federal definition of a corresponding aggravated felony.\"  Moncrieffe v. Holder, 569 U.\u00a0S. 184, 190 (2013) (quoting Duenas-Alvarez, supra, at 186).  In other words, we presume that the state conviction \"rested upon .\u00a0.\u00a0. the least of th[e] acts\" criminalized by the statute, and then we determine whether that conduct would fall within the federal definition of the crime.  Johnson v. United States, 559 U.\u00a0S. 133, 137 (2010); see also Moncrieffe, supra, at 191  (focusing \"on the minimum conduct criminalized by the state statute\").1  Petitioner's state conviction is thus an \"aggravated felony\" under the INA only if the least of the acts criminalized by the state statute falls within the generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Cal. Penal Code \u00a7261.5(c) criminalizes \"unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor who is more than three years younger than the perpetrator\" and defines a minor as someone under age 18, the conduct criminalized under this provision would be, at a minimum, consensual sexual intercourse between a victim who is almost 18 and a perpetrator who just turned 21.  Regardless of the actual facts of petitioner's crime, we must presume that his conviction was based on acts that were no more criminal than that.  If those acts do not constitute sexual abuse of a minor under the INA, then petitioner was not convicted of an aggravated felony and is not, on that basis, removable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner concedes that sexual abuse of a minor under the INA includes some statutory rape offenses.  But he argues that a statutory rape offense based solely on the partners' ages (like the one here) is \"\u00a0'abuse'\u00a0\" \"only when the younger partner is under 16.\"  Reply Brief 2.  Because the California statute criminalizes sexual intercourse when the victim is up to 17 years old, petitioner contends that it does not categorically qualify as sexual abuse of a minor.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We agree with petitioner that, in the context of statutory rape offenses that criminalize sexual intercourse based solely on the age of the participants, the generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor requires that the victim be younger than 16.  Because the California statute at issue in this case does not categorically fall within that definition, a conviction pursuant to it is not an aggravated felony under \u00a71101(a)(43)(A).  We begin, as always, with the text.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1101(a)(43)(A) does not expressly define sexual abuse of a minor, so we interpret that phrase using the normal tools of statutory interpretation.  \"Our analysis begins with the language of the statute.\"  Leocal v. Ashcroft, 543 U.\u00a0S. 1, 8 (2004); see also Lopez v. Gonzales, 549 U.\u00a0S. 47, 53 (2006) (\"The everyday understanding of\" the term used in \u00a71101 \"should count for a lot here, for the statutes in play do not define the term, and so remit us to regular usage to see what Congress probably meant\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA in 1996, as part of a comprehensive immigration reform act.  See Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, \u00a7321(a)(i), 110 Stat. 3009-627.  At that time, the ordinary meaning of \"sexual abuse\" included \"the engaging in sexual contact with a person who is below a specified age or who is incapable of giving consent because of age or mental or physical incapacity.\"  Merriam-Webster's Dictionary of Law 454 (1996).  By providing that the abuse must be \"of a minor,\" the INA focuses on age, rather than mental or physical incapacity.  Accordingly, to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor, the statute of conviction must prohibit certain sexual acts based at least in part on the age of the victim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statutory rape laws are one example of this category of crimes.  Those laws generally provide that an older person may not engage in sexual intercourse with a younger person under a specified age, known as the \"age of consent.\"  See id., at 20 (defining \"age of consent\" as \"the age at which a person is deemed competent by law to give consent esp. to sexual intercourse\" and cross-referencing \"statutory rape\").  Many laws also require an age differential between the two partners.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the age of consent for statutory rape purposes varies by jurisdiction, see infra, at 9, reliable dictionaries provide evidence that the \"generic\" age--in 1996 and today--is 16.  See B. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 38 (2d ed. 1995) (\"Age of consent, usu[ally] 16, denotes the age when one is legally capable of agreeing .\u00a0.\u00a0. to sexual intercourse\" and cross-referencing \"statutory rape\"); Black's Law Dictionary 73 (10th ed. 2014) (noting that the age of consent is \"usu[ally] defined by statute as 16 years\").\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relying on a different dictionary (and \"sparse\" legislative history), the Government suggests an alternative \"\u00a0'everyday understanding'\u00a0\" of \"sexual abuse of a minor.\"  Brief for Respondent 16-17 (citing Black's Law Dictionary 1375 (6th ed. 1990)).  Around the time sexual abuse of a minor was added to the INA's list of aggravated felonies, that dictionary defined \"[s]exual abuse\" as \"[i]llegal sex acts performed against a minor by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance,\" and defined \"[m]inor\" as \"[a]n infant or person who is under the age of legal competence,\" which in \"most states\" was \"18.\"  Id., at 997, 1375.  \"\u00a0'Sexual abuse of a minor,'\u00a0\" the Government accordingly contends, \"most naturally connotes conduct that (1) is illegal, (2) involves sexual activity, and (3) is directed at a person younger than 18 years old.\"  Brief for Respondent 17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are not persuaded that the generic federal offense corresponds to the Government's definition.  First, the Government's proposed definition is flatly inconsistent with the definition of sexual abuse contained in the very dictionary on which it relies; the Government's proposed definition does not require that the act be performed \"by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 1375 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis added).  In any event, as we explain below, offenses predicated on a special relationship of trust between the victim and offender are not at issue here and frequently have a different age requirement than the general age of consent.  Second, in the context of statutory rape, the prepositional phrase \"of a minor\" naturally refers not to the age of legal competence (when a person is legally capable of agreeing to a contract, for example), but to the age of consent (when a person is legally capable of agreeing to sexual intercourse).  Third, the Government's definition turns the categorical approach on its head by defining the generic federal offense of sexual abuse of a minor as whatever is illegal under the particular law of the State where the defendant was convicted.  Under the Government's preferred approach, there is no \"generic\" definition at all.  See Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 591 (requiring \"a clear indication that .\u00a0.\u00a0. Congress intended to abandon its general approach of using uniform categorical definitions to identify predicate offenses\"); id., at 592 (\"We think that 'burglary' in \u00a7924(e) must have some uniform definition independent of the labels employed by the various States' criminal codes\").\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The structure of the INA, a related federal statute, and evidence from state criminal codes confirm that, for a statutory rape offense to qualify as sexual abuse of a minor under the INA based solely on the age of the participants, the victim must be younger than 16.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Surrounding provisions of the INA guide our interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor.  See A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 167 (2012).  This offense is listed in the INA as an \"aggravated felony.\"  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii) (emphasis added).  \"An 'aggravated' offense is one 'made worse or more serious by circumstances such as violence, the presence of a deadly weapon, or the intent to commit another crime.'\u00a0\"  Carachuri-Rosendo v. Holder, 560 U.\u00a0S. 563, 574 (2010) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 75 (9th ed. 2009)).  Moreover, the INA lists sexual abuse of a minor in the same subparagraph as \"murder\" and \"rape,\" \u00a71101(a)(43)(A)--among the most heinous crimes it defines as aggravated felonies.  \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  The structure of the INA therefore suggests that sexual abuse of a minor encompasses only especially egregious felonies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A closely related federal statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72243, provides further evidence that the generic federal definition of sexual abuse of a minor incorporates an age of consent of 16, at least in the context of statutory rape offenses predicated solely on the age of the participants.  Cf. Leocal, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 12-13, n.\u00a09 (concluding that Congress' treatment of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a716 in an Act passed \"just nine months earlier\" provided \"stron[g] suppor[t]\" for our interpretation of \u00a716 as incorporated into the INA); Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U.\u00a0S. 224, 232 (2007).  Section 2243, which criminalizes \"[s]exual abuse of a minor or ward,\" contains the only definition of that phrase in the United States Code.  As originally enacted in 1986, \u00a72243 proscribed engaging in a \"sexual act\" with a person between the ages of 12 and 16 if the perpetrator was at least four years older than the victim.  In 1996, Congress expanded \u00a72243 to include victims who were younger than 12, thereby protecting anyone under the age of 16.  \u00a72243(a); see also \u00a72241(c).  Congress did this in the same omnibus law that added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA, which suggests that Congress understood that phrase to cover victims under age 16.2  See Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, \u00a7\u00a7121(7), 321,110 Stat. 3009-31, 3009-627.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner does not contend that the definition in \u00a72243(a) must be imported wholesale into the INA, Brief for Petitioner 17, and we do not do so.  One reason is that the INA does not cross-reference \u00a72243(a), whereas many other aggravated felonies in the INA are defined by cross-reference to other provisions of the United States Code, see, e.g., \u00a71101(a)(43)(H) (\"an offense described in section 875, 876, 877, or 1202 of Title 18 (relating to the demand for or receipt of ransom)\").  Another is that \u00a72243(a) requires a 4-year age difference between the perpetrator and the victim.  Combining that element with a 16-year age of consent would categorically exclude the statutory rape laws of most States.  See Brief for Respondent 34-35; cf. Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 594 (declining to \"constru[e] 'burglary' to mean common-law burglary,\" because that \"would come close to nullifying that term's effect in the statute,\" since \"few of the crimes now generally recognized as burglaries would fall within the common-law definition\").  Accordingly, we rely on \u00a72243(a) for evidence of the meaning of sexual abuse of a minor, but not as providing the complete or exclusive definition.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As in other cases where we have applied the categorical approach, we look to state criminal codes for additional evidence about the generic meaning of sexual abuse of a minor.  See Taylor, 495 U.\u00a0S., at 598 (interpreting \"\u00a0'burglary'\u00a0\" under the Armed Career Criminal Act of 1984 according to \"the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States\"); Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 190 (interpreting \"theft\" in the INA in the same manner).  When \"sexual abuse of a minor\" was added to the INA in 1996, thirty-one States and the District of Columbia set the age of consent at 16 for statutory rape offenses that hinged solely on the age of the participants.  As for the other States, one set the age of consent at 14; two set the age of consent at 15; six set the age of consent at 17; and the remaining ten, including California, set the age of consent at 18.  See Appendix, infra; cf. ALI, Model Penal Code \u00a7213.3(1)(a) (1980) (in the absence of a special relationship, setting the default age of consent at 16 for the crime of \"[c]orruption of [m]inors\").3  A significant majority of jurisdictions thus set the age of consent at 16 for statutory rape offenses predicated exclusively on the age of the participants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many jurisdictions set a different age of consent for offenses that include an element apart from the age of the participants, such as offenses that focus on whether the perpetrator is in some special relationship of trust with the victim.  That was true in the two States that had offenses labeled \"sexual abuse of a minor\" in 1996.  See Alaska Stat. \u00a711.41.438 (1996) (age of consent for third-degree \"sexual abuse of a minor\" was 16 generally but 18 where \"the offender occupie[d] a position of authority in relation to the victim\"); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17-A, \u00a7254(1) (1983), as amended by 1995 Me. Laws p. 123 (age of consent for \"[s]exual abuse of minors\" was 16 generally but 18 where the victim was \"a student\" and the offender was \"a teacher, employee or other official in the .\u00a0.\u00a0. school .\u00a0.\u00a0. in which the student [was] enrolled\").  And that is true in four of the five jurisdictions that have offenses titled \"sexual abuse of a minor\" today.  Compare, e.g., D.\u00a0C. Code \u00a7\u00a722-3001 (2012), 22-3008 (2016 Cum. Supp.) (age of consent is 16 in the absence of a significant relationship) with \u00a722-3009.01 (age of consent is 18 where the offender \"is in a significant relationship\" with the victim); see also Brief for Respondent 31 (listing statutes with that title).  Accordingly, the generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor may include a different age of consent where the perpetrator and victim are in a significant relationship of trust.  As relevant to this case, however, the general consensus from state criminal codes points to the same generic definition as dictionaries and federal law: Where sexual intercourse is abusive solely because of the ages of the participants, the victim must be younger than 16.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The laws of many States and of the Federal Government include a minimum age differential (in addition to an age of consent) in defining statutory rape.  We need not and do not decide whether the generic crime of sexual abuse of a minor under 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(A) includes an additional element of that kind.  Petitioner has \"show[n] something special about California's version of the doctrine\"--that the age of consent is 18, rather than 16--and needs no more to prevail.  Duenas-Alvarez, supra, at 191.  Absent some special relationship of trust, consensual sexual conduct involving a younger partner who is at least 16 years of age does not qualify as sexual abuse of a minor under the INA, regardless of the age differential between the two participants.  We leave for another day whether the generic offense requires a particular age differential between the victim and the perpetrator, and whether the generic offense encompasses sexual intercourse involving victims over the age of 16 that is abusive because of the nature of the relationship between the participants.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, petitioner and the Government debate whether the Board's interpretation of sexual abuse of a minor is entitled to deference under Chevron, 467 U.\u00a0S. 837.  Petitioner argues that any ambiguity in the meaning of this phrase must be resolved in favor of the alien under the rule of lenity.  See Brief for Petitioner 41-45.  The Government responds that ambiguities should be resolved by deferring to the Board's interpretation.  See Brief for Respondent 45-53.  We have no need to resolve whether the rule of lenity or Chevron receives priority in this case because the statute, read in context, unambiguously forecloses the Board's interpretation.  Therefore, neither the rule of lenity nor Chevron applies.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that in the context of statutory rape offenses focused solely on the age of the participants, the generic federal definition of \"sexual abuse of a minor\" under \u00a71101(a)(43)(A) requires the age of the victim to be less than 16.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\nAPPENDIX \nThese tables list offenses criminalizing sexual intercourse solely because of the age of the participants.  The tables are organized according to the statutory age of consent as of September 30, 1996--the date \"sexual abuse of a minor\" was added to the INA.\n14 Years\n15 Years\n16 Years\n17 Years\n18 Years\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Where a state statute contains several different crimes that are described separately, we employ what is known as the \"modified categorical approach.\"  See Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, 549 U.\u00a0S. 183, 187 (2007) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under that approach, which is not at issue here, the court may review the charging documents, jury instructions, plea agreement, plea colloquy, and similar sources to determine the actual crime of which the alien was convicted.  See ibid.\nFootnote 2\u00a0To eliminate a redundancy, Congress later amended \u00a72243(a) to revert to the pre-1996 language.  See Protection of Children From Sexual Predators Act of 1998, \u00a7301(b), 112 Stat. 2979.  That amendment does not change Congress' understanding in 1996, when it added sexual abuse of a minor to the INA.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The Government notes that this sort of multijurisdictional analysis can \"be useful insofar as it helps shed light on the 'common understanding and meaning' of the federal provision being interpreted,\" but that it is not required by the categorical approach.  Brief for Respondent 23-25 (quoting Perrin v. United States, 444 U.\u00a0S. 37, 45 (1979)).  We agree.  In this case, state criminal codes aid our interpretation of \"sexual abuse of a minor\" by offering useful context.\n\n\n","24":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nEXPRESSIONS HAIR DESIGN ET AL. v. SCHNEIDERMAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-1391\nArgued: January 10, 2017Decided: March 29, 2017\n\n\nNew York General Business Law \u00a7518 provides that \"[n]o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.\"  Petitioners, five New York businesses and their owners who wish to impose surcharges for credit card use, filed suit against state officials, arguing that the law violates the First Amendment by regulating how they communicate their prices, and that it is unconstitutionally vague.  The District Court ruled in favor of the merchants, but the Court of Appeals vacated the judgment with instructions to dismiss.  The Court of Appeals concluded that in the context of single-sticker pricing--where merchants post one price and would like to charge more to customers who pay by credit card--the law required that the sticker price be the same as the price charged to credit card users.  In that context, the law regulated a relationship between two prices.  Relying on this Court's precedent holding that price regulation alone regulates conduct, not speech, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7518 did not violate the First Amendment.  The Court of Appeals abstained from reaching the merits of the constitutional challenge to pricing practices outside the single-sticker context.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0This Court's review is limited to whether \u00a7518 is unconstitutional as applied to the particular pricing scheme that, before this Court, petitioners have argued they seek to employ: a single-sticker regime, in which merchants post a cash price and an additional credit card surcharge.  Pp.\u00a05-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Section 518 prohibits the pricing regime petitioners wish to employ.  Section 518 does not define \"surcharge.\"  Relying on the term's ordinary meaning, the Court of Appeals concluded that a merchant imposes a surcharge when he posts a single sticker price and charges a credit card user more than that sticker price.  This Court \"generally accord[s] great deference to the interpretation and application of state law by the courts of appeals.\"  Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.\u00a0S. 469, 484, n.\u00a013.  Because the interpretation of the Court of Appeals is not \"clearly wrong,\" Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.\u00a0S. 491, 500, n.\u00a09, this Court follows that interpretation.  Pp.\u00a06-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Section 518 regulates speech.  The Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7518 posed no First Amendment problem because price controls regulate conduct, not speech.  Section 518, however, is not like a typical price regulation, which simply regulates the amount a store can collect.  The law tells merchants nothing about the amount they are allowed to collect from a cash or credit card payer.  Instead, it regulates how sellers may communicate their prices.  In regulating the communication of prices rather than prices themselves, \u00a7518 regulates speech.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the Court of Appeals concluded otherwise, it did not determine whether \u00a7518 survives First Amendment scrutiny.  On remand the Court of Appeals should analyze \u00a7518 as a speech regulation.  Pp.\u00a08-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0Section 518 is not vague as applied to petitioners.  As explained, \u00a7518 bans the single-sticker pricing petitioners argue they wish to employ, and \"a plaintiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a successful vagueness claim,\" Holder v.

SCHNEIDERMAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[March 29, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Each time a customer pays for an item with a credit card, the merchant selling that item must pay a transaction fee to the credit card issuer.  Some merchants balk at paying the fees and want to discourage the use of credit cards, or at least pass on the fees to customers who use them.  One method of achieving those ends is through differential pricing--charging credit card users more than customers using cash.  Merchants who wish to employ differential pricing may do so in two ways relevant here: impose a surcharge for the use of a credit card, or offer a discount for the use of cash.  In N.\u00a0Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7518, New York has banned the former practice.  The question presented is whether \u00a7518 regulates merchants' speech and--if so--whether the statute violates the First Amendment.  We conclude that \u00a7518 does regulate speech and remand for the Court of Appeals to determine in the first instance whether that regulation is unconstitutional.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When credit cards were first introduced, contracts between card issuers and merchants barred merchants from charging credit card users higher prices than cash customers.  Congress put a partial stop to this practice in the 1974 amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).  The amendments prohibited card issuers from contractually preventing merchants from giving discounts to customers who paid in cash.  See \u00a7306, 88 Stat. 1515.  The law, however, said nothing about surcharges for the use of credit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two years later, Congress refined its dissimilar treatment of discounts and surcharges.  First, the 1976 version of TILA barred merchants from imposing surcharges on customers who use credit cards.  Act of Feb. 27, 1976, \u00a73(c)(1), 90 Stat. 197.  Second, Congress added definitions of the two terms.  A discount was \"a reduction made from the regular price,\" while a surcharge was \"any means of increasing the regular price to a cardholder which is not imposed upon customers paying by cash, check, or similar means.\"  \u00a73(a), ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1981, Congress further delineated the distinction between discounts and surcharges by defining \"regular price.\"  Where a merchant \"tagged or posted\" a single price, the regular price was that single price.  Cash Discount Act, \u00a7102(a), 95 Stat. 144.  If no price was tagged or posted, or if a merchant employed a two-tag approach--posting one price for credit and another for cash--the regular price was whatever was charged to credit card users.  Ibid.  Because a surcharge was defined as an increase from the regular price, there could be no credit card surcharge where the regular price was the same as the amount charged to customers using credit cards.  The effect of all this was that a merchant could violate the surcharge ban only by posting a single price and charging credit card users more than that posted price.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The federal surcharge ban was short lived.  Congress allowed it to expire in 1984 and has not renewed the ban since.  See \u00a7201, ibid.  The provision preventing credit card issuers from contractually barring discounts for cash, however, remained in place.  With the lapse of the federal surcharge ban, several States, New York among them, immediately enacted their own surcharge bans.  Passed in 1984, N.\u00a0Y. Gen. Bus. Law \u00a7518 adopted the operative language of the federal ban verbatim, providing that \"[n]o seller in any sales transaction may impose a surcharge on a holder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.\"  N.\u00a0Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ann. \u00a7518 (West 2012); see also 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71666f(a)(2) (1982 ed.).  Unlike the federal ban, the New York legislation included no definition of \"surcharge.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to these state legislative bans, credit card companies--though barred from prohibiting discounts for cash--included provisions in their contracts prohibiting merchants from imposing surcharges for credit card use.  For most of its history, the New York law was essentially coextensive with these contractual prohibitions.  In recent years, however, merchants have brought antitrust challenges to contractual no-surcharge provisions.  Those suits have created uncertainty about the legal validity of such contractual surcharge bans.  The result is that otherwise redundant legislative surcharge bans like \u00a7518 have increasingly gained importance, and increasingly come under scrutiny.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners, five New York businesses and their owners, wish to impose surcharges on customers who use credit cards.  Each time one of their customers pays with a credit card, these merchants must pay some transaction fee to the company that issued the credit card.  The fee is generally two to three percent of the purchase price.  Those fees add up, and the merchants allege that they pay tens of thousands of dollars every year to credit card companies.  Rather than increase prices across the board to absorb those costs, the merchants want to pass the fees along only to their customers who choose to use credit cards.  They also want to make clear that they are not the bad guys--that the credit card companies, not the merchants, are responsible for the higher prices.  The merchants believe that surcharges for credit are more effective than discounts for cash in accomplishing these goals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2013, after several major credit card issuers agreed to drop their contractual surcharge prohibitions, the merchants filed suit against the New York Attorney General and three New York District Attorneys to challenge \u00a7518--the only remaining obstacle to their charging surcharges for credit card use.  As relevant here, they argued that the law violated the First Amendment by regulating how they communicated their prices, and that it was unconstitutionally vague because liability under the law \"turn[ed] on the blurry difference\" between surcharges and discounts.  App. 39, Complaint \u00b651.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court ruled in favor of the merchants.  It read the statute as \"draw[ing a] line between prohibited 'surcharges' and permissible 'discounts' based on words and labels, rather than economic realities.\"  975 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 430, 444 (SDNY 2013).  The court concluded that the law therefore regulated speech, and violated the First Amendment under this Court's commercial speech doctrine.  In addition, because the law turned on the \"virtually incomprehensible distinction between what a vendor can and cannot tell its customers,\" the District Court found that the law was unconstitutionally vague.  Id., at 436.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the judgment of the District Court with instructions to dismiss the merchants' claims.  It began by considering single-sticker pricing, where merchants post one price and would like to charge more to customers who pay by credit card.  All the law did in this context, the Court of Appeals explained, was regulate a relationship between two prices--the sticker price and the price charged to a credit card user--by requiring that the two prices be equal.  Relying on our precedent holding that price regulation alone regulates conduct, not speech, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7518 did not violate the First Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court also considered other types of pricing regimes--for example, posting separate cash and credit prices.  The Court of Appeals thought it \"far from clear\" that \u00a7518 prohibited such pricing schemes.  808 F.\u00a03d 118, 137 (CA2 2015).  The federal surcharge ban on which \u00a7518 was modeled did not apply outside the single-sticker context, and the merchants had not clearly shown that \u00a7518 had a \"broader reach\" than the federal law.  Ibid.  Deciding that petitioners' challenge in this regard \"turn[ed] on an unsettled question of state law,\" the Court of Appeals abstained from reaching the merits of the constitutional question beyond the single-sticker context.  Id., at 135 (citing Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.\u00a0S. 496 (1941)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a preliminary matter, we note that petitioners present us with a limited challenge.  Observing that the merchants were not always particularly clear about the scope of their suit, the Court of Appeals deemed them to be bringing a facial attack on \u00a7518 as well as a challenge to the application of the statute to two particular pricing regimes: single-sticker pricing and two-sticker pricing.  Before us, however, the merchants have disclaimed a facial challenge, assuring us that theirs is an as-applied challenge only.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5, 18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There remains the question of what precise application of the law they seek to challenge.  Although the merchants have presented a wide array of hypothetical pricing regimes, they have expressly identified only one pricing scheme that they seek to employ: posting a cash price and an additional credit card surcharge, expressed either as a percentage surcharge or a \"dollars-and-cents\" additional amount.  See, e.g., App. 101-102, 104; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5, 18.  Under this pricing approach, petitioner Expressions Hair Design might, for example, post a sign outside its salon reading \"Haircuts $10 (we add a 3% surcharge if you pay by credit card).\"  Or, petitioner Brooklyn Farmacy & Soda Fountain might list one of the sundaes on its menu as costing \"$10 (with a $0.30 surcharge for credit card users).\"  We take petitioners at their word and limit our review to the question whether \u00a7518 is unconstitutional as applied to this particular pricing practice.1\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next question is whether \u00a7518 prohibits the pricing regime petitioners wish to employ.  The Court of Appeals concluded that it does.  The court read \"surcharge\" in \u00a7518 to mean \"an additional amount above the seller's regular price,\" and found it \"basically self-evident\" how \u00a7518 applies to sellers who post a single sticker price: \"the sticker price is the 'regular' price, so sellers may not charge credit-card customers an additional amount above the sticker price that is not also charged to cash customers.\"  808 F.\u00a03d, at 128.  Under this interpretation, signs of the kind that the merchants wish to post--\"$10, with a $0.30 surcharge for credit card users\"--violate \u00a7518 because they identify one sticker price--$10--and indicate that credit card users are charged more than that amount.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"We generally accord great deference to the interpretation and application of state law by the courts of appeals.\"  Pembaur v. Cincinnati, 475 U.\u00a0S. 469, 484, n.\u00a013 (1986).  This deference is warranted to \"render unnecessary review of their decisions in this respect\" and because lower federal courts \"are better schooled in and more able to interpret the laws of their respective States.\"  Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.\u00a0S. 491, 500 (1985) (quoting Cort v. Ash, 422 U.\u00a0S. 66, 73, n.\u00a06 (1975); internal quotation marks omitted).  \"[W]e surely have the authority to differ with the lower federal courts as to the meaning of a state statute,\" and have done so in instances where the lower court's construction was \"clearly wrong\" or \"plain error.\"  472 U.\u00a0S., at 500, and n.\u00a09 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that is not the case here.  Section 518 does not define \"surcharge,\" but the Court of Appeals looked to the ordinary meaning of the term: \"a charge in excess of the usual or normal amount.\"  808 F. 3d, at 127 (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2299 (2002); internal quotation marks omitted).  Where a seller posts a single sticker price, it is reasonable to treat that sticker price as the \"usual or normal amount\" and conclude, as the court below did, that a merchant imposes a surcharge when he charges a credit card user more than that sticker price.  In short, we cannot dismiss the Court of Appeals' interpretation of \u00a7518 as \"clearly wrong.\"  Accordingly, consistent with our customary practice, we follow that interpretation.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having concluded that \u00a7518 bars the pricing regime petitioners wish to employ, we turn to their constitutional arguments: that the law unconstitutionally regulates speech and is impermissibly vague.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7518 posed no First Amendment problem because the law regulated conduct, not speech.2  In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals began with the premise that price controls regulate conduct alone.  See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.\u00a0S. 484, 507 (1996) (plurality opinion); id., at 524 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 530 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  Section 518 regulates the relationship between \"(1) the seller's sticker price and (2) the price the seller charges to credit card customers,\" requiring that these two amounts be equal.  808 F.\u00a03d, at 131.  A law regulating the relationship between two prices regulates speech no more than a law regulating a single price.  The Court of Appeals concluded that \u00a7518 was therefore simply a conduct regulation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But \u00a7518 is not like a typical price regulation.  Such a regulation--for example, a law requiring all New York delis to charge $10 for their sandwiches--would simply regulate the amount that a store could collect.  In other words, it would regulate the sandwich seller's conduct.  To be sure, in order to actually collect that money, a store would likely have to put \"$10\" on its menus or have its employees tell customers that price.  Those written or oral communications would be speech, and the law--by determining the amount charged--would indirectly dictate the content of that speech.  But the law's effect on speech would be only incidental to its primary effect on conduct, and \"it has never been deemed an abridgment of freedom of speech or press to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken, written, or printed.\"  Rumsfeld v. Forum for Aca- demic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.\u00a0S. 47, 62 (2006) (quoting Giboney v. Empire Storage & Ice Co., 336 U.\u00a0S. 490, 502 (1949); internal quotation marks omitted); see also Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.\u00a0S. 552, 567 (2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 518 is different.  The law tells merchants nothing about the amount they are allowed to collect from a cash or credit card payer.  Sellers are free to charge $10 for cash and $9.70, $10, $10.30, or any other amount for credit.  What the law does regulate is how sellers may communicate their prices.  A merchant who wants to charge $10 for cash and $10.30 for credit may not convey that price any way he pleases.  He is not free to say \"$10, with a 3% credit card surcharge\" or \"$10, plus $0.30 for credit\" because both of those displays identify a single sticker price--$10--that is less than the amount credit card users will be charged.  Instead, if the merchant wishes to post a single sticker price, he must display $10.30 as his sticker price.  Accordingly, while we agree with the Court of Appeals that \u00a7518 regulates a relationship between a sticker price and the price charged to credit card users, we cannot accept its conclusion that \u00a7518 is nothing more than a mine-run price regulation.  In regulating the communication of prices rather than prices themselves, \u00a7518 regulates speech.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because it concluded otherwise, the Court of Appeals had no occasion to conduct a further inquiry into whether \u00a7518, as a speech regulation, survived First Amendment scrutiny.  On that question, the parties dispute whether \u00a7518 is a valid commercial speech regulation under Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.\u00a0Y., 447 U.\u00a0S. 557 (1980), and whether the law can be upheld as a valid disclosure requirement under Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.\u00a0S. 626 (1985).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[W]e are a court of review, not of first view.\"  Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 14) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Accordingly, we decline to consider those questions in the first instance.  Instead, we remand for the Court of Appeals to analyze \u00a7518 as a speech regulation.3\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the way the merchants have presented their case, their vagueness challenge gives us little pause.  Before this Court, the only pricing practice they express an interest in employing is a single-sticker regime, listing one price and a separate surcharge amount.  As we have explained, \u00a7518 bars them from doing so.  \"[A] plaintiff whose speech is clearly proscribed cannot raise a successful vagueness claim.\"  Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.\u00a0S. 1, 20 (2010).  Although the merchants argue that \"no one can seem to put a finger on just how far the law sweeps,\" Brief for Petitioners 51, it is at least clear that \u00a7518 proscribes their intended speech.  Accordingly, the law is not vague as applied to them.4\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nBreyer, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1391\nEXPRESSIONS HAIR DESIGN, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. ERIC T. SCHNEIDERMAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[March 29, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that New York's statute regulates speech.  But that is because virtually all government regulation affects speech.  Human relations take place through speech.  And human relations include community activities of all kinds--commercial and otherwise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the government seeks to regulate those activities, it is often wiser not to try to distinguish between \"speech\" and \"conduct.\"  See R. Post, Democracy, Expertise, and Academic Freedom 3-4 (2012).  Instead, we can, and normally do, simply ask whether, or how, a challenged statute, rule, or regulation affects an interest that the First Amendment protects.  If, for example, a challenged government regulation negatively affects the processes through which political discourse or public opinion is formed or expressed (interests close to the First Amendment's protective core), courts normally scrutinize that regulation with great care.  See, e.g., Boos v. Barry, 485 U.\u00a0S. 312, 321 (1988).  If the challenged regulation restricts the \"informational function\" provided by truthful commercial speech, courts will apply a \"lesser\" (but still elevated) form of scrutiny.  Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.\u00a0Y., 447 U.\u00a0S. 557, 563-564 (1980).  If, however, a challenged regulation simply requires a commercial speaker to disclose \"purely factual and uncontroversial information,\" courts will apply a more permissive standard of review.  Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.\u00a0S. 626, 651 (1985).  Because that kind of regulation normally has only a \"minimal\" effect on First Amendment interests, it normally need only be \"reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.\"  Ibid.  Courts apply a similarly permissive standard of review to \"regulatory legislation affecting ordinary commercial transactions.\"  United States v. Carolene Products Co., 304 U.\u00a0S. 144, 152 (1938).  Since that legislation normally does not significantly affect the interests that the First Amendment protects, we normally look only for assurance that the legislation \"rests upon some rational basis.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I repeat these well-known general standards or judicial approaches both because I believe that determining the proper approach is typically more important than trying to distinguish \"speech\" from \"conduct,\" see Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.\u00a0S. 552, 582 (2011) (Breyer, J., dissenting), and because the parties here differ as to which approach applies.  That difference reflects the fact that it is not clear just what New York's law does.  On its face, the law seems simply to tell merchants that they cannot charge higher prices to credit-card users.  If so, then it is an ordinary piece of commercial legislation subject to \"rational basis\" review.  See 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.\u00a0S. 484, 507 (1996) (opinion of Stevens, J.).  It may, however, make more sense to interpret the statute as working like the expired federal law that it replaced.  If so, it would require a merchant, who posts prices and who wants to charge a higher credit-card price, simply to disclose that credit-card price.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71602(q\u00a0), (x), 1666f(a)(2) (1982 ed.); see also post, at 9 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment).  In that case, though affecting the merchant's \"speech,\" it would not hinder the transmission of information to the public; the merchant would remain free to say whatever it wanted so long as it also revealed its credit-card price to customers.  Accordingly, the law would still receive a deferential form of review.  See Zauderer, supra, at 651.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, petitioners suggest that the statute does more.  See, e.g., Brief for Petitioners 28 (arguing that the statute forbids \"[f\u00a0]raming the price difference .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a credit surcharge\").  Because the statute's operation is unclear and because its interpretation is a matter of state law, I agree with the majority that we should remand the case to the Second Circuit.  I also agree with Justice Sotomayor that on remand, it may well be helpful for the Second Circuit to ask the New York Court of Appeals to clarify the nature of the obligations the statute imposes.  See N.\u00a0Y. Comp.

SCHNEIDERMAN, ATTORNEY GENERAL OF NEW YORK, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[March 29, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Alito joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court addresses only one part of one half of petitioners' First Amendment challenge to the New York statute at issue here.  This quarter-loaf outcome is worse than none.  I would vacate the judgment below and remand with directions to certify the case to the New York Court of Appeals for a definitive interpretation of the statute that would permit the full resolution of petitioners' claims.  I thus concur only in the judgment.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York prohibits its merchants from \"impos[ing] a surcharge on a [customer] who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.\"  N. Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ann. \u00a7518 (West 2012).  A merchant who violates this prohibition commits a misdemeanor and risks \"a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars or a term of imprisonment up to one year, or both.\"  Ibid.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 518 can be interpreted in several ways.  On first read, its prohibition on \"impos[ing] a surcharge\" on credit card customers appears to prohibit charging customers who pay with a credit card more than those who pay by other means.  See Black's Law Dictionary 1579 (9th ed. 2009) (\"surcharge\" means \"[a]n additional tax, charge, or cost\").  That is, \u00a7518 may require a merchant to charge all customers the same price, no matter the form of payment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An earlier federal law containing an almost identical prohibition muddies the path to this plain text reading.  A 1976 amendment to the Truth in Lending Act set out a temporary prohibition barring a \"seller in any sales transaction\" from \"impos[ing] a surcharge on a cardholder who elects to use a credit card in lieu of payment by cash, check, or similar means.\"  \u00a73(c)(1), 90 Stat. 197.  The amendment also defined a \"surcharge\" as \"any means of increasing the regular price to a cardholder which is not imposed upon customers paying by cash, check, or similar means.\"  \u00a73(a), ibid.  \"[R]egular price\" was later defined to mean the displayed price if a merchant displayed only one price or the credit card price if the merchant either did not display prices or displayed both cash and credit card prices.  \u00a7102(a), 95 Stat. 144.  Under that definition, a merchant violated the federal prohibition on \"impos[ing] a surcharge\" by displaying in dollars-and-cents form only one price--the cash price--and then charging credit card customers a higher price.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the federal law lapsed in 1984, New York enacted \u00a7518, which sets out the same ban on \"impos[ing] a surcharge.\"  New York borrowed the federal prohibition almost verbatim.  But it chose, without explanation, not to borrow the federal definitions or to enact clarifying definitions of its own.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The difference between the laws leaves \u00a7518 open to at least three interpretations.  It could be read in line with its plain text to require that a merchant charge the same price to all his customers.  It could be read in line with the lapsed federal ban to permit a merchant to charge different prices to cash and credit card customers but to prohibit a merchant from displaying in dollars-and-cents form only the cash price and then charging credit card customers a higher price.  On this reading, \u00a7518 would not apply where a merchant displays in dollars-and-cents form only the credit card price and then charges a lower price to cash customers, or where a merchant displays both the cash and credit card prices in dollars-and-cents form.  Or it could be read more broadly, based on the omission of the definitions that had limited the federal ban's scope.  On this reading, \u00a7518 might prohibit a merchant from characterizing the difference between the cash and credit card prices as a \"surcharge,\" no matter how he displays his prices.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Confirming the elusive nature of \u00a7518, New York has pressed almost all of these interpretations during this litigation.  Before the District Court, it viewed \u00a7518 as mirroring the lapsed federal ban.  See 975 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 430, 442 (SDNY 2013).  Before the Second Circuit, it offered the lapsed federal ban as a narrowing interpretation, thus suggesting that \u00a7518 applies more broadly than that provision.  See 808 F.\u00a03d 118, 140, n.\u00a013 (2015).  And before this Court, it explained that other prosecutorial entities in New York are not bound by its interpretation of \u00a7518 (or the interpretations of the state district attorneys who are parties to this case), leaving open the possibility of still other interpretations.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40.3\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners here are five New York merchants.  When a customer pays with a credit card, petitioners (like all merchants) are charged a processing fee by the card issuer.  Petitioners want to pass that fee on to their credit card paying customers, but not their cash paying customers.  They want to charge cash customers one price and credit card customers a higher price that includes the processing fee.  One petitioner, Expressions Hair Design, currently does pass the costs of credit card processing fees on to its credit card paying customers.  The other four charge one price to all customers.  They set their prices to account for the processing fees they predict they will incur.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All five would prefer to use a different pricing system or display than the ones they use now.  Expressions Hair Design and Five Points Academy would like to charge cash and credit card customers two different prices and to display a dollars-and-cents cash price alongside the extra charge for credit card customers--say, \"$100 with a 3% credit card charge\" or \"$100 with a $3 credit card charge.\"  Brooklyn Farmacy & Soda Fountain, Brite Buy Wines & Spirits, and Patio.com want to charge cash and credit card customers two different prices and to characterize the difference in prices as a \"surcharge\" when they display or convey their prices to customers.  App. 47-48, 51, 57.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All five do not use their preferred pricing systems or displays for fear of violating \u00a7518.  Expressions Hair Design and Five Points Academy believe \u00a7518 prohibits their pricing display because it would convey the credit card processing costs impermissibly as a surcharge, rather than permissibly as a discount--say, \"$103 with a 3% discount for cash payment\" or \"$103 with a $3 discount for cash payment.\"  The other three petitioners believe that \u00a7518 regulates how they can describe the difference between cash and credit card prices.  Because \u00a7518 does not, in their view, clearly state just how it regulates those descriptions, they have decided that the uncertainty counsels against a change.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners view \u00a7518 as an unconstitutional restriction on their ability to display and describe their prices to their customers.  And so they sued and challenged the law on First Amendment grounds.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Resolving petitioners' challenge to \u00a7518 requires an accurate picture of how, exactly, the statute works.  That understanding is needed both to decide whether \u00a7518 prohibits petitioners' preferred pricing systems and displays and, if so, whether that prohibition is consistent with the First Amendment.  See 808 F.\u00a03d, at 141; ante, at 10, n.\u00a03.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the Second Circuit did not decide just how far \u00a7518 extends.  It instead decided how \u00a7518 applies to part of the petitioners' challenge--the pricing display Expressions Hair Design and Five Points Academy wish to use--and declined to decide how, or even if, \u00a7518 applies to the rest of the challenge.  While \u00a7518 evades easy interpretation, a partial decision was neither required nor right.  The court below erred by not asking the New York Court of Appeals for a definitive interpretation of \u00a7518, and this Court errs by not correcting it.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given a constitutional challenge that turned on the interpretation of an ambiguous state statute not yet definitively interpreted by the state courts, the Second Circuit faced a problem.  Any interpretation it gave \u00a7518 would not be authoritative since state courts, not federal courts, have the final word on the interpretation of state statutes.  But it had before it two routes--abstention and certification--to a solution.  Both would have allowed it to secure an authoritative interpretation of \u00a7518 before resolving the constitutional challenge.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this context, abstention and certification serve the same goals.  Both recognize that when the outcome of a constitutional challenge turns on the proper interpretation of state law, a federal court's resolution of the constitutional question may turn out to be unnecessary.  The state courts could later interpret the state statute differently.  And the state court's different interpretation might result in a statute that implicates no constitutional question, or that renders the federal court's constitutional analysis irrelevant.  See, e.g., Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.\u00a0S. 43, 79 (1997); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.\u00a0S. 491, 507-509 (1985) (O'Connor, J., concurring).  Abstention and certification avoid this risk by deferring a federal court's decision on the constitutionality of the state statute until a state court has authoritatively resolved the antecedent state-law question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Abstention is a blunt instrument. Under Railroad Comm'n of Tex. v. Pullman Co., 312 U.\u00a0S. 496 (1941), a federal court's decision to abstain sends the plaintiff to state court.  Once the plaintiff obtains the state courts' views on the statute, he may return to federal court, state- court decision in hand, for resolution of the constitutional question.  Pullman abstention thus \"entail[s] a full round of litigation in the state court system before any resumption of proceedings in federal court.\"  Arizonans for Official English, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 76.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Certification offers a more precise tool.  In States that have authorized certification, a federal court may \"put the [state-law] question directly to the State's highest court, reducing the delay, cutting the cost, and increasing the assurance of gaining an authoritative response.\"  Ibid.  The rule relevant here is typical of certification statutes.  New York allows a federal court of appeals to certify \"determinative questions of New York law .\u00a0.\u00a0. involved in a case pending before that court for which no controlling precedent of the Court of Appeals exists .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the [New York] Court of Appeals.\"  N.\u00a0Y. Comp. Code, Rules & Regs., tit. 22, Rule 500.27(a) (2016).4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the decision to certify \"rests in the sound discretion of the federal court,\" Lehman Brothers v. Schein, 416 U.\u00a0S. 386, 391 (1974), this Court has repeatedly emphasized that certification offers clear advantages over abstention.  \"[M]ere difficulty in ascertaining local law is no excuse for\" abstaining and \"remitting the parties to a state tribunal for the start of another lawsuit.\"  Id., at 390.  Keeping the case, waiting for an answer on the certified question, and then fully resolving the issues \"in the long run save[s] time, energy, and resources and helps build a cooperative judicial federalism.\"  Id., at 391.  As a result, \"the availability of certification greatly simplifies the analysis\" of whether to abstain.  Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.\u00a0S. 132, 151 (1976); see also Arizonans for Official English, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 75 (\"Certification today covers territory once dominated by a deferral device called Pullman abstention\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And this Court has described abstention as particularly problematic where, as here, a challenge to a state statute rests on the First Amendment.  Cf. Virginia v. American Booksellers Assn., Inc., 484 U.\u00a0S. 383, 396 (1988) (\"Certification, in contrast to the more cumbersome and (in this context) problematic abstention doctrine, is a method by which we may expeditiously obtain that construction\"); Houston v. Hill, 482 U.\u00a0S. 451, 467-468 (1987).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court below chose a convoluted course: It rejected certification, abstained in part, and decided the question in part.  It did so by dividing petitioners' challenge into two parts.  As to the first part, it held that \u00a7518 did prohibit the pricing display that Expressions Hair Design and Five Points Academy prefer: displaying the cash price alongside the credit card charge.5  It found this application of \u00a7518 consistent with the First Amendment.  See 808 F.\u00a03d, at 130.  As to the second part, it declined to address whether \u00a7518 speaks to, or unconstitutionally restricts, how petitioners who wish to display both the cash and credit card prices in dollars-and-cents form can describe the difference between those prices.  See id., at 136.  It doubted whether \u00a7518 did reach that broadly and assumed that, even if it did, the New York state courts would construe the statute more narrowly--in line with the lapsed federal provision.  And so the court declined to certify the question and chose instead to abstain from deciding this part of petitioners' challenge.  See id., at 137-139.  It did so even though New York, responsible for enforcing \u00a7518, had \"never quite abandon[ed]\" its position that \u00a7518 might reach more broadly than the lapsed federal provision.  Id., at 140, n.\u00a013.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Second Circuit should have exercised its discretion to certify the antecedent state-law question here: What pricing schemes or pricing displays does \u00a7518 prohibit?  Certification might have avoided the need for a constitutional ruling altogether.  If the state court reads \u00a7518 only as a price regulation, no constitutional concerns are implicated.  Compare 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.\u00a0S. 484, 507 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\"direct regulation\" of prices does \"not involve any restriction on speech\"), with Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, Inc., 425 U.\u00a0S. 748, 761 (1976) (price advertisements contain protected speech because they convey a merchant's \"\u00a0'idea'\u00a0\" that \"\u00a0'I will sell you the X prescription drug at the Y price'\u00a0\").  Or certification might have limited the scope of the constitutional challenge in the case.  If the state court reads \u00a7518 to mirror the lapsed federal ban, that would eliminate the need for a constitutional ruling on the second part of petitioners' challenge (premised on a reading of \u00a7518 that prohibits more than the lapsed federal ban).  At the very least, certification would have allowed the court to resolve petitioners' entire challenge in one go.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Second Circuit declined to exercise its discretion to certify because it viewed the \"state of the record\" as too underdeveloped.  808 F. 3d, at 141.  It thought that the New York Court of Appeals could not interpret \u00a7518, and that it could not resolve the challenge to \u00a7518, based on that record.  Both issues are pure questions of law: whether \u00a7518 prohibits petitioners' preferred pricing sys-tems and displays (a statutory interpretation question for the New York Court of Appeals) and whether \u00a7518 survives petitioners' First Amendment challenge (a constitutional question for the Second Circuit).  And both issues turn on only a limited set of facts--the pricing systems and displays that petitioners wish to use.  As discussed above, the record contains those facts.  The \"state of the record\" thus does not counsel against certification.  Given the significant benefits certification offered and given the absence of persuasive downsides identified by the Second Circuit, the decision not to certify was an abuse of discretion.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The consequences of the decision not to certify reverberate throughout the Court's opinion today.  For lack of a definitive interpretation of \u00a7518, it chooses to address only the first part of petitioners' challenge and to defer to the Second Circuit's partial interpretation of \u00a7518.6 Ante, at 6-8.  It then holds that \u00a7518 does restrict constitutionally protected speech.  Ante, at 8-10.  But it does not decide whether \u00a7518's restriction is constitutionally permissible because doing so would require it to answer the ever-present question in this case: \"whether the statute permits .\u00a0.\u00a0. pricing schemes like the one .\u00a0.\u00a0. Expressions currently uses.\"  Ante, at 10, n.\u00a03.  And so it sends this case back to the Second Circuit for further proceedings.  Ante, at 10.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The complexity\" of this case \"might have been avoided,\" Arizonans for Official English, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 79, had the Second Circuit certified the question of \u00a7518's meaning when the case was first before it.  The Court's opinion does not foreclose the Second Circuit from choosing that route on remand.  But rather than contributing to the piecemeal resolution of this case, I would vacate the judgment below and remand with instructions to certify the case to the New York Court of Appeals to allow it to definitively interpret \u00a7518.  I thus concur only in the judgment.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Petitioner Expressions Hair Design currently posts separate dollars-and-cents prices for cash and credit--that is, it posts something like \"$10 cash, $10.30 credit.\"  It displays its prices in this way, however, only because it considers itself compelled to do so by the challenged law if it wants to charge different prices.  Prior to becoming aware of the law, Expressions posted single prices along with a notice informing customers that a three percent surcharge would be added to their bill if they paid by credit card.  Expressions has indicated that it would prefer to return to its prior practice.  See App. 19, Complaint \u00b63; id., at 103-104.  Given petitioners' representations about the narrow scope of their as-applied challenge, we limit our consideration to the single-sticker pricing regime for present purposes.  Petitioners' affidavits and briefing reference other potential pricing schemes, which may be considered by the Court of Appeals to the extent it deems appropriate.  See, e.g., id., at 56; Brief for Petitioners 50.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Relying fully on their claim that \u00a7518 regulated speech, petitioners did not advance any argument before the Court of Appeals that \u00a7518 was constitutionally problematic even if deemed a regulation of conduct.  See 808 F.\u00a03d 118, 135 (CA2 2015) (noting that petitioners had not challenged \u00a7518 under United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.\u00a0S. 367 (1968)).\nFootnote 3\u00a0To assess the statute's constitutionality, the Court of Appeals may need to consider a question we need not answer here: whether the statute permits two-sticker pricing schemes like the one petitioner Expressions currently uses, see n.\u00a01, supra.  Respondents' argument that \u00a7518 is a constitutionally valid disclosure requirement rests on an interpretation of the statute that allows such two-sticker schemes.\nFootnote 4\u00a0For similar reasons, petitioners' related argument regarding abstention is no longer at issue.  The Court of Appeals abstained from deciding whether \u00a7518 was constitutional outside of the single-sticker context, but the merchants have disavowed any intent to challenge the law outside of this context.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0This is the interpretation of the lapsed federal ban offered by the United States and accepted by the majority.  For purposes of this opinion, I assume that this interpretation is correct.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Section 518's sparse enforcement history does not clear up the ambiguity.  New York has pursued one \u00a7518 prosecution, which resulted in a conviction later set aside on appeal.  The decision supports, but does not require, giving \u00a7518 a broader reading than the lapsed federal ban.  See People v. Fulvio, 136 Misc. 2d 334, 344-345, 517 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0S.\u00a02d 1008, 1015 (1987) (stating that \u00a7518 permits a conviction for being \"careless enough to describe the higher price in terms which amount to the 'credit price' having been derived from adding a charge to the lower price\" (emphasis deleted)).  A more recent enforcement spree is more opaque.  A group of merchants state that when a customer called asking for their prices, they would quote the cash price and tell the customers they charged, for example, \"a $.05 surcharge\" for payment with a credit card.  See, e.g., App. 107.  They state that in 2009 the New York Attorney General's Office told them that they had violated \u00a7518, directed them to stop, and explained that they could comply with \u00a7518 by quoting the credit card price and offering a \"discoun[t]\" for payment with cash.  Ibid.  While these merchants' acts would have violated the lapsed federal ban--by stating a single cash price and then charging a higher price to credit card customers--the recent enforcement actions do not demonstrate that \u00a7518 prohibits only those acts and stretches no further.  And because the New York attorney general lacks the author-ity to adopt an interpretation of \u00a7518 that binds other prosecutorial entities in the State, these enforcement actions speak only to how the attorney general may interpret \u00a7518.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 40-41.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The multiple available interpretations of \u00a7518 do not render \u00a7518 so vague as to violate the Due Process Clause.  But they do render \u00a7518 ambiguous enough to warrant asking the New York Court of Appeals to resolve the statute's meaning.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The New York Court of Appeals regularly accepts and answers certified questions.  See, e.g., Flo & Eddie, Inc. v. Sirius XM Radio, Inc., 28 N.\u00a0Y. 3d 583, ___ N.\u00a0E. 3d ___ (Dec. 20, 2016) (certified Apr. 13, 2016); Pasternack v. Laboratory Corp. of Am.

General Motors LLC, 27 N.\u00a0Y. 3d 379, 53 N.\u00a0E. 3d 706 (May 3, 2016) (certified May 19, 2015); Ministers & Missionaries Benefit Bd. v. Snow, 26 N.\u00a0Y. 3d 466, 45 N.\u00a0E. 3d 917 (Dec. 15, 2015) (certified Mar. 5, 2015).  The Second Circuit has \"actively and vigorously employed\" certification.  Kaye, Tribute to Judge Guido Calabresi, 70 N.\u00a0Y.\u00a0U. Annual Survey Am. L. 33, 34 (2014) (noting, based on service as the Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals, that certification by the Second Circuit \"has done an enormous amount to bridge the gap between our state and federal court systems\").\nFootnote 5\u00a0The court below did not truly engage with the plain text reading of \u00a7518, under which a merchant may not charge different prices to cash and credit card customers.  See 808 F.\u00a03d 118, 128 (CA2 2015).  It is free to consider that reading on remand in light of the Court's constitutional holding.\nFootnote 6\u00a0It does so by invoking an interpretive rule of deference to a lower federal court's construction of the law of a State within its jurisdiction, in line with the general principle that this Court does not resolve issues of state law.  I do not read the Court's deference to the Second Circuit as holding that this Court will defer to a lower federal court's interpretation of state law even where doing so would cast serious constitutional doubt on, or invalidate, a state law.  Such a rule would be incorrect.  See Frisby v. Schultz, 487 U.\u00a0S. 474, 483 (1988) (describing lower courts' interpretation as \"plain error .\u00a0.\u00a0. [t]o the extent they endorsed a broad reading of the\" law at issue because \"the lower courts ran afoul of the well-established principle that statutes will be interpreted to avoid constitutional difficulties\").  The Court's silence on the relevance of the avoidance canon to the Second Circuit's interpretation is consistent with an unexpressed conclusion, with which I disagree, that no narrowing construction is available that would avoid constitutional concerns or that a broader constriction raises no constitutional concerns.\n\n\n","25":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nFREDDIE H. MATHIS  v.  DAVID J. SHULKIN, SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS(2017)\nNo. 16-677\nArgued: Decided: June 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statement of Justice Sotomayor respecting the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This petition raises important questions about how the Government carries out its obligations to our veterans.  The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) applies a rebuttable presumption when reviewing veterans' disability claims: The medical examiner whose opinion the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) relied on to deny a veteran's claim is presumed competent, absent a specific objection by the veteran.  To raise an objection, a veteran needs to know the medical examiner's credentials.  And yet, the VA does not provide veterans with that information as a matter of course.  Nor does it always provide veterans with that information upon request.  The only road to guaranteed access to an examiner's credentials runs through a Board order.  The Board, however, has sometimes required the veteran to have already raised a specific objection to an examiner's competence before ordering the VA to provide the credentials.  This places a veteran in \"a catch-22\" where she \"must make a specific objection to an examiner's competence before she can learn the examiner's qualifications.\"  834 F.\u00a03d 1347, 1357 (CA Fed. 2016) (Reyna, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  As Justice Gorsuch explains, see post, at 1, the Board's presumption is questionable.  But the presumption is not the only problem.  A decision by the VA to deny benefits in reliance on an examiner's opinion, while denying the veteran access to that examiner's credentials, ensures that the presumption will work to the veteran's disadvantage.  The petitioner here did not ask the VA to provide the examiner's credentials, and so this petition does not allow review of both the VA's practice and the Board's presumption.  Full review would require a petition arising from a case in which the VA denied a veteran benefits after declining to provide the medical examiner's credentials.  Until such a petition presents itself, staying our hand allows the Federal Circuit and the VA to continue their dialogue over whether the current system for adjudicating veterans' disability claims can be squared with the VA's statutory obligations to assist veterans in the development of their disability claims.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nFREDDIE H.

The Board of Veterans' Appeals (Board) applies a rebuttable presumption when reviewing veterans' disability claims: The medical examiner whose opinion the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) relied on to deny a veteran's claim is presumed competent, absent a specific objection by the veteran.  To raise an objection, a veteran needs to know the medical examiner's credentials.  And yet, the VA does not provide veterans with that information as a matter of course.  Nor does it always provide veterans with that information upon request.  The only road to guaranteed access to an examiner's credentials runs through a Board order.  The Board, however, has sometimes required the veteran to have already raised a specific objection to an examiner's competence before ordering the VA to provide the credentials.  This places a veteran in \"a catch-22\" where she \"must make a specific objection to an examiner's competence before she can learn the examiner's qualifications.\"  834 F.\u00a03d 1347, 1357 (CA Fed. 2016) (Reyna, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  As Justice Gorsuch explains, see post, at 1, the Board's presumption is questionable.  But the presumption is not the only problem.  A decision by the VA to deny benefits in reliance on an examiner's opinion, while denying the veteran access to that examiner's credentials, ensures that the presumption will work to the veteran's disadvantage.  The petitioner here did not ask the VA to provide the examiner's credentials, and so this petition does not allow review of both the VA's practice and the Board's presumption.  Full review would require a petition arising from a case in which the VA denied a veteran benefits after declining to provide the medical examiner's credentials.

F. v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITY SCHOOLS ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-497\nArgued: October 31, 2016Decided: February 22, 2017\n\n\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) offers federal funds to States in exchange for a commitment to furnish a \"free appropriate public education\" (FAPE) to children with certain disabilities, 20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71412(a)(1)(A), and establishes formal administrative procedures for resolving disputes between parents and schools concerning the provision of a FAPE.  Other federal statutes also protect the interests of children with disabilities, including Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and \u00a7504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  In Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.\u00a0S. 992, this Court considered the interaction between those other laws and the IDEA, holding that the IDEA was \"the exclusive avenue\" through which a child with a disability could challenge the adequacy of his education.  Id., at 1009.  Congress responded by passing the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986, overturning Smith's preclusion of non-IDEA claims and adding a carefully defined exhaustion provision.  Under that provision, a plaintiff bringing suit under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or similar laws \"seeking relief that is also available under [the IDEA]\" must first exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures.  \u00a71415(l).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner E.\u00a0F. is a child with a severe form of cerebral palsy; a trained service dog named Wonder assists her with various daily life activities.  When E.\u00a0F.'s parents, petitioners Stacy and Brent Fry, sought permission for Wonder to join E.\u00a0F. in kindergarten, officials at Ezra Eby Elementary School refused.  The officials reasoned that the human aide provided as part of E.\u00a0F.'s individualized education program rendered the dog superfluous.  In response, the Frys removed E.\u00a0F. from Ezra Eby and began homeschooling her.  They also filed a complaint with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), claiming that the exclusion of E.\u00a0F.'s service animal violated her rights under Title II and \u00a7504.  OCR agreed, and school officials invited E.\u00a0F. to return to Ezra Eby with Wonder.  But the Frys, concerned about resentment from school officials, instead enrolled E.\u00a0F. in a different school that welcomed the service dog.  The Frys then filed this suit in federal court against Ezra Eby's local and regional school districts and principal (collectively, the school districts), alleging that they violated Title II and \u00a7504 and seeking declaratory and monetary relief.  The District Court granted the school districts' motion to dismiss the suit, holding that \u00a71415(l) required the Frys to first exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed, reasoning that \u00a71415(l) applies whenever a plaintiff's alleged harms are \"educational\" in nature.\nHeld: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0\u00a0Exhaustion of the IDEA's administrative procedures is unnecessary where the gravamen of the plaintiff's suit is something other than the denial of the IDEA's core guarantee of a FAPE.  Pp.\u00a09-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The language of \u00a71415(l) compels exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks \"relief\" that is \"available\" under the IDEA.  Establishing the scope of \u00a71415(l), then, requires identifying the circumstances in which the IDEA enables a person to obtain redress or access a benefit.  That inquiry immediately reveals the primacy of a FAPE in the statutory scheme.  The IDEA's stated purpose and specific commands center on ensuring a FAPE for children with disabilities.  And the IDEA's administrative procedures test whether a school has met this obligation: Any decision by a hearing officer on a request for substantive relief \"shall\" be \"based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.\"  \u00a71415(f)(3)(E)(i).  Accordingly, \u00a71415(l)'s exhaustion rule hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE.  If a lawsuit charges such a denial, the plaintiff cannot escape \u00a71415(l) merely by bringing the suit under a statute other than the IDEA.  But if the remedy sought in a suit brought under a different statute is not for the denial of a FAPE, then exhaustion of the IDEA's procedures is not required.  Pp.\u00a09-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) In determining whether a plaintiff seeks relief for the denial of a FAPE, what matters is the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint, setting aside any attempts at artful pleading.  That inquiry makes central the plaintiff's own claims, as \u00a71415(l) explicitly requires in asking whether a lawsuit in fact \"seeks\" relief available under the IDEA.  But examination of a plaintiff's complaint should consider substance, not surface: \u00a71415(l) requires exhaustion when the gravamen of a complaint seeks redress for a school's failure to provide a FAPE, even if not phrased or framed in precisely that way.  In addressing whether a complaint fits that description, a court should attend to the diverse means and ends of the statutes covering persons with disabilities.  The IDEA guarantees individually tailored educational services for children with disabilities, while Title II and \u00a7504 promise nondiscriminatory access to public institutions for people with disabilities of all ages.  That is not to deny some overlap in coverage: The same conduct might violate all three statutes.  But still, these statutory differences mean that a complaint brought under Title II and \u00a7504 might instead seek relief for simple discrimination, irrespective of the IDEA's FAPE obligation.  One clue to the gravamen of a complaint can come from asking a pair of hypothetical questions.  First, could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was not a school?  Second, could an adult at the school have pressed essentially the same grievance?  When the answer to those questions is yes, a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a FAPE is also unlikely to be truly about that subject.  But when the answer is no, then the complaint probably does concern a FAPE.  A further sign of the gravamen of a suit can emerge from the history of the proceedings.  Prior pursuit of the IDEA's administrative remedies may provide strong evidence that the substance of a plaintiff's claim concerns the denial of a FAPE, even if the complaint never explicitly uses that term.  Pp.\u00a013-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0This case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for a proper analysis of whether the gravamen of E.\u00a0F.'s complaint charges, and seeks relief for, the denial of a FAPE.  The Frys' complaint alleges only disability-based discrimination, without making any reference to the adequacy of the special education services E.\u00a0F.'s school provided.  Instead, the Frys have maintained that the school districts infringed E.\u00a0F.'s right to equal access--even if their actions complied in full with the IDEA's requirements.  But the possibility remains that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different.  The parties have not addressed whether the Frys initially pursued the IDEA's administrative remedies, and the record is cloudy as to the relevant facts.  On remand, the court below should establish whether (or to what extent) the Frys invoked the IDEA's dispute resolution process before filing suit.  And if the Frys started down that road, the court should decide whether their actions reveal that the gravamen of their complaint is indeed the denial of a FAPE, thus necessitating further exhaustion.

F., PETITIONERS v. NAPOLEON COMMUNITYSCHOOLS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[February 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA or Act), 84 Stat. 175, as amended, 20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71400 et seq., ensures that children with disabilities receive needed special education services.  One of its provisions, \u00a71415(l), addresses the Act's relationship with other laws protecting those children.  Section 1415(l) makes clear that nothing in the IDEA \"restrict[s] or limit[s] the rights [or] remedies\" that other federal laws, including antidiscrimination statutes, confer on children with disabilities.  At the same time, the section states that if a suit brought under such a law \"seek[s] relief that is also available under\" the IDEA, the plaintiff must first exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures.  In this case, we consider the scope of that exhaustion requirement.  We hold that exhaustion is not necessary when the gravamen of the plaintiff's suit is something other than the denial of the IDEA's core guarantee--what the Act calls a \"free appropriate public education.\"  \u00a71412(a)(1)(A).\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IDEA offers federal funds to States in exchange for a commitment: to furnish a \"free appropriate public education\"--more concisely known as a FAPE--to all children with certain physical or intellectual disabilities.  Ibid.; see \u00a71401(3)(A)(i) (listing covered disabilities).  As defined in the Act, a FAPE comprises \"special education and related services\"--both \"instruction\" tailored to meet a child's \"unique needs\" and sufficient \"supportive services\" to permit the child to benefit from that instruction.  \u00a7\u00a71401(9), (26), (29); see Board of Ed. of Hendrick Hudson Central School Dist., Westchester Cty. v. Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S. 176, 203 (1982).  An eligible child, as this Court has explained, acquires a \"substantive right\" to such an education once a State accepts the IDEA's financial assistance.  Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.\u00a0S. 992, 1010 (1984).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the IDEA, an \"individualized education program,\" called an IEP for short, serves as the \"primary vehicle\" for providing each child with the promised FAPE.  Honig v. Doe, 484 U.\u00a0S. 305, 311 (1988); see \u00a71414(d).  (Welcome to--and apologies for--the acronymic world of federal legislation.)  Crafted by a child's \"IEP Team\"--a group of school officials, teachers, and parents--the IEP spells out a personalized plan to meet all of the child's \"educational needs.\"  \u00a7\u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(II)(bb), (d)(1)(B).  Most notably, the IEP documents the child's current \"levels of academic achievement,\" specifies \"measurable annual goals\" for how she can \"make progress in the general education curriculum,\" and lists the \"special education and related services\" to be provided so that she can \"advance appropriately toward [those] goals.\"  \u00a7\u00a71414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I), (II), (IV)(aa).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because parents and school representatives sometimes cannot agree on such issues, the IDEA establishes formal procedures for resolving disputes.  To begin, a dissatisfied parent may file a complaint as to any matter concerning the provision of a FAPE with the local or state educational agency (as state law provides).  See \u00a71415(b)(6).  That pleading generally triggers a \"[p]reliminary meeting\" involving the contending parties, \u00a71415(f\u00a0)(1)(B)(i); at their option, the parties may instead (or also) pursue a full-fledged mediation process, see \u00a71415(e).  Assuming their impasse continues, the matter proceeds to a \"due process hearing\" before an impartial hearing officer.  \u00a71415(f\u00a0)(1)(A); see \u00a71415(f\u00a0)(3)(A)(i).  Any decision of the officer granting substantive relief must be \"based on a determination of whether the child received a [FAPE].\"  \u00a71415(f\u00a0)(3)(E)(i).  If the hearing is initially conducted at the local level, the ruling is appealable to the state agency.  See \u00a71415(g).  Finally, a parent unhappy with the outcome of the administrative process may seek judicial review by filing a civil action in state or federal court.  See \u00a71415(i)(2)(A).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Important as the IDEA is for children with disabilities, it is not the only federal statute protecting their interests.  Of particular relevance to this case are two antidiscrimination laws--Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a712131 et\u00a0seq., and \u00a7504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7794--which cover both adults and children with disabilities, in both public schools and other settings.  Title II forbids any \"public entity\" from discriminating based on disability; Section 504 applies the same prohibition to any federally funded \"program or activity.\"  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a712131-12132; 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7794(a).  A regulation implementing Title II requires a public entity to make \"reasonable modifications\" to its \"policies, practices, or procedures\" when necessary to avoid such discrimination.  28 CFR \u00a735.130(b)(7) (2016); see, e.g., Alboniga v. School Bd. of Broward Cty., 87 F.\u00a0Supp. 3d 1319, 1345 (SD Fla. 2015) (requiring an accommodation to permit use of a service animal under Title II).  In similar vein, courts have interpreted \u00a7504 as demanding certain \"reasonable\" modifications to existing practices in order to \"accommodate\" persons with disabilities.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.\u00a0S. 287, 299-300 (1985); see, e.g., Sullivan v. Vallejo City Unified School Dist., 731 F.\u00a0Supp. 947, 961-962 (ED Cal. 1990) (requiring an accommodation to permit use of a service animal under \u00a7504).  And both statutes authorize individuals to seek redress for violations of their substantive guarantees by bringing suits for injunctive relief or money damages.  See 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7794a(a)(2); 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a712133.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court first considered the interaction between such laws and the IDEA in Smith v. Robinson, 468 U.\u00a0S. 992.1  The plaintiffs there sought \"to secure a 'free appropriate public education' for [their] handicapped child.\"  Id., at 994.  But instead of bringing suit under the IDEA alone, they appended \"virtually identical\" claims (again alleging the denial of a \"free appropriate public education\") under \u00a7504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.  Id., at 1009; see id., at 1016.  The Court held that the IDEA altogether foreclosed those additional claims: With its \"comprehensive\" and \"carefully tailored\" provisions, the Act was \"the exclusive avenue\" through which a child with a disability (or his parents) could challenge the adequacy of his education.  Id., at 1009; see id., at 1013, 1016, 1021.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress was quick to respond. In the Handicapped Children's Protection Act of 1986, 100 Stat. 796, it overturned Smith's preclusion of non-IDEA claims while also adding a carefully defined exhaustion requirement.  Now codified at 20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71415(l), the relevant provision of that statute reads:\n\"Nothing in [the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available under the Constitution, the [ADA], title V of the Rehabilitation Act [including \u00a7504], or other Federal laws protecting the rights of children with disabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under [the IDEA], the [IDEA's administrative procedures] shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under [the IDEA].\"\nThe first half of \u00a71415(l) (up until \"except that\") \"reaffirm[s] the viability\" of federal statutes like the ADA or Rehabilitation Act \"as separate vehicles,\" no less integral than the IDEA, \"for ensuring the rights of handicapped children.\"  H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 99-296, p. 4 (1985); see id., at 6.  According to that opening phrase, the IDEA does not prevent a plaintiff from asserting claims under such laws even if, as in Smith itself, those claims allege the denial of an appropriate public education (much as an IDEA claim would).  But the second half of \u00a71415(l) (from \"except that\" onward) imposes a limit on that \"anything goes\" regime, in the form of an exhaustion provision.  According to that closing phrase, a plaintiff bringing suit under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or similar laws must in certain circumstances--that is, when \"seeking relief that is also available under\" the IDEA--first exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures.  The reach of that requirement is the issue in this case.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner E.\u00a0F. is a child with a severe form of cerebral palsy, which \"significantly limits her motor skills and mobility.\"  App. to Brief in Opposition 6, Complaint \u00b619.2  When E.\u00a0F. was five years old, her parents--petitioners Stacy and Brent Fry--obtained a trained service dog for her, as recommended by her pediatrician.  The dog, a goldendoodle named Wonder, \"help[s E.\u00a0F.] to live as independently as possible\" by assisting her with various life activities.  Id., at 2, \u00b63.  In particular, Wonder aids E.\u00a0F. by \"retrieving dropped items, helping her balance when she uses her walker, opening and closing doors, turning on and off lights, helping her take off her coat, [and] helping her transfer to and from the toilet.\"  Id., at 7, \u00b627.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But when the Frys sought permission for Wonder to join E.\u00a0F. in kindergarten, officials at Ezra Eby Elementary School refused the request.  Under E.\u00a0F.'s existing IEP, a human aide provided E.\u00a0F. with one-on-one support throughout the day; that two-legged assistance, the school officials thought, rendered Wonder superfluous.  In the words of one administrator, Wonder should be barred from Ezra Eby because all of E.\u00a0F.'s \"physical and academic needs [were] being met through the services\/programs\/ accommodations\" that the school had already agreed to.  Id., at 8, \u00b633.  Later that year, the school officials briefly allowed Wonder to accompany E.\u00a0F. to school on a trial basis; but even then, \"the dog was required to remain in the back of the room during classes, and was forbidden from assisting [E.\u00a0F.] with many tasks he had been specifically trained to do.\"  Ibid., \u00b635.  And when the trial period concluded, the administrators again informed the Frys that Wonder was not welcome.  As a result, the Frys removed E.\u00a0F. from Ezra Eby and began homeschooling her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the Frys filed a complaint with the U.\u00a0S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR), charging that Ezra Eby's exclusion of E.\u00a0F.'s service animal violated her rights under Title II of the ADA and \u00a7504 of the Rehabilitation Act.  Following an investigation, OCR agreed.  The office explained in its decision letter that a school's obligations under those statutes go beyond providing educational services: A school could offer a FAPE to a child with a disability but still run afoul of the laws' ban on discrimination.  See App. 30-32.  And here, OCR found, Ezra Eby had indeed violated that ban, even if its use of a human aide satisfied the FAPE standard.  See id., at 35-36.  OCR analogized the school's conduct to \"requir[ing] a student who uses a wheelchair to be carried\" by an aide or \"requir[ing] a blind student to be led [around by a] teacher\" instead of permitting him to use a guide dog or cane.  Id., at 35.  Regardless whether those--or Ezra Eby's--policies denied a FAPE, they violated Title II and \u00a7504 by discriminating against children with disabilities.  See id., at 35-36.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In response to OCR's decision, school officials at last agreed that E.\u00a0F. could come to school with Wonder.  But after meeting with Ezra Eby's principal, the Frys became concerned that the school administration \"would resent [E.\u00a0F.] and make her return to school difficult.\"  App. to Brief in Opposition 10, \u00b648.  Accordingly, the Frys found a different public school, in a different district, where administrators and teachers enthusiastically received both E.\u00a0F. and Wonder.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Frys then filed this suit in federal court against the local and regional school districts in which Ezra Eby is located, along with the school's principal (collectively, the school districts).  The complaint alleged that the school districts violated Title II of the ADA and \u00a7504 of the Rehabilitation Act by \"denying [E.\u00a0F.] equal access\" to Ezra Eby and its programs, \"refus[ing] to reasonably accommodate\" E.\u00a0F.'s use of a service animal, and otherwise \"discriminat[ing] against [E.\u00a0F.] as a person with disabilities.\"  Id., at 15, \u00b668, 17-18, \u00b6\u00b682-83.  According to the complaint, E.\u00a0F. suffered harm as a result of that discrimination, including \"emotional distress and pain, embarrassment, [and] mental anguish.\"  Id., at 11-12, \u00b651.  In their prayer for relief, the Frys sought a declaration that the school districts had violated Title II and \u00a7504, along with money damages to compensate for E.\u00a0F.'s injuries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted the school districts' motion to dismiss the suit, holding that \u00a71415(l) required the Frys to first exhaust the IDEA's administrative procedures.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 50.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed on the same ground.  In that court's view, \u00a71415(l) applies if \"the injuries [alleged in a suit] relate to the specific substantive protections of the IDEA.\"  788 F.\u00a03d 622, 625 (2015).  And that means, the court continued, that exhaustion is necessary whenever \"the genesis and the manifestations\" of the complained-of harms were \"educational\" in nature.  Id., at 627 (quoting Charlie F. v. Board of Ed. of Skokie School Dist. 68, 98 F.\u00a03d 989, 993 (CA7 1996)).  On that understanding of \u00a71415(l), the Sixth Circuit held, the Frys' suit could not proceed: Because the harms to E.\u00a0F. were generally \"educational\"--most notably, the court reasoned, because \"Wonder's absence hurt her sense of independence and social confidence at school\"--the Frys had to exhaust the IDEA's procedures.  788 F.\u00a03d, at 627.  Judge Daughtrey dissented, emphasizing that in bringing their Title II and \u00a7504 claims, the Frys \"did not allege the denial of a FAPE\" or \"seek to modify [E.\u00a0F.'s] IEP in any way.\"  Id., at 634.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to address confusion in the courts of appeals as to the scope of \u00a71415(l)'s exhaustion requirement.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).3  We now vacate the Sixth Circuit's decision.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1415(l) requires that a plaintiff exhaust the IDEA's procedures before filing an action under the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, or similar laws when (but only when) her suit \"seek[s] relief that is also available\" under the IDEA.  We first hold that to meet that statutory standard, a suit must seek relief for the denial of a FAPE, because that is the only \"relief\" the IDEA makes \"available.\"  We next conclude that in determining whether a suit indeed \"seeks\" relief for such a denial, a court should look to the substance, or gravamen, of the plaintiff's  complaint.4\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this Court, the parties have reached substantial agreement about what \"relief\" the IDEA makes \"available\" for children with disabilities--and about how the Sixth Circuit went wrong in addressing that question.  The Frys maintain that such a child can obtain remedies under the IDEA for decisions that deprive her of a FAPE, but none for those that do not.  So in the Frys' view, \u00a71415(l)'s exhaustion requirement can come into play only when a suit concerns the denial of a FAPE--and not, as the Sixth Circuit held, when it merely has some articulable connection to the education of a child with a disability.  See Reply Brief 13-15.  The school districts, for their part, also believe that the Sixth Circuit's exhaustion standard \"goes too far\" because it could mandate exhaustion when a plaintiff is \"seeking relief that is not in substance available\" under the IDEA.  Brief for Respondents 30.  And in particular, the school districts acknowledge that the IDEA makes remedies available only in suits that \"directly implicate[\u00a0]\" a FAPE--so that only in those suits can \u00a71415(l) apply.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.  For the reasons that follow, we agree with the parties' shared view: The only relief that an IDEA officer can give--hence the thing a plaintiff must seek in order to trigger \u00a71415(l)'s exhaustion rule--is relief for the denial of a FAPE.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin, as always, with the statutory language at issue, which (at risk of repetition) compels exhaustion when a plaintiff seeks \"relief\" that is \"available\" under the IDEA.  The ordinary meaning of \"relief\" in the context of a lawsuit is the \"redress[\u00a0] or benefit\" that attends a favorable judgment.  Black's Law Dictionary 1161 (5th ed. 1979).  And such relief is \"available,\" as we recently explained, when it is \"accessible or may be obtained.\"  Ross v. Blake, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 8) (quoting Webster's Third New International Dictionary 150 (1993)).  So to establish the scope of \u00a71415(l), we must identify the circumstances in which the IDEA enables a person to obtain redress (or, similarly, to access a benefit).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That inquiry immediately reveals the primacy of a FAPE in the statutory scheme.  In its first section, the IDEA declares as its first purpose \"to ensure that all children with disabilities have available to them a free appropriate public education.\"  \u00a71400(d)(1)(A).  That principal purpose then becomes the Act's principal command: A State receiving federal funding under the IDEA must make such an education \"available to all children with disabilities.\"  \u00a71412(a)(1)(A).  The guarantee of a FAPE to those children gives rise to the bulk of the statute's more specific provisions.  For example, the IEP--\"the centerpiece of the statute's education delivery system\"--serves as the \"vehicle\" or \"means\" of providing a FAPE.  Honig, 484 U.\u00a0S., at 311; Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 181; see supra, at 2.  And finally, as all the above suggests, the FAPE requirement provides the yardstick for measuring the adequacy of the education that a school offers to a child with a disability: Under that standard, this Court has held, a child is entitled to \"meaningful\" access to education based on her individual needs.  Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 192.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The IDEA's administrative procedures test whether a school has met that obligation--and so center on the Act's FAPE requirement.  As noted earlier, any decision by a hearing officer on a request for substantive relief \"shall\" be \"based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.\"  \u00a71415(f\u00a0)(3)(E)(i); see supra, at 3.6  Or said in Latin: In the IDEA's administrative process, a FAPE denial is the sine qua non.  Suppose that a parent's complaint protests a school's failure to provide some accommodation for a child with a disability.  If that accommodation is needed to fulfill the IDEA's FAPE requirement, the hearing officer must order relief.  But if it is not, he cannot--even though the dispute is between a child with a disability and the school she attends.  There might be good reasons, unrelated to a FAPE, for the school to make the requested accommodation.  Indeed, another federal law (like the ADA or Rehabilitation Act) might require the accommodation on one of those alternative grounds.  See infra, at 15.  But still, the hearing officer cannot provide the requested relief.  His role, under the IDEA, is to enforce the child's \"substantive right\" to a FAPE.  Smith, 468 U.\u00a0S., at 1010.  And that is all.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that reason, \u00a71415(l)'s exhaustion rule hinges on whether a lawsuit seeks relief for the denial of a free appropriate public education.  If a lawsuit charges such a denial, the plaintiff cannot escape \u00a71415(l) merely by bringing her suit under a statute other than the IDEA--as when, for example, the plaintiffs in Smith claimed that a school's failure to provide a FAPE also violated the Rehabilitation Act.8  Rather, that plaintiff must first submit her case to an IDEA hearing officer, experienced in addressing exactly the issues she raises.  But if, in a suit brought under a different statute, the remedy sought is not for the denial of a FAPE, then exhaustion of the IDEA's procedures is not required.  After all, the plaintiff could not get any relief from those procedures: A hearing officer, as just explained, would have to send her away empty-handed.  And that is true even when the suit arises directly from a school's treatment of a child with a disability--and so could be said to relate in some way to her education.  A school's conduct toward such a child--say, some refusal to make an accommodation--might injure her in ways unrelated to a FAPE, which are addressed in statutes other than the IDEA.  A complaint seeking redress for those other harms, independent of any FAPE denial, is not subject to \u00a71415(l)'s exhaustion rule because, once again, the only \"relief\" the IDEA makes \"available\" is relief for the denial of a FAPE.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, an important question remains: How is a court to tell when a plaintiff \"seeks\" relief for the denial of a FAPE and when she does not?  Here, too, the parties have found some common ground: By looking, they both say, to the \"substance\" of, rather than the labels used in, the plaintiff's complaint.  Brief for Respondents 20; Reply Brief 7-8.  And here, too, we agree with that view: What matters  is the crux--or, in legal-speak, the gravamen--of the plaintiff's complaint, setting aside any attempts at artful pleading.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That inquiry makes central the plaintiff's own claims, as \u00a71415(l) explicitly requires.  The statutory language asks whether a lawsuit in fact \"seeks\" relief available under the IDEA--not, as a stricter exhaustion statute might, whether the suit \"could have sought\" relief available under the IDEA (or, what is much the same, whether any remedies \"are\" available under that law).  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20 (contrasting \u00a71415(l) with the exhaustion provision in the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(a)).  In effect, \u00a71415(l) treats the plaintiff as \"the master of the claim\": She identifies its remedial basis--and is subject to exhaustion or not based on that choice.  Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.\u00a0S. 386, 392, and n.\u00a07 (1987).  A court deciding whether \u00a71415(l) applies must therefore examine whether a plaintiff's complaint--the principal instrument by which she describes her case--seeks relief for the denial of an appropriate education.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that examination should consider substance, not surface.  The use (or non-use) of particular labels and terms is not what matters.  The inquiry, for example, does not ride on whether a complaint includes (or, alternatively, omits) the precise words(?) \"FAPE\" or \"IEP.\"  After all, \u00a71415(l)'s premise is that the plaintiff is suing under a statute other than the IDEA, like the Rehabilitation Act; in such a suit, the plaintiff might see no need to use the IDEA's distinctive language--even if she is in essence contesting the adequacy of a special education program.  And still more critically, a \"magic words\" approach would make \u00a71415(l)'s exhaustion rule too easy to bypass.  Just last Term, a similar worry led us to hold that a court's jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act turns on the \"gravamen,\" or \"essentials,\" of the plaintiff's suit.  OBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 6, 8, 9).  \"[A]ny other approach,\" we explained, \"would allow plaintiffs to evade the Act's restrictions through artful pleading.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  So too here.  Section 1415(l) is not merely a pleading hurdle.  It requires exhaustion when the gravamen of a complaint seeks redress for a school's failure to provide a FAPE, even if not phrased or framed in precisely that way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addressing whether a complaint fits that description, a court should attend to the diverse means and ends of the statutes covering persons with disabilities--the IDEA on the one hand, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act (most notably) on the other.  The IDEA, of course, protects only \"children\" (well, really, adolescents too) and concerns only their schooling.  \u00a71412(a)(1)(A).  And as earlier noted, the statute's goal is to provide each child with meaningful access to education by offering individualized instruction and related services appropriate to her \"unique needs.\"  \u00a71401(29); see Rowley, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 192, 198; supra, at 11.  By contrast, Title II of the ADA and \u00a7504 of the Rehabilitation Act cover people with disabilities of all ages, and do so both inside and outside schools.  And those statutes aim to root out disability-based discrimination, enabling each covered person (sometimes by means of reasonable accommodations) to participate equally to all others in public facilities and federally funded programs.  See supra, at 3-4.  In short, the IDEA guarantees individually tailored educational services, while Title II and \u00a7504 promise non-discriminatory access to public institutions.  That is not to deny some overlap in coverage: The same conduct might violate all three statutes--which is why, as in Smith, a plaintiff might seek relief for the denial of a FAPE under Title II and \u00a7504 as well as the IDEA.  But still, the statutory differences just discussed mean that a complaint brought under Title II and \u00a7504 might instead seek relief for simple discrimination, irrespective of the IDEA's FAPE obligation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One clue to whether the gravamen of a complaint against a school concerns the denial of a FAPE, or instead addresses disability-based discrimination, can come from asking a pair of hypothetical questions.  First, could the plaintiff have brought essentially the same claim if the alleged conduct had occurred at a public facility that was not a school--say, a public theater or library?  And second, could an adult at the school--say, an employee or visitor--have pressed essentially the same grievance?  When the answer to those questions is yes, a complaint that does not expressly allege the denial of a FAPE is also unlikely to be truly about that subject; after all, in those other situations there is no FAPE obligation and yet the same basic suit could go forward.  But when the answer is no, then the complaint probably does concern a FAPE, even if it does not explicitly say so; for the FAPE requirement is all that explains why only a child in the school setting (not an adult in that setting or a child in some other) has a viable claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take two contrasting examples.  Suppose first that a wheelchair-bound child sues his school for discrimination under Title II (again, without mentioning the denial of a FAPE) because the building lacks access ramps.  In some sense, that architectural feature has educational consequences, and a different lawsuit might have alleged that it violates the IDEA: After all, if the child cannot get inside the school, he cannot receive instruction there; and if he must be carried inside, he may not achieve the sense of independence conducive to academic (or later to real-world) success.  But is the denial of a FAPE really the gravamen of the plaintiff's Title II complaint?  Consider that the child could file the same basic complaint if a municipal library or theater had no ramps.  And similarly, an employee or visitor could bring a mostly identical complaint against the school.  That the claim can stay the same in those alternative scenarios suggests that its essence is equality of access to public facilities, not adequacy of special education.  See supra, at 7 (describing OCR's use of a similar example).  And so \u00a71415(l) does not require exhaustion.9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But suppose next that a student with a learning disability sues his school under Title II for failing to provide remedial tutoring in mathematics.  That suit, too, might be cast as one for disability-based discrimination, grounded on the school's refusal to make a reasonable accommodation; the complaint might make no reference at all to a FAPE or an IEP.  But can anyone imagine the student making the same claim against a public theater or library?  Or, similarly, imagine an adult visitor or employee suing the school to obtain a math tutorial?  The difficulty of transplanting the complaint to those other contexts suggests that its essence--even though not its wording--is the provision of a FAPE, thus bringing \u00a71415(l\u00a0) into play.10\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A further sign that the gravamen of a suit is the denial of a FAPE can emerge from the history of the proceedings.  In particular, a court may consider that a plaintiff has previously invoked the IDEA's formal procedures to handle the dispute--thus starting to exhaust the Act's remedies before switching midstream.  Recall that a parent dissatisfied with her child's education initiates those administrative procedures by filing a complaint, which triggers a preliminary meeting (or possibly mediation) and then a due process hearing.  See supra, at 2-3.  A plaintiff's initial choice to pursue that process may suggest that she is indeed seeking relief for the denial of a FAPE--with the shift to judicial proceedings prior to full exhaustion reflecting only strategic calculations about how to maximize the prospects of such a remedy.  Whether that is so depends on the facts; a court may conclude, for example, that the move to a courtroom came from a late-acquired awareness that the school had fulfilled its FAPE obligation and that the grievance involves something else entirely.  But prior pursuit of the IDEA's administrative remedies will often provide strong evidence that the substance of a plaintiff's claim concerns the denial of a FAPE, even if the complaint never explicitly uses that term.11\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals did not undertake the analysis we have just set forward.  As noted above, it asked whether E.\u00a0F.'s injuries were, broadly speaking, \"educational\" in nature.  See supra, at 8; 788 F.\u00a03d, at 627 (reasoning that the \"value of allowing Wonder to attend [school] with E.\u00a0F. was educational\" because it would foster \"her sense of independence and social confidence,\" which is \"the sort of interest the IDEA protects\").  That is not the same as asking whether the gravamen of E.\u00a0F.'s complaint charges, and seeks relief for, the denial of a FAPE.  And that difference in standard may have led to a difference in result in this case.  Understood correctly, \u00a71415(l) might not require exhaustion of the Frys' claim.  We lack some important information on that score, however, and so we remand the issue to the court below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Frys' complaint alleges only disability-based discrimination, without making any reference to the adequacy of the special education services E.\u00a0F.'s school provided.  The school districts' \"refusal to allow Wonder to act as a service dog,\" the complaint states, \"discriminated against [E.\u00a0F.] as a person with disabilities .\u00a0.\u00a0. by denying her equal access\" to public facilities.  App. to Brief in Opposition 15, Complaint \u00b668.  The complaint contains no allegation about the denial of a FAPE or about any deficiency in E.\u00a0F.'s IEP.  More, it does not accuse the school even in general terms of refusing to provide the educational instruction and services that E.\u00a0F. needs.  See 788 F. 3d, at 631 (acknowledging that the Frys do not \"state that Wonder enhances E.\u00a0F.'s educational opportunities\").  As the Frys explained in this Court: The school districts \"have said all along that because they gave [E.\u00a0F.] a one-on-one [human] aide, that all of her .\u00a0.\u00a0. educational needs were satisfied.  And we have not challenged that, and it would be difficult for us to challenge that.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16.  The Frys instead maintained, just as OCR had earlier found, that the school districts infringed E.\u00a0F.'s right to equal access--even if their actions complied in full with the IDEA's requirements.  See App. to Brief in Opposition 15, 18-19, Complaint \u00b6\u00b6 69, 85, 87; App. 34-37; supra, at 7-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And nothing in the nature of the Frys' suit suggests any implicit focus on the adequacy of E.\u00a0F.'s education.  Consider, as suggested above, that the Frys could have filed essentially the same complaint if a public library or theater had refused admittance to Wonder.  See supra, at 16.  Or similarly, consider that an adult visitor to the school could have leveled much the same charges if prevented from entering with his service dog.  See ibid.  In each case, the plaintiff would challenge a public facility's policy of precluding service dogs (just as a blind person might challenge a policy of barring guide dogs, see supra, at 7) as violating Title II's and \u00a7504's equal access requirements.  The suit would have nothing to do with the provision of educational services.  From all that we know now, that is exactly the kind of action the Frys have brought.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we do not foreclose the possibility that the history of these proceedings might suggest something different.  As earlier discussed, a plaintiff's initial pursuit of the IDEA's administrative remedies can serve as evidence that the gravamen of her later suit is the denial of a FAPE, even though that does not appear on the face of her complaint.  See supra, at 17-18.  The Frys may or may not have sought those remedies before filing this case: None of the parties here have addressed that issue, and the record is cloudy as to the relevant facts.  Accordingly, on remand, the court below should establish whether (or to what extent) the Frys invoked the IDEA's dispute resolution process before bringing this suit.  And if the Frys started down that road, the court should decide whether their actions reveal that the gravamen of their complaint is indeed the denial of a FAPE, thus necessitating further exhaustion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With these instructions and for the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nOpinion of Alito, J.\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-497\nSTACY FRY, et vir, as next friends of minor E.

Next, the Court says, a court should ask whether \"an adult at the school--say, an employee or visitor--[could] have pressed essentially the same grievance.\"  Ibid.  These clues make sense only if there is no overlap between the relief available under the following two sets of claims: (1) the relief provided by the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), and (2) the relief provided by other federal laws (including the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973).  The Court does not show or even claim that there is no such overlap--to the contrary, it observes that \"[t]he same conduct might vio \nlate\" the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act and the IDEA.  Ibid.  And since these clues work only in the absence of overlap, I would not suggest them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court provides another false clue by suggesting that lower courts take into account whether parents, before filing suit under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, began to pursue but then abandoned the IDEA's formal procedures.  Ante, at 17-18.  This clue also seems to me to be ill-advised.  It is easy to imagine circumstances under which parents might start down the IDEA road and then change course and file an action under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that seeks relief that the IDEA cannot provide.  The parents might be advised by their attorney that the relief they were seeking under the IDEA is not available under that law but is available under another.  Or the parents might change their minds about the relief that they want, give up on the relief that the IDEA can provide, and turn to another statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court provides these clues for the purpose of assisting the lower courts, I am afraid that they may have the opposite effect.  They are likely to confuse and lead courts astray.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0At the time (and until 1990), the IDEA was called the Education of the Handicapped Act, or EHA.

Peninsula School Dist., 653 F. 3d 863, 874 (CA9 2011) (en banc) (cataloguing different Circuits' understandings of \u00a71415(l)).  In particular, the Ninth Circuit has criticized an approach similar to the Sixth Circuit's for \"treat[ing] \u00a71415(l) as a quasi-preemption provision, requiring administrative exhaustion for any case that falls within the general 'field' of educating disabled students.\"  Id., at 875.\nFootnote 4\u00a0In reaching these conclusions, we leave for another day a further question about the meaning of \u00a71415(l): Is exhaustion required when the plaintiff complains of the denial of a FAPE, but the specific remedy she requests--here, money damages for emotional distress--is not one that an IDEA hearing officer may award?  The Frys, along with the Solicitor General, say the answer is no.  See Reply Brief 2-3; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16.  But resolution of that question might not be needed in this case because the Frys also say that their complaint is not about the denial of a FAPE, see Reply Brief 17--and, as later explained, we must remand that distinct issue to the Sixth Circuit, see infra, at 18-20.  Only if that court rejects the Frys' view of their lawsuit, using the analysis we set out below, will the question about the effect of their request for money damages arise.\nFootnote 5\u00a0A case now before this Court, Endrew F. v. Douglas County School Dist. RE-1, No. 15-827, presents unresolved questions about the precise content of the FAPE standard.\nFootnote 6\u00a0Without finding the denial of a FAPE, a hearing officer may do nothing more than order a school district to comply with the Act's various procedural requirements, see \u00a71415(f\u00a0)(3)(E)(iii)--for example, by allowing parents to \"examine all records\" relating to their child, \u00a71415(b)(1).\nFootnote 7\u00a0Similarly, a court in IDEA litigation may provide a substantive remedy only when it determines that a school has denied a FAPE.  See School Comm. of Burlington v. Department of Ed. of Mass., 471 U.\u00a0S. 359, 369 (1985).  Without such a finding, that kind of relief is (once again) unavailable under the Act.\nFootnote 8\u00a0Once again, we do not address here (or anywhere else in this opinion) a case in which a plaintiff, although charging the denial of a FAPE, seeks a form of remedy that an IDEA officer cannot give--for example, as in the Frys' complaint, money damages for resulting emotional injury.  See n.\u00a04, supra.\nFootnote 9\u00a0The school districts offer another example illustrating the point. They suppose that a teacher, acting out of animus or frustration, strikes a student with a disability, who then sues the school under a statute other than the IDEA.  See Brief for Respondents 36-37.  Here too, the suit could be said to relate, in both genesis and effect, to the child's education.  But the school districts opine, we think correctly, that the substance of the plaintiff's claim is unlikely to involve the adequacy of special education--and thus is unlikely to require exhaustion.  See ibid.  A telling indicator of that conclusion is that a child could file the same kind of suit against an official at another public facility for inflicting such physical abuse--as could an adult subject to similar treatment by a school official.  To be sure, the particular circumstances of such a suit (school or theater? student or employee?) might be pertinent in assessing the reasonableness of the challenged conduct.  But even if that is so, the plausibility of bringing other variants of the suit indicates that the gravamen of the plaintiff's complaint does not concern the appropriateness of an educational program.\nFootnote 10\u00a0According to Justice Alito, the hypothetical inquiries described above are useful only if the IDEA and other federal laws are mutually exclusive in scope.  See post, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  That is incorrect.  The point of the questions is not to show that a plaintiff faced with a particular set of circumstances could only have proceeded under Title II or \u00a7504--or, alternatively, could only have proceeded under the IDEA.  (Depending on the circumstances, she might well have been able to proceed under both.)  Rather, these questions help determine whether a plaintiff who has chosen to bring a claim under Title II or \u00a7504 instead of the IDEA--and whose complaint makes no mention of a FAPE--nevertheless raises a claim whose substance is the denial of an appropriate education.\nFootnote 11\u00a0The point here is limited to commencement of the IDEA's formal administrative procedures; it does not apply to more informal requests to IEP Team members or other school administrators for accommodations or changes to a special education program.  After all, parents of a child with a disability are likely to bring all grievances first to those familiar officials, whether or not they involve the denial of a FAPE.\n\n\n","27":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGOODYEAR TIRE &AMP; RUBBER CO. v. HAEGER ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-1406\nArgued: January 10, 2017Decided: April 18, 2017\n\n\nRespondents Leroy, Donna, Barry, and Suzanne Haeger sued petitioner Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, alleging that the failure of a Goodyear G159 tire caused the family's motorhome to swerve off the road and flip over.  After several years of contentious discovery, marked by Goodyear's slow response to repeated requests for internal G159 test results, the parties settled the case.  Some months later, the Haegers' lawyer learned that, in another lawsuit involving the G159, Goodyear had disclosed test results indicating that the tire got unusually hot at highway speeds.  In subsequent correspondence, Goodyear conceded withholding the information from the Haegers, even though they had requested all testing data.  The Haegers then sought sanctions for discovery fraud, urging that Goodyear's misconduct entitled them to attorney's fees and costs expended in the litigation. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court found that Goodyear had engaged in an extended course of misconduct.  Exercising its inherent power to sanction bad-faith behavior, the court awarded the Haegers $2.7 million--the entire sum they had spent in legal fees and costs since the moment, early in the litigation, when Goodyear made its first dishonest discovery response.  The court said that in the usual case, sanctions ordered pursuant to a court's inherent power to sanction litigation misconduct must be limited to the amount of legal fees caused by that misconduct.  But it determined that in cases of particularly egregious behavior, a court can award a party all of the attorney's fees incurred in a case, without any need to find a \"causal link between [the expenses and] the sanctionable conduct.\"  906 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 938, 975.  As further support for its award, the District Court concluded that full and timely disclosure of the test results would likely have led Goodyear to settle the case much earlier.  Acknowledging that the Ninth Circuit might require a link between the misconduct and the harm caused, however, the court also made a contingent award of $2 million.  That smaller amount, designed to take effect if the Ninth Circuit reversed the larger award, deducted $700,000 in fees the Haegers incurred in developing claims against other defendants and proving their own medical damages.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the full $2.7 million award, concluding that the District Court had properly awarded the Haegers all the fees they incurred during the time when Goodyear was acting in bad faith. \nHeld:\u00a0When a federal court exercises its inherent authority to sanction bad-faith conduct by ordering a litigant to pay the other side's legal fees, the award is limited to the fees the innocent party incurred solely because of the misconduct--or put another way, to the fees that party would not have incurred but for the bad faith.  Pp.\u00a05-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Federal courts possess certain inherent powers, including \"the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.\"  Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.\u00a0S. 32, 44-45.  One permissible sanction is an assessment of attorney's fees against a party that acts in bad faith.  Such a sanction must be compensatory, rather than punitive, when imposed pursuant to civil procedures.  See Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U.\u00a0S. 821, 826-830.  A sanction counts as compensatory only if it is \"calibrate[d] to [the] damages caused by\" the bad-faith acts on which it is based.  Id., at 834.  Hence the need for a court to establish a causal link between the litigant's misbehavior and legal fees paid by the opposing party.  That kind of causal connection is appropriately framed as a but-for test, meaning a court may award only those fees that the innocent party would not have incurred in the absence of litigation misconduct.  That standard generally demands that a district court assess and allocate specific litigation expenses--yet still allows it to exercise discretion and judgment.  Fox v. Vice, 563 U.\u00a0S. 826, 836.  And in exceptional cases, that standard allows a court to avoid segregating individual expense items by shifting all of a party's fees, from either the start or some midpoint of a suit.  Pp.\u00a05-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Here, the parties largely agree about the pertinent law but dispute what it means for this case.  Goodyear contends that it requires throwing out the fee award and instructing the trial court to consider the matter anew.  The Haegers maintain, to the contrary, that the award can stand because both courts below articulated and applied the appropriate but-for causation standard, or, even if they did not, the fee award in fact passes a but-for test.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Haegers' defense of the lower courts' reasoning is a non-starter: Neither court used the correct legal standard.  The District Court specifically disclaimed the need for a causal link on the ground that this was a \"truly egregious\" case.  906 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 975.  And the Ninth Circuit found that the trial court could grant all attorney's fees incurred \"during the time when [Goodyear was] acting in bad faith,\" 813 F.\u00a03d 1233, 1249--a temporal, not causal, limitation.  A sanctioning court must determine which fees were incurred because of, and solely because of, the misconduct at issue, and no such finding lies behind the $2.7 million award made and affirmed below.  Nor is this Court inclined to fill in the gap, as the Haegers urge.  As an initial matter, the Haegers have not shown that this litigation would have settled as soon as Goodyear divulged the heat-test results (a showing that would justify an all-fees award from the moment Goodyear was supposed to disclose).  Further, they cannot demonstrate that Goodyear's non-disclosure so permeated the suit as to make that misconduct a but-for cause of every subsequent legal expense, totaling the full $2.7 million.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the District Court considered causation in arriving at its back-up award of $2 million, it is unclear whether its understanding of that requirement corresponds to the appropriate standard--an uncertainty pointing toward throwing out the fee award and instructing the trial court to consider the matter anew.  However, the Haegers contend that Goodyear has waived any ability to challenge the contingent award since the $2 million sum reflects Goodyear's own submission that only about $700,000 of the fees sought would have been incurred regardless of the company's behavior.  The Court of Appeals did not address that issue, and this Court declines to decide it in the first instance.  The possibility of waiver should therefore be the initial order of business on remand.  Pp.\u00a09-13.\n813 F.\u00a03d 1233, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Gorsuch, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNOTICE:\u2002This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports.\u2003Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.\u00a0C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.\nNo. 15-1406\nGOODYEAR TIRE & RUBBER COMPANY, PETITIONER v.

We hold that such an order is limited to the fees the innocent party incurred solely because of the misconduct--or put another way, to the fees that party would not have incurred but for the bad faith.  A district court has broad discretion to calculate fee awards under that standard.  But because the court here granted legal fees beyond those resulting from the litigation misconduct, its award cannot stand.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents Leroy, Donna, Barry, and Suzanne Haeger sued the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (among other defendants) after the family's motorhome swerved off the road and flipped over.1  The Haegers alleged that the failure of a Goodyear G159 tire on the vehicle caused the accident: Their theory was that the tire was not designed to withstand the level of heat it generated when used on a motorhome at highway speeds.  Discovery in the case lasted several years--and itself generated considerable heat.  The Haegers repeatedly asked Goodyear to turn over internal test results for the G159, but the company's responses were both slow in coming and unrevealing in content.  After making the District Court referee some of their more contentious discovery battles, the parties finally settled the case (for a still-undisclosed sum) on the eve of trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some months later, the Haegers' lawyer learned from a newspaper article that, in another lawsuit involving the G159, Goodyear had disclosed a set of test results he had never seen.  That data indicated that the G159 got unusually hot at speeds of between 55 and 65 miles per hour.  In ensuing correspondence, Goodyear conceded withholding the information from the Haegers even though they had requested (both early and often) \"all testing data\" related to the G159.  Record in No. 2:05-cv-2046 (D Ariz.), Doc. 938, p.\u00a08; see id., Doc. 938-1, at 24, 36; id., Doc. 1044-2, at\u00a025 (filed under seal).  The Haegers accordingly sought sanctions for discovery fraud, claiming that \"Goodyear knowingly concealed crucial 'internal heat test' records related to the [G159's] defective design.\"  Id., Doc. 938, at\u00a01.  That conduct, the Haegers urged, entitled them to attorney's fees and costs expended in the litigation.  See id., at 14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court agreed to make such an award in the exercise of its inherent power to sanction litigation misconduct.2  The court's assessment of Goodyear's actions was harsh (and is not contested here).  Goodyear, the court found, had engaged in a \"years-long course\" of bad-faith behavior.  906 F. Supp. 2d 938, 972 (D Ariz. 2012).  By withholding the G159's test results at every turn, the company and its lawyers had made \"repeated and deliberate attempts to frustrate the resolution of this case on the merits.\"  Id., at 971.  But because the case had already settled, the court had limited options.  It could not take the measure it most wished: an \"entry of default judgment\" against Goodyear.  Id., at 972.  All it could do for the Haegers was to order Goodyear to reimburse them for attorney's fees and costs paid during the suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that award, in the District Court's view, could be comprehensive, covering both expenses that could be causally tied to Goodyear's misconduct and those that could not.  The court calculated that the Haegers had spent $2.7 million in legal fees and costs since the moment, early in the litigation, when Goodyear made its first dishonest discovery response.  And the court awarded the Haegers that entire sum.  In the \"usual[ ]\" case, the court reasoned, \"sanctions under a [c]ourt's inherent power must be limited to the amount [of legal fees] caused by the misconduct.\"  Id., at 974-975 (emphasis deleted).  But this case was not the usual one: Here, \"the sanctionable conduct r[ose] to a truly egregious level.\"  Id., at 975.  And when a litigant behaves that badly, the court opined, \"all of the attorneys' fees incurred in the case [can] be awarded,\" without any need to find a \"causal link between [those expenses and] the sanctionable conduct.\"  Ibid.  As further support for its decision, the court considered the chances that full and timely disclosure of the test results would have affected Goodyear's settlement calculus.  \"While there is some uncertainty,\" the court stated, \"the case more likely than not would have settled much earlier.\"  Id., at 972.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps sensing thin ice, the District Court also made a \"contingent award\" in the event that the Court of Appeals reversed its preferred one.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 180a.  Here, the District Court recognized the possibility that a \"linkage between [Goodyear's] misconduct and [the Haegers'] harm is required.\"  Ibid.  If so, the court stated, its fee award should be reduced to $2 million.  The deduction of $700,000, which was based on estimates Goodyear offered, represented fees that the Haegers incurred in developing claims against other defendants and proving their own medical damages.  See App. 69.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A divided Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the full $2.7 million award.  According to the majority, the District Court acted properly in \"award[ing] the amount [it] reasonably believed\" the Haegers expended in attorney's fees and costs \"during the time when [Goodyear was] acting in bad faith.\"  813 F. 3d 1233, 1250 (2016).  Or repeated in just slightly different words: The District Court \"did not abuse its discretion\" in \"award[ing] the Haegers all their attorneys' fees and costs in prosecuting the action once [Goodyear] began flouting [its] discovery obligations.\"  Id., at 1249.  Judge Watford disagreed.  He would have demanded a \"causal link between Goodyear's misconduct and the fees awarded.\"  Id., at 1255 (dissenting opinion).  The only part of the District Court's opinion that might support such a connection, Judge Watford noted, was its hypothesis that disclosure of the test results would have produced an earlier settlement, and thus obviated the need for further legal expenses.  But Judge Watford thought that theory unpersuasive: Because Goodyear would still have had plausible defenses to the Haegers' suit, \"[i]t's anyone's guess how the litigation would have proceeded\" had timely disclosure occurred.  Ibid.  Accordingly, Judge Watford would have reversed the District Court for awarding fees beyond those \"sustained as a result of Goodyear's misconduct.\"  Id., at 1256.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals' decision created a split of authority: Other Circuits have insisted on limiting sanctions like this one to fees or costs that are causally related to a litigant's misconduct.3  We therefore granted certiorari.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal courts possess certain \"inherent powers,\" not conferred by rule or statute, \"to manage their own affairs so as to achieve the orderly and expeditious disposition of cases.\"  Link v. Wabash R. Co., 370 U.\u00a0S. 626, 630-631 (1962).  That authority includes \"the ability to fashion an appropriate sanction for conduct which abuses the judicial process.\"  Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 U.\u00a0S. 32, 44-45 (1991).  And one permissible sanction is an \"assessment of attorney's fees\"--an order, like the one issued here, instructing a party that has acted in bad faith to reimburse legal fees and costs incurred by the other side.  Id., at 45.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has made clear that such a sanction, when imposed pursuant to civil procedures, must be compensatory rather than punitive in nature.  See Mine Workers v. Bagwell, 512 U.\u00a0S. 821, 826-830 (1994) (distinguishing compensatory from punitive sanctions and specifying the procedures needed to impose each kind).4  In other words, the fee award may go no further than to redress the wronged party \"for losses sustained\"; it may not impose an additional amount as punishment for the sanctioned party's misbehavior.  Id., at 829 (quoting United States v. Mine Workers, 330 U.\u00a0S. 258, 304 (1947)). To level that kind of separate penalty, a court would need to provide procedural guarantees applicable in criminal cases, such as a \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard of proof.  See id., at 826, 832-834, 838-839.  When (as in this case) those criminal-type protections are missing, a court's shifting of fees is limited to reimbursing the victim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That means, pretty much by definition, that the court can shift only those attorney's fees incurred because of the misconduct at issue.  Compensation for a wrong, after all, tracks the loss resulting from that wrong.  So as we have previously noted, a sanction counts as compensatory only if it is \"calibrate[d] to [the] damages caused by\" the bad-faith acts on which it is based.  Id., at 834.  A fee award is so calibrated if it covers the legal bills that the litigation abuse occasioned.  But if an award extends further than that--to fees that would have been incurred without the misconduct--then it crosses the boundary from compensation to punishment.  Hence the need for a court, when using its inherent sanctioning authority (and civil procedures), to establish a causal link--between the litigant's misbehavior and legal fees paid by the opposing party.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That kind of causal connection, as this Court explained in another attorney's fees case, is appropriately framed as a but-for test: The complaining party (here, the Haegers) may recover \"only the portion of his fees that he would not have paid but for\" the misconduct.  Fox v. Vice, 563 U.\u00a0S. 826, 836 (2011); see Paroline v. United States, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12) (\"The traditional way to prove that one event was a factual cause of another is to show that the latter would not have occurred 'but for' the former\").  In Fox, a prevailing defendant sought reimbursement under a fee-shifting statute for legal expenses incurred in defending against several frivolous claims.  See 563 U.\u00a0S., at 830; 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71988.  The trial court granted fees for all legal work relating to those claims--regardless of whether the same work would have been done (for example, the same depositions taken) to contest the non-frivolous claims in the suit.  We made clear that was wrong.  When a \"defendant would have incurred [an] expense in any event[,] he has suffered no incremental harm from the frivolous claim,\" and so the court lacks a basis for shifting the expense.  Fox, 563 U.\u00a0S., at 836.  Substitute \"discovery abuse\" for \"frivolous claim\" in that sentence, and the same thing goes in this case.  Or otherwise said (and again borrowing from Fox), when \"the cost[\u00a0] would have been incurred in the absence of\" the discovery violation, then the court (possessing only the power to compensate for harm the misconduct has caused) must leave it alone.  Id., at 838.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This but-for causation standard generally demands that a district court assess and allocate specific litigation expenses--yet still allows it to exercise discretion and judgment.  The court's fundamental job is to determine whether a given legal fee--say, for taking a deposition or drafting a motion--would or would not have been incurred in the absence of the sanctioned conduct.  The award is then the sum total of the fees that, except for the misbehavior, would not have accrued.  See id., at 837-838 (providing illustrative examples).  But as we stressed in Fox, trial courts undertaking that task \"need not, and indeed should not, become green-eyeshade accountants\" (or whatever the contemporary equivalent is).  Id., at 838.  \"The essential goal\" in shifting fees is \"to do rough justice, not to achieve auditing perfection.\"  Ibid.  Accordingly, a district court \"may take into account [its] overall sense of a suit, and may use estimates in calculating and allocating an attorney's time.\"  Ibid.  The court may decide, for example, that all (or a set percentage) of a particular category of expenses--say, for expert discovery--were incurred solely because of a litigant's bad-faith conduct.  And such judgments, in light of the trial court's \"superior understanding of the litigation,\" are entitled to substantial deference on appeal.  Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.\u00a0S. 424, 437 (1983).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In exceptional cases, the but-for standard even permits a trial court to shift all of a party's fees, from either the start or some midpoint of a suit, in one fell swoop.  Chambers v. NASCO offers one illustration.  There, we approved such an award because literally everything the defendant did--\"his entire course of conduct\" throughout, and indeed preceding, the litigation--was \"part of a sordid scheme\" to defeat a valid claim.  501 U.\u00a0S., at 51, 57 (brackets omitted).  Thus, the district court could reasonably conclude that all legal expenses in the suit \"were caused . . . solely by [his] fraudulent and brazenly unethical efforts.\"  Id., at 58.  Or to flip the example: If a plaintiff initiates a case in complete bad faith, so that every cost of defense is attributable only to sanctioned behavior, the court may again make a blanket award.  And similarly, if a court finds that a lawsuit, absent litigation misconduct, would have settled at a specific time--for example, when a party was legally required to disclose evidence fatal to its position--then the court may grant all fees incurred from that moment on.  In each of those scenarios, a court escapes the grind of segregating individual expense items (a deposition here, a motion there)--or even categories of such items (again, like expert discovery)--but only because all fees in the litigation, or a phase of it, meet the applicable test: They would not have been incurred except for the misconduct.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is an oddity of this case that both sides agree with just about everything said in the last six paragraphs about the pertinent law.  Do legal fees awarded under a court's inherent sanctioning authority have to be compensatory rather than punitive when civil litigation procedures are used?  The Haegers and Goodyear alike say yes.  Does that mean the fees awarded must be causally related to the sanctioned party's misconduct?  A joint yes on that too.  More specifically, does the appropriate causal test limit the fees, a la Fox, to those that would not have been incurred but for the bad faith?  No argument there either.  And in an exceptional case, such as Chambers, could that test produce an award extending as far as all of the wronged party's legal fees?  Once again, agreement (if with differing degrees of enthusiasm).  See Brief for Petitioner 17, 23-24, 31; Brief for Respondents 17-18, 22-23; Tr. of Oral Arg. 34-35, 46-47.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All the parties really argue about here is what that law means for this case.  Goodyear contends that it requires throwing out the trial court's fee award and instructing the court to consider the matter anew.  The Haegers maintain, to the contrary, that the award can stand.  They initially contend--pointing to a couple of passages from the Ninth Circuit's opinion--that both courts below articulated and applied the very but-for causation standard we have laid out.  See Brief for Respondents 17-18 (highlighting the Ninth Circuit's statements that Goodyear's \"bad faith conduct caused significant harm\" and that the District Court \"determine[d] the appropriate amount of fees to award as sanctions to compensate the [Haegers] for the damages they suffered as a result of [Goodyear's] bad faith\").  And even if we reject that view, the Haegers continue, we may uphold the fee award on the ground that it in fact passes a but-for test.  That standard is satisfied (so they say) for either of two reasons.  First, because the case would have settled as soon as Goodyear disclosed the requested heat-test results, thus putting an end to the Haegers' legal bills.  Or second, because (settlement prospects aside) the withholding of that data so infected the lawsuit as to account for each and every expense the Haegers subsequently incurred.  See id., at 14-15, 22, 26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Haegers' defense of the lower courts' reasoning is a non-starter: Neither of them used the correct legal standard.  As earlier recounted, the District Court specifically disclaimed the \"usual[ ]\" need to find a \"causal link\" between misconduct and fees when the sanctioned party's behavior was bad enough--in the court's words, when it \"r[ose] to a truly egregious level.\"  906 F. Supp. 2d, at 975 (emphasis deleted); see supra, at 3.  In such circumstances, the court thought, it could award \"all\" fees, including those that would have been incurred in the absence of the misconduct.  906 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 975.  And the court confirmed that approach even while conceding that it might be wrong: By issuing a \"contingent award\" of $2 million, meant to go into effect if the Ninth Circuit demanded a causal \"linkage between the misconduct and harm,\" the District Court made clear that its primary, $2.7 million award was not so confined.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 180a; see supra, at 4.  Still, the Court of Appeals left the larger sanction in place, because it too mistook what findings were needed to support that award.  In the Ninth Circuit's view, the trial court could grant all attorney's fees incurred \"during the time when [Goodyear was] acting in bad faith.\"  813 F. 3d, at 1250 (emphasis added); see id., at 1249 (permitting an award of fees incurred \"once [Goodyear] began flouting [its] discovery obligations\" (emphasis added)); supra, at 4.  But that is a temporal limitation, not a causal one; and, like the District Court's \"egregiousness\" requirement, it is wide of the mark.  A sanctioning court must determine which fees were incurred because of, and solely because of, the misconduct at issue (however serious, or concurrent with a lawyer's work, it might have been).  No such finding lies behind the $2.7 million award made and affirmed below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor are we tempted to fill in that gap, as the Haegers have invited us to do.  As an initial matter, the Haegers have not shown that this litigation would have settled as soon as Goodyear divulged the heat-test results (thus justifying an all-fees award from the moment it was supposed to disclose, see supra, at 8-9).  Even the District Court did not go quite that far: In attempting to buttress its comprehensive award, it said only (and after expressing \"some uncertainty\") that the suit probably would have settled \"much earlier.\"  906 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 972.  And that more limited finding is itself subject to grave doubt, even taking into account the deference owed to the trial court.  As Judge Watford reasoned, the test results, although favorable to the Haegers' version of events, did not deprive Goodyear of colorable defenses.  In particular, Goodyear still could have argued, as it had from the beginning, that \"the Haegers' own tire, which had endured more than 40,000 miles of wear and tear, failed because it struck road debris.\"  813 F. 3d, at 1256 (dissenting opinion).  And indeed, that is pretty much the course Goodyear took in another suit alleging that the G159 caused a motorhome accident.  See Schalmo v. Goodyear, No. 51-2006-CA-2064-WS (Fla. Cir. Ct., 6th Cir., Pasco County).  In that case (as Judge Watford again observed), Goodyear produced the very test results at issue here, yet still elected to go to trial.  See 813 F.\u00a03d, at 1256. So we do not think the record allows a finding, as would support the $2.7 million award, that disclosure of the heat-test results would have led straightaway to a settlement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the Haegers cannot demonstrate that Goodyear's non-disclosure so permeated the suit as to make that misconduct a but-for cause of every subsequent legal expense, totaling the full $2.7 million.  If nothing else, the District Court's back-up fee award belies that theory.  After introducing a causal element into the equation, the court found that the $700,000 of fees that the Haegers incurred in litigating against other defendants and proving their own medical damages had nothing to do with Goodyear's discovery decisions.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 180a; supra, at 4.  The Haegers have failed to offer any concrete reason for questioning that judgment, and we do not see how they could.  At a minimum, then, the sanction order could not force Goodyear to reimburse those expenses--because, again, the Haegers would have paid them even had the company behaved immaculately in every respect.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That leaves the question whether the contingent $2 million award should now stand--or, alternatively, whether the District Court must reconsider from scratch which fees to shift.  In the absence of any waiver issue, we would insist on the latter course.  Although the District Court considered causation in arriving at its back-up award, we cannot tell from its sparse discussion whether its understanding of that requirement corresponds to the standard we have described.  That uncertainty points toward demanding a do-over, under the unequivocally right legal rules.  But the Haegers contend that Goodyear has waived any ability to challenge the $2 million award.  In their view, that sum reflected Goodyear's own submission--which it may not now amend--that only about $700,000 of the fees sought would have been incurred \"regardless of Goodyear's behavior.\"  App. 69; see Brief for Respondents 41; supra, at 4.  The Court of Appeals did not previously address that issue, and we decline to decide it in the first instance.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n. 7 (2005) (\"[W]e are a court of review, not of first view\").  The possibility of waiver should therefore be the initial order of business below.  If a waiver is found, that is the end of this case.  If not, the District Court must reassess fees in line with a but-for causation requirement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The additional defendants named in the Haegers' complaint were Gulf Stream Coach, the manufacturer of the motorhome, and Spartan Motors, the manufacturer of the vehicle's chassis.  In the course of the litigation, the Haegers reached a settlement with Gulf Stream, and the District Court granted Spartan's motion for summary judgment.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The court reasoned that no statute or rule enabled it to reach all the offending behavior.  Sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, the court thought, should not be imposed after final judgment in a case.  See 906 F. Supp. 2d 938, 973, n. 24 (D Ariz. 2012).  And sanctions under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71927, it noted, could address the wrongdoing of only Goodyear's attorneys, rather than of Goodyear itself.  See 906 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 973.\nFootnote 3\u00a0See, e.g., Plaintiffs' Baycol Steering Comm. v. Bayer Corp., 419 F.\u00a03d 794, 808 (CA8 2005); Bradley v. American Household, Inc., 378 F.\u00a03d 373, 378 (CA4 2004); United States v. Dowell, 257 F.\u00a03d 694, 699 (CA7 2001).\nFootnote 4\u00a0Bagwell also addressed \"coercive\" sanctions, designed to make a party comply with a court order.  512 U.\u00a0S., at 829.  That kind of sanction is not at issue here.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Rule-based and statutory sanction regimes similarly require courts to find such a causal connection before shifting fees.  For example, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a district court may order a party to pay attorney's fees \"caused by\" discovery misconduct, Rule\u00a037(b)(2)(C), or \"directly resulting from\" misrepresentations in pleadings, motions, and other papers, Rule\u00a011(c)(4).  And under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71927, a court may require an attorney who unreasonably multiplies proceedings to pay attorney's fees incurred \"because of\" that misconduct.  Those provisions confirm the need to establish a causal link between misconduct and fees when acting under inherent authority, given that such undelegated powers should be exercised with especial \"restraint and discretion.\"  Roadway Express, Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.\u00a0S. 752, 764 (1980).\n\n\n","28":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nGREG ABBOTT, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, ET AL.  v.

See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.\u00a0S. 205, 210-213.  In contrast, a time limit prescribed only in a court-made rule is not jurisdictional.  It is a mandatory claim-processing rule that may be waived or forfeited.  Ibid.  This Court and other forums have sometimes overlooked this critical distinction.  See Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.\u00a0S. 154, 161.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Charmaine Hamer filed an employment discrimination suit against respondents.  The District Court granted respondents' motion for summary judgment, entering final judgment on September 14, 2015.  Before October 14, the date Hamer's notice of appeal was due, her attorneys filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and a motion for an extension of the appeal filing deadline to give Hamer time to secure new counsel.  The District Court granted both motions, extending the deadline to December 14, a two-month extension, even though the governing Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure, Rule 4(a)(5)(C), confines such extensions to 30 days.  Concluding that Rule 4(a)(5)(C)'s time prescription is jurisdictional, the Court of Appeals dismissed Hamer's appeal.\nHeld:\u00a0The Court of Appeals erred in treating as jurisdictional Rule 4(a)(5)(C)'s limitation on extensions of time to file a notice of appeal.  Pp.\u00a05-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The 1948 version of 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72107 allowed extensions of time to file a notice of appeal, not exceeding 30 days, \"upon a showing of excusable neglect based on failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment,\" but the statute said nothing about extensions when the judgment loser did receive notice of the entry of judgment.  In 1991, the statute was amended, broadening the class of prospective appellants who could gain extensions to include all who showed \"excusable neglect or good cause\" and reducing the time prescription for appellants who lacked notice of the entry of judgment from 30 to 14 days.  \u00a72107(c).  For other cases, the statute does not say how long an extension may run.  Rule 4(a)(5)(C), however, does prescribe a limit: \"No extension [of time for filing a notice of appeal] may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time [for filing a notice of appeal] or 14 days after the date [of] the order granting the [extension] motion\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. , whichever is later.\"  Pp.\u00a05-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0This Court's precedent shapes a rule of decision that is both clear and easy to apply: If a time prescription governing the transfer of adjudicatory authority from one Article III court to another appears in a statute, the limitation is jurisdictional; otherwise, the time specification fits within the claim-processing category.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In concluding otherwise, the Court of Appeals relied on Bowles.  There, Bowles filed a notice of appeal outside a limitation set by Congress in \u00a72107(c).  This Court held that, as a result, the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over his tardy appeal.  551 U.\u00a0S., at 213.  In conflating Rule 4(a)(5)(C) with \u00a72107(c) here, the Seventh Circuit failed to grasp the distinction between jurisdictional appeal filing deadlines and deadlines stated only in mandatory claim-processing rules.  It therefore misapplied Bowles.  Bowles's statement that \"the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is 'mandatory and jurisdictional,'\u00a0\" id., at 209, is a characterization left over from days when the Court was \"less than meticulous\" in using the term \"jurisdictional,\" Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.\u00a0S. 443, 454.  The statement was correct in Bowles, where the time prescription was imposed by Congress, but it would be incorrect here, where only Rule 4(a)(5)(C) limits the length of the extension.

In Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.\u00a0S. 205, 210-213 (2007), this Court clarified that an appeal filing deadline prescribed by statute will be regarded as \"jurisdictional,\" meaning that late filing of the appeal notice necessitates dismissal of the appeal.  But a time limit prescribed only in a court-made rule, Bowles acknowledged, is not jurisdictional; it is, instead, a mandatory claim-processing rule subject to forfeiture if not properly raised by the appellee.  Ibid.; Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.\u00a0S. 443, 456 (2004).  Because the Court of Appeals held jurisdictional a time limit specified in a rule, not in a statute, 835 F.\u00a03d 761, 763 (CA7 2016), we vacate that court's judgment dismissing the appeal.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Only Congress may determine a lower federal court's subject-matter jurisdiction.\"  Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 452 (citing U.\u00a0S.

Kroger, 437 U.\u00a0S. 365, 370 (1978) (\"[I]t is axiomatic that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure do not create or withdraw federal jurisdiction.\").  Accordingly, a provision governing the time to appeal in a civil action qualifies as jurisdictional only if Congress sets the time.  See Bowles, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 211-212 (noting \"the jurisdictional distinction between court-promulgated rules and limits enacted by Congress\"); Sibbach v. Wilson & Co., 312 U.\u00a0S. 1, 10 (1941) (noting \"the inability of a court, by rule, to extend or restrict the jurisdiction conferred by a statute\").  A time limit not prescribed by Congress ranks as a mandatory claim-processing rule, serving \"to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.\"  Henderson v.

Muchnick, 559 U.\u00a0S. 154, 161 (2010).  But prevailing precedent makes the distinction critical.  Failure to comply with a jurisdictional time prescription, we have maintained, deprives a court of adjudicatory authority over the case, necessitating dismissal--a \"drastic\" result.  Shinseki, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 435; Bowles, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 213 (\"[W]hen an 'appeal has not been prosecuted .\u00a0.\u00a0. within the time limited by the acts of Congress, it must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.'\u00a0\" (quoting United States v. Curry, 6 How. 106, 113 (1848))).  The jurisdictional defect is not subject to waiver or forfeiture1 and may be raised at any time in the court of first instance and on direct appeal.  Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 455.2  In contrast to the ordinary operation of our adversarial system, courts are obliged to notice jurisdictional issues and raise them on their own initiative.

Code, as enacted in 1948, allowed extensions of the time to file a notice of appeal, not exceeding 30 days, \"upon a showing of excusable neglect based on failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment.\"  Act of June 25, 1948, \u00a72107, 62 Stat. 963.6  Nothing in the statute provided for extension of the time to file a notice of appeal when, as in this case, the judgment loser did receive notice of the entry of judgment.  In 1991, Congress broadened the class of persons who could gain extensions to include all prospective appellants who showed \"excusable neglect or good cause.\"  \u00a712, 105 Stat. 1627.  In addition, Congress retained a time prescription covering appellants who lacked notice of the entry of judgment: \"[A] party entitled to notice of the entry of a judgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. [who] did not receive such notice from the clerk or any party within 21 days of [the judgment's] entry\" qualifies for a 14-day extension,7 if \"no party would be prejudiced [thereby].\"  \u00a72107(c).  In full, \u00a72107(c) now provides:\n\"(c) The district court may, upon motion filed not later than 30 days after the expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a showing of excusable neglect or good cause.  In addition, if the district court finds--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(1) that a party entitled to notice of the entry of a judgment or order did not receive such notice from the clerk or any party within 21 days of its entry, and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(2) that no party would be prejudiced,\n\"the district court may, upon motion filed within 180 days after entry of the judgment or order or within 14 days after receipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order reopening the time for appeal.\"\nIn short, current \u00a72107(c), like the provision as initially enacted, specifies the length of an extension for cases in which the appellant lacked notice of the entry of judgment.8  For other cases, the statute does not say how long an extension may run.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)(C) does prescribe a limit: \"No extension [of time for filing a notice of appeal] may exceed 30 days after the prescribed time [for filing a notice of appeal] or 14 days after the date [of] the order granting the [extension] motion .\u00a0.\u00a0. , whichever is later.\"  Unlike \u00a72107(c), we note, Rule 4(a)(5)(C) limits extensions of time to file a notice of appeal in all circumstances, not just in cases in which the prospective appellant lacked notice of the entry of judgment.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although Rule 4(a)(5)(C)'s limit on extensions of time appears nowhere in the text of \u00a72107(c), respondents now contend that Rule 4(a)(5)(C) has a \"statutory basis\" because \u00a72107(c) once limited extensions (to the extent it did authorize them) to 30 days.  Brief for Respondents 17.  No matter, respondents submit, that Congress struck the 30-day limit in 1991 and replaced it with a 14-day limit governing, as the 30-day limit did, only lack-of-notice cases; deleting the 30-day prescription, respondents conjecture, was \"probably inadverten[t].\"  Id., at 1.  In support of their argument that Congress accidentally failed to impose an all-purpose limit on extensions, respondents observe that the 1991 statute identifies Congress' aim as the enactment of \"certain technical corrections in .\u00a0.\u00a0. provisions of law relating to the courts.\"  105 Stat. 1623.  They also note the caption of the relevant section of the amending statute: \"Conformity with Rules of Appellate Procedure.\"  Id., at 1627.  Because striking the 30-day limit from \u00a72107 made the statute less like Rule 4(a)(5)(C), respondents reason, Congress likely erased the relevant paragraph absentmindedly.  Hence, respondents conclude, \"there is no reason to interpret the 1991 amendment as stripping Rule 4(a)(5)(C) of its jurisdictional significance.\"  Brief for Respondents 2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Overlooked by respondents, pre-1991 \u00a72107 never spoke to extensions for reasons other than lack of notice.  In any event, we resist speculating whether Congress acted inadvertently.  See Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., 582 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 9-10) (\"[W]e will not presume with [respondents] that any result consistent with their account of the statute's overarching goal must be the law but will presume more modestly instead 'that [the] legislature says .\u00a0.\u00a0. what it means and means .\u00a0.\u00a0. what it says.'\u00a0\" (quoting Dodd v. United States, 545 U.\u00a0S. 353, 357 (2005))); Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.\u00a0S. 320, 334 (2010) (\"We cannot replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress' intent.\").  The rule of decision our precedent shapes is both clear and easy to apply: If a time prescription governing the transfer of adjudicatory authority from one Article III court to another appears in a statute, the limitation is jurisdictional, supra, at 2; otherwise, the time specification fits within the claim-processing category, ibid.9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In dismissing Hamer's appeal for want of jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on our decision in Bowles.  We therefore reiterate what that precedent conveys.  There, petitioner Keith Bowles did not receive timely notice of the entry of a postjudgment order and consequently failed to file a timely notice of appeal.  Bowles v. Russell, 432 F.\u00a03d 668, 670 (CA6 2005).  When Bowles learned of the postjudgment order, he moved for an extension under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6), which implements \u00a72107(c)'s authorization of extensions in lack-of-notice cases.  Ibid.  The District Court granted Bowles's motion, but inexplicably provided a 17-day extension, rather than the 14-day extension authorized by \u00a72107(c).  Bowles, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 207.  Bowles filed his notice of appeal within the 17 days allowed by the District Court but outside the 14 days allowed by \u00a72107(c).  Ibid.  \"Because Congress specifically limited the amount of time by which district courts can extend the notice-of-appeal period in \u00a72107(c),\" we explained, the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over Bowles's tardy appeal.  Id., at 213.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Quoting Bowles at length, the Court of Appeals in this case reasoned that \"[l]ike Rule 4(a)(6), Rule 4(a)(5)(C) is the vehicle by which \u00a72107(c) is employed and it limits a district court's authority to extend the notice of appeal filing deadline to no more than an additional 30 days.\"  835 F.\u00a03d, at 763.  In conflating Rule 4(a)(5)(C) with \u00a72107(c), the Court of Appeals failed to grasp the distinction our decisions delineate between jurisdictional appeal filing deadlines and mandatory claim-processing rules, and therefore misapplied Bowles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several Courts of Appeals,10 including the Court of Appeals in Hamer's case, have tripped over our statement in Bowles that \"the taking of an appeal within the prescribed time is 'mandatory and jurisdictional.'\u00a0\"  551 U.\u00a0S., at 209 (quoting Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.\u00a0S. 56, 61 (1982) (per curiam)).  The \"mandatory and jurisdictional\" formulation is a characterization left over from days when we were \"less than meticulous\" in our use of the term \"jurisdictional.\"  Kontrick, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 454.11  The statement was correct as applied in Bowles because, as the Court there explained, the time prescription at issue in Bowles was imposed by Congress.  551 U.\u00a0S., at 209-213.  But \"mandatory and jurisdictional\" is erroneous and confounding terminology where, as here, the relevant time prescription is absent from the U.\u00a0S. Code.  Because Rule 4(a)(5)(C), not \u00a72107, limits the length of the extension granted here, the time prescription is not jurisdictional.  See Youkelsone v. FDIC, 660 F.\u00a03d 473, 475 (CADC 2011) (\"Rule 4(a)(5)(C)'s thirty-day limit on the length of any extension ultimately granted appears nowhere in the U.\u00a0S. Code.\").\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the Court of Appeals erroneously treated as jurisdictional Rule 4(a)(5)(C)'s 30-day limitation on extensions of time to file a notice of appeal.  We therefore vacate that court's judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.  We note, in this regard, that our decision does not reach issues raised by Hamer, but left unaddressed by the Court of Appeals, including: (1) whether respondents' failure to raise any objection in the District Court to the overlong time extension, by itself, effected a forfeiture, see Brief for Petitioner 21-22; (2) whether respondents could gain review of the District Court's time extension only by filing their own appeal notice, see id., at 23-27; and (3) whether equitable considerations may occasion an exception to Rule 4(a)(5)(C)'s time constraint, see id., at 29-43.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The terms waiver and forfeiture--though often used interchange-ably by jurists and litigants--are not synonymous.  \"[F]orfeiture is the failure to make the timely assertion of a right[;] waiver is the 'intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.'\u00a0\"  United States v. Olano, 507 U.\u00a0S. 725, 733 (1993) (quoting Johnson v. Zerbst, 304 U.\u00a0S. 458, 464 (1938)).\nFootnote 2\u00a0Subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be attacked collaterally, however.  Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.\u00a0S. 443, 455, n. 9 (2004) (citing Des Moines Nav. & R. Co. v. Iowa Homestead Co., 123 U.\u00a0S. 552, 557-559 (1887)).\nFootnote 3\u00a0We have reserved whether mandatory claim-processing rules may be subject to equitable exceptions.

In fact, respondents maintained that \"the timeliness of Hamer's appeal d[id] not appear to be jurisdictional according to [Circuit] law.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71 (capitalization and footnote omitted).  That was so, respondents explained, because \"the time limits found [in] Fed. R[ule] App. P[roc.] 4(a)(5)(C) .\u00a0.\u00a0. lack a statutory basis.\"  Id., at 77.  Even if not jurisdictional, respondents continued, the Rule is mandatory and must be observed unless forfeited or waived.  Ibid.\nFootnote 6\u00a0As enacted, the pertinent paragraph of \u00a72107 provided in full: \"The district court, in any such action, suit or proceeding, may extend the time for appeal not exceeding thirty days from the expiration of the original time herein prescribed, upon a showing of excusable neglect based on failure of a party to learn of the entry of the judgment, order or decree.\"  Act of June 25, 1948, \u00a72107, 62 Stat. 963.\nFootnote 7\u00a0The 14-day prescription cuts back the original limit of 30 days.\nFootnote 8\u00a0The statute describes the 14-day extension permitted in lack-of-notice cases as a \"reopening [of] the time for appeal.\"  \u00a72107(c).  The \"reopening\" period is the functional equivalent of an extension.  See Brief for American Academy of Appellate Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 5-6.\nFootnote 9\u00a0In cases not involving the timebound transfer of adjudicatory authority from one Article III court to another, we have additionally applied a clear-statement rule: \"A rule is jurisdictional '[i]f the Legislature clearly states that a threshold limitation on a statute's scope shall count as jurisdictional.'\u00a0\"  Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 134, 141 (2012) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.\u00a0S. 500, 515 (2006)).  See also, e.g., Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.\u00a0S. 428, 431 (2011) (statutory deadline for filing notice of appeal with Article I tribunal held not jurisdictional).  \"This is not to say that Congress must incant magic words in order to speak clearly,\" however.  Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U.\u00a0S. 145, 153 (2013).  In determining whether Congress intended a particular provision to be jurisdictional, \"[w]e consider 'context, including this Court's interpretations of similar provisions in many years past,' as probative of [Congress' intent].\"  Id., at 153-154 (quoting Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U.\u00a0S. 154, 168 (2010)).  Even so, \"in applying th[e] clear statement rule, we have made plain that most [statutory] time bars are nonjurisdictional.\"  United States v.

Robinson, 361 U.\u00a0S. 220, 224 (1960).  We have since clarified that \"Robinson is correct not because the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, but because district courts must observe the clear limits of the Rules of Criminal Procedure when they are properly invoked.\"  Eberhart v.

SANTANDER CONSUMER USA INC.(2017)\nNo. 16-349\nArgued: April 18, 2017Decided: June 12, 2017\n\n\nThe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act authorizes private lawsuits and weighty fines designed to deter the wayward practices of \"debt collector[s],\" a term embracing anyone who \"regularly collects or attempts to collect .\u00a0.\u00a0. debts owed or due .\u00a0.\u00a0. another.\"  15\u00a0U.\u00a0S. C. \u00a71692a(6).  The complaint filed in this case alleges that CitiFinancial Auto loaned money to petitioners seeking to buy cars; that petitioners defaulted on those loans; and that respondent Santander then purchased the defaulted loans from CitiFinancial and sought to collect in ways petitioners believe violated the Act.  The district court and Fourth Circuit held that Santander didn't qualify as a debt collector because it did not regularly seek to collect debts \"owed .\u00a0.\u00a0. another\" but sought instead only to collect debts that it purchased and owned. \nHeld:\u00a0A company may collect debts that it purchased for its own account, like Santander did here, without triggering the statutory definition in dispute.  By defining debt collectors to include those who regularly seek to collect debts \"owed .\u00a0.\u00a0. another,\" the statute's plain language seems to focus on third party collection agents regularly collecting for a debt owner--not on a debt owner seeking to collect debts for itself.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners' arguments to the contrary do not dislodge the statute's plain meaning.  Petitioners point out that the word \"owed\" is the past participle of the verb \"to owe,\" and so suggest that the debt collector definition must exclude loan originators (who never seek to collect debts previously owed someone else) but embrace debt purchasers like Santander (who necessarily do).  But past participles like \"owed\" are routinely used as adjectives to describe the present state of a thing.  Congress also used the word \"owed\" to refer to present debt relationships in neighboring provisions of the Act, and petitioners have not rebutted the presumption that identical words in the same statute carry the same meaning.  Neither would reading the word \"owed\" to refer to present debt relationships render any of the Act's provisions surplusage, contrary to what petitioners suggest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners also contend that their interpretation best furthers the Act's perceived purposes because, they primarily argue, if Congress had been aware of defaulted debt purchasers like Santander it would have treated them like traditional debt collectors because they pose similar risks of abusive collection practices.  But it is not this Court's job to rewrite a constitutionally valid text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have done had it faced a question that, on everyone's account, it never faced.  And neither are petitioners' policy arguments unassailable, as reasonable legislators might contend both ways on the question of how defaulted debt purchasers should be treated.  This fact suggests for certain but one thing: that these are matters for Congress, not this Court, to resolve.

From that scrutiny emerged the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a statute that authorizes private lawsuits and weighty fines designed to deter wayward collection practices.  So perhaps it comes as little surprise that we now face a question about who exactly qualifies as a \"debt collector\" subject to the Act's rigors.  Everyone agrees that the term embraces the repo man--someone hired by a creditor to collect an outstanding debt.  But what if you purchase a debt and then try to collect it for yourself--does that make you a \"debt collector\" too?  That's the nub of the dispute now before us.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties approach the question from common ground.  The complaint alleges that CitiFinancial Auto loaned money to petitioners seeking to buy cars; that petitioners defaulted on those loans; that respondent Santander then purchased the defaulted loans from CitiFinancial; and that Santander sought to collect in ways petitioners believe troublesome under the Act.  The parties agree, too, that in deciding whether Santander's conduct falls within the Act's ambit we should look to statutory language defining the term \"debt collector\" to embrace anyone who \"regularly collects or attempts to collect .\u00a0.\u00a0. debts owed or due .\u00a0.\u00a0. another.\"  15\u00a0U.\u00a0S. C. \u00a71692a(6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even when it comes to that question, the parties agree on at least part of an answer.  Both sides accept that third party debt collection agents generally qualify as \"debt collectors\" under the relevant statutory language, while those who seek only to collect for themselves loans they originated generally do not.  These results follow, the parties tell us, because debt collection agents seek to collect debts \"owed .\u00a0.\u00a0. another,\" while loan originators acting on their own account aim only to collect debts owed to themselves.  All that remains in dispute is how to classify individuals and entities who regularly purchase debts originated by someone else and then seek to collect those debts for their own account.  Does the Act treat the debt purchaser in that scenario more like the repo man or the loan originator?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For their part, the district court and Fourth Circuit sided with Santander.  They held that the company didn't qualify as a debt collector because it didn't regularly seek to collect debts \"owed .\u00a0.\u00a0. another\" but sought instead only to collect debts that it purchased and owned.  At the same time, the Fourth Circuit acknowledged that some circuits faced with the same question have ruled otherwise--and it is to resolve this conflict that we took the case.  Compare 817 F.\u00a03d 131, 133-134, 137-138 (2016) (case below); Davidson v. Capital One Bank (USA), N.\u00a0A., 797 F.\u00a03d 1309, 1315-1316 (CA11 2015), with McKinney v. Caldeway Properties, Inc., 548 F.\u00a03d 496, 501 (CA7 2008); FTC v. Check Investors, Inc., 502 F.\u00a03d 159, 173-174 (CA3 2007).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before attending to that job, though, we pause to note two related questions we do not attempt to answer today.  First, petitioners suggest that Santander can qualify as a debt collector not only because it regularly seeks to collect for its own account debts that it has purchased, but also because it regularly acts as a third party collection agent for debts owed to others.  Petitioners did not, however, raise the latter theory in their petition for certiorari and neither did we agree to review it.  Second, the parties briefly allude to another statutory definition of the term \"debt collector\"--one that encompasses those engaged \"in any business the principal purpose of which is the collection of any debts.\"  \u00a71692a(6).  But the parties haven't much litigated that alternative definition and in granting certiorari we didn't agree to address it either.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With these preliminaries by the board, we can turn to the much narrowed question properly before us.  In doing so, we begin, as we must, with a careful examination of the statutory text.  And there we find it hard to disagree with the Fourth Circuit's interpretive handiwork.  After all, the Act defines debt collectors to include those who regularly seek to collect debts \"owed .\u00a0.\u00a0. another.\"  And by its plain terms this language seems to focus our attention on third party collection agents working for a debt owner--not on a debt owner seeking to collect debts for itself.  Neither does this language appear to suggest that we should care how a debt owner came to be a debt owner--whether the owner originated the debt or came by it only through a later purchase.  All that matters is whether the target of the lawsuit regularly seeks to collect debts for its own account or does so for \"another.\"  And given that, it would seem a debt purchaser like Santander may indeed collect debts for its own account without triggering the statutory definition in dispute, just as the Fourth Circuit explained.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners reply that this seemingly straightforward reading overlooks an important question of tense.  They observe that the word \"owed\" is the past participle of the verb \"to owe.\"  And this, they suggest, means the statute's definition of debt collector captures anyone who regularly seeks to collect debts previously \"owed .\u00a0.\u00a0. another.\"  So it is that, on petitioners' account, the statute excludes from its compass loan originators (for they never seek to collect debts previously owed someone else) but embraces many debt purchasers like Santander (for in collecting purchased debts they necessarily seek to collect debts previously owed another).  If Congress wanted to exempt all present debt owners from its debt collector definition, petitioners submit, it would have used the present participle \"owing.\"  That would have better sufficed to do the job--to make clear that you must collect debts currently \"owing .\u00a0.\u00a0. another\" before implicating the Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But this much doesn't follow even as a matter of good grammar, let alone ordinary meaning.  Past participles like \"owed\" are routinely used as adjectives to describe the present state of a thing--so, for example, burnt toast is inedible, a fallen branch blocks the path, and (equally) a debt owed to a current owner may be collected by him or her.  See P. Peters, The Cambridge Guide to English Usage 409 (2004) (explaining that the term \"past participle\" is a \"misnomer[\u00a0], since\" it \"can occur in what is technically a present .\u00a0.\u00a0. tense\").  Just imagine if you told a friend that you were seeking to \"collect a debt owed to Steve.\"  Doesn't it seem likely your friend would understand you as speaking about a debt currently owed to Steve, not a debt Steve used to own and that's now actually yours?  In the end, even petitioners find themselves forced to admit that past participles can and regularly do work just this way, as adjectives to describe the present state of the nouns they modify.  See Brief for Petitioners 28; see also B. Garner, Modern English Usage 666 (4th ed. 2016) (while \"owing .\u00a0.\u00a0. is an old and established usage .\u00a0.\u00a0. the more logical course is simply to write owed\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Widening our view to take in the statutory phrase in which the word \"owed\" appears--\"owed or due .\u00a0.\u00a0. another\"--serves to underscore the point.  Petitioners acknowledge that the word \"due\" describes a debt currently due at the time of collection and not a debt that was due only in some previous period.  Brief for Petitioners 26-28.  So to rule for them we would have to suppose Congress set two words cheek by jowl in the same phrase but meant them to speak to entirely different periods of time.  All without leaving any clue.  We would have to read the phrase not as referring to \"debts that are owed or due another\" but as describing \"debts that were owed or are due another.\"  And supposing such a surreptitious subphrasal shift in time seems to us a bit much.   Neither are we alone in that assessment, for even petitioners acknowledge that theirs \"may not be the most natural interpretation of the phrase standing in isolation.\"  Id., at 26-27.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that, you might wonder whether extending our gaze from the narrow statutory provision at issue to take in the larger statutory landscape might offer petitioners a better perspective.  But it does not.  Looking to other neighboring provisions in the Act, it quickly comes clear that Congress routinely used the word \"owed\" to refer to present (not past) debt relationships.  For example, in one nearby subsection, Congress defined a creditor as someone \"to whom a debt is owed.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692a(4).  In another subsection, too, Congress required a debt collector to identify \"the creditor to whom the debt is owed.\"  \u00a71692g(a)(2).  Yet petitioners offer us no persuasive reason why the word \"owed\" should bear a different meaning here, in the subsection before us, or why we should abandon our usual presumption that \"identical words used in different parts of the same statute\" carry \"the same meaning.\"  IBP, Inc. v. Alvarez, 546 U.\u00a0S. 21, 34 (2005).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still other contextual clues add to petitioners' problems.  While they suggest that the statutory definition before us implicitly distinguishes between loan originators and debt purchasers, a pass through the statute shows that when Congress wished to distinguish between originators and purchasers it left little doubt in the matter.  In the very definitional section where we now find ourselves working, Congress expressly differentiated between a person \"who offers\" credit (the originator) and a person \"to whom a debt is owed\" (the present debt owner).  \u00a71692a(4).  Elsewhere, Congress recognized the distinction between a debt \"originated by\" the collector and a debt \"owed or due\" another.  \u00a71692a(6)(F)(ii).  And elsewhere still, Congress drew a  line between the \"original\" and \"current\" creditor.  \u00a71692g(a)(5).  Yet no similar distinction can be found in the language now before us.  To the contrary, the statutory text at issue speaks not at all about originators and current debt owners but only about whether the defendant seeks to collect on behalf of itself or \"another.\"  And, usually at least, when we're engaged in the business of interpreting statutes we presume differences in language like this convey differences in meaning.  See, e.g., Loughrin v. United States, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even what may be petitioners' best piece of contextual evidence ultimately proves unhelpful to their cause.  Petitioners point out that the Act exempts from the definition of \"debt collector\" certain individuals who have \"obtained\" particular kinds of debt--for example, debts not yet in default or debts connected to secured commercial credit transactions.  \u00a7\u00a71692a(6)(F)(iii) and (F)(iv).  And because these exemptions contemplate the possibility that someone might \"obtain\" a debt \"owed or due .\u00a0.\u00a0. another,\" petitioners submit, the word \"owed\" must refer only to a previous owner.  Ibid.  This conclusion, they say, necessarily follows because, once you have \"obtained\" a debt, that same debt just cannot be currently \"owed or due\" another.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This last and quite essential premise of the argument, however, misses its mark.  As a matter of ordinary English, the word \"obtained\" can (and often does) refer to taking possession of a piece of property without also taking ownership--so, for example, you might obtain a rental car or a hotel room or an apartment.  See, e.g., 10 Oxford English Dictionary 669 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"obtain\" to mean, among other things, \"[t]o come into the possession or enjoyment of (something) by one's own effort or by request\"); Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.\u00a0S. 519, 532-533 (2013) (distinguishing between ownership and obtaining possession).  And it's easy enough to see how you might also come to possess (obtain) a debt without taking ownership of it.  You might, for example, take possession of a debt for servicing and collection even while the debt formally remains owed another.  Or as a secured party you might take possession of a debt as collateral, again without taking full ownership of it.  See, e.g., U.\u00a0C.\u00a0C. \u00a79-207, 3 U. L.\u00a0A. 197 (2010).  So it simply isn't the case that the statute's exclusions imply that the phrase \"owed .\u00a0.\u00a0. another\" must refer to debts previously owed to another.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this point petitioners find themselves in retreat.  Unable to show that debt purchasers regularly collecting for their own account always qualify as debt collectors, they now suggest that purchasers sometimes qualify as debt collectors.  On their view, debt purchasers surely qualify as collectors at least when they regularly purchase and seek to collect defaulted debts--just as Santander allegedly did here.  In support of this narrower and more particular understanding of the Act, petitioners point again to the fact that the statute excludes from the definition of \"debt collector\" certain persons who obtain debts before default.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692a(6)(F)(iii).  This exclusion, petitioners now suggest, implies that the term \"debt collector\" must embrace those who regularly seek to collect debts obtained after default.  Others aligned with petitioners also suggest that the Act treats everyone who attempts to collect a debt as either a \"debt collector\" or a \"creditor,\" but not both.  And because the statutory definition of the term \"creditor\" excludes those who seek to collect a debt obtained \"in default,\" \u00a71692a(4), they contend it again follows as a matter of necessary inference that these persons must qualify as debt collectors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But these alternative lines of inferential argument bear their own problems.  For while the statute surely excludes from the debt collector definition certain persons who acquire a debt before default, it doesn't necessarily follow that the definition must include anyone who regularly collects debts acquired after default.  After all and again, under the definition at issue before us you have to attempt to collect debts owed another before you can ever qualify as a debt collector.  And petitioners' argument simply does not fully confront this plain and implacable textual prerequisite.  Likewise, even spotting (without granting) the premise that a person cannot be both a creditor and a debt collector with respect to a particular debt, we don't see why a defaulted debt purchaser like Santander couldn't qualify as a creditor.  For while the creditor definition excludes persons who \"receive an assignment or transfer of a debt in default,\" it does so only (and yet again) when the debt is assigned or transferred \"solely for the purpose of facilitating collection of such debt for another.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  So a company collecting purchased defaulted debt for its own account--like Santander--would hardly seem to be barred from qualifying as a creditor under the statute's plain terms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Faced with so many obstacles in the text and structure of the Act, petitioners ask us to move quickly on to policy.  Indeed, from the beginning that is the field on which they seem most eager to pitch battle.  Petitioners assert that Congress passed the Act in large measure to add new incentives for independent debt collectors to treat consumers well.  In their view, Congress excluded loan originators from the Act's demands because it thought they already faced sufficient economic and legal incentives to good behavior.  But, on petitioners' account, Congress never had the chance to consider what should be done about those in the business of purchasing defaulted debt.  That's because, petitioners tell us, the \"advent\" of the market for defaulted debt represents \"\u00a0'one of the most significant changes'\u00a0\" to the debt market generally since the Act's passage in 1977.  Brief for Petitioners 8 (quoting Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Fair Debt Collection Practices Act: CFPB Annual Report 2014, p. 7 (2014)).  Had Congress known this new industry would blossom, they say, it surely would have judged defaulted debt purchasers more like (and in need of the same special rules as) independent debt collectors.  Indeed, petitioners contend that no other result would be consistent with the overarching congressional goal of deterring untoward debt collection practices.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this seems to us quite a lot of speculation.  And while it is of course our job to apply faithfully the law Congress has written, it is never our job to rewrite a constitutionally valid statutory text under the banner of speculation about what Congress might have done had it faced a question that, on everyone's account, it never faced.  See Magwood v. Patterson, 561 U.\u00a0S. 320, 334 (2010) (\"We cannot replace the actual text with speculation as to Congress' intent\").  Indeed, it is quite mistaken to assume, as petitioners would have us, that \"whatever\" might appear to \"further[\u00a0] the statute's primary objective must be the law.\"  Rodriguez v. United States, 480 U.\u00a0S. 522, 526 (1987) (per curiam) (emphasis deleted).  Legislation is, after all, the art of compromise, the limitations expressed in statutory terms often the price of passage, and no statute yet known \"pursues its [stated] purpose[\u00a0] at all costs.\"  Id., at 525-526.  For these reasons and more besides we will not presume with petitioners that any result consistent with their account of the statute's overarching goal must be the law but will presume more modestly instead \"that [the] legislature says .\u00a0.\u00a0. what it means and means .\u00a0.\u00a0. what it says.\"  Dodd v. United States, 545 U.\u00a0S. 353, 357 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even taken on its own terms, too, the speculation petitioners urge upon us is far from unassailable.  After all, is it really impossible to imagine that reasonable legislators might contend both ways on the question whether defaulted debt purchasers should be treated more like loan originators than independent debt collection agencies?  About whether other existing incentives (in the form of common law duties, other statutory and regulatory obligations, economic incentives, or otherwise) suffice to deter debt purchasers from engaging in certain undesirable collection activities?  Couldn't a reasonable legislator endorsing the Act as written wonder whether a large financial institution like Santander is any more or less likely to engage in abusive conduct than another large financial institution like CitiFinancial Auto?  Especially where (as here) the institution says that its primary business is loan origination and not the purchase of defaulted debt?  We do not profess sure answers to any of these questions, but observe only that the parties and their amici manage to present many and colorable arguments both ways on them all, a fact that suggests to us for certain but one thing: that these are matters for Congress, not this Court, to resolve.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the end, reasonable people can disagree with how Congress balanced the various social costs and benefits in this area.  We have no difficulty imagining, for example, a statute that applies the Act's demands to anyone collecting any debts, anyone collecting debts originated by another, or to some other class of persons still.  Neither do we doubt that the evolution of the debt collection business might invite reasonable disagreements on whether Congress should reenter the field and alter the judgments it made in the past.  After all, it's hardly unknown for new business models to emerge in response to regulation, and for regulation in turn to address new business models.  Constant competition between constable and quarry, regulator and regulated, can come as no surprise in our changing world.  But neither should the proper role of the judiciary in that process--to apply, not amend, the work of the People's representatives.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is \nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n","31":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHONEYCUTT v. UNITED STATES(2017)\nNo. 16-142\nArgued: March 29, 2017Decided: June 5, 2017\n\n\nTerry Honeycutt managed sales and inventory for a Tennessee hardware store owned by his brother, Tony Honeycutt.  After they were indicted for federal drug crimes including conspiracy to distribute a product used in methamphetamine production, the Government sought judgments against each brother in the amount of $269,751.98 pursuant to the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984, which mandates forfeiture of \"any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\" certain drug crimes, 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7853(a)(1).  Tony pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit $200,000.  Terry went to trial and was convicted.  Despite conceding that Terry had no controlling interest in the store and did not stand to benefit personally from the sales of the product, the Government asked the District Court to hold him jointly and severally liable for the profits from the illegal sales and sought a judgment of $69,751.98, the outstanding conspiracy profits.  The District Court declined to enter a forfeiture judgment against Terry, reasoning that he was a salaried employee who had not received any profits from the sales.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the brothers, as co-conspirators, were jointly and severally liable for any conspiracy proceeds.\nHeld:\u00a0Because forfeiture pursuant to \u00a7853(a)(1) is limited to property the defendant himself actually acquired as the result of the crime, that provision does not permit forfeiture with regard to Terry Honeycutt, who had no ownership interest in his brother's store and did not personally benefit from the illegal sales.  Pp.\u00a03-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Section 853(a) limits forfeiture to property flowing from, \u00a7853(a)(1), or used in, \u00a7853(a)(2), the crime itself--providing the first clue that the statute does not countenance joint and several liability, which would require forfeiture of untainted property.  It also defines forfeitable property solely in terms of personal possession or use.  Section 853(a)(1), the provision at issue, limits forfeiture to property the defendant \"obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\" the crime.  Neither the dictionary definition nor the common usage of the word \"obtain\" supports the conclusion that an individual \"obtains\" property that was acquired by someone else.  And the adverbs \"directly\" and \"indirectly\" refer to how a defendant obtains the property; they do not negate the requirement that he obtain it at all.  Sections 853(a)(2) and 853(a)(3) are in accord with this reading.  Pp.\u00a03-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Joint and several liability is also contrary to several other provisions of \u00a7853.  Section 853(c), which applies to property \"described in subsection (a),\" applies to tainted property only.  See Luis v. United States, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  Section \u00a7853(e)(1) permits pretrial asset freezes to preserve the availability of property forfeitable under subsection (a), provided there is probable cause to think that a defendant has committed an offense triggering forfeiture and \"the property at issue has the requisite connection to that crime.\"  Kaley v. United States, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  Section 853(d) establishes a \"rebuttable presumption\" that property is subject to forfeiture only if the Government proves that the defendant acquired the property \"during the period of the violation\" and \"there was no likely source for\" the property but the crime.  These provisions reinforce the statute's application to tainted property acquired by the defendant and are thus incompatible with joint and several liability.  Joint and several liability would also render futile \u00a7853(p)--the sole provision of \u00a7853 that permits the Government to confiscate property untainted by the crime.  Pp.\u00a07-9. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The plain text and structure of \u00a7853 leave no doubt that Congress did not, as the Government claims, incorporate the principle that conspirators are legally responsible for each other's foreseeable actions in furtherance of their common plan.  See Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.\u00a0S. 640.  Congress provided just one way for the Government to recoup substitute property when the tainted property itself is unavailable--the procedures outlined in \u00a7853(p).  And as is clear from its text and structure, \u00a7853 maintains traditional in rem forfeiture's focus on tainted property unless one of \u00a7853(p)'s preconditions exists.

UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 5, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A federal statute--21 U. S. C. \u00a7853--mandates forfeiture of \"any property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\" certain drug crimes.  This case concerns how \u00a7853 operates when two or more defendants act as part of a conspiracy.  Specifically, the issue is whether, under \u00a7853, a defendant may be held jointly and severally liable for property that his co-conspirator derived from the crime but that the defendant himself did not acquire.  The Court holds that such liability is inconsistent with the statute's text and structure.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Terry Michael Honeycutt managed sales and inventory for a Tennessee hardware store owned by his brother, Tony Honeycutt.  After observing several \"\u00a0'edgy looking folks'\u00a0\" purchasing an iodine-based water-purification product known as Polar Pure, Terry Honeycutt contacted the Chattanooga Police Department to inquire whether the iodine crystals in the product could be used to manufacture methamphetamine.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.  An officer confirmed that individuals were using Polar Pure for this purpose and advised Honeycutt to cease selling it if the sales made Honeycutt \"\u00a0'uncomfortable.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Notwithstanding the officer's advice, the store continued to sell large quantities of Polar Pure.  Although each bottle of Polar Pure contained enough iodine to purify 500 gallons of water, and despite the fact that most people have no legitimate use for the product in large quantities, the brothers sold as many as 12 bottles in a single transaction to a single customer.  Over a 3-year period, the store grossed roughly $400,000 from the sale of more than 20,000 bottles of Polar Pure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unsurprisingly, these sales prompted an investigation by the federal Drug Enforcement Administration along with state and local law enforcement.  Authorities executed a search warrant at the store in November 2010 and seized its entire inventory of Polar Pure--more than 300 bottles.  A federal grand jury indicted the Honeycutt brothers for various federal crimes relating to their sale of iodine while knowing or having reason to believe it would be used to manufacture methamphetamine.  Pursuant to the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984, \u00a7303, 98 Stat. 2045, 21 U. S. C. \u00a7853(a)(1), which mandates forfeiture of \"any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\" drug distribution, the Government sought forfeiture money judgments against each brother in the amount of $269,751.98, which represented the hardware store's profits from the sale of Polar Pure.  Tony Honeycutt pleaded guilty and agreed to forfeit $200,000.  Terry went to trial.  A jury acquitted Terry Honeycutt of 3 charges but found him guilty of the remaining 11, including conspiring to and knowingly distributing iodine in violation of \u00a7\u00a7841(c)(2), 843(a)(6), and 846.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court sentenced Terry Honeycutt to 60 months in prison.  Despite conceding that Terry had no \"controlling interest in the store\" and \"did not stand to benefit personally,\" the Government insisted that the District Court \"hold [him] jointly liable for the profit from the illegal sales.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a-61a.  The Government thus sought a money judgment of $69,751.98, the amount of the conspiracy profits outstanding after Tony Honeycutt's forfeiture payment.  The District Court declined to enter a forfeiture judgment, reasoning that Honeycutt was a salaried employee who had not personally received any profits from the iodine sales.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  As co-conspirators, the court held, the brothers are \"\u00a0'jointly and severally liable for any proceeds of the conspiracy.'\u00a0\"  816 F.\u00a03d 362, 380 (2016).  The court therefore concluded that each brother bore full responsibility for the entire forfeiture judgment.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court granted certiorari to resolve disagreement among the Courts of Appeals regarding whether joint and several liability applies under \u00a7853.1  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016). \nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Criminal forfeiture statutes empower the Government to confiscate property derived from or used to facilitate criminal activity.  Such statutes serve important governmental interests such as \"separating a criminal from his ill-gotten gains,\" \"returning property, in full, to those wrongfully deprived or defrauded of it,\" and \"lessen[ing] the economic power\" of criminal enterprises.  Caplin & Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.\u00a0S. 617, 629-630 (1989).  The statute at issue here--\u00a7853--mandates forfeiture with respect to persons convicted of certain serious drug crimes.  The question presented is whether \u00a7853 embraces joint and several liability for forfeiture judgments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A creature of tort law, joint and several liability \"applies when there has been a judgment against multiple defendants.\"  McDermott, Inc. v. AmClyde, 511 U.\u00a0S. 202, 220-221 (1994).  If two or more defendants jointly cause harm, each defendant is held liable for the entire amount of the harm; provided, however, that the plaintiff recover only once for the full amount.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7875 (1977).  Application of that principle in the forfeiture context when two or more defendants conspire to violate the law would require that each defendant be held liable for a forfeiture judgment based not only on property that he used in or acquired because of the crime, but also on property obtained by his co-conspirator.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An example is instructive.  Suppose a farmer masterminds a scheme to grow, harvest, and distribute marijuana on local college campuses.  The mastermind recruits a college student to deliver packages and pays the student $300 each month from the distribution proceeds for his services.  In one year, the mastermind earns $3 million.  The student, meanwhile, earns $3,600.  If joint and several liability applied, the student would face a forfeiture judgment for the entire amount of the conspiracy's proceeds: $3 million.  The student would be bound by that judgment even though he never personally acquired any proceeds beyond the $3,600.  This case requires determination whether this form of liability is permitted under \u00a7853(a)(1).  The Court holds that it is not.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forfeiture under \u00a7853 applies to \"any person\" convicted of certain serious drug crimes.  Section 853(a) limits the statute's reach by defining the property subject to forfeiture in three separate provisions.  An understanding of how these three provisions work to limit the operation of the statute is helpful to resolving the question in this case.  First, the provision at issue here, \u00a7853(a)(1), limits forfeiture to \"property constituting, or derived from, any proceeds the person obtained, directly or indirectly, as the result of\" the crime.  Second, \u00a7853(a)(2) restricts forfeiture to \"property used, or intended to be used, in any manner or part, to commit, or to facilitate the commission of,\" the crime.  Finally, \u00a7853(a)(3) applies to persons \"convicted of engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise\"--a form of conspiracy--and requires forfeiture of \"property described in paragraph (1) or (2)\" as well as \"any of [the defendant's] interest in, claims against, and property or contractual rights affording a source of control over, the continuing criminal enterprise.\"  These provisions, by their terms, limit forfeiture under \u00a7853 to tainted property; that is, property flowing from (\u00a7853(a)(1)), or used in (\u00a7853(a)(2)), the crime itself.  The limitations of \u00a7853(a) thus provide the first clue that the statute does not countenance joint and several liability, which, by its nature, would require forfeiture of untainted property.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recall, for example, the college student from the earlier hypothetical.  The $3,600 he received for his part in the marijuana distribution scheme clearly falls within \u00a7853(a)(1): It is property he \"obtained .\u00a0.\u00a0. as the result of\" the crime.  But if he were held jointly and severally liable for the proceeds of the entire conspiracy, he would owe the Government $3 million.  Of the $3 million, $2,996,400 would have no connection whatsoever to the student's participation in the crime and would have to be paid from the student's untainted assets.  Joint and several liability would thus represent a departure from \u00a7853(a)'s restriction of forfeiture to tainted property.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to limiting forfeiture to tainted property, \u00a7853(a) defines forfeitable property solely in terms of personal possession or use.  This is most clear in the specific text of \u00a7853(a)(1)--the provision under which the Government sought forfeiture in this case.  Section 853(a)(1) limits forfeiture to property the defendant \"obtained .\u00a0.\u00a0. as the result of\" the crime.  At the time Congress enacted \u00a7853(a)(1), the verb \"obtain\" was defined as \"to come into possession of\" or to \"get or acquire.\"  Random House Dictionary of the English Language 995 (1966); see also 7 Oxford English Dictionary 37 (1933) (defining \"obtain\" as \"[t]o come into the possession or enjoyment of (something) by one's own effort, or by request; to procure or gain, as the result of purpose and effort\").  That definition persists today.  See Black's Law Dictionary 1247 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"obtain\" as \"[t]o bring into one's own possession; to procure, esp. through effort\"); cf. Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2013) (slip op., at 4-5) (\"Obtaining property requires '.\u00a0.\u00a0. the acquisition of property'\u00a0\").  Neither the dictionary definition nor the common usage of the word \"obtain\" supports the conclusion that an individual \"obtains\" property that was acquired by someone else.  Yet joint and several liability would mean just that: The college student would be presumed to have \"obtained\" the $3 million that the mastermind acquired.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 853(a)(1) further provides that the forfeitable property may be \"obtained, directly or indirectly.\"  The adverbs \"directly\" and \"indirectly\" modify--but do not erase--the verb \"obtain.\"  In other words, these adverbs refer to how a defendant obtains the property; they do not negate the requirement that he obtain it at all.  For instance, the marijuana mastermind might receive payments directly from drug purchasers, or he might arrange to have drug purchasers pay an intermediary such as the college student.  In all instances, he ultimately \"obtains\" the property--whether \"directly or indirectly.\" \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other provisions of \u00a7853(a) are in accord with the limitation of forfeiture to property the defendant himself obtained.  Section 853(a)(2) mandates forfeiture of property used to facilitate the crime but limits forfeiture to \"the person's property.\"  Similarly, \u00a7853(a)(3) requires forfeiture of property related to continuing criminal enterprises, but contrary to joint and several liability principles, requires the defendant to forfeit only \"his interest in\" the enterprise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 853(a)'s limitation of forfeiture to tainted property acquired or used by the defendant, together with the plain text of \u00a7853(a)(1), foreclose joint and several liability for co-conspirators. \nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joint and several liability is not only contrary to \u00a7853(a), it is--for the same reasons--contrary to several other provisions of \u00a7853.  Two provisions expressly incorporate the \u00a7853(a) limitations.  First, \u00a7853(c) provides that \"[a]ll right, title, and interest in property described in subsection (a)\"--e.g., tainted property obtained as the result of or used to facilitate the crime--\"vests in the United States upon the commission of the act giving rise to forfeiture.\"  Consistent with its text, the Court has previously acknowledged that \u00a7853(c) applies to tainted property only.  See Luis v. United States, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 8). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, \u00a7853(e)(1) authorizes pretrial freezes \"to preserve the availability of property described in subsection (a) .\u00a0.\u00a0. for forfeiture.\"  Pretrial restraints on forfeitable property are permitted only when the Government proves, at a hearing, that (1) the defendant has committed an offense triggering forfeiture, and (2) \"the property at issue has the requisite connection to that crime.\"  Kaley v. United States, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 3); see also id., at ___, n.\u00a011 (slip op., at 15, n.\u00a011) (\"[F]orfeiture applies only to specific assets\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another provision, \u00a7853(d), does not reference subsection (a) but incorporates its requirements on its own terms.  Section 835(d) establishes a \"rebuttable presumption\" that property is subject to forfeiture only if the Government proves that \"such property was acquired by [the defendant] during the period of the violation\" and that \"there was no likely source for such property other than\" the crime.  Contrary to all of these provisions, joint and several liability would mandate forfeiture of untainted property that the defendant did not acquire as a result of the crime.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It would also render futile one other provision of the statute.  Section 853(p)--the sole provision of \u00a7853 that permits the Government to confiscate property untainted by the crime--lays to rest any doubt that the statute permits joint and several liability.  That provision governs forfeiture of \"substitute property\" and applies \"if any property described in subsection (a), as a result of any act or omission of the defendant\" either:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(A) cannot be located upon the exercise of due diligence;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(B) has been transferred or sold to, or deposited with, a third party;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(C) has been placed beyond the jurisdiction of the court;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(D) has been substantially diminished in value; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(E) has been commingled with other property which cannot be divided without difficulty.\"  \u00a7853(p)(1).\nOnly if the Government can prove that one of these five conditions was caused by the defendant may it seize \"any other property of the defendant, up to the value of\" the tainted property--rather than the tainted property itself.  \u00a7853(p)(2).  This provision begins from the premise that the defendant once possessed tainted property as \"described in subsection (a),\" and provides a means for the Government to recoup the value of the property if it has been dissipated or otherwise disposed of by \"any act or omission of the defendant.\"  \u00a7853(p)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 853(p)(1) demonstrates that Congress contemplated situations where the tainted property itself would fall outside the Government's reach.  To remedy that situation, Congress did not authorize the Government to confiscate substitute property from other defendants or co-conspirators; it authorized the Government to confiscate assets only from the defendant who initially acquired the property and who bears responsibility for its dissipation.  Permitting the Government to force other co-conspirators to turn over untainted substitute property would allow the Government to circumvent Congress' carefully constructed statutory scheme, which permits forfeiture of substitute property only when the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7853(p) and (a) are satisfied.  There is no basis to read such an end run into the statute.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against all of this, the Government asserts the \"bedrock principle of conspiracy liability\" under which \"conspirators are legally responsible for each other's foreseeable actions in furtherance of their common plan.\" Brief for United States 9; see also Pinkerton v. United States, 328 U.\u00a0S. 640 (1946).  Congress, according to the Government, must be presumed to have legislated against the background principles of conspiracy liability, and thus, \"when the traceable proceeds of a conspiracy are unavailable, [\u00a7]853 renders conspirators jointly and severally liable for the amount of the proceeds foreseeably obtained by the conspiracy.\"  Brief for United States 10.  Not so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plain text and structure of \u00a7853 leave no doubt that Congress did not incorporate those background principles.  Congress provided just one way for the Government to recoup substitute property when the tainted property itself is unavailable--the procedures outlined in \u00a7853(p).  And, for all the Government makes of the background principles of conspiracy liability, it fails to fully engage with the most important background principles underlying \u00a7853: those of forfeiture.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Traditionally, forfeiture was an action against the tainted property itself and thus proceeded in rem; that is, proceedings in which \"[t]he thing [was] primarily considered as the offender, or rather the offence [was] attached primarily to the thing.\"  The Palmyra, 12 Wheat. 1, 14 (1827).  The forfeiture \"proceeding in rem st[ood] independent of, and wholly unaffected by any criminal proceeding in personam\" against the defendant.  Id., at 15.  Congress altered this distinction in enacting \u00a7853 by effectively merging the in rem forfeiture proceeding with the in personam criminal proceeding and by expanding forfeiture to include not just the \"thing\" but \"property .\u00a0.\u00a0. derived from .\u00a0.\u00a0. any proceeds\" of the crime.  \u00a7853(a)(1).  But as is clear from its text and structure, \u00a7853 maintains traditional in rem forfeiture's focus on tainted property unless one of the preconditions of \u00a7853(p) exists.  For those who find it relevant, the legislative history confirms as much: Congress altered the traditional system in order to \"improv[e] the procedures applicable in forfeiture cases.\"  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 98-225, p. 192 (1983).  By adopting an in personam aspect to criminal forfeiture, and providing for substitute-asset forfeiture, Congress made it easier for the Government to hold the defendant who acquired the tainted property responsible. Congress did not, however, enact any \"significant expansion of the scope of property subject to forfeiture.\"  Ibid.2\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Forfeiture pursuant to \u00a7853(a)(1) is limited to property the defendant himself actually acquired as the result of the crime.  In this case, the Government has conceded that Terry Honeycutt had no ownership interest in his brother's store and did not personally benefit from the Polar Pure sales.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 60a.  The District Court agreed.  Id., at 40a.  Because Honeycutt never obtained tainted property as a result of the crime, \u00a7853 does not require any forfeiture.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Compare United States v. Van Nguyen, 602 F.\u00a03d 886, 904 (CA8 2010) (applying joint and several liability to forfeiture under \u00a7853); United States v. Pitt, 193 F.\u00a03d 751, 765 (CA3 1999) (same); United States v. McHan, 101 F.\u00a03d 1027 (CA4 1996) (same); and United States v. Benevento, 836 F.\u00a02d 129, 130 (CA2 1988) (per curiam) (same), with United States v.

But the Court cannot construe a statute in a way that negates its plain text, and here, Congress expressly limited forfeiture to tainted property that the defendant obtained.  As explained above, that limitation is incompatible with joint and several liability.\n\n\n","32":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nHOWELL v. HOWELL(2017)\nNo. 15-1031\nArgued: March 20, 2017Decided: May 15, 2017\n\n\nThe Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act authorizes States to treat veterans' \"disposable retired pay\" as community property divisible upon divorce, 10 U. S. C. \u00a71408, but expressly excludes from its definition of \"disposable retired pay\" amounts deducted from that pay \"as a result of a waiver . . . required by law in order to receive\" disability benefits, \u00a71408(a)(4)(B).  The divorce decree of petitioner John Howell and respondent Sandra Howell awarded Sandra 50% of John's future Air Force retirement pay, which she began to receive when John retired the following year.  About 13 years later, the Department of Veterans Affairs found that John was partially disabled due to an earlier service-related injury.  To receive disability pay, federal law required John to give up an equivalent amount of retirement pay.  38 U. S. C. \u00a75305.  By his election, John waived about $250 of his retirement pay, which also reduced the value of Sandra's 50% share.  Sandra petitioned the Arizona family court to enforce the original divorce decree and restore the value of her share of John's total retirement pay.  The court held that the original divorce decree had given Sandra a vested interest in the prewaiver amount of John's retirement pay and ordered John to ensure that she receive her full 50% without regard for the disability waiver.  The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed, holding that federal law did not pre-empt the family court's order.\nHeld:\u00a0A state court may not order a veteran to indemnify a divorced spouse for the loss in the divorced spouse's portion of the veteran's retirement pay caused by the veteran's waiver of retirement pay to receive service-related disability benefits.  This Court's decision in Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U. S. 581, determines the outcome here.  There, the Court held that federal law completely pre-empts the States from treating waived military retirement pay as divisible community property.  Id., at 594-595.  The Arizona Supreme Court attempted to distinguish Mansell by emphasizing the fact that the veteran's waiver in that case took place before the divorce proceeding while the waiver here took place several years after the divorce.  This temporal difference highlights only that John's military pay at the time it came to Sandra was subject to a future contingency, meaning that the value of Sandra's share of military retirement pay was possibly worth less at the time of the divorce.  Nothing in this circumstance makes the Arizona courts' reimbursement award to Sandra any the less an award of the portion of military pay that John waived in order to obtain disability benefits.  That the Arizona courts referred to her interest in the waivable portion as having \"vested\" does not help: State courts cannot \"vest\" that which they lack the authority to give.  Neither can the State avoid Mansell by describing the family court order as an order requiring John to \"reimburse\" or to \"indemnify\" Sandra, rather than an order dividing property, a semantic difference and nothing more.  Regardless of their form, such orders displace the federal rule and stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of Congress.  Family courts remain free to take account of the contingency that some military retirement pay might be waived or take account of reductions in value when calculating or recalculating the need for spousal support.  Here, however, the state courts made clear that the original divorce decree divided the whole of John's military pay, and their decisions rested entirely upon the need to restore Sandra's lost portion.

SANDRA HOWELL\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of arizona\n[May 15, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A federal statute provides that a State may treat as community property, and divide at divorce, a military veteran's retirement pay.  See 10 U. S. C. \u00a71408(c)(1).  The statute, however, exempts from this grant of permission any amount that the Government deducts \"as a result of a waiver\" that the veteran must make \"in order to receive\" disability benefits. \u00a71408(a)(4)(B).  We have held that a State cannot treat as community property, and divide at divorce, this portion (the waived portion) of the veteran's retirement pay.  See Mansell v. Mansell, 490 U.\u00a0S. 581, 594-595 (1989).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case a State treated as community property and awarded to a veteran's spouse upon divorce a portion of the veteran's total retirement pay.  Long after the divorce, the veteran waived a share of the retirement pay in order to receive nontaxable disability benefits from the Federal Government instead.  Can the State subsequently increase, pro\u00a0rata, the amount the divorced spouse receives each month from the veteran's retirement pay in order to indemnify the divorced spouse for the loss caused by the veteran's waiver?  The question is complicated, but the answer is not.  Our cases and the statute make clear that the answer to the indemnification question is \"no.\"\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Government has long provided retirement pay to those veterans who have retired from the Armed Forces after serving, e.g., 20 years or more.  It also provides disabled members of the Armed Forces with disability benefits.  In order to prevent double counting, however, federal law typically insists that, to receive disability benefits, a retired veteran must give up an equivalent amount of retirement pay.  And, since retirement pay is taxable while disability benefits are not, the veteran often elects to waive retirement pay in order to receive disability benefits.  See 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73911 et seq. (Army retirement benefits); \u00a76321 et seq. (Navy and Marines retirement benefits); \u00a78911 et seq. (Air Force retirement benefits); 38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75305 (requiring a waiver to receive disability benefits); \u00a75301(a)(1) (exempting disability benefits from taxation).  See generally McCarty v. McCarty, 453 U.\u00a0S. 210, 211-215 (1981) (describing the military's nondisability retirement system).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1981 we considered federal military retirement pay alone, i.e., not in the context of pay waived to receive disability benefits.  The question was whether a State could consider any of a veteran's retirement pay to be a form of community property, divisible at divorce.  The Court concluded that the States could not.  See McCarty, supra.  We noted that the relevant legislative history referred to military retirement pay as a \"\u00a0'personal entitlement.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 224.  We added that other language in the statute as well as its history made \"clear that Congress intended that military retired pay 'actually reach the beneficiary.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 228.  We found a \"conflict between the terms of the federal retirement statutes and the [state-conferred] community property right.\"  Id., at 232.  And we concluded that the division of military retirement pay by the States threatened to harm clear and substantial federal interests.  Hence federal law pre-empted the state law.  Id., at 235.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1982 Congress responded by passing the Uniformed Services Former Spouses' Protection Act, 10 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71408.  Congress wrote that a State may treat veterans' \"disposable retired pay\" as divisible property, i.e., community property divisible upon divorce.  \u00a71408(c)(1).  But the new Act expressly excluded from its definition of \"disposable retired pay\" amounts deducted from that pay \"as a result of a waiver .\u00a0.\u00a0. required by law in order to receive\" disability benefits.  \u00a71408(a)(4)(B).  (A recent amendment to the statute renumbered the waiver provision.  It now appears at \u00a71408(a)(4)(A)(ii).  See Pub. L. 114-328, \u00a7641(a), 130 Stat. 2164.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1989 we interpreted the new federal language in Mansell, 490 U.\u00a0S. 581.  Major Gerald E. Mansell and his wife had divorced in California.  At the time of the divorce, they entered into a \"property settlement which provided, in part, that Major Mansell would pay Mrs. Mansell 50 percent of his total military retirement pay, including that portion of retirement pay waived so that Major Mansell could receive disability benefits.\"  Id., at 586.  The divorce decree incorporated this settlement and permitted the division.  Major Mansell later moved to modify the decree so that it would omit the portion of the retirement pay that he had waived.  The California courts refused to do so.  But this Court reversed.  It held that federal law forbade California from treating the waived portion as community property divisible at divorce.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing for the Court, pointed out that federal law, as construed in McCarty, \"completely pre-empted the application of state community property law to military retirement pay.\"  490 U.\u00a0S., at 588.  He noted that Congress could \"overcome\" this pre-emption \"by enacting an affirmative grant of authority giving the States the power to treat military retirement pay as community property.\"  Ibid.  He recognized that Congress, with its new Act, had done that, but only to a limited extent.  The Act provided a \"precise and limited\" grant of the power to divide federal military retirement pay.  Ibid.  It did not \"gran[t]\" the States \"the authority to treat total retired pay as community property.\"  Id., at 589.  Rather, Congress excluded from its grant of authority the disability-related waived portion of military retirement pay.  Hence, in respect to the waived portion of retirement pay, McCarty, with its rule of federal pre-emption, still applies.  Ibid.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0John Howell, the petitioner, and Sandra Howell, the respondent, were divorced in 1991, while John was serving in the Air Force.  Anticipating John's eventual retirement, the divorce decree treated John's future retirement pay as community property.  It awarded Sandra \"as her sole and separate property FIFTY PERCENT (50%) of [John's] military retirement when it begins.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a.  It also ordered John to pay child support of $585 per month and spousal maintenance of $150 per month until the time of John's retirement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1992 John retired from the Air Force and began to receive military retirement pay, half of which went to Sandra.  About 13 years later the Department of Veterans Affairs found that John was 20% disabled due to a service-related shoulder injury.  John elected to receive disability benefits and consequently had to waive about $250 per month of the roughly $1,500 of military retirement pay he shared with Sandra.  Doing so reduced the amount of retirement pay that he and Sandra received by about $125 per month each.  In\u00a0re Marriage of Howell, 238 Ariz. 407, 408, 361 P. 3d 936, 937 (2015)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sandra then asked the Arizona family court to enforce the original decree, in effect restoring the value of her share of John's total retirement pay.  The court held that the original divorce decree had given Sandra a \"vested\" interest in the prewaiver amount of that pay, and ordered John to ensure that Sandra \"receive her full 50% of the military retirement without regard for the disability.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arizona Supreme Court affirmed the family court's decision.  See 238 Ariz. 407, 361 P. 3d 936.  It asked whether the family court could \"order John to indemnify Sandra for the reduction\" of her share of John's military retirement pay.  Id., at 409, 361 P.\u00a03d, at 938.  It wrote that the family court order did not \"divide\" John's waived military retirement pay, the order did not require John \"to rescind\" his waiver, nor did the order \"direct him to pay any amount to Sandra from his disability pay.\"  Id., at 410, 361 P.\u00a03d, at 939.  Rather the family court simply ordered John to \"reimburse\" Sandra for \"reducing .\u00a0.\u00a0. her share\" of military retirement pay.  Ibid.  The high court concluded that because John had made his waiver after, rather than before, the family court divided his military retirement pay, our decision in Mansell did not control the case, and thus federal law did not preempt the family court's reimbursement order.  238 Ariz., at 410, 361 P.\u00a03d, at 939.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because different state courts have come to different conclusions on the matter, we granted John Howell's petition for certiorari.  Compare Glover v. Ranney, 314 P. 3d 535, 539-540 (Alaska 2013); Krapf v. Krapf, 439 Mass. 97, 106-107, 786 N. E. 2d 318, 325-326 (2003); and Johnson v. Johnson, 37 S. W. 3d 892, 897-898 (Tenn. 2001), with Mallard v. Burkhart, 95 So. 3d 1264, 1269-1272 (Miss. 2012); and Youngbluth v. Youngbluth, 2010 VT 40, 188 Vt. 53, 62-65, 6 A. 3d 677, 682-685.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's decision in Mansell determines the outcome here.  In Mansell, the Court held that federal law completely pre-empts the States from treating waived military retirement pay as divisible community property.  490 U.\u00a0S., at 594-595.  Yet that which federal law pre-empts is just what the Arizona family court did here.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 28a, 35a (finding that the divorce decree gave Sandra a \"vested\" interest in John's retirement pay and ordering that Sandra receive her share \"without regard for the disability\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arizona Supreme Court, the respondent, and the Solicitor General try to distinguish Mansell.  But we do not find their efforts convincing.  The Arizona Supreme Court, like several other state courts, emphasized the fact that the veteran's waiver in Mansell took place before the divorce proceeding; the waiver here took place several years after the divorce proceedings.  See 238 Ariz., at 410, 361 P.\u00a03d, at 939; see also Abernethy v. Fishkin, 699 So.\u00a02d 235, 240 (Fla. 1997) (noting that a veteran had not yet waived retirement pay at the time of the divorce and permitting indemnification in light of the parties' \"intent to maintain level monthly payments pursuant to their property settlement agreement\").  Hence here, as the Solicitor General emphasizes, the nonmilitary spouse and the family court were likely to have assumed that a full share of the veteran's retirement pay would remain available after the assets were distributed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nonetheless, the temporal difference highlights only that John's military retirement pay at the time it came to Sandra was subject to later reduction (should John exercise a waiver to receive disability benefits to which he is entitled).  The state court did not extinguish (and most likely would not have had the legal power to extinguish) that future contingency.  The existence of that contingency meant that the value of Sandra's share of military retirement pay was possibly worth less--perhaps less than Sandra and others thought--at the time of the divorce.  So too is an ownership interest in property (say, A's property interest in Blackacre) worth less if it is subject to defeasance or termination upon the occurrence of a later event (say, B's death).  See generally Restatement (Third) of Property \u00a724.3 (2010) (describing property interests that are defeasible); id., \u00a725.3, and Comment a (describing contingent future interests subject to divestment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We see nothing in this circumstance that makes the reimbursement award to Sandra any the less an award of the portion of military retirement pay that John waived in order to obtain disability benefits.  And that is the portion that Congress omitted from the Act's definition of \"disposable retired pay,\" namely, the portion that federal law prohibits state courts from awarding to a divorced veteran's former spouse.  Mansell, supra, at 589.  That the Arizona courts referred to Sandra's interest in the waivable portion as having \"vested\" does not help.  State courts cannot \"vest\" that which (under governing federal law) they lack the authority to give.  Cf. 38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75301(a)(1) (providing that disability benefits are generally nonassignable).  Accordingly, while the divorce decree might be said to \"vest\" Sandra with an immediate right to half of John's military retirement pay, that interest is, at most, contingent, depending for its amount on a subsequent condition: John's possible waiver of that pay.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither can the State avoid Mansell by describing the family court order as an order requiring John to \"reimburse\" or to \"indemnify\" Sandra, rather than an order that divides property.  The difference is semantic and nothing more.  The principal reason the state courts have given for ordering reimbursement or indemnification is that they wish to restore the amount previously awarded as community property, i.e., to restore that portion of retirement pay lost due to the postdivorce waiver.  And we note that here, the amount of indemnification mirrors the waived retirement pay, dollar for dollar.  Regardless of their form, such reimbursement and indemnification orders displace the federal rule and stand as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the purposes and objectives of Congress.  All such orders are thus pre-empted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The basic reasons McCarty gave for believing that Congress intended to exempt military retirement pay from state community property laws apply a fortiori to disability pay.  See 453 U.\u00a0S., at 232-235 (describing the federal interests in attracting and retaining military personnel).  And those reasons apply with equal force to a veteran's postdivorce waiver to receive disability benefits to which he or she has become entitled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We recognize, as we recognized in Mansell, the hardship that congressional pre-emption can sometimes work on divorcing spouses.  See 490 U.\u00a0S., at 594.  But we note that a family court, when it first determines the value of a family's assets, remains free to take account of the contingency that some military retirement pay might be waived, or, as the petitioner himself recognizes, take account of reductions in value when it calculates or recalculates the need for spousal support.  See Rose v. Rose, 481 U.\u00a0S. 619, 630-634, and n.\u00a06 (1987); 10 U. S. C. \u00a71408(e)(6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We need not and do not decide these matters, for here the state courts made clear that the original divorce decree divided the whole of John's military retirement pay, and their decisions rested entirely upon the need to restore Sandra's lost portion.  Consequently, the determination of the Supreme Court of Arizona must be reversed.  See Mansell, supra, at 594.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Supreme Court of Arizona is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nOpinion of Thomas, J.\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1031\nJOHN HOWELL, PETITIONER v.

LEXMARK INTERNATIONAL, INC.(2017)\nNo. 15-1189\nArgued: March 21, 2017Decided: May 30, 2017\n\n\nA United States patent entitles the patent holder to \"exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling [its] invention throughout the United States or importing the invention into the United States.\"  35 U. S. C. \u00a7154(a).  Whoever engages in one of these acts \"without authority\" from the patentee may face liability for patent infringement.  \u00a7271(a).  When a patentee sells one of its products, however, the patentee can no longer control that item through the patent laws--its patent rights are said to \"exhaust.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Lexmark International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells toner cartridges to consumers in the United States and abroad.  It owns a number of patents that cover components of those cartridges and the manner in which they are used.  When Lexmark sells toner cartridges, it gives consumers two options: One option is to buy a toner cartridge at full price, with no restrictions.  The other option is to buy a cartridge at a discount through Lexmark's \"Return Program.\"  In exchange for the lower price, customers who buy through the Return Program must sign a contract agreeing to use the cartridge only once and to refrain from transferring the cartridge to anyone but Lexmark.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Companies known as remanufacturers acquire empty Lexmark toner cartridges--including Return Program cartridges--from purchasers in the United States, refill them with toner, and then resell them.  They do the same with Lexmark cartridges that they acquire from purchasers overseas and import into the United States.  Lexmark sued a number of these remanufacturers, including petitioner Impression Products, Inc., for patent infringement with respect to two groups of cartridges.  The first group consists of Return Program cartridges that Lexmark had sold within the United States.  Lexmark argued that, because it expressly prohibited reuse and resale of these cartridges, Impression Products infringed the Lexmark patents when it refurbished and resold them.  The second group consists of all toner cartridges that Lexmark had sold abroad and that Impression Products imported into the country.  Lexmark claimed that it never gave anyone authority to import these cartridges, so Impression Products infringed its patent rights by doing just that.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Impression Products moved to dismiss on the grounds that Lexmark's sales, both in the United States and abroad, exhausted its patent rights in the cartridges, so Impression Products was free to refurbish and resell them, and to import them if acquired overseas.  The District Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the domestic Return Program cartridges, but denied the motion as to the cartridges sold abroad.  The Federal Circuit then ruled for Lexmark with respect to both groups of cartridges.  Beginning with the Return Program cartridges that Lexmark sold domestically, the Federal Circuit held that a patentee may sell an item and retain the right to enforce, through patent infringement lawsuits, clearly communicated, lawful restrictions on post-sale use or resale.  Because Impression Products knew about Lexmark's restrictions and those restrictions did not violate any laws, Lexmark's sales did not exhaust its patent rights, and it could sue Impression Products for infringement.  As for the cartridges that Lexmark sold abroad, the Federal Circuit held that, when a patentee sells a product overseas, it does not exhaust its patent rights over that item.  Lexmark was therefore free to sue for infringement when Impression Products imported cartridges that Lexmark had sold abroad.  Judge Dyk, joined by Judge Hughes, dissented.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Lexmark exhausted its patent rights in the Return Program cartridges that it sold in the United States.  A patentee's decision to sell a product exhausts all of its patent rights in that item, regardless of any restrictions the patentee purports to impose.  As a result, even if the restrictions in Lexmark's contracts with its customers were clear and enforceable under contract law, they do not entitle Lexmark to retain patent rights in an item that it has elected to sell.  Pp. 5-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Patent Act grants patentees the \"right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling [their] invention[s].\"  35 U. S. C. \u00a7154(a).  For over 160 years, the doctrine of patent exhaustion has imposed a limit on that right to exclude: When a patentee sells an item, that product \"is no longer within the limits of the [patent] monopoly\" and instead becomes the \"private, individual property\" of the purchaser.  Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539, 549-550.  If the patentee negotiates a contract restricting the purchaser's right to use or resell the item, it may be able to enforce that restriction as a matter of contract law, but may not do so through a patent infringement lawsuit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The exhaustion rule marks the point where patent rights yield to the common law principle against restraints on alienation.  The Patent Act promotes innovation by allowing inventors to secure the financial rewards for their inventions.  Once a patentee sells an item, it has secured that reward, and the patent laws provide no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the product.  Allowing further restrictions would run afoul of the \"common law's refusal to permit restraints on the alienation of chattels.\"   Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U. S. 519, 538.  As Lord Coke put it in the 17th century, if an owner restricts the resale or use of an item after selling it, that restriction \"is voide, because . . . it is against Trade and Traffique, and bargaining and contracting betweene man and man.\"  1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England \u00a7360, p. 223 (1628).  Congress enacted and has repeatedly revised the Patent Act against the backdrop of this hostility toward restraints on alienation, which is reflected in the exhaustion doctrine.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court accordingly has long held that, even when a patentee sells an item under an express, otherwise lawful restriction, the patentee does not retain patent rights in that product.  See, e.g., Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U. S. 617.  And that well-settled line of precedent allows for only one answer in this case: Lexmark cannot bring a patent infringement suit against Impression Products with respect to the Return Program cartridges sold in the United States because, once Lexmark sold those cartridges, it exhausted its right to control them through the patent laws.  Pp. 5-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Federal Circuit reached a different result because it started from the premise that the exhaustion doctrine is an interpretation of the patent infringement statute, which prohibits anyone from using or selling a patented article \"without authority\" from the patentee.  According to the Federal Circuit, exhaustion reflects a default rule that selling an item \"presumptively grant[s] 'authority' for the purchaser to use it and resell it.\"  816 F. 3d 721, 742.  But if a patentee withholds some authority by expressly limiting the purchaser's rights, the patentee may enforce that restriction through patent infringement lawsuits.  See id., at 741.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem with the Federal Circuit's logic is that the exhaustion doctrine is not a presumption about the authority that comes along with a sale; it is a limit on the scope of the patentee's rights.  The Patent Act gives patentees a limited exclusionary power, and exhaustion extinguishes that power.  A purchaser has the right to use, sell, or import an item because those are the rights that come along with ownership, not because it purchased authority to engage in those practices from the patentee.  Pp. 9-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Lexmark also sold toner cartridges abroad, which Impression Products acquired from purchasers and imported into the United States.  Lexmark cannot sue Impression Products for infringement with respect to these cartridges.  An authorized sale outside the United States, just as one within the United States, exhausts all rights under the Patent Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question about international exhaustion of intellectual property rights has arisen in the context of copyright law.  Under the first sale doctrine, when a copyright owner sells a lawfully made copy of its work, it loses the power to restrict the purchaser's right \"to sell or otherwise dispose of . . . that copy.\"  17 U. S. C. \u00a7109(a).  In Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U. S. 519, this Court held that the first sale doctrine applies to copies of works made and sold abroad.  Central to that decision was the fact that the first sale doctrine has its roots in the common law principle against restraints on alienation.  Because that principle makes no geographical distinctions and the text of the Copyright Act did not provide such a distinction, a straightforward application of the first sale doctrine required concluding that it applies overseas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying patent exhaustion to foreign sales is just as straightforward.  Patent exhaustion, too, has its roots in the antipathy toward restraints on alienation, and nothing in the Patent Act shows that Congress intended to confine that principle to domestic sales.  Differentiating between the patent exhaustion and copyright first sale doctrines would also make little theoretical or practical sense: The two share a \"strong similarity . . . and identity of purpose,\" Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, 229 U. S. 1, 13, and many everyday products are subject to both patent and copyright protections.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lexmark contends that a foreign sale does not exhaust patent rights because the Patent Act limits a patentee's power to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing its products to acts that occur in the United States.  Because those exclusionary powers do not apply abroad, the patentee may not be able to sell its products overseas for the same price as it could in the United States, and therefore is not sure to receive the reward guaranteed by American patent laws.  Without that reward, says Lexmark, there should be no exhaustion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The territorial limit on patent rights is no basis for distinguishing copyright protections; those do not have extraterritorial effect either.  Nor does the territorial limit support Lexmark's argument.  Exhaustion is a distinct limit on the patent grant, which is triggered by the patentee's decision to give a patented item up for whatever fee it decides is appropriate.  The patentee may not be able to command the same amount for its products abroad as it does in the United States.  But the Patent Act does not guarantee a particular price.  Instead, the Patent Act just ensures that the patentee receives one reward--of whatever it deems to be satisfactory compensation--for every item that passes outside the scope of its patent monopoly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's decision in Boesch v. Gr\u00e4ff, 133 U. S. 697, is not to the contrary.  That decision did not, as Lexmark contends, exempt all foreign sales from patent exhaustion.  Instead, it held that a sale abroad does not exhaust a patentee's rights when the patentee had nothing to do with the transaction.  That just reaffirms the basic premise that only the patentee can decide whether to make a sale that exhausts its patent rights in an item.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the United States advocates what it views as a middle-ground position: that a foreign sale exhausts patent rights unless the patentee expressly reserves those rights.  This express-reservation rule is based on the idea that overseas buyers expect to be able to use and resell items freely, so exhaustion should be the presumption.  But, at the same time, lower courts have long allowed patentees to expressly reserve their rights, so that option should remain open to patentees.  The sparse and inconsistent decisions the Government cites, however, provide no basis for any expectation, let alone a settled one, that patentees can reserve rights when they sell abroad.  The theory behind the express-reservation rule also wrongly focuses on the expectations of the patentee and purchaser during a sale.  More is at stake when it comes to patent exhaustion than the dealings between the parties, which can be addressed through contracts.  Instead, exhaustion occurs because allowing patent rights to stick to an already-sold item as it travels through the market would violate the principle against restraints on alienation.  As a result, restrictions and location are irrelevant for patent exhaustion; what matters is the patentee's decision to make a sale.

Whoever engages in one of these acts \"without authority\" from the patentee may face liability for patent infringement.  \u00a7271(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a patentee sells one of its products, however, the patentee can no longer control that item through the patent laws--its patent rights are said to \"exhaust.\"  The purchaser and all subsequent owners are free to use or resell the product just like any other item of personal property, without fear of an infringement lawsuit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case presents two questions about the scope of the patent exhaustion doctrine: First, whether a patentee that sells an item under an express restriction on the purchaser's right to reuse or resell the product may enforce that restriction through an infringement lawsuit.  And second, whether a patentee exhausts its patent rights by selling its product outside the United States, where American patent laws do not apply.  We conclude that a patentee's decision to sell a product exhausts all of its patent rights in that item, regardless of any restrictions the patentee purports to impose or the location of the sale.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The underlying dispute in this case is about laser printers--or, more specifically, the cartridges that contain the powdery substance, known as toner, that laser printers use to make an image appear on paper.  Respondent Lexmark International, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells toner cartridges to consumers in the United States and around the globe.  It owns a number of patents that cover components of those cartridges and the manner in which they are used.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When toner cartridges run out of toner they can be refilled and used again.  This creates an opportunity for other companies--known as remanufacturers--to acquire empty Lexmark cartridges from purchasers in the United States and abroad, refill them with toner, and then resell them at a lower price than the new ones Lexmark puts on the shelves.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not blind to this business problem, Lexmark structures its sales in a way that encourages customers to return spent cartridges.  It gives purchasers two options: One is to buy a toner cartridge at full price, with no strings attached.  The other is to buy a cartridge at roughly 20-percent off through Lexmark's \"Return Program.\"  A customer who buys through the Return Program still owns the cartridge but, in exchange for the lower price, signs a contract agreeing to use it only once and to refrain from transferring the empty cartridge to anyone but Lexmark.  To enforce this single-use\/no-resale restriction, Lexmark installs a microchip on each Return Program cartridge that prevents reuse once the toner in the cartridge runs out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lexmark's strategy just spurred remanufacturers to get more creative.  Many kept acquiring empty Return Program cartridges and developed methods to counteract the effect of the microchips.  With that technological obstacle out of the way, there was little to prevent the re-manufacturers from using the Return Program cartridges in their resale business.  After all, Lexmark's contractual single-use\/no-resale agreements were with the initial customers, not with downstream purchasers like the remanufacturers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lexmark, however, was not so ready to concede that its plan had been foiled.  In 2010, it sued a number of remanufacturers, including petitioner Impression Products, Inc., for patent infringement with respect to two groups of cartridges.  One group consists of Return Program cartridges that Lexmark sold within the United States.  Lexmark argued that, because it expressly prohibited reuse and resale of these cartridges, the remanufacturers infringed the Lexmark patents when they refurbished and resold them.  The other group consists of all toner cartridges that Lexmark sold abroad and that remanufacturers imported into the country.  Lexmark claimed that it never gave anyone authority to import these cartridges, so the remanufacturers ran afoul of its patent rights by doing just that.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, the lawsuit was whittled down to one defendant, Impression Products, and one defense: that Lexmark's sales, both in the United States and abroad, exhausted its patent rights in the cartridges, so Impression Products was free to refurbish and resell them, and to import them if acquired abroad.  Impression Products filed separate motions to dismiss with respect to both groups of cartridges.  The District Court granted the motion as to the domestic Return Program cartridges, but denied the motion as to the cartridges Lexmark sold abroad.  Both parties appealed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit considered the appeals en banc and ruled for Lexmark with respect to both groups of cartridges.  The court began with the Return Program cartridges that Lexmark sold in the United States.  Relying on its decision in Mallinckrodt, Inc. v. Medipart, Inc., 976 F.\u00a02d 700 (1992), the Federal Circuit held that a patentee may sell an item and retain the right to enforce, through patent infringement lawsuits, \"clearly communicated, .\u00a0.\u00a0. lawful restriction[s] as to post-sale use or resale.\"  816 F.\u00a03d 721, 735 (2016).  The exhaustion doctrine, the court reasoned, derives from the prohibition on making, using, selling, or importing items \"without authority.\"  Id., at 734 (quoting 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(a)).  When you purchase an item you presumptively also acquire the authority to use or resell the item freely, but that is just a presumption; the same authority does not run with the item when the seller restricts post-sale use or resale.  816 F.\u00a03d, at 742.  Because the parties agreed that Impression Products knew about Lexmark's restrictions and that those restrictions did not violate any laws, the Federal Circuit concluded that Lexmark's sales had not exhausted all of its patent rights, and that the company could sue for infringement when Impression Products refurbished and resold Return Program cartridges.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the cartridges that Lexmark sold abroad, the Federal Circuit once again looked to its precedent.  In Jazz Photo Corp. v. International Trade Commission, 264 F.\u00a03d 1094 (2001), the court had held that a patentee's decision to sell a product abroad did not terminate its ability to bring an infringement suit against a buyer that \"import[ed] the article and [sold] .\u00a0.\u00a0. it in the United States.\"  816 F.\u00a03d, at 726-727.  That rule, the court concluded, makes good sense: Exhaustion is justified when a patentee receives \"the reward available from [selling in] American markets,\" which does not occur when the patentee sells overseas, where the American patent offers no protection and therefore cannot bolster the price of the patentee's goods.  Id., at 760-761.  As a result, Lexmark was free to exercise its patent rights to sue Impression Products for bringing the foreign-sold cartridges to market in the United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Dyk, joined by Judge Hughes, dissented.  In their view, selling the Return Program cartridges in the United States exhausted Lexmark's patent rights in those items because any \"authorized sale of a patented article .\u00a0.\u00a0. free[s] the article from any restrictions on use or sale based on the patent laws.\"  Id., at 775-776.  As for the foreign cartridges, the dissenters would have held that a sale abroad also results in exhaustion, unless the seller \"explicitly reserve[s] [its] United States patent rights\" at the time of sale.  Id., at 774, 788.  Because Lexmark failed to make such an express reservation, its foreign sales exhausted its patent rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to consider the Federal Circuit's decisions with respect to both domestic and international exhaustion, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First up are the Return Program cartridges that Lexmark sold in the United States.  We conclude that Lexmark exhausted its patent rights in these cartridges the moment it sold them.  The single-use\/no-resale restrictions in Lexmark's contracts with customers may have been clear and enforceable under contract law, but they do not entitle Lexmark to retain patent rights in an item that it has elected to sell.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Patent Act grants patentees the \"right to exclude others from making, using, offering for sale, or selling [their] invention[s].\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7154(a).  For over 160 years, the doctrine of patent exhaustion has imposed a limit on that right to exclude.  See Bloomer v. McQuewan, 14 How. 539 (1853).  The limit functions automatically: When a patentee chooses to sell an item, that product \"is no longer within the limits of the monopoly\" and instead becomes the \"private, individual property\" of the purchaser, with the rights and benefits that come along with ownership.  Id., at 549-550.  A patentee is free to set the price and negotiate contracts with purchasers, but may not, \"by virtue of his patent, control the use or disposition\" of the product after ownership passes to the purchaser.  United States v. Univis Lens Co., 316 U.\u00a0S. 241, 250 (1942) (emphasis added).  The sale \"terminates all patent rights to that item.\"  Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc., 553 U.\u00a0S. 617, 625 (2008).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This well-established exhaustion rule marks the point where patent rights yield to the common law principle against restraints on alienation.  The Patent Act \"promote[s] the progress of science and the useful arts by granting to [inventors] a limited monopoly\" that allows them to \"secure the financial rewards\" for their inventions.  Univis, 316 U.\u00a0S., at 250.  But once a patentee sells an item, it has \"enjoyed all the rights secured\" by that limited monopoly.  Keeler v. Standard Folding Bed Co., 157 U.\u00a0S. 659, 661 (1895).  Because \"the purpose of the patent law is fulfilled .\u00a0.\u00a0. when the patentee has received his reward for the use of his invention,\" that law furnishes \"no basis for restraining the use and enjoyment of the thing sold.\"  Univis, 316 U.\u00a0S., at 251.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have explained in the context of copyright law that exhaustion has \"an impeccable historic pedigree,\" tracing its lineage back to the \"common law's refusal to permit restraints on the alienation of chattels.\"  Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.\u00a0S. 519, 538 (2013).  As Lord Coke put it in the 17th century, if an owner restricts the resale or use of an item after selling it, that restriction \"is voide, because .\u00a0.\u00a0. it is against Trade and Traffique, and bargaining and contracting betweene man and man.\"  1 E. Coke, Institutes of the Laws of England \u00a7360, p. 223 (1628); see J. Gray, Restraints on the Alienation of Prop-erty \u00a727, p.\u00a018 (2d\u00a0ed. 1895) (\"A condition or conditional limitation on alienation attached to a transfer of the entire interest in personalty is as void as if attached to a fee simple in land\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This venerable principle is not, as the Federal Circuit dismissively viewed it, merely \"one common-law jurisdiction's general judicial policy at one time toward anti-alienation restrictions.\"  816 F.\u00a03d, at 750.  Congress enacted and has repeatedly revised the Patent Act against the backdrop of the hostility toward restraints on alienation.  That enmity is reflected in the exhaustion doctrine.  The patent laws do not include the right to \"restrain[\u00a0] .\u00a0.\u00a0. further alienation\" after an initial sale; such conditions have been \"hateful to the law from Lord Coke's day to ours\" and are \"obnoxious to the public interest.\"  Straus v. Victor Talking Machine Co., 243 U.\u00a0S. 490, 501 (1917).  \"The inconvenience and annoyance to the public that an opposite conclusion would occasion are too obvious to require illustration.\"  Keeler, 157 U.\u00a0S., at 667.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But an illustration never hurts.  Take a shop that restores and sells used cars.  The business works because the shop can rest assured that, so long as those bringing in the cars own them, the shop is free to repair and resell those vehicles.  That smooth flow of commerce would sputter if companies that make the thousands of parts that go into a vehicle could keep their patent rights after the first sale.  Those companies might, for instance, restrict resale rights and sue the shop owner for patent infringement.  And even if they refrained from imposing such restrictions, the very threat of patent liability would force the shop to invest in efforts to protect itself from hidden lawsuits.  Either way, extending the patent rights beyond the first sale would clog the channels of commerce, with little benefit from the extra control that the patentees retain.  And advances in technology, along with increasingly complex supply chains, magnify the problem.  See Brief for Costco Wholesale Corp. et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 7-9; Brief for Intel Corp. et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 17, n.\u00a05 (\"A generic smartphone assembled from various high-tech components could practice an estimated 250,000 patents\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court accordingly has long held that, even when a patentee sells an item under an express restriction, the patentee does not retain patent rights in that product.  In Boston Store of Chicago v. American Graphophone Co., for example, a manufacturer sold graphophones--one of the earliest devices for recording and reproducing sounds--to retailers under contracts requiring those stores to resell at a specific price.  246 U.\u00a0S. 8, 17-18 (1918).  When the manufacturer brought a patent infringement suit against a retailer who sold for less, we concluded that there was \"no room for controversy\" about the result: By selling the item, the manufacturer placed it \"beyond the confines of the patent law, [and] could not, by qualifying restrictions as to use, keep [it] under the patent monopoly.\"  Id., at 20, 25.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two decades later, we confronted a similar arrangement in United States v. Univis Lens Co.  There, a company that made eyeglass lenses authorized an agent to sell its products to wholesalers and retailers only if they promised to market the lenses at fixed prices.  The Government filed an antitrust lawsuit, and the company defended its arrangement on the ground that it was exercising authority under the Patent Act.  We held that the initial sales \"relinquish[ed] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the patent monopoly with respect to the article[s] sold,\" so the \"stipulation .\u00a0.\u00a0. fixing resale prices derive[d] no support from the patent and must stand on the same footing\" as restrictions on unpatented goods.  316 U.\u00a0S., at 249-251.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that Boston Store and Univis involved resale price restrictions that, at the time of those decisions, violated the antitrust laws.  But in both cases it was the sale of the items, rather than the illegality of the restrictions, that prevented the patentees from enforcing those resale price agreements through patent infringement suits.  And if there were any lingering doubt that patent exhaustion applies even when a sale is subject to an express, otherwise lawful restriction, our recent decision in Quanta Computer, Inc. v. LG Electronics, Inc. settled the matter.  In that case, a technology company--with authorization from the patentee--sold microprocessors under contracts requiring purchasers to use those processors with other parts that the company manufactured.  One buyer disregarded the restriction, and the patentee sued for infringement.  Without so much as mentioning the lawfulness of the contract, we held that the patentee could not bring an infringement suit because the \"authorized sale .\u00a0.\u00a0. took its products outside the scope of the patent monopoly.\"  553 U.\u00a0S., at 638.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the case at hand, we conclude that this well-settled line of precedent allows for only one answer: Lexmark cannot bring a patent infringement suit against Impression Products to enforce the single-use\/no-resale provision accompanying its Return Program cartridges.  Once sold, the Return Program cartridges passed outside of the patent monopoly, and whatever rights Lexmark retained are a matter of the contracts with its purchasers, not the patent law.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit reached a different result largely because it got off on the wrong foot.  The \"exhaustion doctrine,\" the court believed, \"must be understood as an interpretation of\" the infringement statute, which prohibits anyone from using or selling a patented article \"without authority\" from the patentee.  816 F.\u00a03d, at 734 (quoting 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(a)).  Exhaustion reflects a default rule that a patentee's decision to sell an item \"presumptively grant[s] 'authority' to the purchaser to use it and resell it.\"  816 F.\u00a03d, at 742.  But, the Federal Circuit explained, the patentee does not have to hand over the full \"bundle of rights\" every time.  Id., at 741 (internal quotation marks omitted).  If the patentee expressly withholds a stick from the bundle--perhaps by restricting the purchaser's resale rights--the buyer never acquires that withheld authority, and the patentee may continue to enforce its right to exclude that practice under the patent laws.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The misstep in this logic is that the exhaustion doctrine is not a presumption about the authority that comes along with a sale; it is instead a limit on \"the scope of the patentee's rights.\"  United States v. General Elec. Co., 272 U.\u00a0S. 476, 489 (1926) (emphasis added).  The right to use, sell, or import an item exists independently of the Patent Act.  What a patent adds--and grants exclusively to the pat-entee--is a limited right to prevent others from engaging in those practices.  See Crown Die & Tool Co. v. Nye Tool & Machine Works, 261 U.\u00a0S. 24, 35 (1923).  Exhaustion extinguishes that exclusionary power.  See Bloomer, 14 How., at 549 (the purchaser \"exercises no rights created by the act of Congress, nor does he derive title to [the item] by virtue of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. exclusive privilege granted to the patentee\").  As a result, the sale transfers the right to use, sell, or import because those are the rights that come along with ownership, and the buyer is free and clear of an infringement lawsuit because there is no exclusionary right left to enforce.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit also expressed concern that preventing patentees from reserving patent rights when they sell goods would create an artificial distinction between such sales and sales by licensees.  Patentees, the court explained, often license others to make and sell their products, and may place restrictions on those licenses.  A computer developer could, for instance, license a manufacturer to make its patented devices and sell them only for non-commercial use by individuals.  If a licensee breaches the license by selling a computer for commercial use, the patentee can sue the licensee for infringement.  And, in the Federal Circuit's view, our decision in General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co., 304 U.\u00a0S. 175, aff'd on reh'g, 305 U.\u00a0S. 124 (1938), established that--when a patentee grants a license \"under clearly stated restrictions on post-sale activities\" of those who purchase products from the licensee--the patentee can also sue for infringement those purchasers who knowingly violate the restrictions.  816 F.\u00a03d, at 743-744.  If patentees can employ licenses to impose post-sale restrictions on purchasers that are enforceable through infringement suits, the court concluded, it would make little sense to prevent patentees from doing so when they sell directly to consumers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit's concern is misplaced.  A patentee can impose restrictions on licensees because a license does not implicate the same concerns about restraints on alienation as a sale.  Patent exhaustion reflects the principle that, when an item passes into commerce, it should not be shaded by a legal cloud on title as it moves through the marketplace.  But a license is not about passing title to a product, it is about changing the contours of the patentee's monopoly: The patentee agrees not to exclude a licensee from making or selling the patented invention, expanding the club of authorized producers and sellers.  See General Elec. Co., 272 U.\u00a0S., at 489-490.  Because the patentee is exchanging rights, not goods, it is free to relinquish only a portion of its bundle of patent protections.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A patentee's authority to limit licensees does not, as the Federal Circuit thought, mean that patentees can use licenses to impose post-sale restrictions on purchasers that are enforceable through the patent laws.  So long as a licensee complies with the license when selling an item, the patentee has, in effect, authorized the sale.  That licensee's sale is treated, for purposes of patent exhaustion, as if the patentee made the sale itself.  The result: The sale exhausts the patentee's rights in that item.  See Hobbie v. Jennison, 149 U.\u00a0S. 355, 362-363 (1893).  A license may require the licensee to impose a restriction on purchasers, like the license limiting the computer manufacturer to selling for non-commercial use by individuals.  But if the licensee does so--by, perhaps, having each customer sign a contract promising not to use the computers in business--the sale nonetheless exhausts all patent rights in the item sold.  See Motion Picture Patents Co. v. Universal Film Mfg. Co., 243 U.\u00a0S. 502, 506-507, 516 (1917).  The purchasers might not comply with the restriction, but the only recourse for the licensee is through contract law, just as if the patentee itself sold the item with a restriction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0General Talking Pictures involved a fundamentally different situation: There, a licensee \"knowingly ma[de] .\u00a0.\u00a0. sales .\u00a0.\u00a0. outside the scope of its license.\"  304 U.\u00a0S., at 181-182 (emphasis added).  We treated the sale \"as if no license whatsoever had been granted\" by the patentee, which meant that the patentee could sue both the licensee and the purchaser--who knew about the breach--for infringement.  General Talking Pictures Corp. v. Western Elec. Co., 305 U.\u00a0S. 124, 127 (1938).  This does not mean that patentees can use licenses to impose post-sale restraints on purchasers.  Quite the contrary: The licensee infringed the patentee's rights because it did not comply with the terms of its license, and the patentee could bring a patent suit against the purchaser only because the purchaser participated in the licensee's infringement.  General Talking Pictures, then, stands for the modest principle that, if a patentee has not given authority for a licensee to make a sale, that sale cannot exhaust the patentee's rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, patent exhaustion is uniform and automatic.  Once a patentee decides to sell--whether on its own or through a licensee--that sale exhausts its patent rights, regardless of any post-sale restrictions the patentee purports to impose, either directly or through a license.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our conclusion that Lexmark exhausted its patent rights when it sold the domestic Return Program cartridges goes only halfway to resolving this case.  Lexmark also sold toner cartridges abroad and sued Impression Products for patent infringement for \"importing [Lexmark's] invention into the United States.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7154(a).  Lexmark contends that it may sue for infringement with respect to all of the imported cartridges--not just those in the Return Program--because a foreign sale does not trigger patent exhaustion unless the patentee \"expressly or implicitly transfer[s] or license[s]\" its rights.  Brief for Respondent 36-37.  The Federal Circuit agreed, but we do not.  An authorized sale outside the United States, just as one within the United States, exhausts all rights under the Patent Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This question about international exhaustion of intellectual property rights has also arisen in the context of copyright law.  Under the \"first sale doctrine,\" which is codified at 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7109(a), when a copyright owner sells a lawfully made copy of its work, it loses the power to restrict the purchaser's freedom \"to sell or otherwise dispose of .\u00a0.\u00a0. that copy.\"  In Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., we held that this \"\u00a0'first sale' [rule] applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made [and sold] abroad.\"  568 U.\u00a0S., at 525.  We began with the text of \u00a7109(a), but it was not decisive: The language neither \"restrict[s] the scope of [the] 'first sale' doctrine geographically,\" nor clearly embraces international exhaustion.  Id., at 528-533.  What helped tip the scales for global exhaustion was the fact that the first sale doctrine originated in \"the common law's refusal to permit restraints on the alienation of chattels.\"  Id., at 538.  That \"common-law doctrine makes no geographical distinctions.\"  Id., at 539.  The lack of any textual basis for distinguishing between domestic and international sales meant that \"a straightforward application\" of the first sale doctrine required the conclusion that it applies overseas.  Id., at 540 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying patent exhaustion to foreign sales is just as straightforward.  Patent exhaustion, too, has its roots in the antipathy toward restraints on alienation, see supra, at 6-8, and nothing in the text or history of the Patent Act shows that Congress intended to confine that borderless common law principle to domestic sales.  In fact, Congress has not altered patent exhaustion at all; it remains an unwritten limit on the scope of the patentee's monopoly.  See Astoria Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Solimino, 501 U.\u00a0S. 104, 108 (1991) (\"[W]here a common-law principle is well established, .\u00a0.\u00a0. courts may take it as given that Congress has legislated with an expectation that the principle will apply except when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And differentiating the patent exhaustion and copyright first sale doctrines would make little theoretical or practical sense: The two share a \"strong similarity .\u00a0.\u00a0. and identity of purpose,\" Bauer & Cie v. O'Donnell, 229 U.\u00a0S. 1, 13 (1913), and many everyday products--\"automobiles, microwaves, calculators, mobile phones, tablets, and personal computers\"--are subject to both patent and copyright protections, see Kirtsaeng, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 545; Brief for Costco Wholesale Corp. et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 14-15.  There is a \"historic kinship between patent law and copyright law,\" Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.\u00a0S. 417, 439 (1984), and the bond between the two leaves no room for a rift on the question of international exhaustion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lexmark sees the matter differently.  The Patent Act, it points out, limits the patentee's \"right to exclude others\" from making, using, selling, or importing its products to acts that occur in the United States.  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7154(a).  A domestic sale, it argues, triggers exhaustion because the sale compensates the patentee for \"surrendering [those] U.\u00a0S. rights.\"  Brief for Respondent 38.  A foreign sale is different: The Patent Act does not give patentees exclusionary powers abroad.  Without those powers, a patentee selling in a foreign market may not be able to sell its product for the same price that it could in the United States, and therefore is not sure to receive \"the reward guaranteed by U.\u00a0S. patent law.\"  Id., at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Absent that reward, says Lexmark, there should be no exhaustion.  In short, there is no patent exhaustion from sales abroad because there are no patent rights abroad to exhaust.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The territorial limit on patent rights is, however, no basis for distinguishing copyright protections; those protections \"do not have any extraterritorial operation\" either.  5 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright \u00a717.02, p. 17-26 (2017).  Nor does the territorial limit support the premise of Lexmark's argument.  Exhaustion is a separate limit on the patent grant, and does not depend on the patentee receiving some undefined premium for selling the right to access the American market.  A purchaser buys an item, not patent rights.  And exhaustion is triggered by the patentee's decision to give that item up and receive whatever fee it decides is appropriate \"for the article and the invention which it embodies.\"  Univis, 316 U.\u00a0S., at 251.  The patentee may not be able to command the same amount for its products abroad as it does in the United States.  But the Patent Act does not guarantee a particular price, much less the price from selling to American consumers.  Instead, the right to exclude just ensures that the patentee receives one reward--of whatever amount the patentee deems to be \"satisfactory compensation,\" Keeler, 157 U.\u00a0S., at 661--for every item that passes outside the scope of the patent monopoly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has addressed international patent exhaustion in only one case, Boesch v. Gr\u00e4ff, decided over 125 years ago.  All that case illustrates is that a sale abroad does not exhaust a patentee's rights when the patentee had nothing to do with the transaction.  Boesch--from the days before the widespread adoption of electrical lighting--involved a retailer who purchased lamp burners from a manufacturer in Germany, with plans to sell them in the United States.  The manufacturer had authority to make the burners under German law, but there was a hitch: Two individuals with no ties to the German manufacturer held the American patent to that invention.  These patentees sued the retailer for infringement when the retailer imported the lamp burners into the United States, and we rejected the argument that the German manufacturer's sale had exhausted the American patentees' rights.  The German manufacturer had no permission to sell in the United States from the American patentees, and the American patentees had not exhausted their patent rights in the products because they had not sold them to anyone, so \"purchasers from [the German manufacturer] could not be thereby authorized to sell the articles in the United States.\"  133 U.\u00a0S. 697, 703 (1890).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision did not, as Lexmark contends, exempt all foreign sales from patent exhaustion.  See Brief for Respondent 44-45.  Rather, it reaffirmed the basic premise that only the patentee can decide whether to make a sale that exhausts its patent rights in an item.  The American patentees did not do so with respect to the German products, so the German sales did not exhaust their rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the United States, as an amicus, advocates what it views as a middle-ground position: that \"a foreign sale authorized by the U.\u00a0S. patentee exhausts U.\u00a0S. patent rights unless those rights are expressly reserved.\"  Brief for United States 7-8.  Its position is largely based on policy rather than principle.  The Government thinks that an overseas \"buyer's legitimate expectation\" is that a \"sale conveys all of the seller's interest in the patented article,\" so the presumption should be that a foreign sale triggers exhaustion.  Id., at 32-33.  But, at the same time, \"lower courts long ago coalesced around\" the rule that \"a patentee's express reservation of U.\u00a0S. patent rights at the time of a foreign sale will be given effect,\" so that option should remain open to the patentee.  Id., at 22 (emphasis deleted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government has little more than \"long ago\" on its side.  In the 1890s, two circuit courts--in cases involving the same company--did hold that patentees may use express restrictions to reserve their patent rights in connection with foreign sales.  See Dickerson v. Tinling, 84 F. 192, 194-195 (CA8 1897); Dickerson v. Matheson, 57 F. 524, 527 (CA2 1893).  But no \"coalesc[ing]\" ever took place: Over the following hundred-plus years, only a smattering of lower court decisions mentioned this express-reservation rule for foreign sales.  See, e.g., Sanofi, S.\u00a0A. v. Med-Tech Veterinarian Prods., Inc., 565 F.\u00a0Supp. 931, 938 (NJ 1983).  And in 2001, the Federal Circuit adopted its blanket rule that foreign sales do not trigger exhaustion, even if the patentee fails to expressly reserve its rights.  Jazz Photo, 264 F.\u00a03d, at 1105.  These sparse and inconsistent decisions provide no basis for any expectation, let alone a settled one, that patentees can reserve patent rights when they sell abroad.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The theory behind the Government's express-reservation rule also wrongly focuses on the likely expectations of the patentee and purchaser during a sale.  Exhaustion does not arise because of the parties' expectations about how sales transfer patent rights.  More is at stake when it comes to patents than simply the dealings between the parties, which can be addressed through contract law.  Instead, exhaustion occurs because, in a sale, the patentee elects to give up title to an item in exchange for payment.  Allowing patent rights to stick remora-like to that item as it flows through the market would violate the principle against restraints on alienation.  Exhaustion does not depend on whether the patentee receives a premium for selling in the United States, or the type of rights that buyers expect to receive.  As a result, restrictions and location are irrelevant; what matters is the patentee's decision to make a sale.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nOpinion of Ginsburg, J.\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1189\nIMPRESSION PRODUCTS, INC., PETITIONER v.

See ante, at 5-13.  I dissent, however, from the Court's holding on international exhaustion.  A foreign sale, I would hold, does not exhaust a U.\u00a0S. inventor's U.\u00a0S. patent rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Patent law is territorial.  When an inventor receives a U.\u00a0S. patent, that patent provides no protection abroad.  See Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.\u00a0S. 518, 531 (1972) (\"Our patent system makes no claim to extraterritorial effect.\").  See also 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(a) (establishing liability for acts of patent infringement \"within the United States\" and for \"import[ation] into the United States [of] any patented invention\").  A U.\u00a0S. patentee must apply to each country in which she seeks the exclusive right to sell her invention.  Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U.\u00a0S. 437, 456 (2007) (\"[F]oreign law alone, not United States law, currently governs the manufacture and sale of components of patented inventions in foreign countries.\").  See also Convention at Brussels, An Additional Act Modifying the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property of Mar. 20, 1883, Dec. 14, 1900, Art.\u00a0I, 32 Stat. 1940 (\"Patents applied for in the different contracting States .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be independent of the patents obtained for the same invention in the other States.\").  And patent laws vary by country; each country's laws \"may embody different policy judgments about the relative rights of inventors, competitors, and the public in patented inventions.\"  Microsoft, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 455 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because a sale abroad operates independently of the U.\u00a0S. patent system, it makes little sense to say that such a sale exhausts an inventor's U.\u00a0S. patent rights.  U.\u00a0S. patent protection accompanies none of a U.\u00a0S. patentee's sales abroad--a competitor could sell the same patented product abroad with no U.\u00a0S.-patent-law consequence.  Accordingly, the foreign sale should not diminish the protections of U.\u00a0S. law in the United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority disagrees, in part because this Court decided, in Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 U.\u00a0S. 519, 525 (2013), that a foreign sale exhausts U.\u00a0S. copyright protections.  Copyright and patent exhaustion, the majority states, \"share a strong similarity.\"  Ante, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I dissented from our decision in Kirtsaeng and adhere to the view that a foreign sale should not exhaust U.\u00a0S. copyright protections.  See 568 U.\u00a0S., at 557.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But even if I subscribed to Kirtsaeng's reasoning with respect to copyright, that decision should bear little weight in the patent context.  Although there may be a \"historical kinship\" between patent law and copyright law, Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 464 U.\u00a0S. 417, 439 (1984), the two \"are not identical twins,\" id, at 439, n.\u00a019.  The Patent Act contains no analogue to 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7109(a), the Copyright Act first-sale provision analyzed in Kirtsaeng.  See ante, at 13-14.  More importantly, copyright protections, unlike patent protections, are harmonized across countries.  Under the Berne Convention, which 174 countries have joined,1 members \"agree to treat authors from other member countries as well as they treat their own.\"  Golan v. Holder, 565 U.\u00a0S. 302, 308 (2012) (citing Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, Sept. 9, 1886, as revised at Stockholm on July 14, 1967, Arts. 1, 5(1), 828 U.\u00a0N.\u00a0T.\u00a0S. 225, 231-233).  The copyright protections one receives abroad are thus likely to be similar to those received at home, even if provided under each country's separate copyright regime.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, I would affirm the Federal Circuit's judgment with respect to foreign exhaustion.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See WIPO-Administered Treaties: Contracting Parties: Berne  Convention, www.wipo.int\/treaties\/en\/ShowResults.jsp?lang=en&treaty_ id=5 (as last visited May 25, 2017).\n\n\n","34":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nJAE LEE v. UNITED STATES(2017)\nNo. 16-327\nArgued: March 28, 2017Decided: June 23, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Jae Lee moved to the United States from South Korea with his parents when he was 13.  In the 35 years he has spent in this country, he has never returned to South Korea, nor has he become a U.\u00a0S. citizen, living instead as a lawful permanent resident.  In 2008, federal officials received a tip from a confidential informant that Lee had sold the informant ecstasy and marijuana.  After obtaining a warrant, the officials searched Lee's house, where they found drugs, cash, and a loaded rifle.  Lee admitted that the drugs were his, and a grand jury indicted him on one count of possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute.  Lee retained counsel and entered into plea discussions with the Government.  During the plea process, Lee repeatedly asked his attorney whether he would face deportation; his attorney assured him that he would not be deported as a result of pleading guilty.  Based on that assurance, Lee accepted a plea and was sentenced to a year and a day in prison.  Lee had in fact pleaded guilty to an \"aggravated felony\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(43)(B), so he was, contrary to his attorney's advice, subject to mandatory deportation as a result of that plea.  See \u00a71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  When Lee learned of this consequence, he filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence, arguing that his attorney had provided constitutionally ineffective assistance.  At an evidentiary hearing, both Lee and his plea-stage counsel testified that \"deportation was the determinative issue\" to Lee in deciding whether to accept a plea, and Lee's counsel acknowledged that although Lee's defense to the charge was weak, if he had known Lee would be deported upon pleading guilty, he would have advised him to go to trial.  A Magistrate Judge recommended that Lee's plea be set aside and his conviction vacated.  The District Court, however, denied relief, and the Sixth Circuit affirmed.  Applying the two-part test for ineffective assistance claims from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, the Sixth Circuit concluded that, while the Government conceded that Lee's counsel had performed deficiently, Lee could not show that he was prejudiced by his attorney's erroneous advice.\nHeld:\u00a0Lee has demonstrated that he was prejudiced by his counsel's erroneous advice.  Pp.\u00a05-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0When a defendant claims that his counsel's deficient performance deprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the defendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.\u00a0S. 52, 59.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lee contends that he can make this showing because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known the result would be deportation.  The Government contends that Lee cannot show prejudice from accepting a plea where his only hope at trial was that something unexpected and unpredictable might occur that would lead to acquittal.  Pp.\u00a05-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Government makes two errors in urging the adoption of a per se rule that a defendant with no viable defense cannot show prejudice from the denial of his right to trial.  First, it forgets that categorical rules are ill suited to an inquiry that demands a \"case-by-case examination\" of the \"totality of the evidence.\"  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.\u00a0S. 362, 391 (internal quotation marks omitted); Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 695.  More fundamentally, it overlooks that the Hill v. Lockhart inquiry focuses on a defendant's decisionmaking, which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea.  See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.\u00a0S. 289, 322-323.  When those consequences are, from the defendant's perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive.  For Lee, deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time; he says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation in favor of throwing a \"Hail Mary\" at trial.  Pointing to Strickland, the Government urges that \"[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 695.  That statement, however, was made in the context of discussing the presumption of reliability applied to judicial proceedings, which has no place where, as here, a defendant was deprived of a proceeding altogether.  When the inquiry is focused on what an individual defendant would have done, the possibility of even a highly improbable result may be pertinent to the extent it would have affected the defendant's decisionmaking.  Pp.\u00a08-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Courts should not upset a plea solely because of post hoc assertions from a defendant about how he would have pleaded but for his attorney's deficiencies.  Rather, they should look to contemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant's expressed preferences.  In the unusual circumstances of this case, Lee has adequately demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea had he known that it would lead to mandatory deportation: Both Lee and his attorney testified that \"deportation was the determinative issue\" to Lee; his responses during his plea colloquy confirmed the importance he placed on deportation; and he had strong connections to the United States, while he had no ties to South Korea.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government argues that Lee cannot \"convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances,\" Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\u00a0S. 356, 372, since deportation would almost certainly result from a trial.  Unlike the Government, this Court cannot say that it would be irrational for someone in Lee's position to risk additional prison time in exchange for holding on to some chance of avoiding deportation.  Pp.\u00a010-13.\n825 F.\u00a03d 311, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roberts, C.\u00a0J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 23, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Jae Lee was indicted on one count of possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute.  Although he has lived in this country for most of his life, Lee is not a United States citizen, and he feared that a criminal conviction might affect his status as a lawful permanent resident.  His attorney assured him there was nothing to worry about--the Government would not deport him if he pleaded guilty.  So Lee, who had no real defense to the charge, opted to accept a plea that carried a lesser prison sentence than he would have faced at trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lee's attorney was wrong: The conviction meant that Lee was subject to mandatory deportation from this country.  Lee seeks to vacate his conviction on the ground that, in accepting the plea, he received ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of the Sixth Amendment.  Everyone agrees that Lee received objectively unreasonable representation.  The question presented is whether he can show he was prejudiced as a result.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jae Lee moved to the United States from South Korea in 1982.  He was 13 at the time.  His parents settled the family in New York City, where they opened a small coffee shop.  After graduating from a business high school in Manhattan, Lee set out on his own to Memphis, Tennessee, where he started working at a restaurant.  After three years, Lee decided to try his hand at running a business.  With some assistance from his family, Lee opened the Mandarin Palace Chinese Restaurant in a Memphis suburb.  The Mandarin was a success, and Lee eventually opened a second restaurant nearby.  In the 35 years he has spent in the country, Lee has never returned to South Korea.  He did not become a United States citizen, living instead as a lawful permanent resident.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time he was running his lawful businesses, Lee also engaged in some illegitimate activity.  In 2008, a confidential informant told federal officials that Lee had sold the informant approximately 200 ecstasy pills and two ounces of hydroponic marijuana over the course of eight years.  The officials obtained a search warrant for Lee's house, where they found 88 ecstasy pills, three Valium tablets, $32,432 in cash, and a loaded rifle.  Lee admitted that the drugs were his and that he had given ecstasy to his friends.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A grand jury indicted Lee on one count of possessing ecstasy with intent to distribute in violation of 21 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7841(a)(1).  Lee retained an attorney and entered into plea discussions with the Government.  The attorney advised Lee that going to trial was \"very risky\" and that, if he pleaded guilty, he would receive a lighter sentence than he would if convicted at trial.  App. 167.  Lee informed his attorney of his noncitizen status and repeatedly asked him whether he would face deportation as a result of the criminal proceedings.  The attorney told Lee that he would not be deported as a result of pleading guilty.  Lee v. United States, 825 F.\u00a03d 311, 313 (CA6 2016).  Based on that assurance, Lee accepted the plea and the District Court sentenced him to a year and a day in prison, though it deferred commencement of Lee's sentence for two months so that Lee could manage his restaurants over the holiday season.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lee quickly learned, however, that a prison term was not the only consequence of his plea.  Lee had pleaded guilty to what qualifies as an \"aggravated felony\" under the Immigration and Nationality Act, and a noncitizen convicted of such an offense is subject to mandatory deportation.  See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71101(a)(43)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii); Calcano-Martinez v. INS, 533 U.\u00a0S. 348, 350, n.\u00a01 (2001).  Upon learning that he would be deported after serving his sentence, Lee filed a motion under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72255 to vacate his conviction and sentence, arguing that his attorney had provided constitutionally ineffective assistance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At an evidentiary hearing on Lee's motion, both Lee and his plea-stage counsel testified that \"deportation was the determinative issue in Lee's decision whether to accept the plea.\"  Report and Recommendation in No. 2:10-cv-02698 (WD Tenn.), pp. 6-7 (Report and Recommendation).  In fact, Lee explained, his attorney became \"pretty upset because every time something comes up I always ask about immigration status,\" and the lawyer \"always said why [are you] worrying about something that you don't need to worry about.\"  App. 170.  According to Lee, the lawyer assured him that if deportation was not in the plea agreement, \"the government cannot deport you.\"  Ibid.  Lee's attorney testified that he thought Lee's case was a \"bad case to try\" because Lee's defense to the charge was weak.  Id., at 218-219.  The attorney nonetheless acknowledged that if he had known Lee would be deported upon pleading guilty, he would have advised him to go to trial.  Id., at 236, 244.  Based on the hearing testimony, a Magistrate Judge recommended that Lee's plea be set aside and his conviction vacated because he had received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court, however, denied relief.  Applying our two-part test for ineffective assistance claims from Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984), the District Court concluded that Lee's counsel had performed deficiently by giving improper advice about the deportation consequences of the plea.  But, \"[i]n light of the overwhelming evidence of Lee's guilt,\" Lee \"would have almost certainly\" been found guilty and received \"a significantly longer prison sentence, and subsequent deportation,\" had he gone to trial.  Order in No. 2:10-cv-02698 (WD Tenn.), p.\u00a024 (Order).  Lee therefore could not show he was  prejudiced by his attorney's erroneous advice.  Viewing  its resolution of the issue as debatable among jurists  of reason, the District Court granted a certificate of  appealability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the denial of relief.  On appeal, the Government conceded that the performance of Lee's attorney had been deficient.  To establish that he was prejudiced by that deficient performance, the court explained, Lee was required to show \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"  825 F.\u00a03d, at 313 (quoting Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.\u00a0S. 52, 59 (1985); internal quotation marks omitted).  Lee had \"no bona fide defense, not even a weak one,\" so he \"stood to gain nothing from going to trial but more prison time.\"  825 F.\u00a03d, at 313, 316.  Relying on Circuit precedent holding that \"no rational defendant charged with a deportable offense and facing overwhelming evidence of guilt would proceed to trial rather than take a plea deal with a shorter prison sentence,\" the Court of Appeals concluded that Lee could not show prejudice.  Id., at 314 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We granted certiorari.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Amendment guarantees a defendant the effective assistance of counsel at \"critical stages of a criminal proceeding,\" including when he enters a guilty plea.  Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.\u00a0S. 156, 165 (2012); Hill, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 58.  To demonstrate that counsel was constitutionally ineffective, a defendant must show that counsel's representation \"fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\" and that he was prejudiced as a result.  Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 688, 692.  The first requirement is not at issue in today's case: The Government concedes that Lee's plea-stage counsel provided inadequate representation when he assured Lee that he would not be deported if he pleaded guilty.  Brief for United States 15.  The question is whether Lee can show he was prejudiced by that erroneous advice.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel will often involve a claim of attorney error \"during the course of a legal proceeding\"--for example, that counsel failed to raise an objection at trial or to present an argument on appeal.  Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S. 470, 481 (2000).  A defendant raising such a claim can demonstrate prejudice by showing \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Id., at 482 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 694; internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But in this case counsel's \"deficient performance arguably led not to a judicial proceeding of disputed reliability,  but rather to the forfeiture of a proceeding itself.\"  Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 483.  When a defendant alleges his counsel's deficient performance led him to accept a guilty plea rather than go to trial, we do not ask whether, had he gone to trial, the result of that trial \"would have been different\" than the result of the plea bargain.  That is because, while we ordinarily \"apply a strong presumption of reliability to judicial proceedings,\" \"we cannot accord\" any such presumption \"to judicial proceedings that never took place.\"  Id., at 482-483 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We instead consider whether the defendant was prejudiced by the \"denial of the entire judicial proceeding .\u00a0.\u00a0. to which he had a right.\"  Id., at 483.  As we held in Hill v. Lockhart, when a defendant claims that his counsel's deficient performance deprived him of a trial by causing him to accept a plea, the defendant can show prejudice by demonstrating a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"  474 U.\u00a0S., at 59.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent contends that a defendant must also show that he would have been better off going to trial.  That is true when the defendant's decision about going to trial turns on his prospects of success and those are affected by the attorney's error--for instance, where a defendant alleges that his lawyer should have but did not seek to suppress an improperly obtained confession.  Premo v. Moore, 562 U.\u00a0S. 115, 118 (2011); cf., e.g., Hill, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 59 (discussing failure to investigate potentially exculpatory evidence).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not all errors, however, are of that sort.  Here Lee knew, correctly, that his prospects of acquittal at trial were grim, and his attorney's error had nothing to do with that.  The error was instead one that affected Lee's understanding of the consequences of pleading guilty.  The Court confronted precisely this kind of error in Hill.  See id., at 60 (\"the claimed error of counsel is erroneous advice as to eligibility for parole\").  Rather than asking how a hypothetical trial would have played out absent the error, the Court considered whether there was an adequate showing that the defendant, properly advised, would have opted to go to trial.  The Court rejected the defendant's claim because he had \"alleged no special circumstances that might support the conclusion that he placed particular emphasis on his parole eligibility in deciding whether or not to plead guilty.\"  Ibid.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lee, on the other hand, argues he can establish prejudice under Hill because he never would have accepted a guilty plea had he known that he would be deported as a result.  Lee insists he would have gambled on trial, risking more jail time for whatever small chance there might be of an acquittal that would let him remain in the United States.2  The Government responds that, since Lee had no viable defense at trial, he would almost certainly have lost and found himself still subject to deportation, with a lengthier prison sentence to boot.  Lee, the Government contends, cannot show prejudice from accepting a plea where his only hope at trial was that something unexpected and unpredictable might occur that would lead to an acquittal.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government asks that we, like the Court of Appeals below, adopt a per\u00a0se rule that a defendant with no viable defense cannot show prejudice from the denial of his right to trial.  Brief for United States 26.  As a general matter, it makes sense that a defendant who has no realistic defense to a charge supported by sufficient evidence will be unable to carry his burden of showing prejudice from accepting a guilty plea.  But in elevating this general proposition to a per\u00a0se rule, the Government makes two errors.  First, it forgets that categorical rules are ill suited to an inquiry that we have emphasized demands a \"case-by-case examination\" of the \"totality of the evidence.\"  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.\u00a0S. 362, 391 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted); Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 695.  And, more fundamentally, the Government overlooks that the inquiry we prescribed in Hill v. Lockhart focuses on a defendant's decisionmaking, which may not turn solely on the likelihood of conviction after trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A defendant without any viable defense will be highly likely to lose at trial.  And a defendant facing such long odds will rarely be able to show prejudice from accepting a guilty plea that offers him a better resolution than would be likely after trial.  But that is not because the prejudice inquiry in this context looks to the probability of a conviction for its own sake.  It is instead because defendants obviously weigh their prospects at trial in deciding whether to accept a plea.  See Hill, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 59.  Where a defendant has no plausible chance of an acquittal at trial, it is highly likely that he will accept a plea if the Government offers one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But common sense (not to mention our precedent) recognizes that there is more to consider than simply the likelihood of success at trial.  The decision whether to plead guilty also involves assessing the respective consequences of a conviction after trial and by plea.  See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.\u00a0S. 289, 322-323 (2001).  When those consequences are, from the defendant's perspective, similarly dire, even the smallest chance of success at trial may look attractive.  For example, a defendant with no realistic defense to a charge carrying a 20-year sentence may nevertheless choose trial, if the prosecution's plea offer is 18 years.  Here Lee alleges that avoiding deportation was the determinative factor for him; deportation after some time in prison was not meaningfully different from deportation after somewhat less time.  He says he accordingly would have rejected any plea leading to deportation--even if it shaved off prison time--in favor of throwing a \"Hail Mary\" at trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government urges that, in such circumstances, the possibility of an acquittal after trial is \"irrelevant to the prejudice inquiry,\" pointing to our statement in Strickland that \"[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 695.  That statement, however, was made in the context of discussing the presumption of reliability we apply to judicial proceedings.  As we have explained, that presumption has no place where, as here, a defendant was deprived of a proceeding altogether.  Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S., at 483.  In a presumptively reliable proceeding, \"the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice, 'nullification,' and the like\" must by definition be ignored.  Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 695.  But where we are instead asking what an individual defendant would have done, the possibility of even a highly improbable result may be pertinent to the extent it  would have affected his decisionmaking.3\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Surmounting Strickland's high bar is never an easy task,\" Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\u00a0S. 356, 371 (2010), and the strong societal interest in finality has \"special force with respect to convictions based on guilty pleas.\"  United States v. Timmreck, 441 U.\u00a0S. 780, 784 (1979).  Courts should not upset a plea solely because of post\u00a0hoc assertions from a defendant about how he would have pleaded but for his attorney's deficiencies.  Judges should instead look to contemporaneous evidence to substantiate a defendant's expressed preferences.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the unusual circumstances of this case, we conclude that Lee has adequately demonstrated a reasonable probability that he would have rejected the plea had he known that it would lead to mandatory deportation.  There is no question that \"deportation was the determinative issue in Lee's decision whether to accept the plea deal.\"  Report and Recommendation, at 6-7; see also Order, at 14 (noting Government did not dispute testimony to this effect).  Lee asked his attorney repeatedly whether there was any risk of deportation from the proceedings, and both Lee and his attorney testified at the evidentiary hearing below that Lee would have gone to trial if he had known about the deportation consequences.  See Report and Recommendation, at 12 (noting \"the undisputed fact that had Lee at all been aware that deportation was possible as a result of his guilty plea, he would .\u00a0.\u00a0. not have pled guilty\"), adopted in relevant part in Order, at 15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lee demonstrated as much at his plea colloquy: When the judge warned him that a conviction \"could result in your being deported,\" and asked \"[d]oes that at all affect your decision about whether you want to plead guilty or not,\" Lee answered \"Yes, Your Honor.\"  App. 103.  When the judge inquired \"[h]ow does it affect your decision,\" Lee responded \"I don't understand,\" and turned to his attorney for advice.  Ibid.  Only when Lee's counsel assured him that the judge's statement was a \"standard warning\" was Lee willing to proceed to plead guilty.  Id., at 210.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no reason to doubt the paramount importance Lee placed on avoiding deportation.  Deportation is always \"a particularly severe penalty,\" Padilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 365 (internal quotation marks omitted), and we have \"recognized that 'preserving the client's right to remain in the United States may be more important to the client than any potential jail sentence,'\u00a0\" id., at 368 (quoting St. Cyr, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 322; alteration and some internal quotation marks omitted); see also Padilla, 559 U.\u00a0S., at 364 (\"[D]eportation is an integral part--indeed, sometimes the most important part--of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.\" (footnote omitted)).  At the time of his plea, Lee had lived in the United States for nearly three decades, had established two businesses in Tennessee, and was the only family member in the United States who could care for his elderly parents--both naturalized American citizens.  In contrast to these strong connections to the United States, there is no indication that he had any ties to South Korea; he had never returned there since leaving as a child.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government argues, however, that under Padilla v. Kentucky, a defendant \"must convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.\"  Id., at 372.  The Government contends that Lee cannot make that showing because he was going to be deported either way; going to trial would only result in a longer sentence before that inevitable consequence.  See Brief for United States 13, 21-23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We cannot agree that it would be irrational for a defendant in Lee's position to reject the plea offer in favor of trial.  But for his attorney's incompetence, Lee would have known that accepting the plea agreement would certainly lead to deportation.  Going to trial?  Almost certainly.  If deportation were the \"determinative issue\" for an individual in plea discussions, as it was for Lee; if that individual had strong connections to this country and no other, as did Lee; and if the consequences of taking a chance at trial were not markedly harsher than pleading, as in this case, that \"almost\" could make all the difference.  Balanced against holding on to some chance of avoiding deportation was a year or two more of prison time.  See id., at 6.  Not everyone in Lee's position would make the choice to reject the plea.  But we cannot say it would be irrational to do so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lee's claim that he would not have accepted a plea had he known it would lead to deportation is backed by substantial and uncontroverted evidence.  Accordingly we conclude Lee has demonstrated a \"reasonable probability that, but for [his] counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"  Hill, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 59.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-327\nJAE LEE, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 23, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Alito joins except for Part I, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today holds that a defendant can undo a guilty plea, well after sentencing and in the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt, because he would have chosen to pursue a defense at trial with no reasonable chance of success if his attorney had properly advised him of the immigration consequences of his plea.  Neither the Sixth Amendment nor this Court's precedents support that conclusion.  I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an initial matter, I remain of the view that the Sixth Amendment to the Constitution does not \"requir[e] counsel to provide accurate advice concerning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea.\"  Padilla v. Kentucky, 559 U.\u00a0S. 356, 388 (2010) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting).  I would therefore affirm the Court of Appeals on the ground that the Sixth Amendment does not apply to the allegedly ineffective assistance in this case.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the Court today announces a novel standard for prejudice at the plea stage, I further dissent on the separate ground that its standard does not follow from our precedents.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court and both of the parties agree that the prejudice inquiry in this context is governed by Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984).  See ante, at 5; Brief for Petitioner 16; Brief for United States 15.  The Court in Strickland held that a defendant may establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel by showing that his \"counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\" and, as relevant here, that the representation prejudiced the defendant by \"actually ha[ving] an adverse effect on the defense.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 688, 693.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To establish prejudice under Strickland, a defendant must show a \"reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\" Id., at 694. Strickland made clear that the \"result of the proceeding\" refers to the outcome of the defendant's criminal prosecution as a whole.  It defined \"reasonable probability\" as \"a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  And it explained that \"[a]n error by counsel .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\"  Id., at 691 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties agree that this inquiry assumes an \"objective\" decisionmaker.  Brief for Petitioner 17; Brief for United States 17.  That conclusion also follows directly from Strickland.  According to Strickland, the \"assessment of the likelihood of a result more favorable to the defendant must exclude the possibility of arbitrariness, whimsy, caprice, 'nullification,' and the like.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 695.  It does not depend on subjective factors such as \"the idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker,\" including the decisionmaker's \"unusual propensities toward harshness or leniency.\"  Ibid.  These factors are flatly \"irrelevant to the prejudice inquiry.\"  Ibid.  In other words, \"[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.\"  Ibid.  Instead, \"[t]he assessment of prejudice should proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Court extended the right to effective counsel to the plea stage, see Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.\u00a0S. 52 (1985), it held that \"the same two-part standard\" from Strickland applies.  474 U.\u00a0S., at 57 (repeating Strickland's teaching that even an unreasonable error by counsel \"\u00a0'does not warrant setting aside the judgment'\u00a0\" so long as the error \"\u00a0'had no effect on the judgment'\u00a0\" (quoting 466 U.\u00a0S., at 691)).  To be sure, the Court said--and the majority today emphasizes--that a defendant asserting an ineffectiveness claim at the plea stage \"must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"  474 U.\u00a0S., at 59.  But that requirement merely reflects the reality that a defendant cannot show that the outcome of his case would have been different if he would have accepted his current plea anyway.*  In other words, the defendant's ability to show that he would have gone to trial is necessary, but not sufficient, to establish prejudice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hill Court went on to explain that Strickland's two-part test applies the same way in the plea context as in other contexts.  In particular, the \"assessment\" will primarily turn on \"a prediction whether,\" in the absence of counsel's error, \"the evidence\" of the defendant's innocence or guilt \"likely would have changed the outcome\" of the proceeding.  474 U.\u00a0S., at 59.  Thus, a defendant cannot show prejudice where it is \"\u00a0'inconceivable'\u00a0\" not only that he would have gone to trial, but also \"\u00a0'that if he had done so he either would have been acquitted or, if convicted, would nevertheless have been given a shorter sentence than he actually received.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting Evans v. Meyer, 742 F.\u00a02d 371, 375 (CA7 1984) (emphasis added)).  In sum, the proper inquiry requires a defendant to show both that he would have rejected his plea and gone to trial and that he would likely have obtained a more favorable result in the end.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent Hill was ambiguous about the standard, our precedents applying it confirm this interpretation.  In Premo v. Moore, 562 U.\u00a0S. 115 (2011), the Court emphasized that \"strict adherence to the Strickland standard\" is \"essential\" when reviewing claims about attorney error \"at the plea bargain stage.\"  Id., at 125.  In that case, the defendant argued that his counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he had failed to seek suppression of his confession before he pleaded no contest.  In analyzing the prejudice issue, the Court did not focus solely on whether the suppression hearing would have turned out differently, or whether the defendant would have chosen to go to trial.  It focused as well on the weight of the evidence against the defendant and the fact that he likely would not have obtained a more favorable result at trial, regardless of whether he succeeded at the suppression hearing.  See id., at 129 (describing the State's case as \"formidable\" and observing that \"[t]he bargain counsel struck\" in the plea agreement was \"a favorable one\" to the defendant compared to what might have happened at trial).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.\u00a0S. 134 (2012), took a similar approach.  In that case, the Court extended Hill to hold that counsel could be constitutionally ineffective for failing to communicate a plea deal to a defendant.  566 U.\u00a0S., at 145.  The Court emphasized that, in addition to showing a reasonable probability that the defendant \"would have accepted the earlier plea offer,\" it is also \"necessary\" to show a \"reasonable probability that the end result of the criminal process would have been more favorable by reason of a plea to a lesser charge or a sentence of less prison time.\"  Id., at 147; see also id., at 150 (the defendant \"must show not only a reasonable probability that he would have accepted the lapsed plea but also a reasonable probability that the prosecution would have adhered to the agreement and that it would have been accepted by the trial court\" (emphasis added)).  In short, the Court did not focus solely on whether the defendant would have accepted the plea.  It instead required the defendant to show that the ultimate outcome would have been different.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Court's decision in Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.\u00a0S. 156 (2012), is to the same effect.  In that case, the Court concluded that counsel may be constitutionally ineffective by causing a defendant to reject a plea deal he should have accepted.  Id., at 164.  The Court again emphasized that the prejudice inquiry requires a showing that the criminal prosecution would ultimately have ended differently for the defendant--not merely that the defendant would have accepted the deal.  The Court stated that the defendant in those circumstances \"must show\" a reasonable probability that \"the conviction or sentence, or both, under the offer's terms would have been less severe than under the judgment and sentence that in fact were imposed.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These precedents are consistent with our cases governing the right to effective assistance of counsel in other contexts.  This Court has held that the right to effective counsel applies to all \"critical stages of the criminal proceedings.\"  Montejo v. Louisiana, 556 U.\u00a0S. 778, 786 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Those stages include not only \"the entry of a guilty plea,\" but also \"arraignments, postindictment interrogation, [and] postindictment lineups.\"  Frye, supra, at 140 (citing cases).  In those circumstances, the Court has not held that the prejudice inquiry focuses on whether that stage of the proceeding would have ended differently.  It instead has made clear that the prejudice inquiry is the same as in Strickland, which requires a defendant to establish that he would have been better off in the end had his counsel not erred. See 466 U.\u00a0S., at 694.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority misapplies this Court's precedents when it concludes that a defendant may establish prejudice by showing only that \"he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial,\" without showing that \"the result of that trial would have been different than the result of the plea bargain.\"  Ante, at 5, 6 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In reaching this conclusion, the Court relies almost exclusively on the single line from Hill that \"the defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\"  474 U.\u00a0S., at 59.  For the reasons explained above, that sentence prescribes the threshold showing a defendant must make to establish Strickland prejudice where a defendant has accepted a guilty plea.  In Hill, the Court concluded that the defendant had not made that showing, so it rejected his claim.  The Court did not, however, further hold that a defendant can establish prejudice by making that showing alone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also relies on a case that arises in a completely different context, Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.\u00a0S. 470 (2000).  There, the Court considered a defendant's claim that his attorney failed to file a notice of appeal.  See id., at 474.  The Court observed that the lawyer's failure to file the notice of appeal \"arguably led not to a judicial proceeding of disputed reliability,\" but instead to \"the forfeiture of a proceeding itself.\"  Id., at 483.  The Court today observes that petitioner's guilty plea meant that he did not go to trial.  Ante, at 5.  Because that trial \"\u00a0'never took place,'\u00a0\" the Court reasons, we cannot \"\u00a0'apply a strong presumption of reliability'\u00a0\" to it.  Ante, at 5-6 (quoting Flores-Ortega, supra, at 482-483).  And because the presumption of reliability does not apply, we may not depend on Strickland's statement \"that '[a] defendant has no entitlement to the luck of a lawless decisionmaker.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 8 (quoting 466 U.\u00a0S., at 695).  This point is key to the majority's conclusion that petitioner would have chosen to gamble on a trial even though he had no viable defense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's analysis, however, is directly contrary to Hill, which instructed a court undertaking a prejudice analysis to apply a presumption of reliability to the hypothetical trial that would have occurred had the defendant not pleaded guilty.  After explaining that a court should engage in a predictive inquiry about the likelihood of a defendant securing a better result at trial, the Court said: \"As we explained in Strickland v. Washington, supra, these predictions of the outcome at a possible trial, where necessary, should be made objectively, without regard for the 'idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.'\u00a0\"  474 U.\u00a0S., at 59-60 (quoting 466 U.\u00a0S., at 695).  That quote comes from the same paragraph in Strickland as the discussion about the presumption of reliability that attaches to the trial.  In other words, Hill instructs that the prejudice inquiry must presume that the foregone trial would have been reliable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority responds that Hill made statements about presuming a reliable trial only in \"discussing how courts should analyze 'predictions of the outcome at a possible trial,'\u00a0\" which \"will not always be 'necessary.'\u00a0\"  Ante, at 10, n.\u00a03 (quoting Hill, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 59-60).  I agree that such an inquiry is not always necessary--it is not necessary where, as in Hill, the defendant cannot show at the threshold that he would have rejected his plea and chosen to go to trial.  But that caveat says nothing about the application of the presumption of reliability when a defendant can make that threshold showing.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the Court in Hill recognized that guilty pleas are themselves generally reliable.  Guilty pleas \"rarely\" give rise to the \"concern that unfair procedures may have resulted in the conviction of an innocent defendant.\"  Id., at 58 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That is because \"a counseled plea of guilty is an admission of factual guilt so reliable that, where voluntary and intelligent, it quite validly removes the issue of factual guilt from the case.\"  Menna v. New York, 423 U.\u00a0S. 61, 62, n.\u00a02 (1975) (per curiam) (emphasis deleted).  Guilty pleas, like completed trials, are therefore entitled to the protections against collateral attack that the Strickland prejudice standard affords.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the majority does not dispute that the prejudice inquiry in Frye and Lafler focused on whether the defendant established a reasonable probability of a different outcome.  The majority instead distinguishes those cases on the ground that they involved a defendant who did not accept a guilty plea.  See ante, at 7, n. 1.  According to the majority, those cases \"articulated a different way to show prejudice, suited to the context of pleas not accepted.\"  Ibid.  But the Court in Frye and Lafler (and Hill, for that matter) did not purport to establish a \"different\" test for prejudice.  To the contrary, the Court repeatedly stated that it was applying the \"same two-part standard\" from Strickland.  Hill, supra, at 57 (emphasis added); accord, Frye, 566, U.\u00a0S., at 140 (\"Hill established that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel in the plea bargain context are governed by the two-part test set forth in Strickland\"); Lafler, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 162-163 (applying Strickland).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority today abandons any pretense of applying Strickland to claims of ineffective assistance of counsel that arise at the plea stage.  It instead concludes that one standard applies when a defendant goes to trial (Strickland); another standard applies when a defendant accepts a plea (Hill); and yet another standard applies when counsel does not apprise the defendant of an available plea or when the defendant rejects a plea (Frye and Lafler).  That approach leaves little doubt that the Court has \"open[ed] a whole new field of constitutionalized criminal procedure\"--\"plea-bargaining law\"--despite its repeated assurances that it has been applying the same Strickland standard all along.  Lafler, supra, at 175 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  In my view, we should take the Court's precedents at their word and conclude that \"[a]n error by counsel .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\"  Strickland, 466, U.\u00a0S., at 691.   \nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying the ordinary Strickland standard in this case, I do not think a defendant in petitioner's circumstances could show a reasonable probability that the result of his criminal proceeding would have been different had he not pleaded guilty.  Petitioner does not dispute that he possessed large quantities of illegal drugs or that the Government had secured a witness who had purchased the drugs directly from him.  In light of this \"overwhelming evidence of .\u00a0.\u00a0. guilt,\" 2014 WL 1260388, *15 (WD Tenn., Mar. 20, 2014), the Court of Appeals concluded that petitioner had \"no bona fide defense, not even a weak one,\" 825 F.\u00a03d 311, 316 (CA6 2016).  His only chance of succeeding would have been to \"thro[w] a 'Hail Mary' at trial.\"  Ante, at 8.  As I have explained, however, the Court in Strickland expressly foreclosed relying on the possibility of a \"Hail Mary\" to establish prejudice.  See supra, at 3.  Strickland made clear that the prejudice assessment should \"proceed on the assumption that the decisionmaker is reasonably, conscientiously, and impartially applying the standards that govern the decision.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 695.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the face of overwhelming evidence of guilt and in the absence of a bona fide defense, a reasonable court or jury applying the law to the facts of this case would find the defendant guilty.  There is no reasonable probability of any other verdict.  A defendant in petitioner's shoes, therefore, would have suffered the same deportation consequences regardless of whether he accepted a plea or went to trial.  He is thus plainly better off for having accepted his plea: had he gone to trial, he not only would have faced the same deportation consequences, he also likely would have received a higher prison sentence.  Finding that petitioner has established prejudice in these circumstances turns Strickland on its head.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision today will have pernicious consequences for the criminal justice system.  This Court has shown special solicitude for the plea process, which brings \"stability\" and \"certainty\" to \"the criminal justice system.\"  Premo, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 132.  The Court has warned that \"the prospect of collateral challenges\" threatens to undermine these important values.  Ibid.  And we have explained that \"[p]rosecutors must have assurance that a plea will not be undone years later,\" lest they \"forgo plea bargains that would benefit defendants,\" which would be \"a result favorable to no one.\"  Id., at 125.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today provides no assurance that plea deals negotiated in good faith with guilty defendants will remain final.  For one thing, the Court's artificially cabined standard for prejudice in the plea context is likely to generate a high volume of challenges to existing and future plea agreements.  Under the majority's standard, defendants bringing these challenges will bear a relatively low burden to show prejudice.  Whereas a defendant asserting an ordinary claim of ineffective assistance of counsel must prove that the ultimate outcome of his case would have been different, the Court today holds that a defendant who pleaded guilty need show only that he would have rejected his plea and gone to trial.  This standard does not appear to be particularly demanding, as even a defendant who has only the \"smallest chance of success at trial\"--relying on nothing more than a \"\u00a0'Hail Mary'\u00a0\"--may be able to satisfy it.  Ante, at 7, 8.  For another, the Court does not limit its holding to immigration consequences.  Under its rule, so long as a defendant alleges that his counsel omitted or misadvised him on a piece of information during the plea process that he considered of \"paramount importance,\" ante, at 10, he could allege a plausible claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to undermining finality, the Court's rule will impose significant costs on courts and prosecutors.  Under the Court's standard, a challenge to a guilty plea will be a highly fact-intensive, defendant-specific undertaking.  Petitioner suggests that each claim will \"at least\" require a \"hearing to get th[e] facts on the table.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 7.  Given that more than 90 percent of criminal convictions are the result of guilty pleas, Frye, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 143, the burden of holding evidentiary hearings on these claims could be significant.  In circumstances where a defendant has admitted his guilt, the evidence against him is overwhelming, and he has no bona fide defense strategy, I see no justification for imposing these costs.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The dissent also relies heavily on Missouri v. Frye, 566 U.\u00a0S. 134 (2012), and Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.\u00a0S. 156 (2012).  Those cases involved defendants who alleged that, but for their attorney's incompetence, they would have accepted a plea deal--not, as here and as in Hill, that they would have rejected a plea.  In both Frye and Lafler, the Court highlighted this difference: Immediately following the sentence that the dissent plucks from Frye, post, at 5 (opinion of Thomas, J.), the Court explained that its \"application of Strickland to the instances of an uncommunicated, lapsed plea does nothing to alter the standard laid out in Hill.\"  566 U.\u00a0S., at 148 (\"Hill was correctly decided and applies in the context in which it arose\").  Lafler, decided the same day as Frye, reiterated that \"[i]n contrast to Hill, here the ineffective advice led not to an offer's acceptance but to its rejection.\"  566 U.\u00a0S., at 163.  Frye and Lafler articulated a different way to show prejudice, suited to the context of pleas not accepted, not an additional element to the Hill inquiry.  See Frye, 566 U.\u00a0S., at 148 (\"Hill does not .\u00a0.\u00a0. provide the sole means for demonstrating prejudice arising from the deficient performance of counsel during plea negotiations\").  Contrary to the dissent's assertion, post, at 8-9, we do not depart from Strickland's requirement of prejudice.  The issue is how the required prejudice may be shown.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Lee also argues that he can show prejudice because, had his attorney advised him that he would be deported if he accepted the Government's plea offer, he would have bargained for a plea deal that did not result in certain deportation.  Given our conclusion that Lee can show prejudice based on the reasonable probability that he would have gone to trial, we need not reach this argument.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The dissent makes much of the fact that Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.\u00a0S. 52 (1985), also noted that courts should ignore the \"idiosyncrasies of the particular decisionmaker.\"  Post, at 7 (quoting Hill, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 60; internal quotation marks omitted).  But Hill made this statement in discussing how courts should analyze \"predictions of the outcome at a possible trial.\"  Id., at 59-60.  As we have explained, assessing the effect of some types of attorney errors on defendants' decisionmaking involves such predictions: Where an attorney error allegedly affects how a trial would have played out, we analyze that error's effects on a defendant's decisionmaking by making a prediction of the likely trial outcome.  But, as Hill recognized, such predictions will not always be \"necessary.\"  Id., at 60.  Such a prediction is neither necessary nor appropriate where, as here, the error is one that is not alleged to be pertinent to a trial outcome, but is instead alleged to have affected a defendant's understanding of the consequences of his guilty plea.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Several courts have noted that a judge's warnings at a plea colloquy may undermine a claim that the defendant was prejudiced by his attorney's misadvice.  See, e.g., United States v. Newman, 805 F.\u00a03d 1143, 1147 (CADC 2015); United States v. Kayode, 777 F.\u00a03d 719, 728-729 (CA5 2014); United States v. Akinsade, 686 F.\u00a03d 248, 253 (CA4 2012); Boyd v. Yukins, 99 Fed. Appx. 699, 705 (CA6 2004).  The present case involves a claim of ineffectiveness of counsel extending to advice specifically undermining the judge's warnings themselves, which the defendant contemporaneously stated on the record he did not understand.  There has been no suggestion here that the sentencing judge's statements at the plea colloquy cured any prejudice from the erroneous advice of Lee's counsel.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0It is not enough for a defendant to show that he would have obtained a better plea agreement.  \"[A] defendant has no right to be offered a plea,\" Missouri v.

VERNON MADISON(2017)\nNo. 17-193\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More than 30 years ago, Vernon Madison crept up behind police officer Julius Schulte and shot him twice in the head at close range.  An Alabama jury found Madison guilty of capital murder.  The trial court sentenced him to death.  See Ex\u00a0parte Madison, 718 So.\u00a02d 104, 105-106 (1998).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2016, as Madison's execution neared, he petitioned the trial court for a suspension of his death sentence.  He argued that, due to several recent strokes, he has become incompetent to be executed.  The court held a hearing to receive testimony from two psychologists who had examined Madison and prepared reports concerning his competence.  The court's appointed psychologist, Dr. Karl Kirkland, reported that, although Madison may have \"suffered a significant decline post-stroke, .\u00a0.\u00a0. [he] understands the exact posture of his case at this point,\" and appears to have a \"rational understanding of .\u00a0.\u00a0. the results or effects\" of his death sentence.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a (internal quotation marks omitted); Madison v. Commissioner, Ala. Dept. of Corrections, 851 F.\u00a03d 1173, 1193 (CA11 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Asked at the hearing whether Madison understands that Alabama is seeking retribution against him for his criminal act, Dr. Kirkland answered, \"Certainly.\"  Id., at 1180 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Dr. John Goff, a psychologist hired by Madison's counsel, reported that Madison's strokes have rendered him unable to remember \"numerous events that have occurred over the past thirty years or more.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 77a.  Nevertheless, Dr. Goff found that Madison \"is able to understand the nature of the pending proceeding and he has an understanding of what he was tried for\"; that he knows he is \"in prison .\u00a0.\u00a0. because of 'murder'\u00a0\"; that he \"understands that .\u00a0.\u00a0. [Alabama is] seeking retribution\" for that crime; and that he \"understands the sentence, specifically the meaning of a death sentence.\"  Id., at 76a-78a (some internal quotation marks omitted).  In Dr. Goff's opinion, however, Madison does not \"understan[d] the act that .\u00a0.\u00a0. he is being punished for\" because he cannot recall \"the sequence of events from the offense to his arrest to the trial or any of those details\" and believes that he \"never went around killing folks.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court denied Madison's petition.  It held that, under this Court's decisions in Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.\u00a0S. 399 (1986), and Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.\u00a0S. 930 (2007), Madison was entitled to relief if he could show that he \"suffers from a mental illness which deprives [him] of the mental capacity to rationally understand that he is being executed as a punishment for a crime.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a.  The court concluded that Madison had failed to make that showing.  Specifically, it found that Madison understands \"that he is going to be executed because of the murder he committed[,] .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the State is seeking retribution[,] and that he will die when he is executed.\"  Id., at 82a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Madison then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in Federal District Court.  As a state prisoner, Madison is entitled to federal habeas relief under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) only if the state trial court's adjudication of his incompetence claim \"was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\" this Court, or else was \"based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\" in state court.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a02254(d).  A habeas petitioner meets this demanding standard only when he shows that the state court's decision was \"so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\"  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 103 (2011).  The District Court denied Madison's petition after concluding that the state court \"correctly applied Ford and Panetti\" and did not make an \"unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 67a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit granted a certificate of appealability and, on appeal, reversed over Judge Jordan's dissent.  In the majority's view, given the undisputed fact that Madison \"has no memory of his capital offense,\" it inescapably follows that he \"does not rationally understand the connection between his crime and his execution.\"  851 F.\u00a03d, at 1185-1186.  On that basis, the Eleventh Circuit held that the trial court's conclusion that Madison is competent to be executed was \"plainly unreasonable\" and \"cannot be reconciled with any reasonable application of Panetti.\"  Id., at 1187-1188 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We disagree.  In Panetti, this Court addressed the question whether the Eighth Amendment forbids the execution of a prisoner who lacks \"the mental capacity to understand that [he] is being executed as a punishment for a crime.\"  551 U.\u00a0S., at 954 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We noted that the retributive purpose of capital punishment is not well served where \"the prisoner's mental state is so distorted by a mental illness that his awareness of the crime and punishment has little or no relation to the understanding of those concepts shared by the community as a whole.\"  Id., at 958-959.  Similarly, in Ford, we questioned the \"retributive value of executing a person who has no comprehension of why he has been singled out.\"  477 U.\u00a0S., at 409.  Neither Panetti nor Ford \"clearly established\" that a prisoner is incompetent to be executed because of a failure to remember his commission of the crime, as distinct from a failure to rationally comprehend the concepts of crime and punishment as applied in his case.  The state court did not unreasonably apply Panetti and Ford when it determined that Madison is competent to be executed because--notwithstanding his memory loss--he recognizes that he will be put to death as punishment for the murder he was found to have committed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor was the state court's decision founded on an unreasonable assessment of the evidence before it.  Testimony from each of the psychologists who examined Madison supported the court's finding that Madison understands both that he was tried and imprisoned for murder and that Alabama will put him to death as punishment for that crime.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the state court's determinations of law and fact were not \"so lacking in justification\" as to give rise to error \"beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\"  Richter, supra, at 103.  Under that deferential standard, Madison's claim to federal habeas relief must fail.  We express no view on the merits of the underlying question outside of the AEDPA context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring\n\u2002583 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nJEFFERSON DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS  v.

I write separately to underline the fact that this case illustrates one of the basic problems with the administration of the death penalty itself.  That problem concerns the unconscionably long periods of time that prisoners often spend on death row awaiting execution.  See Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2, 17-33).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I have previously noted, this Court once said that delays in execution can produce uncertainty amounting to \"\u00a0'one of the most horrible feelings to which'\u00a0\" a prisoner \"\u00a0'can be subjected.'\u00a0\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 20) (quoting In re Medley, 134 U.\u00a0S. 160, 172 (1890)).  Justice Stevens later observed that the delay in Medley was a delay of four weeks.  Lackey v. Texas, 514 U.\u00a0S. 1045, 1046 (1995) (memorandum respecting denial of certiorari). And he wrote that the Medley description \"should apply with even greater force in the case of delays that last for many years.\"  514 U.\u00a0S., at 1046.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of those statements, consider the present case.  The respondent, Vernon Madison, was convicted of a murder that took place in April 1985.  He was sentenced to death and transferred to Alabama's William C. Holman Correctional Facility in September 1985.  Mr. Madison is now 67 years old.  He has lived nearly half of his life on death row.  During that time, he has suffered severe strokes, which caused vascular dementia and numerous other significant physical and mental problems.  He is legally blind.  His speech is slurred.  He cannot walk independently.  He is incontinent.  His disability leaves him without a memory of his commission of a capital offense.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Mr. Madison is one among a growing number of aging prisoners who remain on death row in this country for ever longer periods of time.  In 1987, the average period of imprisonment between death sentence and execution was just over seven years.  See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, T. Snell, Capital Punishment, 2013--Statistical Tables 14 (rev. Dec. 19, 2014) (Table 10).  A decade later, in 1997, the average delay was about 11 years.  Ibid.  In 2007, the average delay rose to a little less than 13 years.  Ibid.  In 2017, the 21 individuals who have been executed were on death row on average for more than 19 years.  See Death Penalty Information Center, Execution List 2017, online at https:\/\/deathpenaltyinfo.org\/ execution-list-2017 (as last visited Nov. 3, 2017).  Alabama has executed three individuals this year, including Thomas Arthur, who spent 34 years on death row before his execution on May 26, 2017, at the age of 75; Robert Melson, who spent 21 years on death row before his execution on June 8, 2017; and Torrey McNabb, who spent nearly two decades on death row before his execution on October 19, 2017.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given this trend, we may face ever more instances of state efforts to execute prisoners suffering the diseases and infirmities of old age.  And we may well have to consider the ways in which lengthy periods of imprisonment between death sentence and execution can deepen the cruelty of the death penalty while at the same time undermining its penological rationale.

JESUS MESA, JR., ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-118\nArgued: Decided: June 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case involves a tragic cross-border incident in which a United States Border Patrol agent standing on United States soil shot and killed a Mexican national standing on Mexican soil.  The three questions presented concern whether the parents of the victim of that shooting may assert claims for damages against the agent under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971); whether the shooting violated the victim's Fourth Amendment rights; and whether the agent is entitled to qualified immunity on a claim that the shooting violated the victim's Fifth Amendment rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because this case was resolved on a motion to dismiss, the Court accepts the allegations in the complaint as true for purposes of this opinion.  See Wood v. Moss, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12).  On June 7, 2010, Sergio Adri\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00fcereca, a 15-year-old Mexican national, was with a group of friends in the cement culvert that separates El Paso, Texas, from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.  Now all but dry, the culvert once contained the waters of the Rio Grande River.  The international boundary runs down the middle of the culvert, and at the top of the embankment on the United States side is a fence.  According to the complaint, Hern\u00e1ndez and his friends were playing a game in which they ran up the embankment on the United States side, touched the fence, and then ran back down.  At some point, Border Patrol Agent Jesus Mesa, Jr., arrived on the scene by bicycle and detained one of Hern\u00e1ndez's friends in United States territory as the friend ran down the embankment.  Hern\u00e1ndez ran across the international boundary into Mexican territory and stood by a pillar that supports a railroad bridge spanning the culvert.  While in United States territory, Mesa then fired at least two shots across the border at Hern\u00e1ndez.  One shot struck Hern\u00e1ndez in the face and killed him.  According to the complaint, Hern\u00e1ndez was unarmed and unthreatening at the time.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department of Justice investigated the incident.  The Department concluded that the shooting \"occurred while smugglers attempting an illegal border crossing hurled rocks from close range at a [Customs and Border Patrol] agent who was attempting to detain a suspect.\"  Dept. of Justice, Office of Public Affairs, Federal Officials Close Investigation Into the Death of Sergio Hernandez-Guereca (Apr. 27, 2012), online at http:\/\/www.justice. gov\u00a0\/opa\u00a0\/pr\u00a0\/federal-officials-close-investigation-death-sergiohernandez-guereca (as last visited June 23, 2017).  \"[O]n these particular facts,\" the Department determined, \"the agent did not act inconsistently with [Customs and Border Patrol] policy or training regarding use of force.\"  Ibid.  The Department also declined to bring federal civil rights charges against Mesa.  In the Department's view, there was insufficient evidence that Mesa \"acted willfully and with the deliberate and specific intent to do something the law forbids,\" and, in any event, Hern\u00e1ndez \"was neither within the borders of the United States nor present on U.\u00a0S. property, as required for jurisdiction to exist under the applicable federal civil rights statute.\"  Ibid.  The Department expressed regret for the loss of life in the incident and pledged \"to work with the Mexican government within existing mechanisms and agreements to prevent future incidents.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners--Hern\u00e1ndez's parents--brought suit.  Among other claims, petitioners brought claims against Mesa for damages under Bivens, alleging that Mesa violated Hern\u00e1ndez's rights under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments.  The United States District Court for the Western District of Texas granted Mesa's motion to dismiss.  A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The panel held that Hern\u00e1ndez lacked any Fourth Amendment rights under the circumstances, but that the shooting violated his Fifth Amendment rights.  Hernandez v. United States, 757 F.\u00a03d 249, 267, 272 (2014); id., at 280-281 (Dennis, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); id., at 281 (DeMoss, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The panel also found \"no reason to hesitate in extending Bivens to this new context.\"  Id., at 275.  And the panel held that Mesa was not entitled to qualified immunity, concluding that \"[n]o reasonable officer would have understood Agent Mesa's alleged conduct to be lawful.\"  Id., at 279.  Judge DeMoss dissented in part, arguing that Hern\u00e1ndez lacked any Fifth Amendment rights under the circumstances.  Id., at 281-282.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the District Court's dismissal of petitioners' claims against Mesa.  The en banc Court of Appeals first held that petitioners had failed to state a claim for a violation of the Fourth Amendment because Hern\u00e1ndez was \"a Mexican citizen who had no 'significant voluntary connection' to the United States\" and \"was on Mexican soil at the time he was shot.\"  Hernandez v. United States, 785 F.\u00a03d 117, 119 (CA5 2015) (per curiam) (quoting United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.\u00a0S. 259, 271 (1990)).  As to petitioners' claim under the Fifth Amendment, the en banc Court of Appeals was \"somewhat divided on the question of whether Agent Mesa's conduct violated the Fifth Amendment,\" but was \"unanimous\" in concluding that Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity.  785 F.\u00a03d, at 120.  The en banc Court of Appeals explained that \"[n]o case law in 2010, when this episode occurred, reasonably warned Agent Mesa\" that \"the general prohibition of excessive force applies where the person injured by a U.\u00a0S. official standing on U.\u00a0S. soil is an alien who had no significant voluntary connection to, and was not in, the United States when the incident occurred.\"  Ibid.  Because the en banc Court of Appeals resolved petitioners' claims on other grounds, it \"did not consider whether, even if a constitutional claim had been stated, a tort remedy should be crafted under Bivens.\"  Id., at 121, n.\u00a01 (Jones, J., concurring).  Ten judges filed or joined five separate concurring opinions.  Id., at 121-143.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court granted certiorari.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  The Court now vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remands for further proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court turns first to the Bivens question, which is \"antecedent\" to the other questions presented.  Wood, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  In Bivens, this Court \"recognized for the first time an implied right of action for damages against federal officers alleged to have violated a citizen's constitutional rights.\"  Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S. 61, 66 (2001).  A Bivens remedy is not available, however, where there are \"\u00a0'special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.'\u00a0\"  Carlson v. Green, 446 U.\u00a0S. 14, 18 (1980) (quoting Bivens, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 396).  In the decision recently announced in Ziglar v. Abbasi, ante, p. ___, this Court has clarified what constitutes a \"special facto[r] counselling hesitation.\"  See ante, at 12-14, 17-23.  \"[T]he inquiry,\" the Court explains, \"must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.\"  Ante, at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals here, of course, has not had the opportunity to consider how the reasoning and analysis in Abbasi may bear on this case.  And the parties have not had the opportunity to brief and argue its significance.  In these circumstances, it is appropriate for the Court of Appeals, rather than this Court, to address the Bivens question in the first instance.  This Court, after all, is one \"\u00a0'of review, not of first view.'\u00a0\"  Expressions Hair Design v. Schneiderman, 581 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 10) (quoting Nautilus, Inc. v. Biosig Instruments, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 14)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to petitioners' Fourth Amendment claim, the en banc Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address the Bivens question because it concluded that Hern\u00e1ndez lacked any Fourth Amendment rights under the circumstances.  This approach--disposing of a Bivens claim by resolving the constitutional question, while assuming the existence of a Bivens remedy--is appropriate in many cases.  This Court has taken that approach on occasion.  See, e.g., Wood, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11).  The Fourth Amendment question in this case, however, is sensitive and may have consequences that are far reaching.  It would be imprudent for this Court to resolve that issue when, in light of the intervening guidance provided in Abbasi, doing so may be unnecessary to resolve this particular case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to petitioners' Fifth Amendment claim, the en banc Court of Appeals found it unnecessary to address the Bivens question because it held that Mesa was entitled to qualified immunity.  In reaching that conclusion, the en banc Court of Appeals relied on the fact that Hern\u00e1ndez was \"an alien who had no significant voluntary connection to .\u00a0.\u00a0. the United States.\"  785 F.\u00a03d, at 120.  It is undisputed, however, that Hern\u00e1ndez's nationality and the extent of his ties to the United States were unknown to Mesa at the time of the shooting.  The en banc Court of Appeals therefore erred in granting qualified immunity based on those facts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The doctrine of qualified immunity shields officials from civil liability so long as their conduct 'does not violate clearly established .\u00a0.\u00a0. constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\u00a0\"  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4-5) (quoting Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.\u00a0S. 223, 231 (2009)).  The \"dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\"  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.\u00a0S. 194, 202 (2001).  The qualified immunity analysis thus is limited to \"the facts that were knowable to the defendant officers\" at the time they engaged in the conduct in question.  White v. Pauly, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3).  Facts an officer learns after the incident ends--whether those facts would support granting immunity or denying it--are not relevant.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mesa and the Government contend that Mesa is entitled to qualified immunity even if Mesa was uncertain about Hern\u00e1ndez's nationality and his ties to the United States at the time of the shooting.  The Government also argues that, in any event, petitioners' claim is cognizable only under the Fourth Amendment, and not under the Fifth Amendment.  This Court declines to address these arguments in the first instance.  The Court of Appeals may address them, if necessary, on remand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The facts alleged in the complaint depict a disturbing incident resulting in a heartbreaking loss of life.  Whether petitioners may recover damages for that loss in this suit depends on questions that are best answered by the Court of Appeals in the first instance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-118\nJESUS C.

Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971).\"  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  I would answer that question, rather than remand for the Court of Appeals to do so.  I continue to adhere to the view that \"Bivens and its progeny\" should be limited \"to the precise circumstances that they involved.\"  Ziglar v. Abbasi, ante, at 2 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This case arises in circumstances that are meaningfully different from those at issue in Bivens and its progeny.  Most notably, this case involves cross-border conduct, and those cases did not.  I would decline to extend Bivens and would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals on that basis.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-118\nJESUS C. HERNANDEZ, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.  JESUS MESA, Jr., et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit\n[June 26, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parents of Sergio Adri\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez G\u00fcereca brought this constitutional tort action against a United States Border Patrol agent, Jesus Mesa, Jr.  They claim that Mesa violated their son's constitutional rights when Mesa shot and killed him on June 7, 2010.  Hern\u00e1ndez and some of his friends had been running back and forth across a Rio Grande River culvert that straddles the border between the United States and Mexico.  When Mesa shot him, Hern\u00e1ndez had returned to, and was on, the Mexican side of the culvert.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals, affirming the District Court, held (among other things) that Hern\u00e1ndez had no Fourth Amendment rights because he was not a citizen of the United States, he was \"on Mexican soil at the time he was shot,\" and he \"had no 'significant voluntary connection' to the United States.\u00a0\"  Hernandez v. United States, 785 F. 3d 117, 119 (2015) (per curiam) (quoting United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.\u00a0S. 259, 271 (1990)).  I would reverse the Court of Appeals' Fourth Amendment holding.  And, in my view, that reversal would ordinarily bring with it the right to bring an action for damages under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971).  See Wood v. Moss, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11) (Bivens actions lie for Fourth Amendment violations); Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.\u00a0S. 1, 11 (1985) (officer's application of lethal force when there is no immediate threat to self or others violates the Fourth Amendment).  See also Ziglar v. Abbasi, ante, p. 1 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recognize that Hern\u00e1ndez was on the Mexican side of the culvert when he was shot.  But, we have written in a case involving the suspension of habeas corpus that \"de jure sovereignty\" is not and never has been \"the only relevant consideration in determining the geographic reach of the Constitution.\"  Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.\u00a0S. 723, 764 (2008).  We have added that our precedents make clear that \"questions of extraterritoriality turn on objective factors and practical concerns, not formalism.\"  Ibid.; see also id., at 759-762.  Those factors and concerns here convince me that Hern\u00e1ndez was protected by the Fourth Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the defendant is a federal officer.  He knowingly shot from United States territory into the culvert.  He did not know at the time whether he was shooting at a citizen of the United States or Mexico, nor has he asserted that he knew on which side of the boundary line the bullet would land.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the culvert itself has special border-related physical features.  It does not itself contain any physical features of a border.  Rather, fences and border crossing posts are not in the culvert itself but lie on either side.  Those of Mexico are on the southern side of the culvert; those of the United States are on the northern side.  The culvert (where the shooting took place) lies between the two fences, and consists of a concrete-lined empty space that is typically 270 feet wide.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, history makes clear that nontechnically speaking, the culvert is the border; and more technically speaking, it is at the least a special border-related area (sometimes known as a \"limitrophe\" area, see infra, at 4).  Originally, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the boundary should run \"up the middle\" of the Rio Grande River \"following the deepest channel.\"  See Art.\u00a0V, July 4, 1848, 9 Stat. 926.  It also provided that \"navigation .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be free .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the vessels and citizens of both countries.\"  Art.\u00a0VII, id., at 928.  Subsequently the river jumped its banks, setting a new course, and provoking serious disputes about the border's location.  See S. Liss, A Century of Disagreement: The Chamizal Conflict 1864-1964, p. 15 (1965) (the river's \"ravages .\u00a0.\u00a0. irreparably destroyed any semblance of a discernable United States boundary line in the Ciudad Juarez-El Paso area\").  In the 1960's, however, the United States and Mexico negotiated a new boundary.  The two nations working together would \"relocat[e]\" the river channel.  Convention for the Solution of the Problem of the Chamizal, Art. 2, Aug. 29, 1963, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T. 23, T.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 5515 (Chamizal Convention).  They would jointly bear the costs of doing so; and they would charge a bilateral commission with \"relocation of the river channel .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the maintenance, preservation and improvement of the new channel.\"  Art. 9, id., at 26.  When final construction of the new channel concluded, President Johnson visited the site to celebrate the \"channels between men, bridges between cultures\" created  by the countries' joint effort.  Kramer, A Border Crosses,  The New Yorker, Sept. 20, 2014, online at http:\/\/www. newyorker.com\u00a0\/\u00a0news\u00a0\/\u00a0news\u00a0-\u00a0desk\u00a0\/\u00a0moving-mexican\u00a0-\u00a0border (all internet materials as last visited June 23, 2017); see also Appendix, fig. 2, infra (photograph of President and Mrs. Johnson touring the culvert).  That \"channel\" is the culvert now before us.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, a jointly organized international boundary commission built, and now administers, the culvert.  Once created, the Commission arranged for surveys, acquired rights of way, and built and paved the massive culvert structure.  See Appendix, fig. 1, infra (typical cross-section of the proposed concrete \"culvert\"); see also International Boundary and Water Commission, United States and Mexico, Preliminary Plan (July 25, 1963), Annex to Chamizal Convention, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T., following p. 36.  The United States contributed approximately $45 million of the total cost.  See Compliance With Convention on the Chamizal, S. Rep. No. 868, 88th Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1963); Act To Facilitate Compliance With the Convention Between United States and United Mexican States, \u00a78, 78 Stat. 186.  The United States and Mexico have jointly agreed to maintain the Rio Grande and jointly to maintain the \"limitrophe\" areas.  Treaty To Resolve Pending Boundary Differences and Maintain the Rio Grande and Colorado River as the International Boundary, Art. IV, Nov. 23, 1970, 23 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T. 390, T.\u00a0I.\u00a0A.\u00a0S. No. 7313 (Rio Grande and Colorado River Treaty).  Today an International Boundary and Water Commission, with representatives of both nations, exercises its \"jurisdiction\" over \"limitrophe parts of the Rio Grande.\"  Treaty of Feb. 3, 1944, Art. 2, 59 Stat. 1224.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fifth, international law recognizes special duties and obligations that nations may have in respect to \"limitrophe\" areas.  Traditionally, boundaries consisted of rivers, mountain ranges, and other areas that themselves had depth as well as length.  Lord Curzon of Kedleston, Frontiers 12-13 (2d ed. 1908).  It was not until the late 19th century that effective national boundaries came to consist of an engineer's \"imaginary line,\" perhaps thousands of miles long, but having \"no width.\"  Reeves, International Boundaries, 38 Am. J. Int'l L. 533, 544 (1944); see also 1 Oppenheim's International Law 661, n. 1 (R. Jennings & A. Watts eds., 9th ed. 1992).  Modern precision may help avoid conflicts among nations, see, e.g., Rio Grande and Colorado River Treaty, preamble, 23 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T., at 373, but it has also produced boundary areas--of the sort we have described--which are \"\u00a0'subject to a special legal, political and economic regime of internal and international law,'\u00a0\" Andrassy, Les Relations Internationales de Voisinage, in The Hague Academy of Int'l Law, 1951 Recuiel des Cours 131 (quoting Paul de Lapradelle, La Frontiere 14 (1928)).  Those areas are subject to a special obligation of co-operation and good neighborliness, V. Lowe, International Law 151 (2007) (describing the \"regime of voisinage,\" which includes \"jointly administered infrastructure facilities .\u00a0.\u00a0. co-operation between neighboring police forces .\u00a0.\u00a0. bilingual road signs, .\u00a0.\u00a0. shared access to common resources,\" and the like); cf. United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Art. 111(8), Dec. 10, 1982, 1833 U.\u00a0N.\u00a0T.\u00a0S. 396 (requiring compensation for loss arising from the erroneous exercise of a sovereign's right of hot pursuit), as well as express duties of joint administration that adjoining states undertake by treaty. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sixth, not to apply the Fourth Amendment to the culvert would produce serious anomalies.  Cf. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.\u00a0S., at 278 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The Court of Appeals' approach creates a protective difference depending upon whether Hern\u00e1ndez had been hit just before or just after he crossed an imaginary mathematical borderline running through the culvert's middle.  But nothing else would have changed.  The behavior of the United States Border Patrol agent, along with every other relevant feature of this case, would have remained the same.  Given the near irrelevance of that midculvert line (as compared with the rest of the culvert) for most border-related purposes, as well as almost any other purpose, that result would seem anomalous.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the anomalies would multiply.  Numerous bridges span the culvert, linking El Paso and Ciudad Juarez.  See Chamizal Convention, Arts. 8-10, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T., at 25-26.  \"Across this boundary thousands of Americans and Mexicans pass daily, as casually as one living inland crosses a county line.\"  Liss, supra, at 4; Semuels, Crossing the Mexican-American Border, Every Day, The Atlantic, Jan. 25, 2016, online at https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ business\/archive\/2016\u00a0\/\u00a001\u00a0\/crossing-the-mexican-american-border-every-day\/426678\/; Brief for Border Scholars as Amici Curiae 21-22 (Fifty-five percent of households in the sister cities cross the border to comparison shop for everyday goods and Mexican shoppers spend $445 million each year in El Paso businesses).  It does not make much sense to distinguish for Fourth Amendment purposes among these many thousands of individuals on the basis of an invisible line of which none of them is aware.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These six sets of considerations taken together provide more than enough reason for treating the entire culvert as having sufficient involvement with, and connection to, the United States to subject the culvert to Fourth Amendment protections.  I would consequently conclude that the Fourth Amendment applies.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I note that neither court below reached the question whether Bivens applies to this case, likely because Mesa did not move to dismiss on that basis.  I would decide the Fourth Amendment question before us and remand the case for consideration of the Bivens and qualified immunity questions.  See Ziglar v. Abbasi, ante, p. 1; but see ante, p. 1 (Breyer, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, with respect, I dissent.\nAPPENDIX\nFigure 1.

CLARK ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-32\nArgued: February 22, 2017Decided: May 15, 2017\n\n\nRespondents Beverly Wellner and Janis Clark--the wife and daughter, respectively, of Joe Wellner and Olive Clark--each held a power of attorney affording her broad authority to manage her family member's affairs.  When Joe and Olive moved into a nursing home operated by petitioner Kindred Nursing Centers L.\u00a0P., Beverly and Janis used their powers of attorney to complete all necessary paperwork.  As part of that process, each signed an arbitration agreement on her relative's behalf providing that any claims arising from the relative's stay at the facility would be resolved through binding arbitration.  After Joe and Olive died, their estates (represented by Beverly and Janis) filed suits alleging that Kindred's substandard care had caused their deaths.  Kindred moved to dismiss the cases, arguing that the arbitration agreements prohibited bringing the disputes to court.  The trial court denied Kindred's motions, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals agreed that the suits could go forward.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Kentucky Supreme Court consolidated the cases and affirmed.  The court initially found that the language of the Wellner power of attorney did not permit Beverly to enter into an arbitration agreement on Joe's behalf, but that the Clark document gave Janis the capacity to do so on behalf of Olive.  Nonetheless, the court held, both arbitration agreements were invalid because neither power of attorney specifically entitled the representative to enter into an arbitration agreement.  Because the Kentucky Constitution declares the rights of access to the courts and trial by jury to be \"sacred\" and \"inviolate,\" the court determined, an agent could deprive her principal of such rights only if expressly provided in the power of attorney.\nHeld: The Kentucky Supreme Court's clear-statement rule violates the Federal Arbitration Act by singling out arbitration agreements for disfavored treatment.  Pp.\u00a04-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) The FAA, which makes arbitration agreements \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract,\" 9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72, establishes an equal-treatment principle: A court may invalidate an arbitration agreement based on \"generally applicable contract defenses,\" but not on legal rules that \"apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue,\" AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. 333, 339.  The Act thus preempts any state rule that discriminates on its face against arbitration or that covertly accomplishes the same objective by disfavoring contracts that have the defining features of arbitration agreements.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Kentucky Supreme Court's clear-statement rule fails to put arbitration agreements on an equal plane with other contracts.  By requiring an explicit statement before an agent can relinquish her principal's right to go to court and receive a jury trial, the court did exactly what this Court has barred: adopt a legal rule hinging on the primary characteristic of an arbitration agreement.  Pp.\u00a04-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) In support of the decision below, respondents argue that the clear-statement rule affects only contract formation, and that the FAA does not apply to contract formation questions.  But the Act's text says otherwise.  The FAA cares not only about the \"enforce[ment]\" of arbitration agreements, but also about their initial \"valid[ity]\"--that is, about what it takes to enter into them.  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72.  Precedent confirms the point.  In Concepcion, the Court noted the impermissibility of applying a contract defense like duress \"in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.\"  563 U.\u00a0S., at 341.  That discussion would have made no sense if the FAA had nothing to say about contract formation, because duress involves \"unfair dealing at the contract formation stage.\"  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U.\u00a0S. 527, 547.  Finally, respondents' view would make it trivially easy for States to undermine the Act.  Pp.\u00a07-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) Because the Kentucky Supreme Court invalidated the Clark-Kindred arbitration agreement based exclusively on the clear-statement rule, the court must now enforce that agreement.  But because it is unclear whether the court's interpretation of the Wellner document was wholly independent of its rule, the court should determine on remand whether it adheres, in the absence of the rule, to its prior reading of that power of attorney.

In the decision below, the Kentucky Supreme Court declined to give effect to two arbitration agreements executed by individuals holding \"powers of attorney\"--that is, authorizations to act on behalf of others.  According to the court, a general grant of power (even if seemingly comprehensive) does not permit a legal representative to enter into an arbitration agreement for someone else; to form such a contract, the representative must possess specific authority to \"waive his principal's fundamental constitutional rights to access the courts [and] to trial by jury.\"  Extendicare Homes, Inc. v. Whisman, 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 306, 327 (2015).  Because that rule singles out arbitration agreements for disfavored treatment, we hold that it violates the FAA.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Kindred Nursing Centers L.\u00a0P. operates nursing homes and rehabilitation centers.  Respondents Beverly Wellner and Janis Clark are the wife and daughter, respectively, of Joe Wellner and Olive Clark, two now-deceased residents of a Kindred nursing home called the Winchester Centre.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At all times relevant to this case, Beverly and Janis each held a power of attorney, designating her as an  \"attorney-in-fact\" (the one for Joe, the other for Olive) and affording her broad authority to manage her family member's affairs.  In the Wellner power of attorney, Joe gave Beverly the authority, \"in my name, place and stead,\" to (among other things) \"institute legal proceedings\" and make \"contracts of every nature in relation to both real and personal property.\"  App. 10-11.  In the Clark power of attorney, Olive provided Janis with \"full power .\u00a0.\u00a0. to transact, handle, and dispose of all matters affecting me and\/or my estate in any possible way,\" including the power to \"draw, make, and sign in my name any and all .\u00a0.\u00a0. contracts, deeds, or agreements.\"  Id., at 7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Joe and Olive moved into the Winchester Centre in 2008, with Beverly and Janis using their powers of attorney to complete all necessary paperwork.  As part of that process, Beverly and Janis each signed an arbitration agreement with Kindred on behalf of her relative.  The two contracts, worded identically, provided that \"[a]ny and all claims or controversies arising out of or in any way relating to .\u00a0.\u00a0. the Resident's stay at the Facility\" would be resolved through \"binding arbitration\" rather than a lawsuit.  Id., at 14, 21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Joe and Olive died the next year, their estates (represented again by Beverly and Janis) brought separate suits against Kindred in Kentucky state court.  The complaints alleged that Kindred had delivered substandard care to Joe and Olive, causing their deaths.  Kindred moved to dismiss the cases, arguing that the arbitration agreements Beverly and Janis had signed prohibited bringing their disputes to court.  But the trial court denied Kindred's motions, and the Kentucky Court of Appeals agreed that the estates' suits could go forward.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 125a-126a, 137a-138a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Kentucky Supreme Court, after consolidating the cases, affirmed those decisions by a divided vote.  See 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 313.  The court began with the language of the two powers of attorney.  The Wellner document, the court stated, did not permit Beverly to enter into an arbitration agreement on Joe's behalf.  In the court's view, neither the provision authorizing her to bring legal proceedings nor the one enabling her to make property-related contracts reached quite that distance.  See id., at 325-326; supra,  at 2.  By contrast, the court thought, the Clark power of attorney extended that far and beyond.  Under that document, after all, Janis had the capacity to \"dispose of all matters\" affecting Olive.  See supra, at 2.  \"Given this extremely broad, universal delegation of authority,\" the court acknowledged, \"it would be impossible to say that entering into [an] arbitration agreement was not covered.\"  478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 327.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, the court went on, both arbitration agreements--Janis's no less than Beverly's--were invalid.  That was because a power of attorney could not entitle a representative to enter into an arbitration agreement without specifically saying so.  The Kentucky Constitution, the court explained, protects the rights of access to the courts and trial by jury; indeed, the jury guarantee is the sole right the Constitution declares \"sacred\" and \"inviolate.\"  Id., at 328-329.  Accordingly, the court held, an agent could deprive her principal of an \"adjudication by judge or jury\" only if the power of attorney \"expressly so provide[d].\"  Id., at 329.  And that clear-statement rule--so said the court--complied with the FAA's demands.  True enough that the Act precludes \"singl[ing] out arbitration agreements.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  But that was no problem, the court asserted, because its rule would apply not just to those agreements, but also to some other contracts implicating \"fundamental constitutional rights.\"  Id., at 328.  In the future, for example, the court would bar the holder of a \"non-specific\" power of attorney from entering into a contract \"bind[ing] the principal to personal servitude.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Abramson dissented, in an opinion joined by two of her colleagues.  In their view, the Kentucky Supreme Court's new clear-statement rule was \"clearly not .\u00a0.\u00a0. applicable to 'any contract' but [instead] single[d] out arbitration agreements for disfavored treatment.\"  Id., at 344-345.  Accordingly, the dissent concluded, the rule \"r[a]n afoul of the FAA.\"  Id., at 353.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FAA makes arbitration agreements \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\"  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72.  That statutory provision establishes an equal-treatment principle: A court may invalidate an arbitration agreement based on \"generally applicable contract defenses\" like fraud or unconscionability, but not on legal rules  that \"apply only to arbitration or that derive their meaning from the fact that an agreement to arbitrate is at issue.\"  AT&T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\u00a0S. 333, 339 (2011).  The FAA thus preempts any state rule discriminating on its face against arbitration--for example, a \"law prohibit[ing] outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim.\"  Id., at 341.  And not only that: The Act also displaces any rule that covertly accomplishes the same objective by disfavoring contracts that (oh so coincidentally) have the defining features of arbitration agreements.  In Concepcion, for example, we described a hypothetical state law declaring unenforceable any contract that \"disallow[ed] an ultimate disposition [of a dispute] by a jury.\"  Id., at 342.  Such a law might avoid referring to arbitration by name; but still, we explained, it would \"rely on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate as [its] basis\"--and thereby violate the FAA.  Id., at 341 (quoting Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.\u00a0S. 483, 493, n.\u00a09 (1987)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Kentucky Supreme Court's clear-statement rule, in just that way, fails to put arbitration agreements on an equal plane with other contracts.  By the court's own account, that rule (like the one Concepcion posited) serves to safeguard a person's \"right to access the courts and to trial by jury.\"  478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 327; see supra, at 3-4.  In ringing terms, the court affirmed the jury right's unsurpassed standing in the State Constitution: The framers, the court explained, recognized \"that right and that right alone as a divine God-given right\" when they made it \"the only thing\" that must be \"\u00a0'held sacred'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'inviolate.'\u00a0\"  478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 328-329 (quoting Ky. Const. \u00a77).  So it was that the court required an explicit statement before an attorney-in-fact, even if possessing broad delegated powers, could relinquish that right on another's behalf.  See 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 331 (\"We say only that an agent's authority to waive his principal's constitutional right to access the courts and to trial by jury must be clearly expressed by the principal\").  And so it was that the court did exactly what Concepcion barred: adopt a legal rule hinging on the primary characteristic of an arbitration agreement--namely, a waiver of the right to go to court and receive a jury trial.  See 563 U.\u00a0S., at 341-342; see also 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 353 (Abramson, J., dissenting) (noting that the jury-trial right at the core of \"the majority's new rule\" is \"the one right that just happens to be correlative to the right to arbitrate\" (emphasis deleted)).  Such a rule is too tailor-made to arbitration agreements--subjecting them, by virtue of their defining trait, to uncommon barriers--to survive the FAA's edict against singling out those contracts for disfavored treatment.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And the state court's sometime-attempt to cast the rule in broader terms cannot salvage its decision.  The clear-statement requirement, the court suggested, could also apply when an agent endeavored to waive other \"fundamental constitutional rights\" held by a principal.  478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 331; see supra, at 4.  But what other rights, really?  No Kentucky court, so far as we know, has ever before demanded that a power of attorney explicitly confer authority to enter into contracts implicating constitutional guarantees.  Nor did the opinion below indicate that such a grant would be needed for the many routine contracts--executed day in and day out by legal representatives--meeting that description.  For example, the Kentucky Constitution protects the \"inherent and inalienable\" rights to \"acquir[e] and protect[\u00a0] property\" and to \"freely communicat[e] thoughts and opinions.\"  Ky. Const. \u00a71.  But the state court nowhere cautioned that an attorney-in-fact would now need a specific authorization to, say, sell her principal's furniture or commit her principal to a non-disclosure agreement.  (And were we in the business of giving legal advice, we would tell the agent not to worry.)  Rather, the court hypothesized a slim set of both patently objectionable and utterly fanciful contracts that would be subject to its rule: No longer could a representative lacking explicit authorization waive her \"principal's right to worship freely\" or \"consent to an arranged marriage\" or \"bind [her] principal to personal servitude.\"  478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 328; see supra, at 4.  Placing arbitration agreements within that class reveals the kind of \"hostility to arbitration\" that led Congress to enact the FAA.  Concepcion,  563 U.\u00a0S., at 339.  And doing so only makes clear the arbitration-specific character of the rule, much as if it were made applicable to arbitration agreements and black swans.2\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The respondents, Janis and Beverly, primarily advance a different argument--based on the distinction between contract formation and contract enforcement--to support the decision below.  Kentucky's clear-statement rule, they begin, affects only contract formation, because it bars agents without explicit authority from entering into arbitration agreements.  And in their view, the FAA has \"no application\" to \"contract formation issues.\"  Supp. Brief for Respondents 1.  The Act, to be sure, requires a State to enforce all arbitration agreements (save on generally applicable grounds) once they have come into being.  But, the respondents claim, States have free rein to decide--irrespective of the FAA's equal-footing principle--whether such contracts are validly created in the first instance.  See id., at 3 (\"The FAA's statutory framework applies only after a court has determined that a valid arbitration agreement was formed\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both the FAA's text and our case law interpreting it say otherwise.  The Act's key provision, once again, states that an arbitration agreement must ordinarily be treated as \"valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\"  9 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72; see supra, at 4.  By its terms, then, the Act cares not only about the \"enforce[ment]\" of arbitration agreements, but also about their initial \"valid[ity]\"--that is, about what it takes to enter into them.  Or said otherwise: A rule selectively finding arbitration contracts invalid because improperly formed fares no better under the Act than a rule selectively refusing to enforce those agreements once properly made.  Precedent confirms that point.  In Concepcion, we noted the impermissibility of applying a contract defense like duress \"in a fashion that disfavors arbitration.\"  563 U.\u00a0S., at 341.  But the doctrine of duress, as we have elsewhere explained, involves \"unfair dealing at the contract formation stage.\"  Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. v. Public Util. Dist. No. 1 of Snohomish Cty., 554 U.\u00a0S. 527, 547 (2008).  Our discussion of duress would have made no sense if the FAA, as the respondents contend, had nothing to say about contract formation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And still more: Adopting the respondents' view would make it trivially easy for States to undermine the Act--indeed, to wholly defeat it.  As the respondents have acknowledged, their reasoning would allow States to pronounce any attorney-in-fact incapable of signing an arbitration agreement--even if a power of attorney specifically authorized her to do so.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.  (After all, such a rule would speak to only the contract's formation.)  And why stop there?  If the respondents were right, States could just as easily declare everyone incompetent to sign arbitration agreements.  (That rule too would address only formation.)  The FAA would then mean nothing at all--its provisions rendered helpless to prevent even the most blatant discrimination against arbitration.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we did just last Term, we once again \"reach a conclusion that .\u00a0.\u00a0. falls well within the confines of (and goes no further than) present well-established law.\"  DIRECTV, 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  The Kentucky Supreme Court specially impeded the ability of attorneys-in-fact to enter into arbitration agreements.  The court thus flouted the FAA's command to place those agreements on an equal footing with all other contracts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision requires reversing the Kentucky Supreme Court's judgment in favor of the Clark estate.  As noted earlier, the state court held that the Clark power of attorney was sufficiently broad to cover executing an arbitration agreement.  See supra, at 3.  The court invalidated the agreement with Kindred only because the power of attorney did not specifically authorize Janis to enter into it on Olive's behalf.  In other words, the decision below was based exclusively on the clear-statement rule that we have held violates the FAA.  So the court must now enforce the Clark-Kindred arbitration agreement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By contrast, our decision might not require such a result in the Wellner case.  The Kentucky Supreme Court began its opinion by stating that the Wellner power of attorney was insufficiently broad to give Beverly the authority to execute an arbitration agreement for Joe.  See supra, at 3.  If that interpretation of the document is wholly independent of the court's clear-statement rule, then nothing we have said disturbs it.  But if that rule at all influenced the construction of the Wellner power of attorney, then the court must evaluate the document's meaning anew.  The court's opinion leaves us uncertain as to whether such an impermissible taint occurred.  We therefore vacate the judgment below and return the case to the state court for further consideration.  See Marmet Health Care Center, Inc. v. Brown, 565 U.\u00a0S. 530, 534 (2012) (per curiam) (vacating and remanding another arbitration decision because we could not tell \"to what degree [an] alternative holding was influenced by\" the state court's erroneous, arbitration-specific rule).  On remand, the court should determine whether it adheres, in the absence of its clear-statement rule, to its prior reading of the Wellner power of attorney.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, we reverse in part and vacate in part the judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court, and we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-32\nKINDRED NURSING CENTERS LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, dba WINCHESTER CENTRE FOR HEALTH  AND REHABILITATION, nka FOUNTAIN  CIRCLE HEALTH AND REHABILITA- TION, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

See Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513 U.\u00a0S. 265, 285-297 (1995) (Thomas, J., dissenting); see also DIRECTV, Inc. v.

Casarotto, 517 U.\u00a0S. 681, 689 (1996) (same).  In state-court proceedings, therefore, the FAA does not displace a rule that requires express authorization from a principal before an agent may waive the principal's right to a jury trial.  Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Kentucky Supreme Court.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Making matters worse, the Kentucky Supreme Court's clear-statement rule appears not to apply to other kinds of agreements relinquishing the right to go to court or obtain a jury trial.  Nothing in the decision below (or elsewhere in Kentucky law) suggests that explicit authorization is needed before an attorney-in-fact can sign a settlement agreement or consent to a bench trial on her principal's behalf.  See 478 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 325 (discussing the Wellner power of attorney's provision for \"managing a claim in litigation\" without insisting that such commitments would require a clearer grant).  Mark that as yet another indication that the court's demand for specificity in powers of attorney arises from the suspect status of arbitration rather than the sacred status of jury trials.\nFootnote 2\u00a0We do not suggest that a state court is precluded from announcing a new, generally applicable rule of law in an arbitration case.  We simply reiterate here what we have said many times before--that the rule must in fact apply generally, rather than single out arbitration.\n\n\n","39":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nKOKESH v. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION(2017)\nNo. 16-529\nArgued: April 18, 2017Decided: June 5, 2017\n\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) possesses authority to investigate violations of federal securities laws and to commence enforcement actions in federal district court if its investigations uncover evidence of wrongdoing.  Initially, the Commission's statutory authority in enforcement actions was limited to seeking an injunction barring future violations.  Beginning in the 1970's, federal district courts, at the request of the Commission, began ordering disgorgement in SEC enforcement proceedings.  Although Congress has since authorized the Commission to seek monetary civil penalties, the Commission has continued to seek disgorgement.  This Court has held that 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72462, which establishes a 5-year limitations period for \"an action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture,\" applies when the Commission seeks monetary civil penalties.  See Gabelli v. SEC, 568 U.\u00a0S. 442, 454.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2009, the Commission brought an enforcement action, alleging that petitioner Charles Kokesh violated various securities laws by concealing the misappropriation of $34.9 million from four business-development companies from 1995 to 2009.  The Commission sought monetary civil penalties, disgorgement, and an injunction barring Kokesh from future violations.  After a jury found that Kokesh's actions violated several securities laws, the District Court determined that \u00a72462's 5-year limitations period applied to the monetary civil penalties.  With respect to the $34.9 million disgorgement judgment, however, the court concluded that \u00a72462 did not apply because disgorgement is not a \"penalty\" within the meaning of the statute.  The Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that disgorgement was neither a penalty nor a forfeiture.\nHeld:\u00a0Because SEC disgorgement operates as a penalty under \u00a72462, any claim for disgorgement in an SEC enforcement action must be commenced within five years of the date the claim accrued.  Pp.\u00a05-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The definition of \"penalty\" as a \"punishment, whether corporal or pecuniary, imposed and enforced by the State, for a crime or offen[s]e against its laws,\" Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.\u00a0S. 657, 667, gives rise to two principles.  First, whether a sanction represents a penalty turns in part on \"whether the wrong sought to be redressed is a wrong to the public, or a wrong to the individual.\"  Id., at 668.  Second, a pecuniary sanction operates as a penalty if it is sought \"for the purpose of punishment, and to deter others from offending in like manner\" rather than to compensate victims.  Ibid.  This Court has applied these principles in construing the term \"penalty,\" holding, e.g., that a statute providing a compensatory remedy for a private wrong did not impose a \"penalty,\" Brady v. Daly, 175 U.\u00a0S. 148, 154.  Pp.\u00a05-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The application of these principles here readily demonstrates that SEC disgorgement constitutes a penalty within the meaning of \u00a72462.  First, SEC disgorgement is imposed by the courts as a consequence for violating public laws, i.e., a violation committed against the United States rather than an aggrieved individual.  Second, SEC disgorgement is imposed for punitive purposes.  Sanctions imposed for the purpose of deterring infractions of public laws are inherently punitive because \"deterrence [is] not [a] legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectiv[e].\"  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.\u00a0S. 520, 539, n.\u00a020.  Finally, SEC disgorgement is often not compensatory.  Disgorged profits are paid to the district courts, which have discretion to determine how the money will be distributed.  They may distribute the funds to victims, but no statute commands them to do so.  When an individual is made to pay a noncompensatory sanction to the government as a consequence of a legal violation, the payment operates as a penalty.  See Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.\u00a0S. 395, 402.  Pp.\u00a07-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The Government responds that SEC disgorgement is not punitive but a remedial sanction that operates to restore the status quo.  It is not clear, however, that disgorgement simply returns the defendant to the place he would have occupied had he not broken the law.  It sometimes exceeds the profits gained as a result of the violation.  And, as demonstrated here, SEC disgorgement may be ordered without consideration of a defendant's expenses that reduced the amount of illegal profit.  In such cases, disgorgement does not simply restore the status quo; it leaves the defendant worse off and is therefore punitive.  Although disgorgement may serve compensatory goals in some cases, \"sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose.\"  Austin v. United States, 509 U.\u00a0S. 602, 610.  Because they \"go beyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label defendants wrongdoers\" as a consequence of violating public laws, Gabelli, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 451-452, disgorgement orders represent a penalty and fall within \u00a72462's 5-year limitations period.  Pp.\u00a09-11.\n834 F.\u00a03d 1158, reversed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sotomayor, J., delivered the opinion for a unanimous Court.\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNOTICE:\u2002This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports.\u2003Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.\u00a0C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.\nNo. 16-529\nCHARLES R. KOKESH, PETITIONER v. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit\n[June 5, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A 5-year statute of limitations applies to any \"action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72462.  This case presents the question whether \u00a72462 applies to claims for disgorgement imposed as a sanction for violating a federal securities law.  The Court holds that it does.  Disgorgement in the securities-enforcement context is a \"penalty\" within the meaning of \u00a72462, and so disgorgement actions must be commenced within five years of the date the claim accrues.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After rampant abuses in the securities industry led to the 1929 stock market crash and the Great Depression, Congress enacted a series of laws to ensure that \"the highest ethical standards prevail in every facet of the securities industry.\"1 SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.\u00a0S. 180, 186-187 (1963) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The second in the series--the Securities Exchange Act of 1934--established the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or Commission) to enforce federal securities laws.  Congress granted the Commission power to prescribe \"\u00a0'rules and regulations .\u00a0.\u00a0. as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.'\u00a0\"  Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores, 421 U.\u00a0S. 723, 728 (1975).  In addition to rulemaking, Congress vested the Commission with \"broad authority to conduct investigations into possible violations of the federal securities laws.\"  SEC v. Jerry T. O'Brien, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 735, 741 (1984).  If an investigation uncovers evidence of wrongdoing, the Commission may initiate enforcement actions in federal district court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initially, the only statutory remedy available to the SEC in an enforcement action was an injunction barring future violations of securities laws.  See 1 T. Hazen, Law of Securities Regulation \u00a71:37 (7th ed., rev. 2016).  In the absence of statutory authorization for monetary remedies, the Commission urged courts to order disgorgement as an exercise of their \"inherent equity power to grant relief ancillary to an injunction.\" SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 312 F. Supp. 77, 91 (SDNY 1970), aff'd in part and rev'd in part, 446 F.\u00a02d 1301 (CA2 1971).  Generally, disgorgement is a form of \"[r]estitution measured by the defendant's wrongful gain.\"  Restatement (Third) of Restitution and Unjust Enrichment \u00a751, Comment a, p. 204 (2010) (Restatement (Third)).  Disgorgement requires that the defendant give up \"those gains .\u00a0.\u00a0. properly attributable to the defendant's interference with the claimant's legally protected rights.\"  Ibid.  Beginning in the 1970's, courts ordered disgorgement in SEC enforcement proceedings in order to \"deprive .\u00a0.\u00a0. defendants of their profits in order to remove any monetary reward for violating\" securities laws and to \"protect the investing public by providing an effective deterrent to future violations.\"  Texas Gulf, 312 F. Supp., at 92.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1990, as part of the Securities Enforcement Remedies and Penny Stock Reform Act, Congress authorized the Commission to seek monetary civil penalties.  104 Stat. 932, codified at 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777t(d).  The Act left the Commission with a full panoply of enforcement tools: It may promulgate rules, investigate violations of those rules and the securities laws generally, and seek monetary penalties and injunctive relief for those violations.  In the  years since the Act, however, the Commission has continued its practice of seeking disgorgement in enforcement proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has already held that the 5-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72462 applies when the Commission seeks statutory monetary penalties.  See Gabelli v. SEC, 568 U.\u00a0S. 442, 454 (2013).  The question here is whether \u00a72462, which applies to any \"action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise,\" also applies when the SEC seeks disgorgement.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Charles Kokesh owned two investment-adviser firms that provided investment advice to business-development companies.  In late 2009, the Commission commenced an enforcement action in Federal District Court alleging that between 1995 and 2009, Kokesh, through his firms, misappropriated $34.9 million from four of those development companies.  The Commission further alleged that, in order to conceal the misappropriation, Kokesh caused the filing of false and misleading SEC reports and proxy statements.  The Commission sought civil monetary penalties, disgorgement, and an injunction barring Kokesh from violating securities laws in the future.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a 5-day trial, a jury found that Kokesh's actions violated the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a-36; the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a780b-5, 80b-6; and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a778m, 78n.  The District Court then turned to the task of imposing penalties sought by the Commission.  As to the civil monetary penalties, the District Court determined that \u00a72462's 5-year limitations period precluded any penalties for misappropriation occurring prior to October 27, 2004--that is, five years prior to the date the Commission filed the complaint.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a.  The court ordered Kokesh to pay a civil penalty of $2,354,593, which represented \"the amount of funds that [Kokesh] himself received during the limitations period.\"  Id., at 31a-32a.  Regarding the Commission's request for a $34.9 million disgorgement judgment--$29.9 million of which resulted from violations outside the limitations period--the court agreed with the Commission that because disgorgement is not a \"penalty\" within the meaning of \u00a72462, no limitations period applied.  The court therefore entered a disgorgement judgment in the amount of $34.9 million and ordered Kokesh to pay an additional $18.1 million in prejudgment interest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  834 F.\u00a03d 1158 (2016).  It agreed with the District Court that disgorgement is not a penalty, and further found that disgorgement is not a forfeiture.  Id., at 1164-1167.  The court thus concluded that the statute of limitations in \u00a72462 does not apply to SEC disgorgement claims.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court granted certiorari, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), to resolve disagreement among the Circuits over whether disgorgement claims in SEC proceedings are subject to the 5-year limitations period of \u00a72462.2\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statutes of limitations \"se[t] a fixed date when exposure to the specified Government enforcement efforts en[d].\"  Gabelli, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 448.  Such limits are \"\u00a0'vital to the welfare of society'\u00a0\" and rest on the principle that \"\u00a0'even wrongdoers are entitled to assume that their sins may be forgotten.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 449.  The statute of limitations at issue here--28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72462--finds its roots in a law enacted nearly two centuries ago.  568 U.\u00a0S., at 445.  In its current form, \u00a72462 establishes a 5-year limitations period for \"an action, suit or proceeding for the enforcement of any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture.\"  This limitations period applies here if SEC disgorgement qualifies as either a fine, penalty, or forfeiture.  We hold that SEC disgorgement constitutes a penalty.3\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A \"penalty\" is a \"punishment, whether corporal or pecuniary, imposed and enforced by the State, for a crime or offen[s]e against its laws.\"  Huntington v. Attrill, 146 U.\u00a0S. 657, 667 (1892).  This definition gives rise to two principles.  First, whether a sanction represents a penalty turns in part on \"whether the wrong sought to be redressed is a wrong to the public, or a wrong to the individual.\"  Id., at 668.  Although statutes creating private causes of action against wrongdoers may appear--or even be labeled--penal, in many cases \"neither the liability imposed nor the remedy given is strictly penal.\"  Id., at 667.  This is because \"[p]enal laws, strictly and properly, are those imposing punishment for an offense committed against the State.\"  Ibid.  Second, a pecuniary sanction operates as a penalty only if it is sought \"for the purpose of punishment, and to deter others from offending in like manner\"--as opposed to compensating a victim for his loss.  Id., at 668.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has applied these principles in construing the term \"penalty.\"  In Brady v. Daly, 175 U.\u00a0S. 148 (1899), for example, a playwright sued a defendant in Federal Circuit Court under a statute providing that copyright infringers \"\u00a0'shall be liable for damages .\u00a0.\u00a0. not less than one hundred dollars for the first [act of infringement], and fifty dollars for every subsequent performance, as to the court shall appear to be just.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 153.  The defendant argued that the Circuit Court lacked jurisdiction on the ground that a separate statute vested district courts with exclusive jurisdiction over actions \"to recover a penalty.\"  Id., at 152.  To determine whether the statutory damages represented a penalty, this Court noted first that the statute provided \"for a recovery of damages for an act which violates the rights of the plaintiff, and gives the right of action solely to him\" rather than the public generally, and second, that \"the whole recovery is given to the proprietor, and the statute does not provide for a recovery by any other person.\"  Id., at 154, 156.  By providing a compensatory remedy for a private wrong, the Court held, the statute did not impose a \"penalty.\"  Id., at 154.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, in construing the statutory ancestor of \u00a72462, the Court utilized the same principles.  In Meeker v. Lehigh Valley R. Co., 236 U.\u00a0S. 412, 421-422 (1915), the Interstate Commerce Commission, a now-defunct federal agency charged with regulating railroads, ordered a railroad company to refund and pay damages to a shipping company for excessive shipping rates.  The railroad company argued that the action was barred by Rev. Stat. \u00a71047, Comp. Stat. 1913, \u00a71712 (now 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72462), which imposed a 5-year limitations period upon any \"\u00a0'suit or prosecution for a penalty or forfeiture, pecuniary or otherwise, accruing under the laws of the United States.'\u00a0\"  236 U.\u00a0S., at 423.  The Court rejected that argument, reasoning that \"the words 'penalty or forfeiture' in [the statute] refer to something imposed in a punitive way for an infraction of a public law.\"  Ibid.  A penalty, the Court held, does \"not include a liability imposed [solely] for the purpose of redressing a private injury.\"  Ibid.  Because the liability imposed was compensatory and paid entirely to a private plaintiff, it was not a \"penalty\" within the meaning of the statute of limitations.  Ibid.; see also Gabelli, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 451-452 (\"[P]enalties\" in the context of \u00a72462 \"go beyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label defendants wrongdoers\").\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Application of the foregoing principles readily demonstrates that SEC disgorgement constitutes a penalty within the meaning of \u00a72462.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, SEC disgorgement is imposed by the courts as a consequence for violating what we described in Meeker as public laws.  The violation for which the remedy is sought is committed against the United States rather than an aggrieved individual--this is why, for example, a securities-enforcement action may proceed even if victims do not support or are not parties to the prosecution.  As the Government concedes, \"[w]hen the SEC seeks disgorgement, it acts in the public interest, to remedy harm to the public at large, rather than standing in the shoes of particular injured parties.\"  Brief for United States 22.  Courts agree. See, e.g., SEC v. Rind, 991 F.\u00a02d 1486, 1491 (CA9 1993) (\"[D]isgorgement actions further the Commission's public policy mission of protecting investors and safeguarding the integrity of the markets\"); SEC v. Teo, 746 F.\u00a03d 90, 102 (CA3 2014) (\"[T]he SEC pursues [disgorgement] 'independent of the claims of individual investors'\u00a0\" in order to \"\u00a0'promot[e] economic and social policies'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, SEC disgorgement is imposed for punitive purposes.  In Texas Gulf--one of the first cases requiring disgorgement in SEC proceedings--the court emphasized the need \"to deprive the defendants of their profits in order to .\u00a0.\u00a0. protect the investing public by providing an effective deterrent to future violations.\"  312 F. Supp., at 92.  In the years since, it has become clear that deterrence is not simply an incidental effect of disgorgement.  Rather, courts have consistently held that \"[t]he primary purpose of disgorgement orders is to deter violations of the securities laws by depriving violators of their ill-gotten gains.\"  SEC v. Fischbach Corp., 133 F.\u00a03d 170, 175 (CA2 1997); see also SEC v. First Jersey Securities, Inc., 101 F.\u00a03d 1450, 1474 (CA2 1996) (\"The primary purpose of disgorgement as a remedy for violation of the securities laws is to deprive violators of their ill-gotten gains, thereby effectuating the deterrence objectives of those laws\"); Rind, 991 F.\u00a02d, at 1491 (\"\u00a0'The deterrent effect of [an SEC] enforcement action would be greatly undermined if securities law violators were not required to disgorge illicit profits'\u00a0\").  Sanctions imposed for the purpose of deterring infractions of public laws are inherently punitive because \"deterrence [is] not [a] legitimate nonpunitive governmental objectiv[e].\"  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.\u00a0S. 520, 539, n. 20 (1979); see also United States v. Bajakajian, 524 U.\u00a0S. 321, 329 (1998) (\"Deterrence .\u00a0.\u00a0. has traditionally been viewed as a goal of punishment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, in many cases, SEC disgorgement is not compensatory.  As courts and the Government have employed the remedy, disgorged profits are paid to the district court, and it is \"within the court's discretion to determine how and to whom the money will be distributed.\"  Fischbach Corp., 133 F.\u00a03d, at 175.  Courts have required disgorgement \"regardless of whether the disgorged funds will be paid to such investors as restitution.\"  Id., at 176; see id., at 175 (\"Although disgorged funds may often go to compensate securities fraud victims for their losses, such compensation is a distinctly secondary goal\").  Some disgorged funds are paid to victims; other funds are dispersed to the United States Treasury.  See, e.g., id., at 171 (affirming distribution of disgorged funds to Treasury where \"no party before the court was entitled to the funds and .\u00a0.\u00a0. the persons who might have equitable claims were too dispersed for feasible identification and payment\"); SEC v. Lund, 570 F.\u00a0Supp. 1397, 1404-1405 (CD Cal. 1983) (ordering disgorgement and directing trustee to disperse funds to victims if \"feasible\" and to disperse any remaining money to the Treasury).  Even though district courts may distribute the funds to the victims, they have not identified any statutory command that they do so.  When an individual is made to pay a noncompensatory sanction to the Government as a consequence of a legal violation, the payment operates as a penalty.  See Porter v. Warner Holding Co., 328 U.\u00a0S. 395, 402 (1946) (distinguishing between restitution paid to an aggrieved party and penalties paid to the Government).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SEC disgorgement thus bears all the hallmarks of a penalty: It is imposed as a consequence of violating a public law and it is intended to deter, not to compensate.  The 5-year statute of limitations in \u00a72462 therefore applies when the SEC seeks disgorgement.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government's primary response to all of this is that SEC disgorgement is not punitive but \"remedial\" in that it \"lessen[s] the effects of a violation\" by \"\u00a0'restor[ing] the status quo.'\u00a0\"  Brief for Respondent 17.  As an initial matter, it is not clear that disgorgement, as courts have applied it in the SEC enforcement context, simply returns the defendant to the place he would have occupied had he not broken the law.  SEC disgorgement sometimes exceeds the profits gained as a result of the violation.  Thus, for example, \"an insider trader may be ordered to disgorge not only the unlawful gains that accrue to the wrongdoer directly, but also the benefit that accrues to third parties whose gains can be attributed to the wrongdoer's conduct.\"  SEC v. Contorinis, 743 F.\u00a03d 296, 302 (CA2 2014).  Individuals who illegally provide confidential trading information have been forced to disgorge profits gained by individuals who received and traded based on that information--even though they never received any profits.  Ibid; see also SEC v. Warde, 151 F.\u00a03d 42, 49 (CA2 1998) (\"A tippee's gains are attributable to the tipper, regardless whether benefit accrues to the tipper\"); SEC v. Clark, 915 F.\u00a02d 439, 454 (CA9 1990) (\"[I]t is well settled that a tipper can be required to disgorge his tippees' profits\").  And, as demonstrated by this case, SEC disgorgement sometimes is ordered without consideration of a defendant's expenses that reduced the amount of illegal profit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a; see Restatement (Third) \u00a751, Comment h, at 216 (\"As a general rule, the defendant is entitled to a deduction for all marginal costs incurred in producing the revenues that are subject to disgorgement.  Denial of an otherwise appropriate deduction, by making the defendant liable in excess of net gains, results in a punitive sanction that the law of restitution normally attempts to avoid\").  In such cases, disgorgement does not simply restore the status quo; it leaves the defendant worse off.  The justification for this practice given by the court below demonstrates that disgorgement in this context is a punitive, rather than a remedial, sanction: Disgorgement, that court explained, is intended not only to \"prevent the wrongdoer's unjust enrichment\" but also \"to deter others' violations of the securities laws.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0True, disgorgement serves compensatory goals in some cases; however, we have emphasized \"the fact that sanctions frequently serve more than one purpose.\"  Austin v. United States, 509 U.\u00a0S. 602, 610 (1993).  \"\u00a0'A civil sanction that cannot fairly be said solely to serve a remedial purpose, but rather can only be explained as also serving either retributive or deterrent purposes, is punishment, as we have come to understand the term.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 621; cf. Bajakajian, 524 U.\u00a0S., at 331, n. 6 (\"[A] modern statutory forfeiture is a 'fine' for Eighth Amendment purposes if it constitutes punishment even in part\").  Because disgorgement orders \"go beyond compensation, are intended to punish, and label defendants wrongdoers\" as a consequence of violating public laws, Gabelli, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 451-452, they represent a penalty and thus fall within the 5-year statute of limitations of \u00a72462.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Disgorgement, as it is applied in SEC enforcement proceedings, operates as a penalty under \u00a72462.  Accordingly, any claim for disgorgement in an SEC enforcement action must be commenced within five years of the date the claim accrued.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Each of these statutes--the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777a et seq.; the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a778a et seq.; the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a779 et seq.; the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a777aaa et seq.; the Investment Company Act of 1940, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a780a-1 et seq.; and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a780b-1 et seq.--serves the \"fundamental purpose\" of \"substitut[ing] a philosophy of full disclosure for the philosophy of caveat emptor and thus .\u00a0.\u00a0. achiev[ing] a high standard of business ethics in the securities industry.\"  SEC v.

CLARKE(2017)\nNo. 15-1500\nArgued: January 9, 2017Decided: April 25, 2017\n\n\nPetitioners Brian and Michelle Lewis were driving on a Connecticut interstate when they were struck from behind by a vehicle driven by respondent William Clarke, a Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority employee, who was transporting Mohegan Sun Casino patrons.  The Lewises sued Clarke in his individual capacity in state court.  Clarke moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction, arguing that because he was an employee of the Gaming Authority--an arm of the Mohegan Tribe entitled to sovereign immunity--and was acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, he was similarly entitled to sovereign immunity against suit.  He also argued, in the alternative, that he should prevail because the Gaming Authority was bound by tribal law to indemnify him.  The trial court denied Clarke's motion, but the Supreme Court of Connecticut reversed, holding that tribal sovereign immunity barred the suit because Clarke was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred.  It did not consider whether Clarke should be entitled to sovereign immunity based on the indemnification statute.\nHeld:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0In a suit brought against a tribal employee in his individual capacity, the employee, not the tribe, is the real party in interest and the tribe's sovereign immunity is not implicated.

Melo, 502 U.\u00a0S. 21, 25.  A defendant in an official-capacity action--where the relief sought is only nominally against the official and in fact is against the official's office and thus the sovereign itself--may assert sovereign immunity.  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.\u00a0S. 159, 167.  But an officer in an individual-capacity action--which seeks \"to impose individual liability upon a government officer for actions taken under color of state law,\" Hafer, 502 U.\u00a0S., at 25--may be able to assert personal immunity defenses but not sovereign immunity, id., at 30-31.  The Court does not reach Clarke's argument that he is entitled to the personal immunity defense of official immunity, which Clarke raised for the first time on appeal.  Pp.\u00a05-7.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Applying these general rules in the context of tribal sovereign immunity, it is apparent that they foreclose Clarke's sovereign immunity defense.  This action arises from a tort committed by Clarke on a Connecticut interstate and is simply a suit against Clarke to recover for his personal actions.  Clarke, not the Gaming Authority, is the real party in interest.  The State Supreme Court extended sovereign immunity for tribal employees beyond what common-law sovereign immunity principles would recognize for either state or federal employees.  Pp.\u00a07-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0An indemnification provision cannot, as a matter of law, extend sovereign immunity to individual employees who would otherwise not fall under its protective cloak.  Pp.\u00a08-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This conclusion follows naturally from the principles discussed above and previously applied to the different question whether a state instrumentality may invoke the State's immunity from suit even when the Federal Government has agreed to indemnify that instrumentality against adverse judgments, Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.\u00a0S. 425.  There, this Court held that the indemnification provision did not divest the state instrumentality of Eleventh Amendment immunity, and its analysis turned on where the potential legal liability lay, not from whence the money to pay the damages award ultimately came.  Here, the Connecticut courts exercise no jurisdiction over the Tribe or Gaming Authority, and their judgments will not bind the Tribe or its instrumentalities in any way.  Moreover, indemnification is not a certainty, because Clarke will not be indemnified should the Gaming Authority determine that he engaged in \"wanton, reckless, or malicious\" activity.  Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a74-52.  Pp.\u00a08-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Courts have extended sovereign immunity to private healthcare insurance companies under certain circumstances, but those cases rest on the proposition that the fiscal intermediaries are essentially state instrumentalities, and Clarke offers no persuasive reason to depart from precedent and treat a lawsuit against an individual employee as one against a state instrumentality.  Similarly, this Court has never held that a civil rights suit under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 against a state officer in his individual capacity implicates the Eleventh Amendment and a State's sovereign immunity from suit.  Finally, this Court's conclusion that indemnification provisions do not alter the real-party-in-interest analysis for sovereign immunity purposes is consistent with the practice that applies in the contexts of diversity of citizenship and joinder.

This Court has considered the scope of that immunity in a number of circumstances.  This case presents an ordinary negligence action brought against a tribal employee in state court under state law.  We granted certiorari to resolve whether an Indian tribe's sovereign immunity bars individual-capacity damages actions against tribal employees for torts committed within the scope of their employment and for which the employees are indemnified by the tribe.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that, in a suit brought against a tribal employee in his individual capacity, the employee, not the tribe, is the real party in interest and the tribe's sovereign immunity is not implicated.  That an employee was acting within the scope of his employment at the time the tort was committed is not, on its own, sufficient to bar a suit against that employee on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity.  We hold further that an indemnification provision does not extend a tribe's sovereign immunity where it otherwise would not reach.  Accordingly, we reverse and remand.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Mohegan Tribe of Indians of Connecticut traces its lineage back centuries.  Originally part of the Lenni Lenape, the Tribe formed the independent Mohegan Tribe under the leadership of Sachem Uncas in the early 1600's.  M. Fawcett, The Lasting of the Mohegans 7, 11-13 (1995).  In 1994, in accordance with the petition procedures established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Tribe attained federal recognition.1  See 59 Fed. Reg. 12140 (1994); Mohegan Const., Preamble and Art. II.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As one means of maintaining its economic self-sufficiency, the Tribe entered into a Gaming Compact with the State of Connecticut pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, 102 Stat. 2467, 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72701 et seq.  The compact authorizes the Tribe to conduct gaming on its land, subject to certain conditions including establishment of the Gaming Disputes Court.  See 59 Fed. Reg. 65130 (approving the Tribal-State Compact Between the Mohegan Indian Tribe and the State of Connecticut (May 17, 1994)); Mohegan Const., Art. XIII, \u00a72; Mohegan Tribe Code 3-248(a) (Supp. 2016).  The Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority, an arm of the Tribe, exercises the powers of the Mohegan Tribe over tribal gaming activities.  Mohegan Const., Art. XIII, \u00a71; Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a72-21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of particular relevance here, Mohegan law sets out sovereign immunity and indemnification policies applicable to disputes arising from gaming activities.  The Gaming Authority has waived its sovereign immunity and consented to be sued in the Mohegan Gaming Disputes Court.  Mohegan Const., Art. XIII, \u00a71; Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a73-250(b).  Neither the Tribe nor the Gaming Authority has consented to suit for claims arising under Connecticut state law.  See Mohegan Const., Art. IX, \u00a72(t); Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a73-250(g); see also Blatchford v. Native Village of Noatak, 501 U.\u00a0S. 775, 782 (1991) (observing that Indian tribes have not surrendered their immunity against suits by States).  Further, Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a74-52 provides that the Gaming Authority \"shall save harmless and indemnify its Officer or Employee from financial loss and expense arising out of any claim, demand, or suit by reason of his or her alleged negligence .\u00a0.\u00a0. if the Officer or Employee is found to have been acting in the discharge of his or her duties or within the scope of his or her employment.\"  The Gaming Authority does not indemnify employees who engage in \"wanton, reckless or malicious\" activity.  Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a74-52.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners Brian and Michelle Lewis were driving down Interstate 95 in Norwalk, Connecticut, when a limousine driven by respondent William Clarke hit their vehicle from behind.  Clarke, a Gaming Authority employee, was transporting patrons of the Mohegan Sun Casino to their homes.  For purposes of this appeal, it is undisputed that Clarke caused the accident.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lewises filed suit against Clarke in his individual capacity in Connecticut state court, and Clarke moved to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction on the basis of tribal sovereign immunity.  See 2014 WL 5354956, *2 (Super. Ct. Conn., Sept. 10, 2014) (Cole-Chu, J.).  Clarke argued that because the Gaming Authority, an arm of the Tribe, was entitled to sovereign immunity, he, an employee of the Gaming Authority acting within the scope of his employment at the time of the accident, was similarly entitled to sovereign immunity against suit.  According to Clarke, denying the motion would abrogate the Tribe's sovereign immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court denied Clarke's motion to dismiss.  Id., at *8.  The court agreed with the Lewises that the sovereign immunity analysis should focus on the remedy sought in their complaint.  To that end, the court identified Clarke, not the Gaming Authority or the Tribe, as the real party in interest because the damages remedy sought was solely against Clarke and would in no way affect the Tribe's ability to govern itself independently.  The court therefore concluded that tribal sovereign immunity was not implicated.  Id., at *2-*8.  It also rejected Clarke's alternative argument that because the Gaming Authority was obligated to indemnify him pursuant to Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a74-52 and would end up paying the damages, he should prevail under the remedy analysis.  Id., at *7.  The trial court reasoned that a \"voluntary undertaking cannot be used to extend sovereign immunity where it did not otherwise exist.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Supreme Court of Connecticut reversed, holding that tribal sovereign immunity did bar the suit.  320 Conn. 706, 135 A.\u00a03d 677 (2016).  The court agreed with Clarke that \"because he was acting within the scope of his employment for the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority and the Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority is an arm of the Mohegan Tribe, tribal sovereign immunity bars the plaintiffs' claims against him.\"  Id., at 709, 135 A.\u00a03d, at 680.  Of particular significance to the court was ensuring that \"plaintiffs cannot circumvent tribal immunity by merely naming the defendant, an employee of the tribe, when the complaint concerns actions taken within the scope of his duties and the complaint does not allege, nor have the plaintiffs offered any other evidence, that he acted outside the scope of his authority.\"  Id., at 720, 135 A.\u00a03d, at 685.  To do otherwise, the court reasoned, would \"\u00a0'eviscerate'\u00a0\" the protections of tribal immunity.  Id., at 717, 135 A.\u00a03d, at 684 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Because the court determined that Clarke was entitled to sovereign immunity on the sole basis that he was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred, id., at 720, 135 A.\u00a03d, at 685-686, it did not consider whether Clarke should be entitled to sovereign immunity on the basis of the indemnification statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to consider whether tribal sovereign immunity bars the Lewises' suit against Clarke, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and we now reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Connecticut.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two issues require our resolution: (1) whether the sovereign immunity of an Indian tribe bars individual-capacity damages against tribal employees for torts committed within the scope of their employment; and (2) what role, if any, a tribe's decision to indemnify its employees plays in this analysis.  We decide this case under the framework of our precedents regarding tribal immunity.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our cases establish that, in the context of lawsuits against state and federal employees or entities, courts should look to whether the sovereign is the real party in interest to determine whether sovereign immunity bars the suit.  See Hafer v. Melo, 502 U.\u00a0S. 21, 25 (1991).  In making this assessment, courts may not simply rely on the characterization of the parties in the complaint, but rather must determine in the first instance whether the remedy sought is truly against the sovereign.  See, e.g., Ex parte New York, 256 U.\u00a0S. 490, 500-502 (1921).  If, for example, an action is in essence against a State even if the State is not a named party, then the State is the real party in interest and is entitled to invoke the Eleventh Amendment's protection.  For this reason, an arm or instrumentality of the State generally enjoys the same immunity as the sovereign itself.  E.g., Regents of Univ. of Cal. v. Doe, 519 U.\u00a0S. 425, 429-430 (1997).  Similarly, lawsuits brought against employees in their official capacity \"represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent,\" and they may also be barred by sovereign immunity.  Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.\u00a0S. 159, 165-166 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The distinction between individual- and official-capacity suits is paramount here.  In an official-capacity claim, the relief sought is only nominally against the official and in fact is against the official's office and thus the sovereign itself.  Will v. Michigan Dept. of State Police, 491 U.\u00a0S. 58, 71 (1989); Dugan v. Rank, 372 U.\u00a0S. 609, 611, 620-622 (1963).  This is why, when officials sued in their official capacities leave office, their successors automatically assume their role in the litigation.  Hafer, 502 U.\u00a0S., at 25.  The real party in interest is the government entity, not the named official.  See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.\u00a0S. 651, 663-665 (1974).  \"Personal-capacity suits, on the other hand, seek to impose individual liability upon a government officer for actions taken under color of state law.\"  Hafer, 502 U.\u00a0S., at 25 (emphasis added); see also id., at 27-31 (discharged employees entitled to bring personal damages action against state auditor general); cf. Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971).  \"[O]fficers sued in their personal capacity come to court as individuals,\" Hafer, 502 U.\u00a0S., at 27, and the real party in interest is the individual, not the sovereign.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The identity of the real party in interest dictates what immunities may be available.  Defendants in an official-capacity action may assert sovereign immunity.  Graham, 473 U.\u00a0S., at 167.  An officer in an individual-capacity action, on the other hand, may be able to assert personal immunity defenses, such as, for example, absolute prosecutorial immunity in certain circumstances.  Van de Kamp v. Goldstein, 555 U.\u00a0S. 335, 342-344 (2009).  But sovereign immunity \"does not erect a barrier against suits to impose individual and personal liability.\"  Hafer, 502 U.\u00a0S., at 30-31 (internal quotation marks omitted); see Alden v. Maine, 527 U.\u00a0S. 706, 757 (1996).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is no reason to depart from these general rules in the context of tribal sovereign immunity.  It is apparent that these general principles foreclose Clarke's sovereign immunity defense in this case.  This is a negligence action arising from a tort committed by Clarke on an interstate highway within the State of Connecticut.  The suit is brought against a tribal employee operating a vehicle within the scope of his employment but on state lands, and the judgment will not operate against the Tribe.  This is not a suit against Clarke in his official capacity.  It is simply a suit against Clarke to recover for his personal actions, which \"will not require action by the sovereign or disturb the sovereign's property.\"  Larson v. Domestic and Foreign Commerce Corp., 337 U.\u00a0S. 682, 687 (1949).  We are cognizant of the Supreme Court of Connecticut's concern that plaintiffs not circumvent tribal sovereign immunity.  But here, that immunity is simply not in play.  Clarke, not the Gaming Authority, is the real party in interest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In ruling that Clarke was immune from this suit solely because he was acting within the scope of his employment, the court extended sovereign immunity for tribal employees beyond what common-law sovereign immunity principles would recognize for either state or federal employees.  See, e.g., Graham, 473 U.\u00a0S., at 167-168.  The protection offered by tribal sovereign immunity here is no broader than the protection offered by state or federal sovereign immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, under established sovereign immunity principles, the Gaming Authority's immunity does not, in these circumstances, bar suit against Clarke.2\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conclusion above notwithstanding, Clarke argues that the Gaming Authority is the real party in interest here because it is required by Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a74-52 to indemnify Clarke for any adverse judgment.3\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have never before had occasion to decide whether an indemnification clause is sufficient to extend a sovereign immunity defense to a suit against an employee in his individual capacity.  We hold that an indemnification provision cannot, as a matter of law, extend sovereign immunity to individual employees who would otherwise not fall under its protective cloak.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Our holding follows naturally from the principles discussed above.  Indeed, we have applied these same principles to a different question before--whether a state instrumentality may invoke the State's immunity from suit even when the Federal Government has agreed to indemnify that instrumentality against adverse judgments.  In Regents of Univ. of Cal., an individual brought suit against the University of California, a public university of the State of California, for breach of contract related to his employment at a laboratory operated by the university pursuant to a contract with the Federal Government.  We held that the indemnification provision did not divest the state instrumentality of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  519 U.\u00a0S., at 426.  Our analysis turned on where the potential legal liability lay, not from whence the money to pay the damages award ultimately came.  Because the lawsuit bound the university, we held, the Eleventh Amendment applied to the litigation even though the damages award would ultimately be paid by the federal Department of Energy.  Id., at 429-431.  Our reasoning remains the same.  The critical inquiry is who may be legally bound by the court's adverse judgment, not who will ultimately pick up the tab.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, the Connecticut courts exercise no jurisdiction over the Tribe or the Gaming Authority, and their judgments will not bind the Tribe or its instrumentalities in any way.  The Tribe's indemnification provision does not somehow convert the suit against Clarke into a suit against the sovereign; when Clarke is sued in his individual capacity, he is held responsible only for his individual wrongdoing.  Moreover, indemnification is not a certainty here.  Clarke will not be indemnified by the Gaming Authority should it determine that he engaged in \"wanton, reckless, or malicious\" activity.  Mohegan Tribe Code \u00a74-52.  That determination is not necessary to the disposition of the Lewises' suit against Clarke in the Connecticut state courts, which is a separate legal matter.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Clarke notes that courts have extended sovereign immunity to private healthcare insurance companies under certain circumstances.  See, e.g., Pani v. Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, 152 F.\u00a03d 67, 71-72 (CA2 1998); Pine View Gardens, Inc. v. Mutual of Omaha Ins. Co., 485 F.\u00a02d 1073, 1074-1075 (CADC 1973); Brief for Respondent 19, n.\u00a04.  But, these cases rest on the proposition that the fiscal intermediaries are essentially state instrumentalities, as the governing regulations make clear.  See 42 CFR \u00a7421.5(b) (2016) (providing that the Medicare Administrator \"is the real party of interest in any litigation involving the administration of the program\").  It is well established in our precedent that a suit against an arm or instrumentality of the State is treated as one against the State itself.  See Regents of Univ. of Cal., 519 U.\u00a0S., at 429.  We have not before treated a lawsuit against an individual employee as one against a state instrumentality, and Clarke offers no persuasive reason to do so now.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor have we ever held that a civil rights suit under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 against a state officer in his individual capacity implicates the Eleventh Amendment and a State's sovereign immunity from suit.5  Federal appellate courts that have considered the indemnity question have rejected the argument that an indemnity statute brings the Eleventh Amendment into play in \u00a71983 actions.  See, e.g., Stoner v. Wisconsin Dept. of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection, 50 F.\u00a03d 481, 482-483 (CA7 1995); Blalock v. Schwinden, 862 F.\u00a02d 1352, 1354 (CA9 1988); Duckworth v. Franzen, 780 F.\u00a02d 645, 650 (CA7 1985).  These cases rely on the concern that originally drove the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment--the protection of the States against involuntary liability.  See Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U.\u00a0S. 30, 39, 48 (1994).  But States institute indemnification policies voluntarily.  And so, indemnification provisions do not implicate one of the underlying rationales for state sovereign immunity--a government's ability to make its own decisions about \"the allocation of scarce resources.\"  Alden, 527 U.\u00a0S., at 751.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, our conclusion that indemnification provisions do not alter the real-party-in-interest analysis for purposes of sovereign immunity is consistent with the practice that applies in the contexts of diversity of citizenship and joinder.  In assessing diversity jurisdiction, courts look to the real parties to the controversy.  Navarro Savings Assn. v. Lee, 446 U.\u00a0S. 458, 460 (1980).  Applying this principle, courts below have agreed that the fact that a third party indemnifies one of the named parties to the case does not, as a general rule, influence the diversity analysis.  See, e.g., Corfield v. Dallas Glen Hills LP, 355 F.\u00a03d 853, 865 (CA5 2003); E.\u00a0R. Squibb & Sons, Inc. v. Accident & Cas. Ins. Co., 160 F.\u00a03d 925, 936-937 (CA2 1998).  They have similarly held that a party does not become a required party for joinder purposes under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 19 simply by virtue of indemnifying one of the named parties.  See, e.g., Gardiner v. Virgin Islands Water & Power Auth., 145 F.\u00a03d 635, 641 (CA3 1998); Rochester Methodist Hospital v. Travelers Ins. Co., 728 F.\u00a02d 1006, 1016-1017 (CA8 1984).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, although tribal sovereign immunity is implicated when the suit is brought against individual officers in their official capacities, it is simply not present when the claim is made against those employees in their individual capacities.  An indemnification statute such as the one at issue here does not alter the analysis.  Clarke may not avail himself of a sovereign immunity defense.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Supreme Court of Connecticut is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nThomas, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1500\nBRIAN LEWIS, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014) (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 2); see also Kiowa Tribe of Okla. v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.\u00a0S. 751, 764 (1998) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This suit arose from an off-reservation commercial act.  Ante, at 3.  Accordingly, I would hold that respondent cannot assert the Tribe's immunity, regardless of the capacity in which he was sued.  Because the Court reaches the same result for different reasons, I concur in its judgment.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1500\nBRIAN LEWIS, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., 523 U.\u00a0S. 751, 760 (1998) (Stevens, J., dissenting), and Michigan v. Bay Mills Indian Community, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).  See also id., at ___ (Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 1).  These dissenting opinions explain why tribes, interacting with nontribal members outside reservation boundaries, should be subject to nondiscriminatory state laws of general application.  I agree with the Court, however, that a voluntary indemnity undertaking does not convert a suit against a tribal employee, in the employee's individual capacity, into a suit against the tribe.  I therefore concur in the Court's judgment.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0There are currently 567 federally recognized Indian and Alaska Native entities.  81 Fed.

E.g., Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.\u00a0S. 800, 811-815 (1982).  Clarke argues for the first time before this Court that one particular form of personal immunity is available to him here--official immunity.  See Westfall v. Erwin, 484 U.\u00a0S. 292, 295-297 (1988).  That defense is not properly before us now, however, given that Clarke's motion to dismiss was based solely on tribal sovereign immunity.  See Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U.\u00a0S. 443, 455 (2007).\nFootnote 3\u00a0As noted above, the Supreme Court of Connecticut did not reach whether Clarke should be entitled to sovereign immunity on the basis of the indemnification statute.  We nevertheless consider the issue fairly included within the question presented, as it is a purely legal question that is an integral part of Clarke's sovereign immunity argument and that was both raised to and passed on by the trial court.  See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.\u00a0S. 511, 530 (1985) (\"[T]he purely legal question on which [petitioner's] claim of immunity turns is appropriate for our immediate resolution notwithstanding that it was not addressed by the Court of Appeals\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\nFootnote 4\u00a0Our holding in Hess v. Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation, 513 U.\u00a0S. 30 (1994), is not to the contrary.  There the immunity question turned on whether the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation was a state agency cloaked with Eleventh Amendment immunity such that any judgment \"must be paid out of a State's treasury.\"  Id., at 48, 51-52 (emphasis added).  Here, unlike in Hess, the damages judgment would not come from the sovereign.\nFootnote 5\u00a0A suit against a state officer in his official, rather than individual, capacity might implicate the Eleventh Amendment.  See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.\u00a0S. 159, 165-166 (1985).\n\n\n","41":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORP. ET AL. v. PROMEGA CORP.(2017)\nNo. 14-1538\nArgued: December 6, 2016Decided: February 22, 2017\n\n\nRespondent Promega Corporation sublicensed the Tautz patent, which claims a toolkit for genetic testing, to petitioner Life Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries (collectively Life Technologies) for the manufacture and sale of the kits for use in certain licensed law enforcement fields worldwide.  One of the kit's five components, an enzyme known as the Taq polymerase, was manufactured by Life Technologies in the United States and then shipped to the United Kingdom, where the four other components were made, for combination there.  When Life Technologies began selling the kits outside the licensed fields of use, Promega sued, claiming that patent infringement liability was triggered under \u00a7271(f)(1) of the Patent Act, which prohibits the supply from the United States of \"all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention\" for combination abroad.  The jury returned a verdict for Promega, but the District Court granted Life Technologies' motion for judgment as a matter of law, holding that \u00a7271(f)(1)'s phrase \"all or a substantial portion\" did not encompass the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention.  The Federal Circuit reversed.  It determined that a single important component could constitute a \"substantial portion\" of the components of an invention under \u00a7271(f)(1) and found the Taq polymerase to be such a component.\nHeld:\u00a0The supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention for manufacture abroad does not give rise to \u00a7271(f)(1) liability.  Pp.\u00a04-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Section 271(f)(1)'s phrase \"substantial portion\" refers to a quantitative measurement.  Although the Patent Act itself does not define the term \"substantial,\" and the term's ordinary meaning may refer either to qualitative importance or to quantitatively large size, the statutory context points to a quantitative meaning.  Neighboring words \"all\" and \"portion\" convey a quantitative meaning, and nothing in the neighboring text points to a qualitative interpretation.  Moreover, a qualitative reading would render the modifying phrase \"of the components\" unnecessary the first time it is used in \u00a7271(f)(1).  Only the quantitative approach thus gives meaning to each statutory provision.    \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Promega's proffered \"case-specific approach,\" which would require a factfinder to decipher whether the components at issue are a \"substantial portion\" under either a qualitative or a quantitative test, is rejected.  Tasking juries with interpreting the statute's meaning on an ad\u00a0hoc basis would only compound, not resolve, the statute's ambiguity.  And Promega's proposal to adopt an analytical framework that accounts for both the components' quantitative and qualitative aspects is likely to complicate rather than aid the factfinder's review.  Pp.\u00a04-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) Under a quantitative approach, a single component cannot constitute a \"substantial portion\" triggering \u00a7271(f)(1) liability.  This conclusion is reinforced by \u00a7271(f)'s text, context, and structure.  Section 271(f)(1) consistently refers to the plural \"components,\" indicating that multiple components make up the substantial portion.  Reading \u00a7271(f)(1) to cover any single component would also leave little room for \u00a7271(f)(2), which refers to \"any component,\" and would undermine \u00a7271(f)(2)'s express reference to a single component \"especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\"  The better reading allows the two provisions to work in tandem and gives each provision its unique application.  Pp.\u00a08-10.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) The history of \u00a7271(f) further bolsters this conclusion.  Congress enacted \u00a7271(f) in response to Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.\u00a0S. 518, to fill a gap in the enforceability of patent rights by reaching components that are manufactured in the United States but assembled overseas.  Consistent with Congress's intent, a supplier may be liable under \u00a7271(f)(1) for supplying from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of the invention or under \u00a7271(f)(2) for supplying a single component if it is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity.  But, as here, when a product is made abroad and all components but a single commodity article are supplied from abroad, the activity is outside the statute's scope.

Section 271(f)(1) of the Patent Act of 1952 prohibits the supply from the United States of \"all or a substantial portion\" of the components of a patented invention for combination abroad.  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(f)(1).  We granted certiorari to determine whether a party that supplies a single component of a multicomponent invention for manufacture abroad can be held liable for infringement under \u00a7271(f)(1).  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  We hold that a single component does not constitute a substantial portion of the components that can give rise to liability under \u00a7271(f)(1).  Because only a single component of the patented invention at issue here was supplied from the United States, we reverse and remand.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin with an overview of the patent in dispute.  Although the science behind the patent is complex, a basic understanding suffices to resolve the question presented by this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tautz patent, U.\u00a0S. Reissue Patent No. RE 37,984, claims a toolkit for genetic testing.1  The kit is used to take small samples of genetic material--in the form of nucleotide sequences that make up the molecule deoxyribonucleic acid (commonly referred to as \"DNA\")--and then synthesize multiple copies of a particular nucleotide sequence.  This process of copying, known as amplification, generates DNA profiles that can be used by law enforcement agencies for forensic identification and by clinical and research institutions around the world.  For purposes of this litigation, the parties agree that the kit covered by the Tautz patent contains five components: (1) a mixture of primers that mark the part of the DNA strand to be copied; (2) nucleotides for forming replicated strands of DNA; (3) an enzyme known as Taq polymerase; (4) a buffer solution for the amplification; and (5) control DNA.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Promega Corporation was the exclusive licensee of the Tautz patent.  Petitioner Life Technologies Corporation manufactured genetic testing kits.3  During the timeframe relevant here, Promega sublicensed the Tautz patent to Life Technologies for the manufacture and sale of the kits for use in certain licensed law enforcement fields worldwide.  Life Technologies manufactured all but one component of the kits in the United Kingdom.  It manufactured that component--the Taq polymerase--in the United States.  Life Technologies shipped the Taq polymerase to its United Kingdom facility, where it was combined with the other four components of the kit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Four years into the agreement, Promega sued Life Technologies on the grounds that Life Technologies had infringed the patent by selling the kits outside the licensed fields of use to clinical and research markets.  As relevant here, Promega alleged that Life Technologies' supply of the Taq polymerase from the United States to its United Kingdom manufacturing facilities triggered liability under \u00a7271(f)(1).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At trial, the parties disputed the scope of \u00a7271(f)(1)'s prohibition against supplying all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention from the United States for combination abroad.  Section 271(f)(1)'s full text reads:\n\"Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components of a patented invention, where such components are uncombined in whole or in part, in such manner as to actively induce the combination of such components outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury returned a verdict for Promega, finding that Life Technologies had willfully infringed the patent.  Life Technologies then moved for judgment as a matter of law, contending that \u00a7271(f)(1) did not apply to its conduct because the phrase \"all or a substantial portion\" does not encompass the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted Life Technologies' motion.  The court agreed that there could be no infringement under \u00a7271(f)(1) because Promega's evidence at trial \"showed at most that one component of all of the accused products, [the Taq] polymerase, was supplied from the United States.\"  2012 WL 12862829, *3 (WD Wis., Sept. 13, 2012) (Crabb, J.).  Section 271(f)(1)'s reference to \"a substantial portion of the components,\" the District Court ruled, does not embrace the supply of a single component.  Id., at *5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit reversed and reinstated the jury's verdict finding Life Technologies liable for infringement.4  773 F.\u00a03d 1338, 1353 (2014).  As relevant here, the court held that \"there are circumstances in which a party may be liable under \u00a7271(f)(1) for supplying or causing to be supplied a single component for combination outside the United States.\"  Ibid.  The Federal Circuit concluded that the dictionary definition of \"substantial\" is \"important\" or \"essential,\" which it read to suggest that a single important component can be a \"\u00a0'substantial portion of the components'\u00a0\" of a patented invention.  Ibid.  Relying in part on expert trial testimony that the Taq polymerase is a \"\u00a0'main'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'major'\u00a0\" component of the kits, the court ruled that the single Taq polymerase component was a substantial component as the term is used in \u00a7271(f)(1).  Id., at 1356.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question before us is whether the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention is an infringing act under 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(f)(1).  We hold that it is not.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The threshold determination to be made is whether \u00a7271(f)(2)'s requirement of \"a substantial portion\" of the components of a patented invention refers to a quantitative or qualitative measurement.  Life Technologies and the United States argue that the text of \u00a7271(f)(1) establishes a quantitative threshold, and that the threshold must be greater than one.  Promega defends the Federal Circuit's reading of the statute, arguing that a \"substantial portion\" of the components includes a single component if that component is sufficiently important to the invention.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We look first to the text of the statute.  Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6).  The Patent Act itself does not define the term \"substantial,\" and so we turn to its ordinary meaning.  Ibid.  Here we find little help.  All agree the term is ambiguous and, taken in isolation, might refer to an important portion or to a large portion.  Brief for Petitioners 16; Brief for Respondent 18; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 12.  \"Substantial,\" as it is commonly understood, may refer either to qualitative importance or to quantitatively large size.  See, e.g., Webster's Third New International Dictionary 2280 (defs. 1c, 2c) (1981) (Webster's Third) (\"important, essential,\" or \"considerable in amount, value, or worth\"); 17 Oxford English Dictionary 67 (defs. 5a, 9) (2d ed. 1989) (OED) (\"That is, constitutes, or involves an essential part, point, or feature; essential, material,\" or \"Of ample or considerable amount, quantity, or dimensions\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The context in which \"substantial\" appears in the statute, however, points to a quantitative meaning here.  Its neighboring terms are the first clue.  \"[A] word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated.\" United States v. Williams, 553 U.\u00a0S. 285, 294 (2008).  Both \"all\" and \"portion\" convey a quantitative meaning.  \"All\" means the entire quantity, without reference to relative importance.  See, e.g., Webster's Third 54 (defs. 1a, 2a, 3) (\"that is the whole amount or quantity of,\" or \"every member or individual component of,\" or \"the whole number or sum of\"); 1 OED 324 (def. 2) (\"The entire number of; the individual components of, without exception\").  \"Portion\" likewise refers to some quantity less than all.  Webster's Third 1768 (defs. 1, 3a) (\"an individual's part or share of something,\" or \"a part of a whole\"); 12 OED 154, 155 (def. 1a, 5a) (\"The part (of anything) allotted or belonging to one person,\" or \"A part of any whole\").  Conversely, there is nothing in the neighboring text to ground a qualitative interpretation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the phrase \"substantial portion\" is modified by \"of the components of a patented invention.\"  It is the supply of all or a substantial portion \"of the components\" of a patented invention that triggers liability for infringement.  But if \"substantial\" has a qualitative meaning, then the more natural way to write the opening clause of the provision would be to not reference \"the components\" at all.  Instead, the opening clause of \u00a7271(f)(1) could have triggered liability for the supply of \"all or a substantial portion of .\u00a0.\u00a0. a patented invention, where [its] components are uncombined in whole or in part.\"  A qualitative reading would render the phrase \"of the components\" unnecessary the first time it is used in \u00a7271(f)(1).  Whenever possible, however, we should favor an interpretation that gives meaning to each statutory provision.  See Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.\u00a0S. 88, 101 (2004).  Only the quantitative approach does so here.  Thus, \"substantial,\" in the context of \u00a7271(f)(1), is most reasonably read to connote a quantitative measure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Promega argues that a quantitative approach is too narrow, and invites the Court to instead adopt a \"case-specific approach\" that would require a factfinder to decipher whether the components at issue are a \"substantial portion\" under either a qualitative or quantitative test.  Brief for Respondent 17, 42.  We decline to do so.  Having determined the phrase \"substantial portion\" is ambiguous, our task is to resolve that ambiguity, not to compound it by tasking juries across the Nation with interpreting the meaning of the statute on an ad\u00a0hoc basis.  See, e.g., Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.\u00a0S. 337, 345-346 (1997).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a more general matter, moreover, we cannot accept Promega's suggestion that the Court adopt a different analytical framework entirely--one that accounts for both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the components.  Promega reads \u00a7271(f)(1) to mean that the answer to whether a given portion of the components is \"substantial\" depends not only on the number of components involved but also on their qualitative importance to the invention overall.  At first blush, there is some appeal to the idea that, in close cases, a subjective analysis of the qualitative importance of a component may help determine whether it is a \"substantial portion\" of the components of a patent.  But, for the reasons discussed above, the statute's structure provides little support for a qualitative interpretation of the term.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor would considering the qualitative importance of a component necessarily help resolve close cases.  To the contrary, it might just as easily complicate the factfinder's review.  Surely a great many components of an invention (if not every component) are important.  Few inventions, including the one at issue here, would function at all without any one of their components.  Indeed, Promega has not identified any component covered by the Tautz patent that would not satisfy Promega's \"importance\" litmus test.6  How are courts--or, for that matter, market participants attempting to avoid liability--to determine the relative importance of the components of an invention?  Neither Promega nor the Federal Circuit offers an easy way to make this decision.  Accordingly, we conclude that a quantitative interpretation hews most closely to the text of the statute and provides an administrable construction.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having determined that the term \"substantial portion\" refers to a quantitative measurement, we must next decide whether, as a matter of law, a single component can ever constitute a \"substantial portion\" so as to trigger liability under \u00a7271(f)(1).  The answer is no.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As before, we begin with the text of the statute.  Section 271(f)(1) consistently refers to \"components\" in the plural.  The section is targeted toward the supply of all or a substantial portion \"of the components,\" where \"such components\" are uncombined, in a manner that actively induces the combination of \"such components\" outside the United States.  Text specifying a substantial portion of \"components,\" plural, indicates that multiple components constitute the substantial portion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The structure of \u00a7271(f) reinforces this reading.  Section 271(f)(2), which is \u00a7271(f)(1)'s companion provision, reads as follows:\n\"Whoever without authority supplies or causes to be supplied in or from the United States any component of a patented invention that is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity of commerce suitable for substantial noninfringing use, where such component is uncombined in whole or in part, knowing that such component is so made or adapted and intending that such component will be combined outside of the United States in a manner that would infringe the patent if such combination occurred within the United States, shall be liable as an infringer.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reading \u00a7271(f)(1) to refer to more than one component allows the two provisions to work in tandem.  Whereas \u00a7271(f)(1) refers to \"components,\" plural, \u00a7271(f)(2) refers to \"any component,\" singular.  And, whereas \u00a7271(f)(1) speaks to whether the components supplied by a party constitute a substantial portion of the components, \u00a7271(f)(2) speaks to whether a party has supplied \"any\" noncommodity component \"especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not disagree with the Federal Circuit's observation that the two provisions concern different scenarios.  See 773 F.\u00a03d, at 1354.  As this Court has previously observed, \u00a7\u00a7271(f)(1) and 271(f)(2) \"differ, among other things, on the quantity of components that must be 'supplie[d] .\u00a0.\u00a0. from the United States' for liability to attach.\"  Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U.\u00a0S. 437, 454, n. 16 (2007).  But we do not draw the Federal Circuit's conclusion from these different but related provisions.  Reading \u00a7271(f)(1) to cover any single component would not only leave little room for \u00a7271(f)(2), but would also undermine \u00a7271(f)(2)'s express reference to a single component \"especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention.\"7  Our conclusion that \u00a7271(f)(1) prohibits the supply of components, plural, gives each subsection its unique application.8  See, e.g., Cloer, 569 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Taken alone, \u00a7271(f)(1)'s reference to \"components\" might plausibly be read to encompass \"component\" in the singular.  See 1 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71 (instructing that \"words importing the plural include the singular,\" \"unless the context indicates otherwise\").  But \u00a7271(f)'s text, context, and structure leave us to conclude that when Congress said \"components,\" plural, it meant plural, and when it said \"component,\" singular, it meant singular.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not today define how close to \"all\" of the components \"a substantial portion\" must be.  We hold only that one component does not constitute \"all or a substantial portion\" of a multicomponent invention under \u00a7271(f)(1).  This is all that is required to resolve the question presented.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The history of \u00a7271(f) bolsters our conclusion.  The Court has previously observed that Congress enacted \u00a7271(f) in response to our decision in Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.\u00a0S. 518 (1972).  See Microsoft Corp., 550 U.\u00a0S., at 444.  In Deepsouth, the Court determined that, under patent law as it existed at the time, it was \"not an infringement to make or use a patented product outside of the United States.\"  406 U.\u00a0S., at 527.  The new \u00a7271(f) \"expand[ed] the definition of infringement to include supplying from the United States a patented invention's components,\" as outlined in subsections (f)(1) and (f)(2).  Microsoft, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 444-445.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The effect of this provision was to fill a gap in the enforceability of patent rights by reaching components that are manufactured in the United States but assembled overseas and that were beyond the reach of the statute in its prior formulation.  Our ruling today comports with Congress' intent.  A supplier may be liable under \u00a7271(f)(1) for supplying from the United States all or a substantial portion of the components (plural) of the invention, even when those components are combined abroad.  The same is true even for a single component under \u00a7271(f)(2) if it is especially made or especially adapted for use in the invention and not a staple article or commodity.  We are persuaded, however, that when as in this case a product is made abroad and all components but a single commodity article are supplied from abroad, this activity is outside the scope of the statute.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that the phrase \"substantial portion\" in 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(f)(1) has a quantitative, not a qualitative, meaning.  We hold further that \u00a7271(f)(1) does not cover the supply of a single component of a multicomponent invention.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Chief Justice took no part in the decision of this case.\n\nOpinion of Alito, J.\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 14-1538\nLIFE TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v.

It is clear from the text of 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(f) that Congress intended not only to fill the gap created by Deepsouth Packing Co. v. Laitram Corp., 406 U.\u00a0S. 518 (1972)--where all of the components of the invention were manufactured in the United States, id., at 524--but to go at least a little further.  How much further is the question in this case, and the genesis of \u00a7271(f) sheds no light on that question.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I note, in addition, that while the Court holds that a single component cannot constitute a substantial portion of an invention's components for \u00a7271(f)(1) purposes, I do not read the opinion to suggest that any number greater than one is sufficient.  In other words, today's opinion establishes that more than one component is necessary, but does not address how much more.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The Tautz patent expired in 2015.  The litigation thus concerns past acts of infringement only.\nFootnote 2\u00a0Because the parties here agree that the patented invention is made up of only these five components, we do not consider how to identify the \"components\" of a patent or whether and how that inquiry relates to the elements of a patent claim.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Applied Biosystems, LLC, and Invitrogen IP Holdings, Inc., are also petitioners in this proceeding and are wholly owned subsidiaries of Life Technologies Corporation.  The agreement at issue here was originally between Promega and Applied Biosystems.  773 F.\u00a03d 1338, 1344, n. 3 (CA Fed. 2014).\nFootnote 4\u00a0Chief Judge Prost dissented from the majority's conclusion with respect to the \"active inducement\" element of 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1).  773 F.\u00a03d, at 1358-1360.  Neither that question, nor any of the Federal Circuit's conclusions regarding Life Technologies' liability under \u00a7271(a) or infringement of four additional Promega patents, see id., at 1341, is before us.  See 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nFootnote 5\u00a0The examples Promega provides of other statutes' use of the terms \"substantial\" or \"significant\" are inapposite.  See Brief for Respondent 19-20.  The text of these statutes, which arise in different statutory schemes with diverse purposes and structures, differs in material ways from the text of \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1).  The Tax Code, for instance, refers to \"a substantial portion of a return,\" 26 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77701(a)(36)(A), not to \"a substantial portion of the entries of a return.\"\nFootnote 6\u00a0Life Technologies' expert described the Taq polymerase as a \"main\" component.  App. 160.  The expert also described two other components the same way.  Ibid.\nFootnote 7\u00a0This Court's opinion in Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp., 550 U.\u00a0S. 437, 447 (2007), is not to the contrary.  The holding in that case turned not on the number of components involved, but rather on whether the software at issue was a component at all.\nFootnote 8\u00a0Promega argues that the important distinction between these provisions is that \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1), unlike \u00a7271(f\u00a0)(2), requires a showing of specific intent for active inducement.  Brief for Respondent 34-41.  But cf. Global-Tech Appliances, Inc. v. SEB S.\u00a0A., 563 U.\u00a0S. 754, 765-766 (2011) (substantially equating the intent requirements for \u00a7\u00a7271(b) and 271(c), on which Promega asserts \u00a7\u00a7271(f\u00a0)(1) and (f\u00a0)(2) were modeled).  But, to repeat, whatever intent subsection (f\u00a0)(1) may require, it also imposes liability only on a party who supplies a \"substantial portion of the components\" of the invention.  Thus, even assuming that subsection (f\u00a0)(1)'s \"active inducement\" requirement is different from subsection (f\u00a0)(2)'s \"knowing\" and \"intending\" element--a question we do not reach today--that difference between the two provisions does not read the \"substantial portion\" language out of the statute.\n\n\n","42":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nLIGHTFOOT ET AL. v. CENDANT MORTGAGE CORP., DBA PHH MORTGAGE, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 14-1055\nArgued: November 8, 2016Decided: January 18, 2017\n\n\nThe Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) is a federally chartered corporation that participates in the secondary mortgage market.  By statute, Fannie Mae has the power \"to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\"  12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71723a(a).  When petitioners Beverly Ann Hollis-Arrington and her daughter Crystal Lightfoot filed suit in state court alleging deficiencies in the refinancing, foreclosure, and sale of their home, Fannie Mae removed the case to federal court, relying on its sue-and-be-sued clause as the basis for jurisdiction.  The District Court denied a motion to remand the case to state court and later entered judgment against petitioners.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  In concluding that the District Court had jurisdiction under Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause, the court relied on American Nat. Red Cross v. S. G., 505 U.\u00a0S. 247, which it read as establishing a rule that when a sue-and-be-sued clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes suit in federal court, it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.\nHeld:\u00a0Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause does not grant federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae.  Pp.\u00a06-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This Court has addressed the jurisdictional reach of sue-and-be-sued clauses in five federal charters.  Three clauses were held to grant jurisdiction--Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738; D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.\u00a0S. 447; American Nat. Red Cross v. S. G., 505 U.\u00a0S. 247--while two were found wanting--Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61; Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacific R. Co., 241 U.\u00a0S. 295.  Describing the earlier decisions as this Court's \"best efforts at divining congressional intent retrospectively,\" 505 U.\u00a0S., at 252, the Court in Red Cross concluded that those decisions \"support the rule that a congressional charter's 'sue and be sued' provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the federal courts,\" id., at 255.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In specifically mentioning the federal courts, Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause resembles the three clauses this Court has held confer jurisdiction.  But unlike those clauses, Fannie Mae's clause adds the qualification \"any court of competent jurisdiction,\" 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71723a(a).  Thus, the outcome here turns on the meaning of \"court of competent jurisdiction.\" \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudicate the case before it, Black's Law Dictionary 431, and a court's subject-matter jurisdiction defines its power to hear cases, see Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.\u00a0S. 83, 89.  It follows that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with a grant of subject-matter jurisdiction covering the case before it.  This Court has understood that phrase as a reference to a court with an existing source of subject-matter jurisdiction.  See, e.g., Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co., 118 U.\u00a0S. 610.  On this understanding, Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause is most naturally read not to grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae but to permit suit in any state or federal court already endowed with subject-matter jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Red Cross does not require a different result.  It did not set out a rule that an express reference to the federal courts suffices to make a sue-and-be-sued clause a grant of federal jurisdiction.  Rather, it restated \"the basic rule\" of Deveaux and Osborn that a sue-and-be-sued clause conferring only a general right to sue does not grant jurisdiction to the federal courts.  505 U.\u00a0S., at 253.  Pp.\u00a06-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Fannie Mae's arguments against reading its sue-and-be-sued clause as merely capacity conferring are unpersuasive.  Its alternative readings of \"court of competent jurisdiction\" are premised on the already rejected reading of Red Cross.  The prior construction canon of statutory interpretation does not apply because none of the cases on which Fannie Mae relies suggest that Congress in 1954 would have surveyed the jurisprudential landscape and necessarily concluded that the courts had already settled the question whether a sue-and-be-sued clause containing the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.  Finally, Fannie Mae's appeals to congressional purpose do not call into question the plain text reading of its sue-and-be-sued clause.

This case presents the question whether this sue-and-be-sued clause grants federal district courts jurisdiction over cases involving Fannie Mae.  We hold that it does not.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the Great Depression, the Federal Government worked to stabilize and strengthen the residential mortgage market.  Among other things, it took steps to increase liquidity (reasonably available funding) in the mortgage market.  These efforts included the creation of the Federal Home Loan Banks, which provide credit to member institutions to finance affordable housing and economic development projects, and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insures residential mortgages.  See Dept. of Housing and Urban Development, Background and History of the Federal National Mortgage Association 1-7, A4 (1966).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also as part of these efforts, Title III of the National Housing Act (1934 Act) authorized the Administrator of the newly created FHA to establish \"national mortgage associations\" that could \"purchase and sell [certain] first mortgages and such other first liens\" and \"borrow money for such purposes.\"  \u00a7301(a), 48 Stat. 1252-1253.  The associations were endowed with certain powers, including the power to \"sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.\"  \u00a7301(c), id., at 1253.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1938, the FHA Administrator exercised that authority and chartered the Federal National Mortgage Association.  Avoiding a mouthful of an acronym (FNMA), it went by Fannie Mae.  See, e.g., Washington Post, July 14, 1940, p. P2 (\"\u00a0'Fanny May'\u00a0\"); N.\u00a0Y. Times, Mar. 23, 1950, p. 48 (\"\u00a0'Fannie Mae'\u00a0\").  As originally chartered, Fannie Mae was wholly owned by the Federal Government and had three objectives: to \"establish a market for [FHA-insured] first mortgages\" covering new housing construction, to \"facilitate the construction and financing of economically sound rental housing projects,\" and to \"make [the bonds it issued] available to .\u00a0.\u00a0. investors.\"  Fed. Nat. Mortgage Assn. Information Regarding the Activities of the Assn. 1 (Circular No. 1, 1938).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae was rechartered in 1954.  Housing Act of 1954 (1954 Act), \u00a7201, 68 Stat. 613.  No longer wholly Government owned, Fannie Mae had mixed ownership: Private shareholders held its common stock and the Department of the Treasury held its preferred stock.  The 1954 Act required the Secretary of the Treasury to allow Fannie Mae to repurchase that stock.  See id., at 613-615.  It expected that Fannie Mae would repurchase all of its preferred stock and that legislation would then be enacted to turn Fannie Mae over to the private stockholders.  From then on, Fannie Mae's duties would \"be carried out by a privately owned and privately financed corporation.\"  Id., at 615.  Along with these structural changes, the 1954 Act replaced Fannie Mae's initial set of powers with a more detailed list.  In doing so, it revised the sue-and-be-sued clause to give Fannie Mae the power \"to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\"  Id., at 620.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1968, Fannie Mae became fully privately owned and relinquished part of its portfolio to its new spinoff, the Government National Mortgage Association (known as Ginnie Mae).  See Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (1968 Act), 82 Stat. 536.  Fannie Mae \"continue[d] to operate the secondary market operations\" but became \"a Government-sponsored private corporation.\"  12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71716b.  Ginnie Mae \"remain[ed] in the Government\" and took over \"the special assistance functions and management and liquidating functions.\"  Ibid.  Ginnie Mae received the same set of powers as Fannie Mae.  See \u00a71723(a); see also 1968 Act, \u00a7802(z), 82 Stat. 540 (minor revisions to \u00a71723a(a)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This general structure remains in place.  Fannie Mae continues to participate in the secondary mortgage market.  It purchases mortgages that meet its eligibility criteria, packages them into mortgage-backed securities, and sells those securities to investors, and it invests in mortgage-backed securities itself.  One of those mortgage purchases led to Fannie Mae's entanglement in this case.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beverly Ann Hollis-Arrington refinanced her mortgage with Cendant Mortgage Corporation (Cendant) in the summer of 1999.  Fannie Mae then bought the mortgage, while Cendant continued to service it.  Unable to make her payments, Hollis-Arrington pursued a forbearance arrangement with Cendant.  No agreement materialized, and the home entered foreclosure.  Around this time, Cendant repurchased the mortgage from Fannie Mae because it did not meet Fannie Mae's credit standards.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To stave off the foreclosure, Hollis-Arrington and her daughter, Crystal Lightfoot, pursued bankruptcy and transferred the property between themselves.  These efforts failed, and the home was sold at a trustee's sale in 2001.  The two then took to the courts to try to undo the foreclosure and sale.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After two unsuccessful federal suits, the pair filed this suit in state court.  They alleged that deficiencies in the refinancing, foreclosure, and sale of their home entitled them to relief against Fannie Mae.  Their claims against other defendants are not relevant here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae removed the case to federal court under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71441(a), which permits a defendant to remove from state to federal court \"any civil action\" over which the federal district courts \"have original jurisdiction.\"  It relied on its sue-and-be-sued clause as the basis for jurisdiction.  The District Court denied a motion to remand the case to state court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court then dismissed the claims against Fannie Mae on claim preclusion grounds.  After a series of motions, rulings, and appeals not related to the issue  here, the District Court entered final judgment.  Hollis-Arrington and Lightfoot immediately moved to set aside the judgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), alleging \"fraud upon the court.\"  App. 95-110.  The District Court denied the motion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the case and the denial of the Rule 60(b) motion.  465 Fed. Appx. 668 (2012).  After Hollis-Arrington and Lightfoot sought rehearing, the Ninth Circuit withdrew its opinion and ordered briefing on the question whether the District Court had jurisdiction over the case under Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause.  769 F.\u00a03d 681, 682-683 (2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A divided panel affirmed the District Court's judgment.  The majority relied on American Nat. Red Cross v. S. G., 505 U.\u00a0S. 247 (1992).  It read that decision to have established a \"rule [that] resolves this case\": When a sue-and-be-sued clause in a federal charter expressly authorizes suit in federal courts, it confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.  769 F.\u00a03d, at 684.  The dissent instead read Red Cross as setting out only a \"\u00a0'default rule'\u00a0\" that provides a \"starting point for [the] analysis.\"  769 F.\u00a03d, at 692 (opinion of Stein, J.).  It read \"any court of competent jurisdiction\" in Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause to overcome that default rule by requiring an independent source for jurisdiction in cases involving Fannie Mae.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two Circuits have likewise concluded that the language in Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause grants jurisdiction to federal courts.  See Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston v. Moody's Corp., 821 F.\u00a03d 102 (CA1 2016) (Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston's identical sue-and-be-sued clause); Pirelli Armstrong Tire Corp. Retiree Medical Benefits Trust ex rel. Fed. Nat. Mortgage Assn. v. Raines, 534 F.\u00a03d 779 (CADC 2008) (Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause).  Four Circuits have disagreed, finding that similar language did not grant jurisdiction.  See Western Securities Co. v. Derwinski, 937 F.\u00a02d 1276 (CA7 1991) (Under 38 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71820(a)(1) (1988 ed.), Secretary of Veterans Affairs' authority to \"sue and be sued .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal\"); C. H. Sanders Co. v. BHAP Housing Development Fund Co., 903 F.\u00a02d 114 (CA2 1990) (Under 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71702 (1988 ed.), Secretary of Housing and Urban Development's authority \"in his official capacity, to sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal\"); Industrial Indemnity, Inc. v. Landrieu, 615 F.\u00a02d 644 (CA5 1980) (\u00a0per curiam) (similar); Lindy v. Lynn, 501 F.\u00a02d 1367 (CA3 1974) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause authorizes it \"to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\"  12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71723a(a).  As in other federal corporate charters, this language serves the uncontroversial function of clarifying Fannie Mae's capacity to bring suit and to be sued.  See Bank of United States v. Deveaux, 5 Cranch 61, 85-86 (1809).  The question here is whether Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause goes further and grants federal courts jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In answering this question, \"we do not face a clean slate.\"  Red Cross, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 252.  This Court has addressed the jurisdictional reach of sue-and-be-sued clauses in five federal charters.  Three clauses were held to grant jurisdiction, while two were found wanting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first discussion of sue-and-be-sued clauses came in a pair of opinions by Chief Justice Marshall.  The charter of the first Bank of the United States allowed it \"\u00a0'to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in courts of record, or any other place whatsoever.'\u00a0\"  Deveaux, 5 Cranch, at 85.  Another provision allowed suits in federal court against certain bank officials, suggesting \"the right to sue does not imply a right to sue in the courts of the union, unless it be expressed.\"  Id., at 86.  In light of this language, the Court held that the first Bank of the United States had \"no right .\u00a0.\u00a0. to sue in the federal courts.\"  Ibid.  The Court concluded that the second Bank of the United States was not similarly disabled.  Its charter allowed it \"\u00a0'to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, answer and be answered, defend and be defended, in all State Courts having competent jurisdiction, and in any Circuit Court of the United States.'\u00a0\"  Osborn v. Bank of United States, 9 Wheat. 738, 817 (1824).  The Court took from Deveaux \"that a general capacity in the Bank to sue, without mentioning the Courts of the Union, may not give a right to sue in those Courts.\"  9 Wheat., at 818.  By contrast, the second Bank's charter did grant jurisdiction to the federal circuit courts because it used \"words expressly conferring a right to sue in those Courts.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A mortgage dispute between a railroad and its creditor led to the next consideration of this issue.  The Texas and Pacific Railway Company's federal charter authorized it \"\u00a0'to sue and be sued, plead and be impleaded, defend and be defended, in all courts of law and equity within the United States.'\u00a0\"  Bankers Trust Co. v. Texas & Pacific R. Co., 241 U.\u00a0S. 295, 302 (1916).  This Court held that the clause had \"the same generality and natural import as\" the clause in Deveaux.  241 U.\u00a0S., at 304.  Thus, \"all that was intended was to render this corporation capable of suing and being sued by its corporate name in any court .\u00a0.\u00a0. whose jurisdiction as otherwise competently defined was adequate to the occasion.\"  Id., at 303.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another lending dispute, involving defaulted bonds, led to the next statement on this issue.  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's (FDIC) sue-and-be-sued clause authorized it \"[t]o sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any court of law or equity, State or Federal.\"  12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7264(j) (1940 ed.).  In D'Oench, Duhme & Co. v. FDIC, 315 U.\u00a0S. 447, 455 (1942), this Court held that federal jurisdiction over the case was based on the FDIC's sue-and-be-sued clause.  See Red Cross, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 254 (expressing no \"doubt that the Court held federal jurisdiction to rest on the\" sue-and-be-sued clause).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's most recent discussion of a sue-and-be-sued clause came in Red Cross, which involved a state-law tort suit related to a contaminated blood transfusion.  It described the previous quartet of decisions as reflecting this Court's \"best efforts at divining congressional intent retrospectively,\" efforts that had put \"Congress on prospective notice of the language necessary and sufficient to confer jurisdiction.\"  Id., at 252.  Those decisions \"support the rule that a congressional charter's 'sue and be sued' provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the federal courts.\"  Id., at 255.  Under that rule, the Court explained, the result was \"clear.\"  Id., at 257.  The Red Cross' sue-and-be-sued clause, which permits it to \"sue and be sued in courts of law and equity, State or Federal, within the jurisdiction of the United States,\" 36 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7300105(a)(5), confers jurisdiction.  Red Cross, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 257.  \"In expressly authorizing [suits] in federal courts, using language .\u00a0.\u00a0. in all relevant respects identical to [the clause in D'Oench] on which [the Court] based a holding of federal jurisdiction just five years before [its enactment], the provision extends beyond a mere grant of general corporate capacity to sue, and suffices to confer federal jurisdiction.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Armed with these earlier cases, as synthesized by Red Cross, we turn to the sue-and-be-sued clause at issue here.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause resembles the clauses this Court has held confer jurisdiction in one important respect.  In authorizing Fannie Mae \"to sue and to be sued, and to complain and to defend, in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71723a(a), it \"specifically mentions the federal courts.\"  Red Cross, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 255.  This mention of the federal courts means that Fannie Mae's charter clears a hurdle that the clauses in Deveaux and Bankers Trust did not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Fannie Mae's clause differs in a material respect from the three clauses the Court has held sufficient to grant federal jurisdiction.  Those clauses referred to suits in the federal courts without qualification.  In contrast, Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause refers to \"any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal.\"  \u00a71723a(a) (emphasis added).  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because this sue-and-be-sued clause is not \"in all relevant respects identical\" to a clause already held to grant federal jurisdiction, Red Cross, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 257, this case cannot be resolved by a simple comparison.  The outcome instead turns on the meaning of \"court of competent jurisdiction\" in Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A court of competent jurisdiction is a court with the power to adjudicate the case before it.  See Black's Law Dictionary 431 (10th ed. 2014) (\"[a] court that has the power and authority to do a particular act; one recognized by law as possessing the right to adjudicate a controversy\").  And a court's subject-matter jurisdiction defines its power to hear cases.  See Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Environment, 523 U.\u00a0S. 83, 89 (1998) (Subject-matter jurisdiction is \"the courts' statutory or constitutional power to adjudicate the case\" (emphasis deleted)); Wachovia Bank, N.\u00a0A. v. Schmidt, 546 U.\u00a0S. 303, 316 (2006) (\"Subject-matter jurisdiction .\u00a0.\u00a0. concerns a court's competence to adjudicate a particular category of cases\").  It follows that a court of competent jurisdiction is a court with a grant of subject-matter jurisdiction covering the case before it.  Cf. Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.\u00a0S. 714, 733 (1878) (\"[T]here must be a tribunal competent by its constitution--that is, by the law of its creation--to pass upon the subject-matter of the suit\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a result, this Court has understood the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" as a reference to a court with an existing source of subject-matter jurisdiction. Ex parte Phenix Ins. Co., 118 U.\u00a0S. 610 (1886), provides an example.  There, the Court explained that a statute \"providing for the transfer to a trustee of the interest of the owner in the vessel and freight, provides only that the trustee may 'be appointed by any court of competent jurisdiction,' leaving the question of such competency to depend on other provisions of law.\"  Id., at 617.  See also Shoshone Mining Co. v. Rutter, 177 U.\u00a0S. 505, 506-507 (1900) (statute authorizing suit \"\u00a0'in a court of competent jurisdiction' .\u00a0.\u00a0. unquestionably meant that the competency of the court should be determined by rules theretofore prescribed in respect to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts\").  Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.\u00a0S. 99 (1977), provides another.  It held that \u00a710 of the Administrative Procedure Act, codified in 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7701-704, did not contain \"an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction to review agency actions.\"  430 U.\u00a0S., at 105.  In noting that \"the actual text .\u00a0.\u00a0. nowhere contains an explicit grant of jurisdiction,\" the Court pointed to two clauses requiring \"judicial review .\u00a0.\u00a0. to proceed 'in a court specified by statute' or 'in a court of competent jurisdiction'\u00a0\" and stated that both \"seem to look to outside sources of jurisdictional authority.\"  Id., at 105-106, and n.\u00a06.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On this understanding, Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause is most naturally read not to grant federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over all cases involving Fannie Mae.  In authorizing Fannie Mae to sue and be sued \"in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal,\" it permits suit in any state or federal court already endowed with subject-matter jurisdiction over the suit.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Red Cross does not require a different result.  Some, including the lower courts here, have understood it to set out a rule that an express reference to the federal courts suffices to make a sue-and-be-sued clause a grant of federal jurisdiction.  Red Cross contains no such rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its own terms, the rule Red Cross restates is \"the basic rule\" drawn in Deveaux and Osborn that a sue-and-be-sued clause conferring only a general right to sue does not grant jurisdiction to the federal courts.  Red Cross, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 253.  Each mention of a \"rule\" refers back to this principle.  See id., at 255 (reading this Court's sue-and-be-sued clause cases to \"support the rule that a .\u00a0.\u00a0. 'sue and be sued' provision may be read to confer federal court jurisdiction if, but only if, it specifically mentions the federal courts\" (emphasis added)); id., at 256 (Bankers Trust applied \"the rule thus established\" to hold that the railroad's sue-and-be-sued clause did not confer jurisdiction); 505 U.\u00a0S., at 257 (finding the result \"clear\" under the \"rule established in these cases\" because the charter \"expressly authoriz[es]\" suits in federal courts in a clause \"in all relevant respects identical\" to one already found to confer jurisdiction).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0True enough, the dissent thought Red Cross established a broad rule.  See 505 U.\u00a0S., at 271-272 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (describing Red Cross as announcing a \"rule .\u00a0.\u00a0. that any grant of a general capacity to sue with mention of federal courts will suffice to confer jurisdiction\" (emphasis deleted)).  The certainty of the dissent may explain the lower court decisions adopting a broader reading of Red Cross.  But Red Cross itself establishes no such rule.  And such a rule is hard to square with the opinion's thorough consideration of the contrary arguments based in text, purpose, and legislative history.  See id., at 258-263.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing in Red Cross suggests that courts should ignore \"the ordinary sense of the language used,\" id., at 263, when confronted with a federal charter's sue-and-be-sued clause that expressly references the federal courts, but only those that are courts \"of competent jurisdiction.\"\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae, preferring to be in federal court, raises several arguments against reading its sue-and-besued clause as merely capacity conferring.  None are  persuasive.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae first offers several alternative readings of \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"  It suggests that the phrase might refer to a court with personal jurisdiction over the parties before it, a court of proper venue, or a court of general, rather than specialized, jurisdiction.  Brief for Respondents 41-45.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At bottom, Fannie Mae's efforts on this front are premised on the reading of Red Cross rejected above.  In its view, an express reference to the federal courts suffices to confer subject-matter jurisdiction on federal courts.  It sees its only remaining task as explaining why that would not render \"court of competent jurisdiction\" superfluous.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-30.  But the fact that a sue-and-be-sued clause references the federal courts does not resolve the jurisdictional question.  Thus, arguments as to why the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" could still have meaning if it does not carry its ordinary meaning are beside the point.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, even if the phrase carries additional meaning, that would not further Fannie Mae's argument.  Take its suggestion that a \"court of competent jurisdiction\" is a court with personal jurisdiction.  A court must have the power to decide the claim before it (subject-matter jurisdiction) and power over the parties before it (personal jurisdiction) before it can resolve a case.  See Ruhrgas AG v. Marathon Oil Co., 526 U.\u00a0S. 574, 583-585 (1999).  Recognizing as much, this Court has stated that the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" while \"usually used to refer to subject-matter jurisdiction, has also been used on occasion to refer to a court's jurisdiction over the defendant's person.\"  United States v. Morton, 467 U.\u00a0S. 822, 828 (1984) (footnote omitted).  See also Blackmar v. Guerre, 342 U.\u00a0S. 512, 516 (1952).  But nothing in Fannie Mae's sue-and-be-sued clause suggests that the reference to \"court of competent jurisdiction\" refers only to a court with personal jurisdiction over the parties before it.  At most then, this point might support reading the phrase to refer to both subject-matter and personal jurisdiction.  That does not help Fannie Mae.  So long as the sue-and-be-sued clause refers to an outside source of subject-matter jurisdiction, it does not confer subject-matter jurisdiction.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae next claims that, by the time its sue-and-be-sued clause was enacted in 1954, courts had interpreted provisions containing the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" to grant jurisdiction and that Congress was entitled to rely on those interpretations.  This argument invokes the prior construction canon of statutory interpretation.  The canon teaches that if courts have settled the meaning of an existing provision, the enactment of a new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text indicates, as a general matter, that the new provision has that same meaning.  See Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.\u00a0S. 624, 645 (1998).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae points to cases discussing three types of statutory provisions that, in its view, show that the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" had acquired a settled meaning by 1954.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first pair addresses the FHA's sue-and-be-sued clause.  See 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71702 (\"sue and be sued in any court of competent jurisdiction, State or Federal\").  Two Court of Appeals decisions in the 1940's concluded that the FHA sue-and-be-sued clause overrode the general rule, today found in 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71346(a)(2), 1491, that monetary claims against the United States exceeding $10,000 must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, rather than the federal district courts.  See Ferguson v. Union Nat. Bank of Clarksburg, 126 F.\u00a02d 753, 755-757 (CA4 1942); George H. Evans & Co. v. United States, 169 F.\u00a02d 500, 502 (CA3 1948).  These courts did not state that their jurisdiction was founded on the sue-and-be-sued clause, as opposed to statutes governing the original jurisdiction of the federal district courts.  See, e.g., 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a741(a) (1946 ed.).  Thus, even assuming that two appellate court cases can \"\u00a0'settle'\u00a0\" an issue, A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 325 (2012), these two cases did not because they did not speak to the question here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second set of cases addresses provisions authorizing suit for a violation of a statute.  One arose under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, which authorizes employees to sue for violations of the Act in \"any .\u00a0.\u00a0. court of competent jurisdiction.\"  \u00a76(d)(1), 88 Stat. 61, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7216(b).  This Court, in its description of the facts, stated that \"[j]urisdiction of the action was conferred by .\u00a0.\u00a0. 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a741(8), and .\u00a0.\u00a0. 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7216(b).\"  Williams v. Jacksonville Terminal Co., 315 U.\u00a0S. 386, 390 (1942).  This brief, ambiguous statement did not settle the meaning of \u00a7216(b), and thus did not settle the meaning of the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction.\"  The other cases in this set dealt with the Housing and Rent Act of 1947.  As enacted, the statute permitted suit in \"any Federal, State, or Territorial court of competent jurisdiction.\"  \u00a7206(b), 61 Stat. 199.  Some courts read \u00a7206 not to confer jurisdiction and instead assessed their jurisdiction under the federal-question jurisdiction statute.  See, e.g., Schuman v. Greenberg, 100 F. Supp. 187, 189 (NJ 1951) (collecting cases).  At the time, that statute carried an amount-in-controversy requirement, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a741(1) (1946 ed.), and so some cases were dismissed or remanded to state court for lack of federal jurisdiction.  Congress later amended \u00a7206 to permit suit \"in any Federal court of competent jurisdiction regardless of the amount involved.\"  Defense Production Act Amendments of 1951, \u00a7204, 65 Stat. 147.  Congress' elimination of the amount-in-controversy requirement suggests, if anything, it understood that \"court of competent jurisdiction\" could be read to require an outside source of jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The third set of cases interpreted provisions making federal jurisdiction over certain causes of action exclusive.  Brief for Respondents 36-37.  Those cases confirm that the provisions require suit to be brought in federal courts but do not discuss the basis for federal jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, none of the cases on which Fannie Mae relies suggest that Congress in 1954 would have surveyed the jurisprudential landscape and necessarily concluded that the courts had already settled the question whether a sue-and-be-sued clause containing the phrase \"court of competent jurisdiction\" confers jurisdiction on the federal courts.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae ends with an appeal to congressional purpose, or, more accurately, a lack of congressional purpose.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It argues that its original sue-and-be-sued clause, enacted in 1934, granted jurisdiction to federal courts and that there is no indication that Congress wanted to change the status quo in 1954.  The addition in 1954 of \"court of competent jurisdiction,\" a phrase that, as discussed, carries a clear meaning, means that the current sue-and-be-sued clause does not confer jurisdiction.  An indication whether that meaning was understood as a change from the 1934 Act is not required.*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae next points to its sibling rival, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, known as Freddie Mac.  The two share parallel authority to compete in the secondary mortgage market.  Compare 12 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71717(b)(2)-(6) (Fannie Mae) with \u00a71454(a) (Freddie Mac).  Suits involving Freddie Mac may be brought in federal court.  See \u00a71452(c) (\"to sue and be sued, complain and defend, in any State, Federal, or other court\"); \u00a71452(f) (providing that Freddie Mac is a federal agency under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71345, 1442, that civil actions to which Freddie Mac is a party arise under federal law, and that Freddie Mac may remove cases to federal district court before trial).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fannie Mae argues there is no good reason to think that Congress gave Freddie Mac fuller access to the federal courts than it has.  Leaving aside the clear textual indications suggesting Congress did just that, a plausible reason does exist.  In 1970, when Freddie Mac's sue-and-be-sued clause and related jurisdictional provisions were enacted, Freddie Mac was a Government-owned corporation.  See Emergency Home Finance Act of 1970, \u00a7304(a), 84 Stat. 454.  Fannie Mae, on the other hand, had already transitioned into a privately owned corporation.  Fannie Mae's argument on this front, moreover, contains a deeper flaw.  The doors to federal court remain open to Fannie Mae through diversity and federal-question jurisdiction.  Fannie Mae provides no reason to think that in other cases, involving only state-law claims, access to the federal courts gives Freddie Mac an unintended competitive advantage over Fannie Mae that Congress would have wanted to avoid.  Indeed, the usual assumption is that state courts are up to the task of adjudicating their own laws.  Cf.  Gulf Offshore Co. v. Mobil Oil Corp., 453 U.\u00a0S. 473, 483-484 (1981).\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Ninth Circuit is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0The legislative history of the 1934 Act provides some reason to question Fannie Mae's premise about Congress' view of the status quo under the 1934 Act.  During debate on this provision, Senator Logan asked Senator Bulkley, the chair of the subcommittee with authority over the bill, about the original sue-and-be-sued clause.  Senator Bulkley explained that it merely conferred a capacity to sue and be sued \"and [did] not confe[r] a right to go into a Federal court where it would not otherwise exist.\"  78 Cong.

TEXAS(2017)\nNo. 16-122\nArgued: Decided: March 6, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statement of Justice Thomas respecting the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This petition asks an important question: whether modern civil-forfeiture statutes can be squared with the Due Process Clause and our Nation's history.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Early in the morning on April 1, 2013, a police officer stopped James Leonard for a traffic infraction along a known drug corridor.  During a search of the vehicle, the officer found a safe in the trunk.  Leonard and his passenger, Nicosa Kane, gave conflicting stories about the contents of the safe, with Leonard at one point indicating that it belonged to his mother, who is the petitioner here.  The officer obtained a search warrant and discovered that the safe contained $201,100 and a bill of sale for a Pennsylvania home.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State initiated civil forfeiture proceedings against the $201,100 on the ground that it was substantially connected to criminal activity, namely, narcotics sales.  See Tex. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 59.01 (Vernon Cum. Supp. 2016).  The trial court issued a forfeiture order, and petitioner appealed.  Citing the suspicious circumstances of the stop and the contradictory stories provided by Leonard and Kane, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court's conclusion that the government had shown by a preponderance of the evidence that the money was either the proceeds of a drug sale or intended to be used in such a sale.  It also affirmed the trial court's rejection of petitioner's innocent-owner defense.  Petitioner had asserted that the money was not related to a drug sale at all, but was instead from a home she had recently sold in Pennsylvania.  The court deemed this testimony insufficient to establish that she was in fact an innocent owner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner now challenges the constitutionality of the procedures used to adjudicate the seizure of her property.  In particular, she argues that the Due Process Clause required the State to carry its burden by clear and convincing evidence rather than by a preponderance of the evidence.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Modern civil forfeiture statutes are plainly designed, at least in part, to punish the owner of property used for criminal purposes.  See, e.g., Austin v. United States, 509 U.\u00a0S. 602, 618-619 (1993).  When a state wishes to punish one of its citizens, it ordinarily proceeds against the defendant personally (known as \"in personam\"), and in many cases it must provide the defendant with full criminal procedural protections.  Nevertheless, for reasons discussed below, this Court permits prosecutors seeking forfeiture to proceed against the property (known as \"in\u00a0rem\") and to do so civilly.  See, e.g., United States v. James Daniel Good Real Property, 510 U.\u00a0S. 43, 56-57 (1993).  In\u00a0rem proceedings often enable the government to seize the property without any predeprivation judicial process and to obtain forfeiture of the property even when the owner is personally innocent (though some statutes, including the one here, provide for an innocent-owner defense).  Civil proceedings often lack certain procedural protections that accompany criminal proceedings, such as the right to a jury trial and a heightened standard of proof.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Partially as a result of this distinct legal regime, civil forfeiture has in recent decades become widespread and highly profitable.  See, e.g., Institute for Justice, D. Carpenter, L. Knepper, A. Erickson, & J. McDonald, Policing for Profit: The Abuse of Civil Asset Forfeiture 10 (2d ed. Nov. 2015) (Department of Justice Assets Forfeiture Fund took in $4.5 billion in 2014 alone), https:\/\/ij.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/11\/policing-for-profit-2nd-edition.pdf (as last visited Feb. 27, 2017).  And because the law enforcement entity responsible for seizing the property often keeps it, these entities have strong incentives to pursue forfeiture.  Id., at 14 (noting that the Federal Government and many States permit 100 percent of forfeiture proceeds to flow directly to law enforcement); see also App. to Pet. for Cert. B-2 (directing that the money in this case be divided between the \"Cleveland Police Department\" and the \"Liberty County District Attorney's Office\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This system--where police can seize property with limited judicial oversight and retain it for their own use--has led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses.  According to one nationally publicized report, for example, police in the town of Tenaha, Texas, regularly seized the property of out-of-town drivers passing through and collaborated with the district attorney to coerce them into signing waivers of their property rights.  Stillman, Taken, The New Yorker, Aug. 12 & 19, 2013, pp. 54-56.  In one case, local officials threatened to file unsubstantiated felony charges against a Latino driver and his girlfriend and to place their children in foster care unless they signed a waiver.  Id., at 49.  In another, they seized a black plant worker's car and all his property (including cash he planned to use for dental work), jailed him for a night, forced him to sign away his property, and then released him on the side of the road without a phone or money.  Id., at 51.  He was forced to walk to a Wal-Mart, where he borrowed a stranger's phone to call his mother, who had to rent a car to pick him up.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These forfeiture operations frequently target the poor and other groups least able to defend their interests in forfeiture proceedings.  Id., at 53-54; Sallah, O'Harrow, & Rich, Stop and Seize, Washington Post, Sept. 7, 2014, pp.\u00a0A1, A10.  Perversely, these same groups are often the most burdened by forfeiture.  They are more likely to use cash than alternative forms of payment, like credit cards, which may be less susceptible to forfeiture.  And they are more likely to suffer in their daily lives while they litigate for the return of a critical item of property, such as a car or a home.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has justified its unique constitutional treatment of civil forfeiture largely by reference to a discrete historical practice that existed at the time of the founding.  See, e.g., Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U.\u00a0S. 442, 446-448 (1996).  \"\u00a0'English Law provided for statutory forfeitures of offending objects used in violation of the customs and revenue laws.'\u00a0\"  Austin, supra, at 612 (quoting Calero-Toledo v. Pearson Yacht Leasing Co., 416 U.\u00a0S. 663, 682 (1974)).  This practice \"took hold in the United States,\" where the \"First Congress passed laws subjecting ships and cargos involved in customs offenses to forfeiture.\"  509 U.\u00a0S., at 613.  Other early statutes also provided for the forfeiture of pirate ships.  United States v. Parcel of Rumson, N. J., Land, 507 U.\u00a0S. 111, 119 (1993) (plurality opinion).  These early statutes permitted the government to proceed in\u00a0rem under the fiction that the thing itself, rather than the owner, was guilty of the crime.  See Calero-Toledo, supra, at 684-685; Act of Aug. 4, 1790, \u00a767, 1 Stat. 176-177.  And, because these suits were in\u00a0rem rather than in personam, they typically proceeded civilly rather than criminally.  See United States v. La Vengeance, 3 Dall. 297, 301 (1796).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the absence of this historical practice, the Constitution presumably would require the Court to align its distinct doctrine governing civil forfeiture with its doctrines governing other forms of punitive state action and property deprivation.  See Bennis, supra, at 454 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\"One unaware of the history of forfeiture laws and 200 years of this Court's precedent regarding such laws might well assume that such a scheme is lawless--a violation of due process\").  I am skeptical that this historical practice is capable of sustaining, as a constitutional matter, the contours of modern practice, for two reasons.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, historical forfeiture laws were narrower in most respects than modern ones.  Cf. James Daniel Good, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 85 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (noting that \"ambitious modern statutes and prosecutorial practices have all but detached themselves from the ancient notion of civil forfeiture\").  Most obviously, they were limited to a few specific subject matters, such  as customs and piracy.  Proceeding in\u00a0rem in those cases was often justified by necessity, because the party responsible for the crime was frequently located overseas and thus beyond the personal jurisdiction of United States courts.  See Herpel, Toward a Constitutional Kleptocracy: Civil Forfeiture in America, 96 Mich. L.\u00a0Rev. 1910, 1918-1920 (1998); see also id., at 1925-1926 (arguing that founding-era precedents do not support the use of forfeiture against purely domestic offenses where the owner is plainly within the personal jurisdiction of both state and federal courts).  These laws were also narrower with respect to the type of property they encompassed.  For example, they typically covered only the instrumentalities of the crime (such as the vessel used to transport the goods), not the derivative proceeds of the crime (such as property purchased with money from the sale of the illegal goods).  See Rumson, supra, at 121-122, 125 (plurality opinion) (Forfeiture of criminal proceeds is a modern innovation).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, it is unclear whether courts historically permitted forfeiture actions to proceed civilly in all respects.  Some of this Court's early cases suggested that forfeiture actions were in the nature of criminal proceedings.  See, e.g., Boyd v. United States, 116 U.\u00a0S. 616, 633-634 (1886) (\"We are .\u00a0.\u00a0. clearly of [the] opinion that proceedings instituted for the purpose of declaring the forfeiture of a man's property by reason of offenses committed by him, though they may be civil in form, are in their nature criminal\"); but see R. Waples, Treatise on Proceedings In\u00a0Rem 29-30 (1882) (collecting contrary authorities).  Whether forfeiture is characterized as civil or criminal carries important implications for a variety of procedural protections, including the right to a jury trial and the proper standard of proof.  Indeed, as relevant in this case, there is some evidence that the government was historically required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  See United States v. Brig Burdett, 9 Pet. 682, 690 (1835) (\"The object of the prosecution against the Burdett is to enforce a forfeiture of the vessel, and all that pertains to it, for a violation of a revenue law.  This prosecution then is a highly penal one, and the penalty should not be inflicted, unless the infractions of the law shall be established beyond reasonable doubt\").\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, petitioner raises her due process arguments for the first time in this Court.  As a result, the Texas Court of Appeals lacked the opportunity to address them in the first instance.  I therefore concur in the denial of certiorari.  Whether this Court's treatment of the broad modern forfeiture practice can be justified by the narrow historical one is certainly worthy of consideration in greater detail.\n\n\nLISA OLIVIA LEONARD v.

The District Court entered an initial judgment sentencing petitioner to a term of imprisonment.  It also acknowledged that restitution was mandatory but deferred determination of the restitution amount.  Petitioner filed a notice of appeal from this initial judgment.  Months later, the District Court entered an amended judgment, ordering petitioner to pay restitution to one of his victims.  Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal from the amended judgment.  When he nonetheless challenged the restitution amount before the Eleventh Circuit, the Government argued that he had forfeited his right to do so by failing to file a second notice of appeal.  The Eleventh Circuit agreed, holding that petitioner could not challenge the restitution amount.\nHeld:\u00a0A defendant wishing to appeal an order imposing restitution in a deferred restitution case must file a notice of appeal from that order.  If he fails to do so and the Government objects, he may not challenge the restitution order on appeal.  Pp.\u00a03-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Both 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73742(a), which governs criminal appeals, and Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) contemplate that a defendant will file a notice of appeal after the district court has decided the issue sought to be appealed.  Here, petitioner filed only one notice of appeal, which preceded by many months the sentence and judgment imposing restitution.  He therefore failed to properly appeal the amended judgment.  Whether or not the requirement that a defendant file a timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional prerequisite, it is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule, which is \"unalterable\" if raised properly by the party asserting a violation of the rule.  Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.\u00a0S. 12, 15.  Because the Government timely raised the issue, \"the court's duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.\"  Id., at 18.  Pp.\u00a03-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Petitioner's argument that his single notice of appeal sufficed under the Federal Rules to appeal both judgments depends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one \"judgment,\" as that term is used in Rules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and second, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after the initial judgment, it \"springs forward\" under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judgment imposing restitution.  Each premise is rejected.  Pp.\u00a05-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0This Court's analysis in Dolan v. United States, 560 U.\u00a0S. 605, makes clear that deferred restitution cases involve two appealable judgments, not one.  The Dolan Court did not decide the question presented here, but the Court was not persuaded by the argument that \"a sentencing judgment is not 'final' until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution.\"  Id., at 617-618.   Instead, the Court recognized, \"strong arguments\" supported the proposition that both the initial judgment and the restitution order were each immediately appealable final judgments.  Ibid.  Pp.\u00a05-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0Because petitioner's notice of appeal was filed well before the District Court announced the sentence imposing restitution, the notice of appeal did not \"spring forward\" to become effective on the date the court entered its amended restitution judgment.  By its own terms, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sentence has been announced and before the judgment imposing the sentence is entered on the docket.  Even if the District Court's acknowledgment in the initial judgment that restitution was mandatory could qualify as a \"sentence\" that the District Court \"announced\" under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.  Rather, he argued on appeal that the amount imposed is unlawful.  Pp.\u00a06-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) Petitioner's alternative argument that any defect in his notice of appeal should be overlooked as harmless error is rejected.  Lemke v. United States, 346 U.\u00a0S. 325, on which he relies, has been superseded by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in two ways.  First, the Lemke petitioner's notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule 4(b)(2).  Petitioner in this case cannot take advantage of that Rule.  Second, Rule 3(a)(2) now provides the consequences for litigant errors associated with filing a notice of appeal.  The court of appeals may, in its discretion, overlook defects in a notice of appeal other than the failure to timely file a notice.  It may not overlook the failure to file a notice of appeal at all.  Pp.\u00a08-9.\n618 Fed.

But the amount to be imposed is not always known at the time of sentencing.  When that is the case, the court may enter an initial judgment imposing certain aspects of a defendant's sentence, such as a term of imprisonment, while deferring a determination of the amount of restitution until entry of a later, amended judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We must decide whether a single notice of appeal, filed between the initial judgment and the amended judgment, is sufficient to invoke appellate review of the later-determined restitution amount.  We hold that it is not, at least where, as here, the Government objects to the defendant's failure to file a notice of appeal following the amended judgment.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After federal agents found more than 300 files containing child pornography on his computer, petitioner Marcelo Manrique pleaded guilty to possessing a visual depiction of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2).  Under the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA), the District Court was required to order petitioner to \"make restitution to the victim of the offense.\"  \u00a73663A(a)(1); see \u00a7\u00a72259(a), (b)(2) (\"An order of restitution under this section shall be issued and enforced in accordance with [\u00a7]3664 in the same manner as an order under [\u00a7]3663A\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June 24, 2014, the District Court entered an initial judgment sentencing petitioner to 72 months of imprisonment and a life term of supervised release.  At the sentencing hearing, the court acknowledged that restitution was mandatory.  But, consistent with the MVRA, the court postponed determining the victims' damages, which had not yet been ascertained.  See, e.g., \u00a73664(d)(5); Dolan v. United States, 560 U.\u00a0S. 605, 607-608 (2010).  Accordingly, the judgment expressly deferred \"determination of restitution\" and noted that an \"Amended Judgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. w[ould] be entered after such determination.\"  App. 39.  On July 8, petitioner filed a notice of appeal \"from the final judgment and sentence entered in this action on the 24th day of June, 2014.\"  Id., at 42.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court held a restitution hearing on September 17, 2014.  Only one of the victims sought restitution.  The court ordered petitioner to pay $4,500 in restitution to her and entered an amended judgment the next day imposing that sentence.  Petitioner did not file a second notice of appeal from the court's order imposing restitution or from the amended judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding his failure to file a second notice of appeal, petitioner challenged the restitution amount before the Eleventh Circuit, arguing in his brief that the Government had not shown he was the proximate cause of the victim's injuries and that the restitution amount bore no rational relationship to the damages she claimed.  The Government countered that petitioner had forfeited his right to challenge the restitution amount by failing to file a second notice of appeal.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals agreed that petitioner could not challenge the restitution amount and declined to consider his challenge.  618 Fed.\u00a0Appx. 579, 583-584 (CA11 2015) (\u00a0per curiam).  We granted certiorari, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now affirm.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To secure appellate review of a judgment or order, a party must file a notice of appeal from that judgment or order.  Filing a notice of appeal transfers adjudicatory authority from the district court to the court of appeals.  The statute that governs appeals of criminal sentences, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73742(a), provides that a \"defendant may file a notice of appeal in the district court for review of an otherwise final sentence\" in certain specified circumstances.  See United States v. Ruiz, 536 U.\u00a0S. 622, 626\u2212628 (2002).  And Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3(a)(1) specifies that \"[a]n appeal permitted by law as of right .\u00a0.\u00a0. may be taken only by filing a notice of appeal with the district clerk within the time allowed by Rule 4.\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both \u00a73742(a) and Rule 4 contemplate that the defendant will file the notice of appeal after the district court has decided the issue sought to be appealed.  Section 3742(a)(1) permits the defendant to file a notice of appeal of a sentence that \"was imposed in violation of law.\"  (Emphasis added.)  And Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) provides generally that, \"[i]n a criminal case, a defendant's notice of appeal must be filed in the district court within 14 days after .\u00a0.\u00a0. the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed.\"  (Emphasis added.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner filed only one notice of appeal, which preceded by many months the sentence and judgment imposing restitution.  His notice of appeal could not have been \"for review\" of the restitution order, \u00a73742(a), and it was not filed within the timeframe allowed by Rule 4.  He thus failed to properly appeal under the statute and the Rules the amended judgment imposing restitution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government contends that filing a notice of appeal from the judgment imposing restitution is a jurisdictional prerequisite to securing appellate review of the restitution amount.  See, e.g., Brief for United States 28-31.  This position follows, according to the Government, from many of our cases emphasizing the \"jurisdictional significance\" of a notice of appeal.  E.g., Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.\u00a0S. 56, 58 (1982) (\u00a0per curiam).  Because the notice of appeal is jurisdictional, the Government explains, the Court of Appeals was required to dismiss petitioner's appeal regardless of whether the Government raised the issue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not need to decide in this case whether the Government is correct.  The requirement that a defendant file a timely notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule.  See Greenlaw v. United States, 554 U.\u00a0S. 237, 252-253 (2008); see also Rule 3(a)(2) (\"An appellant's failure to take any step other than the timely filing of a notice of appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal, but is ground only for the court of appeals to act as it considers appropriate, including dismissing the appeal\" (emphasis added)).  Mandatory claim-processing rules \"seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.\"  Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.\u00a0S. 428, 435 (2011).  Unlike jurisdictional rules, mandatory claim-processing rules may be forfeited \"if the party asserting the rule waits too long to raise the point.\"  Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.\u00a0S. 12, 15 (2005) (\u00a0per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).  If a party \"properly raise[s] them,\" however, they are \"unalterable.\"  Id., at 15, 19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government timely raised petitioner's failure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution before the Court of Appeals.  See Brief for United States in No. 14-13029 (CA11), pp. 22-25 (arguing that petitioner \"waived his right to appeal the district court's order of restitution by failing to file a notice of appeal from that order\" (capitalization omitted)).  Accordingly, \"the court's duty to dismiss the appeal was mandatory.\"  Eberhart, supra, at 18.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner disputes this conclusion, arguing that his single notice of appeal sufficed under the Rules to appeal both the initial judgment and the amended judgment imposing restitution.  As we understand it, his argument depends on two premises: First, in a deferred restitution case, there is only one \"judgment,\" as that term is used in Rules 4(b)(1) and (b)(2); and second, so long as a notice of appeal is filed after the initial judgment, it \"springs forward\" under Rule 4(b)(2) to appeal the amended judgment imposing restitution.  We reject each of these premises.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner argues that the initial judgment deferring restitution and the amended judgment imposing a specific restitution amount merge to become \"the judgment\" referenced in the Federal Rules.  See Rule 4(b)(1)(A)(i) (notice of appeal must be filed within 14 days after \"the entry of .\u00a0.\u00a0. the judgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. being appealed\"); Rule 4(b)(2) (\"Filing Before Entry of Judgment\").  He argues that his notice of appeal, which was filed within 14 days of the initial judgment, was therefore sufficient to invoke appellate review of the merged judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner's approach is inconsistent with our reasoning in Dolan, 560 U.\u00a0S. 605.  The petitioner in that case argued that the amended judgment imposing restitution is the only final, appealable judgment in a deferred restitution case.  See id., at 616.  Although we did not decide \"whether or when a party can, or must, appeal\"--the question presented here--we were not persuaded by the argument that \"a sentencing judgment is not 'final' until it contains a definitive determination of the amount of restitution.\"  Id., at 617-618.  To the contrary, we recognized \"strong arguments\" supporting the proposition that both the \"initial judgment [that] imposed a sentence of imprisonment and supervised release\" and the subsequent \"\u00a0'sentence that impose[d] an order of restitution'\u00a0\" were each immediately appealable final judgments.  Ibid. (citing 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73582(b) (imprisonment), 3583(a) (supervised release), and 3664(o) (restitution)).  Consequently, we were not surprised \"to find instances where a defendant ha[d] appealed from the entry of a judgment containing an initial sentence that includes a term of imprisonment\" and \"subsequently appealed from a later order setting forth the final amount of restitution.\"  560 U.\u00a0S., at 618.  Our analysis in Dolan thus makes clear that deferred restitution cases involve two appealable judgments, not one.1\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner's reliance on Rule 4(b)(2) is also misplaced.  That Rule provides that a \"notice of appeal filed after the court announces a decision, sentence, or order--but before the entry of the judgment or order--is treated as filed on the date of and after the entry.\"  A prematurely filed notice of appeal will become effective under the Rule to challenge a later-entered judgment in some circumstances.  As this Court explained in construing Rule 4(a)(2)'s parallel provision for civil cases, the Rule \"was intended to protect the unskilled litigant who files a notice of appeal from a decision that he reasonably but mistakenly believes to be a final judgment, while failing to file a notice of appeal from the actual final judgment.\"  FirsTier Mortgage Co. v. Investors Mortgage Ins. Co., 498 U.\u00a0S. 269, 276 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By its own terms, however, Rule 4(b)(2) applies only to a notice of appeal filed after a sentence has been \"announce[d]\" and before the judgment imposing the sentence is entered on the docket.  See Rule 4(b)(6) (\"A judgment or order is entered for purposes of this Rule 4(b) when it is entered on the criminal docket\").  If the court has not yet decided the issue that the appellant seeks to appeal, then the Rule does not come into play.  Accordingly, it does not apply where a district court enters an initial judgment deferring restitution and subsequently amends the judgment to include the sentence of restitution.  By deferring restitution, the court is declining to announce a sentence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When petitioner filed his notice of appeal in this case, the District Court had observed only that restitution was \"mandatory.\"  App. 27.  The court did not announce the restitution amount (or even hold a hearing on the issue) until months later.  Even if describing restitution as mandatory could qualify as a \"sentence\" that the District Court \"announced\" under Rule 4(b)(2), petitioner has never disputed that restitution is mandatory for his offense.  Rather, he argued on appeal that the amount of the restitution imposed--an issue the court did not consider until months later--is unlawful.  Because petitioner's notice of appeal was filed well before the District Court announced the sentence imposing $4,500 in restitution, the notice of appeal did not \"spring forward\" to become effective on the date the court entered its amended judgment imposing that sentence.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, petitioner argues in the alternative that any defect in his notice of appeal should be overlooked as harmless error, citing Lemke v. United States, 346 U.\u00a0S. 325 (1953) (per curiam).  In that case, the petitioner filed a notice of appeal the day after his sentence was announced but three days before the judgment was entered.  Id., at 326.  His notice of appeal was dismissed as premature under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 37(a)(2), which then governed notices of appeal in criminal cases.  This Court reversed on the ground that the premature filing was harmless error under Rule 52(a).  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's holding in Lemke does not apply to petitioner's failure to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment.  Lemke has been superseded by the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure in two ways.  First, the Lemke petitioner's notice of appeal would now be timely under Rule 4(b)(2).  As discussed in Part II-B-2, supra, petitioner here cannot take advantage of that rule.  Second, Rule 3(a)(2) now provides the consequences for litigant errors associated with filing a notice of appeal.  The court of appeals may, in its discretion, overlook defects in a notice of appeal other than the failure to timely file a notice.  It may not overlook the failure to file a notice of appeal at all.  The filing of a notice of appeal from an amended judgment imposing restitution is at least a mandatory claim-processing rule, Part II-A, supra, meaning that the requirement to file such a notice is unalterable, so long as the opposing party raises the issue.  By definition, mandatory claim-processing rules, although subject to forfeiture, are not subject to harmless-error analysis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner in this case did not file a defective notice of appeal from the amended judgment imposing restitution, but rather failed altogether to file a notice of appeal from the amended judgment.  Courts do not have discretion to overlook such an error, at least where it is called to their attention.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that a defendant who wishes to appeal an order imposing restitution in a deferred restitution case must file a notice of appeal from that order.  Because petitioner failed to do so, and the Government objected, the Court of Appeals properly declined to consider his challenge to the amount of restitution imposed.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals, accordingly, is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nGinsburg, J., dissenting\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-7250\nMARCELO MANRIQUE, PETITIONER v.  UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\n[April 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg, with whom Justice Sotomayor joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Time limits, such as those stated in Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure 3 and 4, and other limitations prescribed in a procedural rule, this Court has held, are claim-processing rules, not jurisdictional requirements.  See, e.g., Eberhart v. United States, 546 U.\u00a0S. 12, 15-19 (2005) (per curiam); Kontrick v. Ryan, 540 U.\u00a0S. 443, 448, 452-456 (2004).  That matter is settled, and the Court, today, leaves undisturbed prior opinions distinguishing claim-processing rules from jurisdictional orders.  See, e.g., Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.\u00a0S. 134, 141-143 (2012); Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U.\u00a0S. 428, 435-436, 441-442 (2011); Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U.\u00a0S. 401, 413-414 (2004); cf. Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.\u00a0S. 205, 209-213 (2007) (distinguishing statutory prescriptions from procedural rules).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I see it, a defendant wishing to appeal his sentence and conviction when a restitution determination has been deferred has two choices: (1) He may immediately appeal his conviction and sentence of imprisonment, and later appeal the restitution order when made; or (2) he may await the restitution order and then appeal, through a single notice, his conviction, sentence of imprisonment, and restitution order.  But even assuming, arguendo, that separate appeal notices are ordinarily required, I would hold that Manrique is not barred from appealing the restitution order in the circumstances of this case.  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(j)(1)(B) states:\n\"Appealing a Sentence.  After sentencing--regardless of the defendant's plea--the court must advise the defendant of any right to appeal the sentence.\"\nThe District Court gave Manrique the requisite advice upon sentencing him to imprisonment on June 23, 2014, see App. 29; that court gave no such advice upon amending its judgment on September 18, 2014 to include the amount of restitution ordered, see id., at 10, 46-65.  The Government agrees that the District Court was \"absolutely\" required to advise Manrique of his right to appeal the restitution order, and anticipates that the required advice \"will prevent cases like this from arising again in the future.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Aware of its obligation to advise Manrique of his right to appeal, the District Court appears to have assumed that no second notice was required to place the restitution amount before the Court of Appeals.  Without awaiting another appeal notice, the District Court clerk transmitted the amended judgment, five days after its entry, to the Court of Appeals, which filed that judgment on the docket of the appeal from the conviction and sentence already pending in that court.  App. 10.  In turn, the Eleventh Circuit's clerk asked the District Court reporter to send up the transcript of, and record from, the restitution hearing.  See Docket in No. 14-13029 (CA11).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of what occurred here, I would hold that the clerk's dispatch of the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals \"confer[red] jurisdiction on the court of appeals.\"  Griggs v. Provident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.\u00a0S. 56, 58 (1982) (per curiam).  In other words, in lieu of trapping an unwary defendant, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 29, I would rank the clerk's transmission of the amended judgment to the Court of Appeals as an adequate substitute for a second notice of appeal.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because I would treat the clerk's transmission of the amended judgment as tantamount to, or effectively doing service for, a second appeal notice, I would reverse the Eleventh Circuit's judgment and allow Manrique to include the restitution order in his appeal.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0We do not intend to call into question this Court's decision in Corey v. United States, 375 U.\u00a0S. 169, 176 (1963) (holding that a defendant may challenge his conviction after a single notice of appeal filed from a final sentence imposed under \u00a74208(b)).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Given the steps taken by the District Court, Court of Appeals, and the clerks of those courts, it was likely no surprise to the Government when Manrique challenged the restitution award in his opening brief on appeal.

CITY OF JOLIET, ILLINOIS, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 14-9496\nArgued: October 5, 2016Decided: March 21, 2017\n\n\nDuring a traffic stop, police officers in Joliet, Illinois, searched petitioner Elijah Manuel and found a vitamin bottle containing pills.  Suspecting the pills to be illegal drugs, the officers conducted a field test, which came back negative for any controlled substance.  Still, they arrested Manuel and took him to the police station.  There, an evidence technician tested the pills and got the same negative result, but claimed in his report that one of the pills tested \"positive for the probable presence of ecstasy.\"  App. 92.  An arresting officer also reported that, based on his \"training and experience,\" he \"knew the pills to be ecstasy.\"  Id., at 91.  On the basis of those false statements, another officer filed a sworn complaint charging Manuel with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.  Relying exclusively on that complaint, a county court judge found probable cause to detain Manuel pending trial.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Manuel was in jail, the Illinois police laboratory tested the seized pills and reported that they contained no controlled substances.  But Manuel remained in custody, spending a total of 48 days in pretrial detention.  More than two years after his arrest, but less than two years after his criminal case was dismissed, Manuel filed a 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 lawsuit against Joliet and several of its police officers (collectively, the City), alleging that his arrest and detention violated the Fourth Amendment.  The District Court dismissed Manuel's suit, holding, first, that the applicable two-year statute of limitations barred his unlawful arrest claim, and, second, that under binding Circuit precedent, pretrial detention following the start of legal process (here, the judge's probable-cause determination) could not give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.  Manuel appealed the dismissal of his unlawful detention claim; the Seventh Circuit affirmed.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on Fourth Amendment grounds.  This conclusion follows from the Court's settled precedent.  In Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.\u00a0S. 103, the Court decided that a pretrial detention challenge was governed by the Fourth Amendment, noting that the Fourth Amendment establishes the minimum constitutional \"standards and procedures\" not just for arrest but also for \"detention,\" id., at 111, and \"always has been thought to define\" the appropriate process \"for seizures of person[s] . . . in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial,\" id., at 125, n. 27.  And in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.\u00a0S. 266, a majority of the Court again looked to the Fourth Amendment to assess pretrial restraints on liberty.  Relying on Gerstein, the plurality reiterated that the Fourth Amendment is the \"relevan[t]\" constitutional provision to assess the \"deprivations of liberty that go hand in hand with criminal prosecutions.\"  Id., at 274; see id., at 290 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (\"[R]ules of recovery for such harms have naturally coalesced under the Fourth Amendment\").  That the pretrial restraints in Albright arose pursuant to legal process made no difference, given that they were allegedly unsupported by probable cause.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As reflected in those cases, pretrial detention can violate the Fourth Amendment not only when it precedes, but also when it follows, the start of legal process.  The Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person absent probable cause.  And where legal process has gone forward, but has done nothing to satisfy the probable-cause requirement, it cannot extinguish a detainee's Fourth Amendment claim.  That was the case here: Because the judge's determination of probable cause was based solely on fabricated evidence, it did not expunge Manuel's Fourth Amendment claim.  For that reason, Manuel stated a Fourth Amendment claim when he sought relief not merely for his arrest, but also for his pretrial detention.  Pp.\u00a06-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0On remand, the Seventh Circuit should determine the claim's accrual date, unless it finds that the City has previously waived its timeliness argument.  In doing so, the court should look to the common law of torts for guidance, Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.\u00a0S. 247, 257-258, while also closely attending to the values and purposes of the constitutional right at issue.  The court may also consider any other still-live issues relating to the elements of and rules applicable to Manuel's Fourth Amendment claim.  Pp.\u00a011-15.\n590 Fed.

CITY OF JOLIET, ILLINOIS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit\n[March 21, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Elijah Manuel was held in jail for some seven weeks after a judge relied on allegedly fabricated evidence to find probable cause that he had committed a crime.  The primary question in this case is whether Manuel may bring a claim based on the Fourth Amendment to contest the legality of his pretrial confinement.  Our answer follows from settled precedent.  The Fourth Amendment, this Court has recognized, establishes \"the standards and procedures\" governing pretrial detention.  See, e.g., Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.\u00a0S. 103, 111 (1975).  And those constitutional protections apply even after the start of \"legal process\" in a criminal case--here, that is, after the judge's determination of probable cause.  See Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.\u00a0S. 266, 274 (1994) (plurality opinion); id., at 290 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).  Accordingly, we hold today that Manuel may challenge his pretrial detention on the ground that it violated the Fourth Amendment (while we leave all other issues, including one about that claim's timeliness, to the court below).\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after midnight on March 18, 2011, Manuel was riding through Joliet, Illinois, in the passenger seat of a Dodge Charger, with his brother at the wheel.  A pair of Joliet police officers pulled the car over when the driver failed to signal a turn.  See App. 90.  According to the complaint in this case, one of the officers dragged Manuel from the car, called him a racial slur, and kicked and punched him as he lay on the ground.  See id., at 31-32, 63.1  The policeman then searched Manuel and found a vitamin bottle containing pills.  See id., at 64.  Suspecting that the pills were actually illegal drugs, the officers conducted a field test of the bottle's contents.  The test came back negative for any controlled substance, leaving the officers with no evidence that Manuel had committed a crime.  See id., at 69.  Still, the officers arrested Manuel and took him to the Joliet police station.  See id., at 70.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There, an evidence technician tested the pills once again, and got the same (negative) result.  See ibid.  But the technician lied in his report, claiming that one of the pills was \"found to be .\u00a0.\u00a0. positive for the probable presence of ecstasy.\"  Id., at 92.  Similarly, one of the arresting officers wrote in his report that \"[f\u00a0]rom [\u00a0his] training and experience, [\u00a0he] knew the pills to be ecstasy.\"  Id., at 91.  On the basis of those statements, another officer swore out a criminal complaint against Manuel, charging him with unlawful possession of a controlled substance.  See id., at 52-53.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Manuel was brought before a county court judge later that day for a determination of whether there was probable cause for the charge, as necessary for further detention.  See Gerstein, 420 U.\u00a0S., at 114 (requiring a judicial finding of probable cause following a warrantless arrest to impose any significant pretrial restraint on liberty); Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \u00a75\/109-1 (West 2010) (implementing that constitutional rule).  The judge relied exclusively on the criminal complaint--which in turn relied exclusively on the police department's fabrications--to support a finding of probable cause.  Based on that determination, he sent Manuel to the county jail to await trial.  In the somewhat obscure legal lingo of this case, Manuel's subsequent detention was thus pursuant to \"legal process\"--because it followed from, and was authorized by, the judge's probable-cause determination.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While Manuel sat in jail, the Illinois police laboratory reexamined the seized pills, and on April 1, it issued a report concluding (just as the prior two tests had) that they contained no controlled substances.  See App. 51.  But for unknown reasons, the prosecution--and, critically for this case, Manuel's detention--continued for more than another month.  Only on May 4 did an Assistant State's Attorney seek dismissal of the drug charge.  See id., at 48, 101.  The County Court immediately granted the request, and Manuel was released the next day.  In all, he had spent 48 days in pretrial detention.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 22, 2013, Manuel brought this lawsuit under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 against the City of Joliet and several of its police officers (collectively, the City).  Section 1983 creates a \"species of tort liability,\" Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.\u00a0S. 409, 417 (1976), for \"the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution,\" \u00a71983.  Manuel's complaint alleged that the City violated his Fourth Amendment rights in two ways--first by arresting him at the roadside without any reason, and next by \"detaining him in police custody\" for almost seven weeks based entirely on made-up evidence.  See App. 79-80.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court dismissed Manuel's suit.  See 2014 WL 551626 (ND Ill., Feb. 12, 2014).  The court first held that the applicable two-year statute of limitations barred Manuel's claim for unlawful arrest, because more than two years had elapsed between the date of his arrest (March 18, 2011) and the filing of his complaint (April 22, 2013).  But the court relied on another basis in rejecting Manuel's challenge to his subsequent detention (which stretched from March 18 to May 5, 2011).  Binding Circuit precedent, the District Court explained, made clear that pretrial detention following the start of legal process could not give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.  See id., at *1 (citing, e.g., Newsome v. McCabe, 256 F.\u00a03d 747, 750 (CA7 2001)).  According to that line of decisions, a \u00a71983 plaintiff challenging such detention must allege a breach of the Due Process Clause--and must show, to recover on that theory, that state law fails to provide an adequate remedy.  See 2014 WL 551626, at *1-*2.  Because Manuel's complaint rested solely on the Fourth Amendment--and because, in any event, Illinois's remedies were robust enough to preclude the due process avenue--the District Court found that Manuel had no way to proceed.  See ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of Manuel's claim for unlawful detention (the only part of the District Court's decision Manuel appealed).  See 590 Fed. Appx. 641 (2015).  Invoking its prior caselaw, the Court of Appeals reiterated that such claims could not be brought under the Fourth Amendment.  Once a person is detained pursuant to legal process, the court stated, \"the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture and the detainee's claim that the detention is improper becomes [one of] due process.\"  Id., at 643-644 (quoting Llovet v. Chicago, 761 F.\u00a03d 759, 763 (CA7 2014)).  And again: \"When, after the arrest[,] a person is not let go when he should be, the Fourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention.\"  590 Fed. Appx., at 643 (quoting Llovet, 761 F.\u00a03d, at 764).  So the Seventh Circuit held that Manuel's complaint, in alleging only a Fourth Amendment violation, rested on the wrong part of the Constitution: A person detained following the onset of legal process could at most (although, the court agreed, not in Illinois) challenge his pretrial confinement via the Due Process Clause.  See 590 Fed. Appx., at 643-644.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Seventh Circuit recognized that its position makes it an outlier among the Courts of Appeals, with ten others taking the opposite view.  See id., at 643; Hernandez-Cuevas v. Taylor, 723 F.\u00a03d 91, 99 (CA1 2013) (\"[T]here is now broad consensus among the circuits that the Fourth Amendment right to be free from seizure but upon probable cause extends through the pretrial period\").4  Still, the court decided, Manuel had failed to offer a sufficient reason for overturning settled Circuit precedent; his argument, albeit \"strong,\" was \"better left for the Supreme Court.\"  590 Fed. Appx., at 643.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On cue, we granted certiorari.  577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fourth Amendment protects \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons .\u00a0.\u00a0. against unreasonable .\u00a0.\u00a0. seizures.\"  Manuel's complaint seeks just that protection.  Government officials, it recounts, detained--which is to say, \"seiz[ed]\"--Manuel for 48 days following his arrest.  See App. 79-80; Brendlin v. California, 551 U.\u00a0S. 249, 254 (2007) (\"A person is seized\" whenever officials \"restrain[ ] his freedom of movement\" such that he is \"not free to leave\").  And that detention was \"unreason-able,\" the complaint continues, because it was based solely on false evidence, rather than supported by probable cause.  See App. 79-80; Bailey v. United States, 568 U.\u00a0S. 186, 192 (2013) (\"[T]he general rule [is] that Fourth Amendment seizures are 'reasonable' only if based on probable cause to believe that the individual has committed a crime\").  By their respective terms, then, Manuel's claim fits the Fourth Amendment, and the Fourth Amendment fits Manuel's claim, as hand in glove.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court decided some four decades ago that a claim challenging pretrial detention fell within the scope of the Fourth Amendment.  In Gerstein, two persons arrested without a warrant brought a \u00a71983 suit complaining that they had been held in custody for \"a substantial period solely on the decision of a prosecutor.\"  420 U.\u00a0S., at 106.  The Court looked to the Fourth Amendment to analyze--and uphold--their claim that such a pretrial restraint on liberty is unlawful unless a judge (or grand jury) first makes a reliable finding of probable cause.  See id., at 114, 117, n.\u00a019.  The Fourth Amendment, we began, establishes the minimum constitutional \"standards and procedures\" not just for arrest but also for ensuing \"detention.\"  Id., at 111.  In choosing that Amendment \"as the rationale for decision,\" the Court responded to a concurring Justice's view that the Due Process Clause offered the better framework: The Fourth Amendment, the majority countered, was \"tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system, and it[ ] always has been thought to define\" the appropriate process \"for seizures of person[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial.\"  Id., at 125, n. 27.  That Amendment, standing alone, guaranteed \"a fair and reliable determination of probable cause as a condition for any significant pretrial restraint.\"  Id., at 125.  Accordingly, those detained prior to trial without such a finding could appeal to \"the Fourth Amendment's protection against unfounded invasions of liberty.\"  Id., at 112; see id., at 114.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so too, a later decision indicates, those objecting to a pretrial deprivation of liberty may invoke the Fourth Amendment when (as here) that deprivation occurs after legal process commences.  The \u00a71983 plaintiff in Albright complained of various pretrial restraints imposed after a court found probable cause to issue an arrest warrant, and then bind him over for trial, based on a policeman's unfounded charges.  See 510 U.\u00a0S., at 268-269 (plurality opinion).  For uncertain reasons, Albright ignored the Fourth Amendment in drafting his complaint; instead, he alleged that the defendant officer had infringed his substantive due process rights.  This Court rejected that claim, with five Justices in two opinions remitting Albright to the Fourth Amendment.  See id., at 271 (plurality opinion) (\"We hold that it is the Fourth Amendment .\u00a0.\u00a0. under which [\u00a0his] claim must be judged\"); id., at 290 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (\"[I]njuries like those [\u00a0he] alleges are cognizable in \u00a71983 claims founded upon .\u00a0.\u00a0. the Fourth Amendment\").  \"The Framers,\" the plurality wrote, \"considered the matter of pretrial deprivations of liberty and drafted the Fourth Amendment to address it.\"  Id., at 274.  That the deprivations at issue were pursuant to legal process made no difference, given that they were (allegedly) unsupported by probable cause; indeed, neither of the two opinions so much as mentioned that procedural circumstance.  Relying on Gerstein, the plurality stated that the Fourth Amendment remained the \"relevan[t]\" constitutional provision to assess the \"deprivations of liberty\"--most notably, pretrial detention--\"that go hand in hand with criminal prosecutions.\"  510 U.\u00a0S., at 274; see id., at 290 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (\"[R]ules of recovery for such harms have naturally coalesced under the Fourth Amendment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As reflected in Albright's tracking of Gerstein's analysis, pretrial detention can violate the Fourth Amendment not only when it precedes, but also when it follows, the start of legal process in a criminal case.  The Fourth Amendment prohibits government officials from detaining a person in the absence of probable cause.  See supra, at 6.  That can happen when the police hold someone without any reason before the formal onset of a criminal proceeding.  But it also can occur when legal process itself goes wrong--when, for example, a judge's probable-cause determination is predicated solely on a police officer's false statements.  Then, too, a person is confined without constitutionally adequate justification.  Legal process has gone forward, but it has done nothing to satisfy the Fourth Amendment's probable-cause requirement.  And for that reason, it cannot extinguish the detainee's Fourth Amendment claim--or somehow, as the Seventh Circuit has held, convert that claim into one founded on the Due Process Clause.  See 590 Fed. Appx., at 643-644.  If the complaint is that a form of legal process resulted in pretrial detention unsupported by probable cause, then the right allegedly infringed lies in the Fourth Amendment.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For that reason, and contrary to the Seventh Circuit's view, Manuel stated a Fourth Amendment claim when he sought relief not merely for his (pre-legal-process) arrest, but also for his (post-legal-process) pretrial detention.7  Consider again the facts alleged in this case.  Police officers initially arrested Manuel without probable cause, based solely on his possession of pills that had field tested negative for an illegal substance.  So (putting timeliness issues aside) Manuel could bring a claim for wrongful arrest under the Fourth Amendment.  And the same is true (again, disregarding timeliness) as to a claim for wrongful detention--because Manuel's subsequent weeks in custody were also unsupported by probable cause, and so also constitutionally unreasonable.  No evidence of Manuel's criminality had come to light in between the roadside arrest and the County Court proceeding initiating legal process; to the contrary, yet another test of Man-uel's pills had come back negative in that period.  All that the judge had before him were police fabrications about the pills' content.  The judge's order holding Manuel for trial therefore lacked any proper basis.  And that means Manuel's ensuing pretrial detention, no less than his original arrest, violated his Fourth Amendment rights.  Or put just a bit differently: Legal process did not expunge Manuel's Fourth Amendment claim because the process he received failed to establish what that Amendment makes essential for pretrial detention--probable cause to believe he committed a crime.8\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our holding--that the Fourth Amendment governs a claim for unlawful pretrial detention even beyond the start of legal process--does not exhaust the disputed legal issues in this case.  It addresses only the threshold inquiry in a \u00a71983 suit, which requires courts to \"identify the specific constitutional right\" at issue.  Albright, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 271.  After pinpointing that right, courts still must determine the elements of, and rules associated with, an action seeking damages for its violation.  See, e.g., Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.\u00a0S. 247, 257-258 (1978).  Here, the parties particularly disagree over the accrual date of Manuel's Fourth Amendment claim--that is, the date on which the applicable two-year statute of limitations began to run.  The timeliness of Manuel's suit hinges on the choice between their proposed dates.  But with the following brief comments, we remand that issue to the court below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In defining the contours and prerequisites of a \u00a71983 claim, including its rule of accrual, courts are to look first to the common law of torts.  See ibid. (explaining that tort principles \"provide the appropriate starting point\" in specifying the conditions for recovery under \u00a71983); Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.\u00a0S. 384, 388-390 (2007) (same for accrual dates in particular).  Sometimes, that review of common law will lead a court to adopt wholesale the rules that would apply in a suit involving the most analogous tort.  See id., at 388-390; Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477, 483-487 (1994).  But not always.  Common-law principles are meant to guide rather than to control the definition of \u00a71983 claims, serving \"more as a source of inspired examples than of prefabricated components.\"  Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.\u00a0S. 250, 258 (2006); see Rehberg v. Paulk, 566 U.\u00a0S. 356, 366 (2012) (noting that \"\u00a71983 is [not] simply a federalized amalgamation of pre-existing common-law claims\").  In applying, selecting among, or adjusting common-law approaches, courts must closely attend to the values and purposes of the constitutional right at issue.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With these precepts as backdrop, Manuel and the City offer competing views about what accrual rule should govern a \u00a71983 suit challenging post-legal-process pretrial detention.  According to Manuel, that Fourth Amendment claim accrues only upon the dismissal of criminal charges--here, on May 4, 2011, less than two years before he brought his suit.  See Reply Brief 2; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24-25, n.\u00a016 (taking the same position).  Relying on this Court's caselaw, Manuel analogizes his claim to the common-law tort of malicious prosecution.  See Reply Brief 9; Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 389-390.  An element of that tort is the \"termination of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. proceeding in favor of the accused\"; and accordingly, the statute of limitations does not start to run until that termination takes place.  Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 484, 489.  Man-uel argues that following the same rule in suits like his will avoid \"conflicting resolutions\" in \u00a71983 litigation and criminal proceedings by \"preclud[ing] the possibility of the claimant succeeding in the tort action after having been convicted in the underlying criminal prosecution.\"  Id., at 484, 486; see Reply Brief 10-11; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 24-25, n.\u00a016.  In support of Manuel's position, all but two of the ten Courts of Appeals that have recognized a Fourth Amendment claim like his have incorporated a \"favorable termination\" element and so pegged the statute of limitations to the dismissal of the criminal case.  See n.\u00a04, supra.9  That means in the great majority of Circuits, Manuel's claim would be timely.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The City, however, contends that any such Fourth Amendment claim accrues (and the limitations period starts to run) on the date of the initiation of legal process--here, on March 18, 2011, more than two years before Manuel filed suit.  See Brief for Respondents 33.  According to the City, the most analogous tort to Manuel's constitutional claim is not malicious prosecution but false arrest, which accrues when legal process commences.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47; Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 389 (noting accrual rule for false arrest suits).  And even if malicious prosecution were the better comparison, the City continues, a court should decline to adopt that tort's favorable-termination element and associated accrual rule in adjudicating a \u00a71983 claim involving pretrial detention.  That element, the City argues, \"make[s] little sense\" in this context because \"the Fourth Amendment is concerned not with the outcome of a prosecution, but with the legality of searches and seizures.\"  Brief for Respondents 16.  And finally, the City contends that Manuel forfeited an alternative theory for treating his date of release as the date of accrual: to wit, that his pretrial detention \"constitute[d] a continuing Fourth Amendment violation,\" each day of which triggered the statute of limitations anew.  Id., at 29, and n.\u00a06; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 36; see also Albright, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 280 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (propounding a similar view).  So Manuel, the City concludes, lost the opportunity to recover for his pretrial detention by waiting too long to file suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We leave consideration of this dispute to the Court of Appeals.  \"[W]e are a court of review, not of first view.\"  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 718, n.\u00a07 (2005).  Because the Seventh Circuit wrongly held that Manuel lacked any Fourth Amendment claim once legal process began, the court never addressed the elements of, or rules applicable to, such a claim.  And in particular, the court never confronted the accrual issue that the parties contest here.10  On remand, the Court of Appeals should decide that question, unless it finds that the City has previously waived its timeliness argument.  See Reply to Brief in Opposition 1-2 (addressing the possibility of waiver); Tr. of Oral Arg. 40-44 (same).  And so too, the court may consider any other still-live issues relating to the contours of Manuel's Fourth Amendment claim for unlawful pretrial detention.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, we reverse the judgment of the Seventh Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 14-9496\nELIJAH MANUEL, PETITIONER v.

Justice Alito suggests that a claim for unreasonable seizure based on a warrantless arrest might not accrue until the \"first appearance\" under Illinois law (or the \"initial appearance\" under federal law)--which ordinarily represents the first judicial determination of probable cause for that kind of arrest--rather than at the time of the arrest.  See post, at 1, 9 (dissenting opinion); see also Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.\u00a0S. 384 (2007) (taking a similar approach).  Which of those events is the correct one for purposes of accrual makes no difference in this case, because both the arrest and the first appearance occurred more than two years before petitioner filed suit.  See ante, at 4; see also Wallace, supra, at 387 (petitioner's claim was untimely regardless of whether it accrued on day of arrest or first appearance).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would leave for another case (one where the question is dispositive) whether an unreasonable-seizure claim would accrue on the date of the first appearance if that appearance occurred on some day after the arrest.  I think the answer to that question might turn on the meaning of \"seizure,\" rather than on the presence or absence of any form of legal process.  See post, at 7-8 (describing the ordinary meaning of \"seizure\").\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 14-9496\nELIJAH MANUEL, PETITIONER v. CITY OF JOLIET, ILLINOIS, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit\n[March 21, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court's holding up to a point: The protection provided by the Fourth Amendment continues to apply after \"the start of legal process,\" ante, at 1, if legal process is understood to mean the issuance of an arrest warrant or what is called a \"first appearance\" under Illinois law and an \"initial appearance\" under federal law.  Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \u00a7\u00a75\/109-1(a), (e) (West Supp. 2015); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5.  But if the Court means more--specifically, that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as pretrial detention lasts--the Court stretches the concept of a seizure much too far.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What is perhaps most remarkable about the Court's approach is that it entirely ignores the question that we agreed to decide, i.e., whether a claim of malicious prosecution may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.  I would decide that question and hold that the Fourth Amendment cannot house any such claim.  If a malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the Constitution, it must find some other home, presumably the Due Process Clause.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question that was set out in Manuel's petition for a writ of certiorari and that we agreed to decide is as  follows:\n\"[W]hether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim based upon the Fourth Amendment.  This question was raised, but left unanswered, by this Court in Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.\u00a0S. 266 (1994).  Since then, the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and D.\u00a0C. Circuits have all held that a Fourth Amendment malicious prosecution claim is cognizable through 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 (\"Section 1983\").  Only the Seventh Circuit holds that a Fourth Amendment Section 1983 malicious prosecution claim is not cognizable.\"  Pet. for Cert. i (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question's reference to \"a malicious prosecution claim\" was surely no accident.  First, the conflict on the malicious prosecution question was the centerpiece of Manuel's argument in favor of certiorari.1  Second, unless Manuel is given the benefit of the unique accrual rule for malicious prosecution claims, his claim is untimely, and he is not entitled to relief.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would first consider what I take to be the core of the question presented--whether a \"malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.\"  See ibid.  Manuel asked us to decide that question because it may be critical to his ultimate success in this lawsuit.    Why is that so?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute of limitations for Manuel's claim is Illinois's general statute of limitations for personal-injury torts, see Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.\u00a0S. 384, 387 (2007), which requires suit to be brought within two years of the accrual of the claim, see Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 735, \u00a75\/13-202 (West 2010).  Here is the chronology of relevant events in this case:\nMarch 18, 2011: Manuel is arrested and brought before a county court judge, who makes the required probable-cause finding because Manuel was arrested without a warrant.\nMarch 31, 2011: Manuel is indicted by a grand jury.\nApril 8, 2011: Manuel is arraigned.\nMay 4, 2011: An assistant state's attorney moves to dismiss the charges, and the motion is granted.\nMay 5, 2011: Manuel is released from jail.\nApril 22, 2013: Manuel files his complaint.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the statute of limitations requires the commencement of suit within two years of accrual, Manuel's claim is untimely unless it accrued on or after April 22, 2011.  And the only events in the above chronology that occurred within that time frame are the dismissal of the charge against him and his release from custody.  A claim of malicious prosecution \"does not accrue until the criminal proceedings have terminated in the plaintiff's favor.\"  Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.\u00a0S. 477, 489 (1994); see 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7653 (1976).  None of the other common-law torts to which Manuel's claim might be compared--such as false arrest or false imprisonment--has such an accrual date.  See Wallace, supra, at 397 (holding that a claim for false imprisonment under the Fourth Amendment accrues when \"the claimant becomes detained pursuant to legal process\").  Therefore, if Manuel's case is to go forward, it is essential that his claim be treated like a malicious prosecution claim.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court refuses to decide whether Manuel's claim should be so treated, the answer to that question--the one that the Court actually agreed to review--is straightforward: A malicious prosecution claim cannot be based on the Fourth Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The first inquiry in any \u00a71983 suit,\" the Court has explained, is \"to isolate the precise constitutional violation with which [the defendant] is charged.\"  Baker v. McCollan, 443 U.\u00a0S. 137, 140 (1979).  In this case, Manuel charges that he was seized without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  In order to flesh out the elements of this constitutional tort, we must look for \"tort analogies.\" Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.\u00a0S. 261, 277 (1985).  Manuel says that the appropriate analog is the tort of malicious prosecution, so we should look to the elements of that tort.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 To make out a claim for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff generally must show three things: (1) \"that the criminal proceeding was initiated or continued by the defendant without 'probable cause,'\u00a0\" W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, P. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts 876 (5th ed. 1984) (Prosser and Keeton) (emphasis added), (2) \"that the defendant instituted the proceeding 'maliciously,'\u00a0\" id., at 882, and (3) that \"the proceedings have terminated in favor of the accused,\" 3 Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7653(b); see also Heck, supra, at 489.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a severe mismatch between these elements and the Fourth Amendment.  First, the defendants typically named in Fourth Amendment seizure cases--namely, law enforcement officers--lack the authority to initiate or dismiss a prosecution.  See Prosser and Keeton 876.  That authority lies in the hands of prosecutors.  A law enforcement officer, including the officer responsible for the defendant's arrest, may testify before a grand jury, at a preliminary examination, see Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \u00a7\u00a75\/109-3(b), 5\/109-3.1(b) (West 2010), or hearing, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5.1, and at trial.  But when that occurs, the officer is simply a witness and is not responsible for \"the decision to press criminal charges.\"  Rehberg v. Paulk, 566 U.\u00a0S. 356, 371 (2012).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, while subjective bad faith, i.e., malice, is the core element of a malicious prosecution claim, it is firmly established that the Fourth Amendment standard of reasonableness is fundamentally objective.  See Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. 731, 736 (2011).  These two standards--one subjective and the other objective--cannot co-exist.  In some instances, importing a malice requirement into the Fourth Amendment would leave culpable conduct unpunished.  An officer could act unreasonably, thereby violating the Fourth Amendment, without even a hint of bad faith.  In other cases, the malice requirement would cast too wide a net.  An officer could harbor intense personal ill will toward an arrestee but still act in an objectively reasonable manner in carrying out an arrest.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, malicious prosecution's favorable-termination element makes no sense when the claim is that a seizure violated the Fourth Amendment.  The Fourth Amendment, after all, prohibits all unreasonable seizures--regardless of whether a prosecution is ever brought or how a prosecution ends.  A \"Fourth Amendment wrong\" \"is fully accomplished,\" United States v. Calandra, 414 U.\u00a0S. 338, 354 (1974), when an impermissible seizure occurs.  The Amendment is violated and the injury is inflicted no matter what happens in any later proceedings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our cases concerning Fourth Amendment claims brought under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983 prove the point.  For example, we have recognized that there is no favorable-termination element for a Fourth Amendment false imprisonment claim.  See Wallace, 549 U.\u00a0S., at 389-392.2  An arrestee can file such a claim while his prosecution is pending--and, in at least some situations--will need to do so to ensure that the claim is not time barred.  See id., at 392-395.  By the same token, an individual may seek damages for pretrial Fourth Amendment violations even after a valid conviction.  For example, in Haring v. Prosise, 462 U.\u00a0S. 306, 308 (1983), the respondent pleaded guilty to a drug crime without raising any Fourth Amendment issues.  He then brought a \u00a71983 suit, challenging the constitutionality of the search that led to the discovery of the drugs on which his criminal charge was based.  The Court held that respondent's suit could proceed--despite his valid conviction.  Id., at 323; see also Heck, 512 U.\u00a0S., at 487, n. 7 (\"[A] suit for damages attributable to an allegedly unreasonable search may lie even if the challenged search produced evidence that was introduced in a state criminal trial resulting in the \u00a71983 plaintiff's still-outstanding conviction\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The favorable-termination element is similarly irrelevant to claims like Manuel's.  Manuel alleges that he was arrested and held based entirely on falsified evidence.  In such a case, it makes no difference whether the prosecution was eventually able to gather and introduce legitimate evidence and to obtain a conviction at trial.  The unlawful arrest and detention would still provide grounds for recovery.  Accordingly, there is no good reason why the accrual of a claim like Manuel's should have to await a favorable termination of the prosecution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all these reasons, malicious prosecution is a strikingly inapt \"tort analog[y],\" Wilson, 471 U.\u00a0S., at 277, for Fourth Amendment violations.  So the answer to the question presented in Manuel's certiorari petition is that the Fourth Amendment does not give rise to a malicious prosecution claim, and this means that Manuel's suit is untimely.  I would affirm the Seventh Circuit on that basis.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of deciding the question on which we granted review, the Court ventures in a different direction.  The Court purports to refrain from deciding any issue of timeliness, see ante, at 10, but the Court's opinion is certain to be read by some to mean that every moment of pretrial confinement without probable cause constitutes a violation of the Fourth Amendment.  And if that is so, it would seem to follow that new Fourth Amendment claims continue to accrue as long as the pretrial detention lasts. \nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That proposition--that every moment in pretrial  detention constitutes a \"seizure\"--is hard to square with the ordinary meaning of the term.  The term \"seizure\" applies most directly to the act of taking a person into custody or otherwise depriving the person of liberty.  It is not generally used to refer to a prolonged detention.  Dictionary definitions from around the time of the adoption of the Fourth Amendment define the term \"seizure\" as a single event--and not a continuing condition.  See, e.g., 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language 67 (1828) (Webster) (defining \"seizure\" as \"the act of laying hold on suddenly\"); 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (6th ed. 1785) (defining \"seizure\" as \"the act of taking forcible possession\"); 1 T. Dyche & W. Pardon, A New General English Dictionary (14th ed. 1771) (defining \"seize\" as \"to lay or take hold of violently or at unawares, wrongfully, or by force\").  As the Court has explained before, \"[f]rom the time of the founding to the present, the word 'seizure' has meant a 'taking possession.'\u00a0\"  California v. Hodari D., 499 U.\u00a0S. 621, 624 (1991) (quoting 2 Webster 67).  And we have cautioned against \"stretch[ing] the Fourth Amendment beyond its words and beyond the meaning of arrest.\"  499 U.\u00a0S., at 627.  The Members of Congress who proposed the Fourth Amendment and the State legislatures that ratified the Amendment would have expected to see a more expansive term, such as \"detention\" or \"confinement,\" if a Fourth Amendment seizure could be a long event that continued throughout the entirety of the pretrial period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, a period of detention spanning weeks or months cannot be viewed as one long, continuing seizure, and a pretrial detainee is not \"seized\" over and over again as long as he remains in custody.3  Of course, the damages resulting from an unlawful seizure may continue to mount during the period of confinement caused by the seizure, but no new Fourth Amendment seizure claims accrue after that date.4  Thus, any possible Fourth Amendment claim that Manuel could bring is time barred.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court is mistaken in saying that its decision \"follows from settled precedent.\"  Ante, at 1.  The Court reads Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.\u00a0S. 266 (1994), and Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.\u00a0S. 103 (1975), to mean that the Fourth Amendment can be violated \"when legal process itself goes wrong,\" ante, at 9, but the accuracy of that interpretation depends on the meaning of \"legal process.\"  The Court's reading is correct if by \"legal process\" the Court means a determination of probable cause at a first or initial appearance.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \u00a75\/109-1 (West Supp. 2015); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 5(b).  When an arrest warrant is obtained, the probable-cause determination is made at that time, and there is thus no need for a repeat determination at the first or initial appearance.  But when an arrest is made without a warrant, the arrestee, generally within 48 hours, must be brought before a judicial officer, County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U. S. 44, 56 (1991), who then completes the arrest process by making the same determination that would have been made as part of the warrant application process.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 725, \u00a7\u00a75\/109-1(a), (b); Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 4(a), 5(b).  Thus, this appearance is an integral part of the process of taking the arrestee into custody and easily falls within the meaning of the term \"seizure.\"  But other forms of \"legal process,\" for example, a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause at a preliminary examination or hearing, do not fit within the concept of a \"seizure,\" and the cases cited by the Court do not suggest otherwise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take Albright first.  A detective named Oliver procured a warrant for the arrest of Albright for distributing a \"look-alike\" substance.  See Albright v. Oliver, 975 F.\u00a02d 343, 344 (CA7 1992).  The warrant was based on information given to Oliver by the purchaser of the substance.  Ibid.  After learning of the warrant, Albright turned himself in, was booked, and was released on bond.  Ibid.  Oliver testified at what Illinois calls a preliminary examination and apparently related the information provided by the alleged purchaser.  Ibid.  The judge found probable cause, but the charges were later dismissed.  Ibid.  According to the Seventh Circuit, probable cause was sorely lacking, id., at 345, and Albright sued Oliver under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, claiming that Oliver had violated his substantive due process right not to be prosecuted without probable cause.  All that this Court held was that Albright's claim had to be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment, not substantive due process.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court now reads Albright to mean that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues \"after the start of 'legal process,\" but three forms of what might be termed \"legal process\" were issued in Albright: the arrest warrant, the order releasing him on bond after his first appearance, and the order holding him over for trial after the preliminary examination.  I agree that Albright's seizure did not end with the issuance of the warrant (that would be ridiculous since he had not even been arrested at that point) or the first appearance, see ante, at 8-9, and n. 6, but it is impossible to read anything more into the holding in Albright.  The terse plurality opinion joined by four Justices said no more; the opinion of Justice Scalia, who joined the plurality opinion, referred only to Albright's \"arrest,\" 510 U.\u00a0S., at 275 (concurring opinion); and Justices Kennedy and Thomas, who concurred in the judgment, did so only because Albright's \"allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment.\"  Id., at 281 (Kennedy, J., concurring in the judgment).  To read anything more into Albright is to adopt the position taken by just one Member of the plurality, see id., at 279 (Ginsburg, J., concurring) (seizure continues throughout the period of pretrial detention), and the two Justices in dissent, see id., at 307 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other precedent on which the Court relies, Gerstein, goes no further than Albright.  All that the Court held in Gerstein was that if there is no probable-cause finding by a neutral magistrate before an arrest, there must be one after the arrest.  420 U.\u00a0S., at 111-116.  The Court reasoned that \"the Fourth Amendment requires a judicial determination of probable cause as a prerequisite to extended restraint of liberty following arrest.\"  Id., at 114.  The Court said nothing about whether a claim for a seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment could accrue after an initial appearance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court thus is forced to rely on dicta--taken out of context--from Gerstein.  For example, the Court cites Gerstein's statement that \"[t]he Fourth Amendment was tailored explicitly for the criminal justice system,\" and that it \"always has been thought to define the 'process that is due' for seizures of person[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. in criminal cases, including the detention of suspects pending trial.\"  Id., at 125, n. 27.  This statement hardly shows that a Fourth Amendment seizure continues throughout a period of pretrial detention, and the Court does not mention the very next sentence in Gerstein--which suggests that the Fourth Amendment might govern \"only the first stage\" of a prosecution, eventually giving way to other protections that are also part of our \"elaborate system, unique in jurisprudence, designed to safeguard the rights of those accused of criminal conduct.\"  Ibid. (emphasis deleted).  In the end, Gerstein stands for the proposition that the Fourth Amendment requires a post-arrest probable cause finding by a neutral magistrate; it says nothing about whether the Fourth Amendment extends beyond that or any other \"legal process.\"\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A well-known medical maxim--\"first, do no harm\"--is a good rule of thumb for courts as well.  The Court's decision today violates that rule by avoiding the question presented in order to reach an unnecessary and tricky issue.  The resulting opinion will, I fear, inject much confusion into Fourth Amendment law.  And it has the potential to do much harm--by dramatically expanding Fourth Amendment liability under \u00a71983 in a way that does violence to the text of the Fourth Amendment.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Because we here review an order dismissing Manuel's suit, we accept as true all the factual allegations in his complaint.  See, e.g., Leatherman v. Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit, 507 U.\u00a0S. 163, 164 (1993).\nFootnote 2\u00a0Although not addressed in Manuel's complaint, the police department's alleged fabrications did not stop at this initial hearing on probable cause.  About two weeks later, on March 30, a grand jury indicted Manuel based on similar false evidence: testimony from one of the arresting officers that \"[t]he pills field tested positive\" for ecstasy.  App. 96 (grand jury minutes).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Manuel's allegation of unlawful detention concerns only the period after the onset of legal process--here meaning, again, after the County Court found probable cause that he had committed a crime.  See supra, at 3.  The police also held Manuel in custody for several hours between his warrantless arrest and his first appearance in court.  But throughout this litigation, Manuel has treated that short period as part and parcel of the initial unlawful arrest.  See, e.g., Reply Brief 1.\nFootnote 4\u00a0See also Singer v. Fulton County Sheriff, 63 F.\u00a03d 110, 114-118 (CA2 1995); McKenna v. Philadelphia, 582 F.\u00a03d 447, 461 (CA3 2009); Lambert v. Williams, 223 F.\u00a03d 257, 260-262 (CA4 2000); Castellano v. Fragozo, 352 F.\u00a03d 939, 953-954, 959-960 (CA5 2003) (en banc); Sykes v. Anderson, 625 F.\u00a03d 294, 308-309 (CA6 2010); Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.\u00a03d 1119, 1126-1127 (CA9 2002); Wilkins v. De- Reyes, 528 F.\u00a03d 790, 797-799 (CA10 2008); Whiting v. Traylor, 85 F.\u00a03d 581, 584-586 (CA11 1996); Pitt v. District of Columbia, 491 F.\u00a03d 494, 510-511 (CADC 2007).\nFootnote 5\u00a0The Court repeated the same idea in a follow-on decision to Gerstein.  In County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.\u00a0S. 44, 47 (1991), we considered how quickly a jurisdiction must provide the probable-cause determination that Gerstein demanded \"as a prerequisite to an extended pretrial detention.\"  In holding that the decision should occur within 48 hours of an arrest, the majority understood its \"task [as] articulat[ing] more clearly the boundaries of what is permissible under the Fourth Amendment.\"  500 U.\u00a0S., at 56.  In arguing for still greater speed, the principal dissent invoked the original meaning of \"the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of 'unreasonable seizures,' insofar as it applies to seizure of the person.\"  Id., at 60 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The difference between the two opinions was significant, but the commonality still more so: All Justices agreed that the Fourth Amendment provides the appropriate lens through which to view a claim involving pretrial detention.\nFootnote 6\u00a0The opposite view would suggest an untenable result: that a person arrested pursuant to a warrant could not bring a Fourth Amendment claim challenging the reasonableness of even his arrest, let alone any subsequent detention.  An arrest warrant, after all, is a way of initiating legal process, in which a magistrate finds probable cause that a person committed a crime.  See Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.\u00a0S. 384, 389 (2007) (explaining that the seizure of a person was \"without legal process\" because police officers \"did not have a warrant for his arrest\"); W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, & D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \u00a7119, pp. 871, 886 (5th ed. 1984) (similar).  If legal process is the cut-off point for the Fourth Amendment, then someone arrested (as well as later held) under a warrant procured through false testimony would have to look to the Due Process Clause for relief.  But that runs counter to our caselaw.  See, e.g., Whiteley v. Warden, Wyo. State Penitentiary, 401 U.\u00a0S. 560, 568-569 (1971) (holding that an arrest violated the Fourth Amendment because a magistrate's warrant was not backed by probable cause).  And if the Seventh Circuit would reply that arrest warrants are somehow different--that there is legal process and then again there is legal process--the next (and in our view unanswerable) question would be why.\nFootnote 7\u00a0Even the City no longer appears to contest that conclusion.  On multiple occasions during oral argument in this Court, the City agreed that \"a Fourth Amendment right .\u00a0.\u00a0. survive[d] the initiation of process\" at the hearing in which the county judge found probable cause and ordered detention.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; see id., at 33 (concurring with the statement that \"once [an] individual is brought .\u00a0.\u00a0. before a magistrate, and the magistrate using the same bad evidence says, stay here in jail .\u00a0.\u00a0. until we get to trial, that that period is a violation of the Fourth Amendment\"); id., at 51 (stating that a detainee has \"a Fourth Amendment claim\" if \"misstatements at [such a probable-cause hearing] led to ongoing pretrial seizure\").\nFootnote 8\u00a0The dissent goes some way toward claiming that a different kind of pretrial legal process--a grand jury indictment or preliminary examination--does expunge such a Fourth Amendment claim.  See post, at 9, n. 4 (opinion of Alito, J.) (raising but \"not decid[ing] that question\"); post, at 10 (suggesting an answer nonetheless).  The effect of that view would be to cut off Manuel's claim on the date of his grand jury indictment (March 30)--even though that indictment (like the County Court's probable-cause proceeding) was entirely based on false testi-mony and even though Manuel remained in detention for 36 days longer. See n.\u00a02, supra.  Or said otherwise--even though the legal process he received failed to establish the probable cause necessary for his continued confinement.  We can see no principled reason to draw that line.  Nothing in the nature of the legal proceeding establishing probable cause makes a difference for purposes of the Fourth Amendment: Whatever its precise form, if the proceeding is tainted--as here, by fabricated evidence--and the result is that probable cause is lacking, then the ensuing pretrial detention violates the confined person's Fourth Amendment rights, for all the reasons we have stated.  By contrast (and contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see post, at 9, n.\u00a03), once a trial has occurred, the Fourth Amendment drops out: A person challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support both a conviction and any ensuing incarceration does so under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.\u00a0S. 307, 318 (1979) (invalidating a conviction under the Due Process Clause when \"the record evidence could [not] reasonably support a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\"); Thompson v. Louisville, 362 U.\u00a0S. 199, 204 (1960) (striking a conviction under the same provision when \"the record [wa]s entirely lacking in evidence\" of guilt--such that it could not even establish probable cause).  Gerstein and Albright, as already suggested, both reflected and recognized that constitutional division of labor.  See supra, at 6-8.  In their words, the Framers \"drafted the Fourth Amendment\" to address \"the matter of pretrial deprivations of liberty,\" Albright, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 274 (emphasis added), and the Amendment thus provides \"standards and procedures\" for \"the detention of suspects pending trial,\" Gerstein, 420 U.\u00a0S., at 125, n.\u00a027 (emphasis added).\nFootnote 9\u00a0The two exceptions--the Ninth and D.\u00a0C. Circuits--have not yet weighed in on whether a Fourth Amendment claim like Manuel's includes a \"favorable termination\" element.\nFootnote 10\u00a0The dissent would have us address these questions anyway, on the ground that \"the conflict on the malicious prosecution question was the centerpiece of Manuel's argument in favor of certiorari.\"  Post, at 2.  But the decision below did not implicate a \"conflict on the malicious prosecution question\"--because the Seventh Circuit, in holding that detainees like Manuel could not bring a Fourth Amendment claim at all, never considered whether (and, if so, how) that claim should resemble the malicious prosecution tort.  Nor did Manuel's petition for certiorari suggest otherwise.  The principal part of his question presented--mirroring the one and only Circuit split involving the decision below--reads as follows: \"[W]hether an individual's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure continues beyond legal process.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  That is exactly the issue we have resolved.  The rest of Manuel's question did indeed express a view as to what would follow from an affirmative answer (\"so as to allow a malicious prosecution claim\").  Ibid.  (And as the dissent notes, the Seventh Circuit recounted that he made the same argument in that court.  See post, at 2, n.\u00a01.) But as to that secondary issue, we think (for all the reasons just stated) that Manuel jumped the gun.  See supra, at 11-14.  And contra the dissent, his doing so provides no warrant for our doing so too.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court defends this evasion on the ground that it is resolving \"the one and only Circuit split involving the decision below.\"  Ante, at 15, n.\u00a010.  That is flatly wrong.  As the Seventh Circuit acknowledged, its decision in this case and an earlier case on which the decision here relied, Newsome v. McCabe, 256 F.\u00a03d 747 (2001), conflict with decisions of other circuits holding that a malicious prosecution claim may be brought under the Fourth Amendment.  The decision below states: \"Manuel argues that we should reconsider our holding in Newsome and recognize a federal claim for malicious prosecution under the Fourth Amendment regardless of the available state remedy.  By his count, 10 other Circuits have recognized federal malicious-prosecution claims under the Fourth Amendment.\"  590 Fed. Appx. 641, 643 (2015).  The court refused to overrule Newsome and said that \"Manuel's argument is better left for the Supreme Court.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Manuel's petition for a writ of certiorari repeatedly made the same point.  See Pet. for Cert. 2 (\"The Seventh Circuit stands alone among circuits in not allowing a federal malicious prosecution claim grounded on the Fourth Amendment\"); id., at 10 (\"Ten Federal Circuits Correctly Hold That Malicious Prosecution is Actionable as a Fourth Amendment, Section 1983 Claim\"); ibid. (\"[E]ight circuits have held that malicious prosecution is cognizable through a Section 1983 Fourth Amendment claim\").  All of the decisions that are cited as being in conflict with the decision below involved malicious prosecution claims and are described as such.  See id., at 10-11. \nFootnote 2\u00a0In Wallace, the Court noted that \"[f]alse arrest and false imprisonment overlap\" and decided to \"refer to the two torts together as false imprisonment.\"  549 U.\u00a0S., at 388-389.\nFootnote 3\u00a0By the Court's logic, there is no apparent reason why even a judgment of conviction should cut off the accrual of new Fourth Amendment claims based on the use of fabricated evidence.  The Court writes that \"[n]othing in the nature of the legal proceeding establishing probable cause makes a difference for purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\"  Ante, at 11, n. 8.  \"[I]f the proceeding is tainted--as here, by fabricated evidence--and the result is that probable cause is lacking,\" the Court continues, \"then the ensuing pretrial detention violates the confined person's Fourth Amendment rights, for all the reasons we have stated.\"  Ibid.  Although the Court inserts the word \"pretrial\" in this sentence, its logic provides no reason for that limitation.  If a Fourth Amendment seizure continues as long as a person is detained, there is no reason why incarceration after conviction cannot be regarded as a continuing seizure.  The Court asserts that the Fourth Amendment \"drops out of the picture\" after trial, ibid., but it does not explain why this is so.  There are facilities that house both pretrial detainees and prisoners serving sentences.  If a detainee is transferred following conviction from the section for detainees to the section for prisoners, does the transfer render this person \"unseized\"?\nFootnote 4\u00a0There is authority for the proposition that a grand jury indictment or a determination of probable cause after an adversary proceeding may be an intervening cause that cuts off liability for an unlawful arrest.  See Wallace v. Kato, 494 U.\u00a0S. 384, 390 (2007); Prosser and Keeton 885.  I would not decide that question here.\n\n\n","46":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMARCUS DANTE REED  v.

The judgment is vacated, and the case is remanded to  the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for further consideration in light of the position asserted by the Acting Solicitor General in his brief for the United States filed on May 1, 2017.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Everyone agrees that Mr. Hicks was wrongly sentenced to a 20-year mandatory minimum sentence under a now-defunct statute.  True, Mr. Hicks didn't argue the point in the court of appeals.  But before us the government admits his sentence is plainly wrong as a matter of law, and it's simple enough to see the government is right.  Of course, to undo and revise a sentence under the plain error standard, a court must not only (1) discern an error, that error must (2) be plain, (3) affect the defendant's substantial rights, and (4) implicate the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.  United States v. Olano, 507 U.\u00a0S. 725, 732 (1993).  And while the government concedes the first two legal elements of the plain error test, it asks us to remand the case to the court of appeals for it to resolve the latter two questions in the first  instance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cannot think of a good reason to say no.  When this Court identifies a legal error, it routinely remands the case so the court of appeals may resolve whether the error was harmless in light of other proof in the case--and so decide if the judgment must be revised under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(a).  After identifying an unpreserved but plain legal error, this Court likewise routinely remands the case so the court of appeals may resolve whether the error affected the defendant's substantial rights and implicated the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings--and so (again) determine if the judgment must be revised, this time under Rule 52(b).  We remand in cases like these not only when we are certain that curing the error will yield a different outcome, but also in cases where we think there's a reasonable probability that will happen.  See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, 561 U.\u00a0S. 358, 414 (2010) (harmless error); Tapia v. United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. 319, 335 (2011) (plain error); United States v. Marcus, 560 U.\u00a0S. 258, 266-267 (2010) (plain error).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To know this much is to know what should be done in our current case.  A plain legal error infects this judgment--a man was wrongly sentenced to 20 years in prison under a defunct statute.  No doubt, too, there's a reasonable probability that cleansing this error will yield a different outcome.   Of course, Mr. Hicks's conviction won't be undone, but the sentencing component of the district court's judgment is likely to change, and change substantially.  For experience surely teaches that a defendant entitled to a sentence consistent with 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73553(a)'s parsimony provision, rather than pursuant to the rigors of a statutory mandatory minimum, will often receive a much lower sentence.  So there can be little doubt Mr. Hicks's substantial rights are, indeed, implicated.  Cf. Molina-Martinez v. United States, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016).  When it comes to the fourth prong of plain error review, it's clear Mr. Hicks also enjoys a reasonable probability of success.  For who wouldn't hold a rightly diminished view of our courts if we allowed individuals to linger longer in prison than the law requires only because we were unwilling to correct our own obvious mistakes?  Cf. United States v. Sabillon-Umana, 772 F.\u00a03d 1328, 1333 (CA10 2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now this Court has no obligation to rove about looking for errors to correct in every case in this large country, and I agree with much in Justice Scalia's dissent in Nunez v. United States, 554 U.\u00a0S. 911, 911-913 (2008), suggesting caution.  For example, it rightly counsels against vacating a judgment when we harbor doubts about a confession of error or when the confession bears the marks of gamesmanship.  Nor should we take the government's word for it and vacate a judgment when we cannot with ease determine the existence of an error of federal law.  Or when independent and untainted legal grounds appear to exist that would support the judgment anyway.  Or when lightly accepting a confession of error could lead to a circuit  conflict or interfere with the administration of state law.  No doubt other reasons too will often counsel against intervening.  But, respectfully, I am unaware of any such reason here.  Besides, if the only remaining objection to vacating the judgment here is that, despite our precedent routinely permitting the practice, we should be wary of remanding a case without first deciding for ourselves the latter elements of the plain error test, that task is so easily done that in this case that I cannot think why it should not be done.  Indeed, the lone peril in the present case seems to me the possibility that we might permit the government to deny someone his liberty longer than the law permits only because we refuse to correct an obvious judicial error.\n\nRoberts, C.

Hicks now seeks certiorari. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government's response is not to concede that the Fifth Circuit's judgment was wrong.

NATHANIEL SMITH(2017)\nNo. 16-992\nArgued: Decided: June 26, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this Court explained in Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), the Constitution entitles same-sex couples to civil marriage \"on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  In the decision below, the Arkansas Supreme Court considered the effect of that holding on the State's rules governing the issuance of birth certificates.  When a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate--regardless of his biological relationship to the child.  According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State.  Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples \"the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 17), we reverse the state court's judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petitioners here are two married same-sex couples who conceived children through anonymous sperm donation.  Leigh and Jana Jacobs were married in Iowa in 2010, and Terrah and Marisa Pavan were married in New Hampshire in 2011.  Leigh and Terrah each gave birth to a child in Arkansas in 2015.  When it came time to secure birth certificates for the newborns, each couple filled out paperwork listing both spouses as parents--Leigh and Jana in one case, Terrah and Marisa in the other.  Both times, however, the Arkansas Department of Health issued certificates bearing only the birth mother's name.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The department's decision rested on a provision of Arkansas law, Ark. Code \u00a720-18-401 (2014), that specifies which individuals will appear as parents on a child's state-issued birth certificate.  \"For the purposes of birth registration,\" that statute says, \"the mother is deemed to be the woman who gives birth to the child.\"  \u00a720-18-401(e).  And \"[i]f the mother was married at the time of either conception or birth,\" the statute instructs that \"the name of [her] husband shall be entered on the certificate as the father of the child.\"  \u00a720-18-401(f)(1).  There are some limited exceptions to the latter rule--for example, another man may appear on the birth certificate if the \"mother\" and \"husband\" and \"putative father\" all file affidavits vouching for the putative father's paternity.  Ibid.  But as all parties agree, the requirement that a married woman's husband appear on her child's birth certificate applies in cases where the couple conceived by means of artificial insemination with the help of an anonymous sperm donor.  See Pet. for Cert. 4; Brief in Opposition 3-4; see also Ark. Code \u00a79-10-201(a) (2015) (\"Any child born to a married woman by means of artificial insemination shall be deemed the legitimate natural child of the woman and the woman's husband if the husband consents in writing to the artificial insemination\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Jacobses and Pavans brought this suit in Arkansas state court against the director of the Arkansas Department of Health--seeking, among other things, a declaration that the State's birth-certificate law violates the Constitution.  The trial court agreed, holding that the relevant portions of \u00a720-18-401 are inconsistent with Obergefell because they \"categorically prohibi[t] every same-sex married couple .\u00a0.\u00a0. from enjoying the same spousal benefits which are available to every opposite-sex married couple.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a.  But a divided Arkansas Supreme Court reversed that judgment, concluding that the statute \"pass[es] constitutional muster.\"  2016 Ark. 437, 505 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 169, 177.  In that court's view, \"the statute centers on the relationship of the biological mother and the biological father to the child, not on the marital relationship of husband and wife,\" and so it \"does not run afoul of Obergefell.\"  Id., at 178.  Two justices dissented from that view, maintaining that under Obergefell \"a same-sex married couple is entitled to a birth certificate on the same basis as an opposite-sex married couple.\"  505 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 184 (Brill, C.\u00a0J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); accord, id., at 190 (Danielson, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Arkansas Supreme Court's decision, we conclude, denied married same-sex couples access to the \"constellation of benefits that the Stat[e] ha[s] linked to marriage.\"  Obergefell, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  As already explained, when a married woman in Arkansas conceives a child by means of artificial insemination, the State will--indeed, must--list the name of her male spouse on the child's birth certificate.  See \u00a720-18-401(f\u00a0)(1); see also \u00a79-10-201; supra, at 2.  And yet state law, as interpreted by the court below, allows Arkansas officials in those very same circumstances to omit a married woman's female spouse from her child's birth certificate.  See 505 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 177-178.  As a result, same-sex parents in Arkansas lack the same right as opposite-sex parents to be listed on a child's birth certificate, a document often used for important transactions like making medical decisions for a child or enrolling a child in school.  See Pet. for Cert. 5-7 (listing situations in which a parent might be required to present a child's birth certificate).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Obergefell proscribes such disparate treatment.  As we explained there, a State may not \"exclude same-sex couples from civil marriage on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.\"  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  Indeed, in listing those terms and conditions--the \"rights, benefits, and responsibilities\" to which same-sex couples, no less than opposite-sex couples, must have access--we expressly identified \"birth and death certificates.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  That was no accident: Several of the plaintiffs in Obergefell challenged a State's refusal to recognize their same-sex spouses on their children's birth certificates.  See DeBoer v. Snyder, 772 F.\u00a03d 388, 398-399 (CA6 2014).  In considering those challenges, we held the relevant state laws unconstitutional to the extent they treated same-sex couples differently from opposite-sex couples.  See 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  That holding applies with equal force to \u00a720-18-401.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Echoing the court below, the State defends its birth-certificate law on the ground that being named on a child's birth certificate is not a benefit that attends marriage.  Instead, the State insists, a birth certificate is simply a device for recording biological parentage--regardless of whether the child's parents are married.  But Arkansas law makes birth certificates about more than just genetics.  As already discussed, when an opposite-sex couple conceives a child by way of anonymous sperm donation--just as the petitioners did here--state law requires the placement of the birth mother's husband on the child's birth certificate.  See supra, at 2.  And that is so even though (as the State concedes) the husband \"is definitively not the biological father\" in those circumstances.  Brief in Opposition 4.*  Arkansas has thus chosen to make its birth certificates more than a mere marker of biological relationships: The State uses those certificates to give married parents a form of legal recognition that is not available to unmarried parents.  Having made that choice, Arkansas may not, consistent with Obergefell, deny married same-sex couples that recognition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari and the pending motions for leave to file briefs as amici curiae are granted.  The judgment of the Arkansas Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is so ordered.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nMARISA N.

Hansen, 450 U.\u00a0S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Respectfully, I don't believe this case meets that standard.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, Obergefell addressed the question whether a State must recognize same-sex marriages.  But nothing in Obergefell spoke (let alone clearly) to the question whether \u00a720-18-401 of the Arkansas Code, or a state supreme court decision upholding it, must go.  The statute in question establishes a set of rules designed to ensure that the biological parents of a child are listed on the child's birth certificate.  Before the state supreme court, the State argued that rational reasons exist for a biology based birth registration regime, reasons that in no way offend Obergefell--like ensuring government officials can identify public health trends and helping individuals determine their biological lineage, citizenship, or susceptibility to genetic disorders.  In an opinion that did not in any way seek to defy but rather earnestly engage Obergefell, the state supreme court agreed.  And it is very hard to see what is wrong with this conclusion for, just as the state court recognized, nothing in Obergefell indicates that a birth registration regime based on biology, one no doubt with many analogues across the country and throughout history, offends the Constitution.  To the contrary, to the extent they speak to the question at all, this Court's precedents suggest just the opposite conclusion.  See, e.g., Michael H. v. Gerald D., 491 U.\u00a0S. 110, 124-125 (1989); Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.\u00a0S. 53, 73 (2001).  Neither does anything in today's opinion purport to identify any constitutional problem with a biology based birth registration regime.  So whatever else we might do with this case, summary reversal would not exactly seem the obvious course.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What, then, is at work here?  If there isn't a problem with a biology based birth registration regime, perhaps the concern lies in this particular regime's exceptions.  For it turns out that Arkansas's general rule of registration based on biology does admit of certain more specific exceptions.  Most importantly for our purposes, the State acknowledges that \u00a79-10-201 of the Arkansas Code controls how birth certificates are completed in cases of artificial insemination like the one before us.  The State acknowledges, too, that this provision, written some time ago, indicates that the mother's husband generally shall be treated as the father--and in this way seemingly anticipates only opposite-sex marital unions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But if the artificial insemination statute is the concern, it's still hard to see how summary reversal should follow for at least a few reasons.  First, petitioners didn't actually challenge \u00a79-10-201 in their lawsuit.  Instead, petitioners sought and the trial court granted relief eliminating the State's authority under \u00a720-18-401 to enforce a birth registration regime generally based on biology.  On appeal, the state supreme court simply held that this overbroad remedy wasn't commanded by Obergefell or the Constitution.  And, again, nothing in today's opinion for the Court identifies anything wrong, let alone clearly wrong, in that conclusion.  Second, though petitioners' lawsuit didn't challenge \u00a79-10-201, the State has repeatedly conceded that the benefits afforded nonbiological parents under \u00a79-10-201 must be afforded equally to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples.  So that in this particular case and all others of its kind, the State agrees, the female spouse of the birth mother must be listed on birth certificates too.  Third, further proof still of the state of the law in Arkansas today is the fact that, when it comes to adoption (a situation not present in this case but another one in which Arkansas departs from biology based registration), the State tells us that adopting parents are eligible for placement on birth certificates without respect to sexual orientation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given all this, it seems far from clear what here warrants the strong medicine of summary reversal.  Indeed, it is not even clear what the Court expects to happen on remand that hasn't happened already.  The Court does not offer any remedial suggestion, and none leaps to mind.  Perhaps the state supreme court could memorialize the State's concession on \u00a79-10-201, even though that law wasn't fairly challenged and such a chore is hardly the usual reward for seeking faithfully to apply, not evade, this Court's mandates.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\n\nMARISA N. PAVAN, et\u00a0al. v. NATHANIEL SMITH\non petition for writ of certiorari to the supreme court of arkansas\nNo. 16-992.\u2003Decided June 26, 2017\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this Court explained in Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), the Constitution entitles same-sex couples to civil marriage \"on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 23).  In the decision below, the Arkansas Supreme Court considered the effect of that holding on the State's rules governing the issuance of birth certificates.  When a married woman gives birth in Arkansas, state law generally requires the name of the mother's male spouse to appear on the child's birth certificate--regardless of his biological relationship to the child.  According to the court below, however, Arkansas need not extend that rule to similarly situated same-sex couples: The State need not, in other words, issue birth certificates including the female spouses of women who give birth in the State.  Because that differential treatment infringes Obergefell's commitment to provide same-sex couples \"the constellation of benefits that the States have linked to marriage,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 17), we reverse the state court's judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petitioners here are two married same-sex couples who conceived children through anonymous sperm donation.  Leigh and Jana Jacobs were married in Iowa in 2010, and Terrah and Marisa Pavan were married in New Hampshire in 2011.  Leigh and Terrah each gave birth to a child in Arkansas in 2015.  When it came time to secure birth certificates for the newborns, each couple filled out paperwork listing both spouses as parents--Leigh and Jana in one case, Terrah and Marisa in the other.  Both times, however, the Arkansas Department of Health issued certificates bearing only the birth mother's name.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The department's decision rested on a provision of Arkansas law, Ark. Code \u00a720-18-401 (2014), that specifies which individuals will appear as parents on a child's state-issued birth certificate.  \"For the purposes of birth registration,\" that statute says, \"the mother is deemed to be the woman who gives birth to the child.\"  \u00a720-18-401(e).  And \"[i]f the mother was married at the time of either conception or birth,\" the statute instructs that \"the name of [her] husband shall be entered on the certificate as the father of the child.\"  \u00a720-18-401(f)(1).  There are some limited exceptions to the latter rule--for example, another man may appear on the birth certificate if the \"mother\" and \"husband\" and \"putative father\" all file affidavits vouching for the putative father's paternity.  Ibid.  But as all parties agree, the requirement that a married woman's husband appear on her child's birth certificate applies in cases where the couple conceived by means of artificial insemination with the help of an anonymous sperm donor.  See Pet. for Cert. 4; Brief in Opposition 3-4; see also Ark. Code \u00a79-10-201(a) (2015) (\"Any child born to a married woman by means of artificial insemination shall be deemed the legitimate natural child of the woman and the woman's husband if the husband consents in writing to the artificial insemination\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Jacobses and Pavans brought this suit in Arkansas state court against the director of the Arkansas Department of Health--seeking, among other things, a declaration that the State's birth-certificate law violates the Constitution.  The trial court agreed, holding that the relevant portions of \u00a720-18-401 are inconsistent with Obergefell because they \"categorically prohibi[t] every same-sex married couple .\u00a0.\u00a0. from enjoying the same spousal benefits which are available to every opposite-sex married couple.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 59a.  But a divided Arkansas Supreme Court reversed that judgment, concluding that the statute \"pass[es] constitutional muster.\"  2016 Ark. 437, 505 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 169, 177.

UNITED STATES(2017)\nNo. 16-309\nArgued: April 26, 2017Decided: June 22, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Divna Maslenjak is an ethnic Serb who resided in Bosnia during the 1990's, when a civil war divided the new country.  In 1998, she and her family sought refugee status in the United States.  Interviewed under oath, Maslenjak explained that the family feared persecution from both sides of the national rift: Muslims would mistreat them because of their ethnicity, and Serbs would abuse them because Maslenjak's husband had evaded service in the Bosnian Serb Army by absconding to Serbia.  Persuaded of the Maslenjaks' plight, American officials granted them refugee status.  Years later, Maslenjak applied for U.\u00a0S. citizenship.  In the application process, she swore that she had never given false information to a government official while applying for an immigration benefit or lied to an official to gain entry into the United States.  She was naturalized as a U.\u00a0S. citizen.  But it soon emerged that her professions of honesty were false: Maslenjak had known all along that her husband spent the war years not secreted in Serbia, but serving as an officer in the Bosnian Serb Army.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government charged Maslenjak with knowingly \"procur[ing], contrary to law, [her] naturalization,\" in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71425(a).  According to the Government's theory, Maslenjak violated \u00a71425(a) because, in the course of procuring her naturalization, she broke another law: 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71015(a), which prohibits knowingly making a false statement under oath in a naturalization proceeding.  The District Court instructed the jury that, to secure a conviction under \u00a71425(a), the Government need not prove that Maslenjak's false statements were material to, or influenced, the decision to approve her citizenship application.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction, holding that if Maslenjak made false statements violating \u00a71015(a) and procured naturalization, then she also violated \u00a71425(a).\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The text of \u00a71425(a) makes clear that, to secure a conviction, the Government must establish that the defendant's illegal act played a role in her acquisition of citizenship.  To \"procure .\u00a0.\u00a0. naturalization\" means to obtain it.  And the adverbial phrase \"contrary to law\" specifies how a person must procure naturalization so as to run afoul of the statute: illegally.  Thus, someone \"procure[s], contrary to law, naturalization\" when she obtains citizenship illegally.  As ordinary usage demonstrates, the most natural understanding of that phrase is that the illegal act must have somehow contributed to the obtaining of citizenship.  To get citizenship unlawfully is to get it through an unlawful means--and that is just to say that an illegality played some role in its acquisition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government's contrary view--that \u00a71425(a) requires only a violation in the course of procuring naturalization--falters on the way language naturally works.  Suppose that an applicant for citizenship fills out the paperwork in a government office with a knife tucked away in her handbag.  She has violated the law against possessing a weapon in a federal building, and she has done so in the course of procuring citizenship, but nobody would say she has \"procure[d]\" her citizenship \"contrary to law.\"  That is because the violation of law and the acquisition of citizenship in that example are merely coincidental: The one has no causal relation to the other.  Although the Government attempts to define such examples out of the statute, that effort falls short for multiple reasons.  Most important, the Government's attempted carve-out does nothing to alter the linguistic understanding that gives force to the examples the Government would exclude. Under ordinary rules of language usage, \u00a71425(a) demands a causal or means-end connection between a legal violation and naturalization.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The broader statutory context reinforces the point, because the Government's reading would create a profound mismatch between the requirements for naturalization and those for denaturalization: Some legal violations that do not justify denying citizenship would nonetheless justify revoking it later.  For example, lies told out of \"embarrassment, fear, or a desire for privacy\" (rather than \"for the purpose of obtaining [immigration] benefits\") are not generally disqualifying under the statutory requirement of \"good moral character.\"  Kungys v. United States, 485 U.\u00a0S. 759, 780; 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(f)(6).  But under the Government's reading of \u00a71425(a), any lie told in the naturalization process would provide a basis for rescinding citizenship.  The Government could thus take away on one day what it was required to give the day before.  And by so unmooring the revocation of citizenship from its award, the Government opens the door to a world of disquieting consequences--which this Court would need far stronger textual support to believe Congress intended.  The statute Congress passed, most naturally read, strips a person of citizenship not when she committed any illegal act during the naturalization process, but only when that act played some role in her naturalization.  Pp.\u00a04-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0When the underlying illegality alleged in a \u00a71425(a) prosecution is a false statement to government officials, a jury must decide whether the false statement so altered the naturalization process as to have influenced an award of citizenship.  Because the entire naturalization process is set up to provide little room for subjective preferences or personal whims, that inquiry is properly framed in objective terms: To decide whether a defendant acquired citizenship by means of a lie, a jury must evaluate how knowledge of the real facts would have affected a reasonable government official properly applying naturalization law.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the facts the defendant misrepresented are themselves legally disqualifying for citizenship, the jury can make quick work of that inquiry.  In such a case, the defendant's lie must have played a role in her naturalization. But that is not the only time a jury can find that a defendant's lies had the requisite bearing on a naturalization decision, because lies can also throw investigators off a trail leading to disqualifying facts.  When relying on such an investigation-based theory, the Government must make a two-part showing.  Initially, the Government must prove that the misrepresented fact was sufficiently relevant to a naturalization criterion that it would have prompted reasonable officials, \"seeking only evidence concerning citizenship qualifications,\" to undertake further investigation.  Kungys, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 774, n.\u00a09.  If that much is true, the inquiry turns to the prospect that such an investigation would have borne disqualifying fruit.  The Government need not show definitively that its investigation would have unearthed a disqualifying fact.  It need only establish that the investigation \"would predictably have disclosed\" some legal disqualification.  Id., at 774.  If that is so, the defendant's misrepresentation contributed to the citizenship award in the way \u00a71425(a) requires.  This demanding but still practicable causal standard reflects the real-world attributes of cases premised on what an unhindered investigation would have found.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Government can make its two-part showing, the defendant may overcome it by establishing that she was qualified for citizenship (even though she misrepresented facts that suggested the opposite).  Thus, whatever the Government shows with respect to a thwarted investigation, qualification for citizenship is a complete defense to a prosecution under \u00a71425(a).  Pp.\u00a010-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. Measured against this analysis, the jury instructions in this case were in error.  The jury needed to find more than an unlawful false statement.  However, it was not asked to--and so did not--make any of the necessary determinations.  The Government's assertion that any instructional error was harmless is left for resolution on remand.  Pp.\u00a015-16.\n821 F.\u00a03d 675, vacated and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kagan, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\u00a0J., and Kennedy, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Sotomayor, JJ., joined.

See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71451(e).  In this case, we consider what the Government must prove to obtain such a conviction.  We hold that the Government must establish that an illegal act by the defendant played some role in her acquisition of citizenship.  When the illegal act is a false statement, that means demonstrating that the defendant lied about facts that would have mattered to an immigration official, because they would have justified denying naturalization or would predictably have led to other facts warranting that result.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Divna Maslenjak is an ethnic Serb who resided in Bosnia during the 1990's, when a civil war between Serbs and Muslims divided the new country.  In 1998, she and her family (her husband Ratko Maslenjak and their two children) met with an American immigration official to seek refugee status in the United States.  Interviewed under oath, Maslenjak explained that the family feared persecution in Bosnia from both sides of the national rift.  Muslims, she said, would mistreat them because of their ethnicity.  And Serbs, she testified, would abuse them because her husband had evaded service in the Bosnian Serb Army by absconding to Serbia--where he remained hidden, apart from the family, for some five years.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 58a-60a.  Persuaded of the Maslenjaks' plight, American officials granted them refugee status, and they immigrated to the United States in 2000.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Six years later, Maslenjak applied for naturalization.  Question 23 on the application form asked whether she had ever given \"false or misleading information\" to a government official while applying for an immigration benefit; question 24 similarly asked whether she had ever \"lied to a[\u00a0] government official to gain entry or admission into the United States.\"  Id., at 72a.  Maslenjak answered \"no\" to both questions, while swearing under oath that her replies were true.  Id., at 72a, 74a.  She also swore that all her written answers were true during a subsequent interview with an immigration official.  In August 2007, Maslenjak was naturalized as a U.\u00a0S. citizen.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But Maslenjak's professions of honesty were false: In fact, she had made up much of the story she told to immigration officials when seeking refuge in this country.  Her fiction began to unravel at around the same time she applied for citizenship.  In 2006, immigration officials confronted Maslenjak's husband Ratko with records showing that he had not fled conscription during the Bosnian civil war; rather, he had served as an officer in the Bosnian Serb Army.  And not only that: He had served in a brigade that participated in the Srebrenica massacre--a slaughter of some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim civilians.  Within a year, the Government convicted Ratko on charges of making false statements on immigration documents.  The newly naturalized Maslenjak attempted to prevent Ratko's deportation.  During proceedings on that matter, Maslenjak admitted she had known all along that Ratko spent the war years not secreted in Serbia but fighting in  Bosnia.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As a result, the Government charged Maslenjak with knowingly \"procur[ing], contrary to law, [her] naturalization,\" in violation of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71425(a).  According to the Government's theory, Maslenjak violated \u00a71425(a) because, in the course of procuring her naturalization, she broke another law: 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71015(a), which prohibits knowingly making a false statement under oath in a naturalization proceeding.  The false statements the Government invoked were Maslenjak's answers to questions 23 and 24 on the citizenship application (stating that she had not lied in seeking refugee status) and her corresponding statements in the citizenship interview.  Those statements, the Government argued to the District Court, need not have affected the naturalization decision to support a conviction under \u00a71425(a).  The court agreed: Over Maslenjak's objection, it instructed the jury that a conviction was proper so long as the Government \"prove[d] that one of the defendant's statements was false\"--even if the statement was not \"material\" and \"did not influence the decision to approve [her] naturalization.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a.  The jury returned a guilty verdict; and the District Court, based on that finding, stripped Maslenjak of her citizenship.  See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71451(e).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the conviction.  As relevant here, the Sixth Circuit upheld the District Court's instructions that Maslenjak's false statements need not have influenced the naturalization decision.  If, the Court of Appeals held, Maslenjak made false statements violating \u00a71015(a) and she procured naturalization, then she also violated \u00a71425(a)--irrespective of whether the false statements played any role in her obtaining citizenship.  See 821 F.\u00a03d 675, 685-686 (2016).  That decision created a conflict in the Circuit Courts.1  We granted certiorari to resolve it, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), and we now vacate the Sixth Circuit's judgment.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1425(a), the parties agree, makes it a crime to commit some other illegal act in connection with naturalization.  But the parties dispute the nature of the required connection.  Maslenjak argues that the relationship must be \"causal\" in kind: A person \"procures\" her naturalization \"contrary to law,\" she contends, only if a predicate crime in some way \"contribut[ed]\" to her gaining citizenship.  Brief for Petitioner 21.  By contrast, the Government proposes a basically chronological link: Section 1425(a), it urges, \"punishes the commission of other violations of law in the course of procuring naturalization\"--even if the illegality could not have had any effect on the naturalization decision.  Brief for United States 14 (emphasis added).  We conclude that Maslenjak has the better of this argument.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We begin, as usual, with the statutory text.  In ordinary usage, \"to procure\" something is \"to get possession of\" it.  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1809 (2002); accord, Black's Law Dictionary 1401 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"procure\" as \"[t]o obtain (something), esp. by special effort or means\").  So to \"procure .\u00a0.\u00a0. naturalization\" means to obtain naturalization (or, to use another word, citizenship).  The adverbial phrase \"contrary to law,\" wedged in between \"procure\" and \"naturalization,\" then specifies how a person must procure naturalization so as to run afoul of the statute: in contravention of the law--or, in a word, illegally.  Putting the pieces together, someone \"procure[s], contrary to law, naturalization\" when she obtains citizenship illegally.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What, then, does that whole phrase mean?  The most natural understanding is that the illegal act must have somehow contributed to the obtaining of citizenship.  Consider if someone said to you: \"John obtained that painting illegally.\"  You might imagine that he stole it off the walls of a museum.  Or that he paid for it with a forged check.  Or that he impersonated the true buyer when the auction house delivered it.  But in all events, you would imagine illegal acts in some kind of means-end relation--or otherwise said, in some kind of causal relation--to the painting's acquisition.  If someone said to you, \"John obtained that painting illegally, but his unlawful acts did not play any role in his obtaining it,\" you would not have a clue what the statement meant.  You would think it nonsense--or perhaps the opening of a riddle.  That is because if no illegal act contributed at all to getting the painting, then the painting would not have been gotten illegally.  And the same goes for naturalization.  If whatever illegal conduct occurring within the naturalization process was a causal dead-end--if, so to speak, the ripples from that act could not have reached the decision to award citizenship--then the act cannot support a charge that the applicant obtained naturalization illegally.  The conduct, though itself illegal, would not also make the obtaining of citizenship so.  To get citizenship unlawfully, we understand, is to get it through an unlawful means--and that is just to say that an illegality played some role in its acquisition.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government's contrary view--that \u00a71425(a) requires only a \"violation[\u00a0] of law in the course of procuring naturalization\"--falters on the way language naturally works.  Brief for United States 14.  Return for a moment to our artwork example.  Imagine this time that John made an illegal turn while driving to the auction house to purchase a painting.  Would you say that he had \"procured the painting illegally\" because he happened to violate the law in the course of obtaining it?  Not likely.  And again, the same is true with respect to naturalization.  Suppose that an applicant for citizenship fills out the necessary paperwork in a government office with a knife tucked away in her handbag (but never mentioned or used).  She has violated the law--specifically, a statute criminalizing the possession of a weapon in a federal building.  See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7930.  And she has surely done so \"in the course of\" procuring citizenship.  But would you say, using English as you ordinarily would, that she has \"procure[d]\" her citizenship \"contrary to law\" (or, as you would really speak, \"illegally\")?  Once again, no.  That is because the violation of law and the acquisition of citizenship are in that example merely coincidental: The one has no causal relation to the other.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government responds to such examples by seeking to define them out of the statute, but that effort falls short for multiple reasons.  According to the Government, the laws to which \u00a71425(a) speaks are only laws \"pertaining to naturalization.\"  Brief for United States 20.  But to begin with, that claim fails on its own terms.  The Government's proposed limitation has no basis in \u00a71425(a)'s text (which refers to \"law\" generally); it is a deus ex machina--rationalized only by calling it \"necessary,\" Tr. of Oral Arg. 39, and serving only to get the Government out of a tight interpretive spot.  Indeed, the Government does not really buy its own argument: At another point, it asserts that an applicant for citizenship can violate \u00a71425(a) by bribing a government official, see Brief for United States 16--even though the law against that conduct has nothing in particular to do with naturalization.  See 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201(b)(1).  And still more important, the Government's (sometime) carve-out does nothing to alter the linguistic understanding that gives force to the examples the Government would exclude--and that applies just as well to every application that would remain.  Laws pertaining to naturalization, in other words, are subject to the same rules of language usage as laws concerning other subjects.  And under those rules, as we have shown, \u00a71425(a) demands a means-end connection between a legal violation and naturalization.  See supra, at 5-6.  Take \u00a71015(a)'s bar on making false statements in connection with naturalization--the prototypical \u00a71425(a) predicate, and the one at issue here.  If such a statement (in an interview, say) has no bearing at all on the decision to award citizenship, then it cannot render that award--as \u00a71425(a) requires--illegally gained.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The broader statutory context reinforces that point, because the Government's reading would create a profound mismatch between the requirements for naturalization on the one hand and those for denaturalization on the other.  See West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.\u00a0S. 83, 101 (1991) (\"[I]t is our role to make sense rather than nonsense out of the corpus juris\").  The immigration statute requires all applicants for citizenship to have \"good moral character,\" and largely defines that term through a list of unlawful or unethical behaviors. 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71427(a)(3), 1101(f\u00a0).3  On the Government's theory, some legal violations that do not justify denying citizenship under that definition would nonetheless justify revoking it later.  Again, false statements under \u00a71015(a) offer an apt illustration.  The statute's description of \"good moral character\" singles out a specific class of lies--\"false testimony for the purpose of obtaining [immigration] benefits\"--as a reason to deny naturalization.  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(f\u00a0)(6).  By contrast, \"[w]illful misrepresentations made for other reasons, such as embarrassment, fear, or a desire for privacy, were not deemed sufficiently culpable to brand the applicant as someone who lacks good moral character\"--and so are not generally disqualifying.  Kungys v. United States, 485 U.\u00a0S. 759, 780 (1988) (quoting Supplemental Brief for United States 12).  But under the Government's reading of \u00a71425(a), a lie told in the naturalization process--even out of embarrassment, fear, or a desire for privacy--would always provide a basis for rescinding citizenship.  The Government could thus take away on one day what it was required to give the day before.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And by so wholly unmooring the revocation of citizenship from its award, the Government opens the door to a world of disquieting consequences--which we would need far stronger textual support to believe Congress intended.  Consider the kinds of questions a person seeking citizenship confronts on the standard application form.  Says one: \"Have you EVER been .\u00a0.\u00a0. in any way associated with[\u00a0] any organization, association, fund, foundation, party, club, society, or similar group[?]\"  Form N-400, Application for Naturalization 12 (2016), online at http:\/\/www. uscis.gov\/n-400 (as last visited June 20, 2017) (bold in original).  Asks another: \"Have you EVER committed .\u00a0.\u00a0. a crime or offense for which you were NOT arrested?\"  Id., at 14.  Suppose, for reasons of embarrassment or what-have-you, a person concealed her membership in an online support group or failed to disclose a prior speeding violation.  Under the Government's view, a prosecutor could scour her paperwork and bring a \u00a71425(a) charge on that meager basis, even many years after she became a citizen.  That would give prosecutors nearly limitless leverage--and afford newly naturalized Americans precious little security.  Small wonder that Congress, in enacting \u00a71425(a), did not go so far as the Government claims.  The statute it passed, most naturally read, strips a person of citizenship not when she committed any illegal act during the naturalization process, but only when that act played some role in her naturalization.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That conclusion leaves us with a more operational question: How should \u00a71425(a)'s requirement of causal influence apply in practice, when charges are brought under that law?4  Because the proper analysis may vary with the nature of the predicate crime, we confine our discussion of that issue to the kind of underlying illegality alleged here: a false statement made to government officials.  Such conduct can affect a naturalization decision in a single, significant way--by distorting the Government's understanding of the facts when it investigates, and then adjudicates, an application.  So the issue a jury must decide in a case like this one is whether a false statement sufficiently altered those processes as to have influenced an award  of citizenship.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer to that question, like the naturalization decision itself, turns on objective legal criteria.  Congress has prescribed specific eligibility standards for new citizens, respecting such matters as length of residency and \"physical[\u00a0] presen[ce],\" understanding of English and American government, and (as previously mentioned) \"good moral character,\" with all its many specific components.  See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71423(a), 1427(a); supra, at 8.  Government officials are obligated to apply that body of law faithfully--granting naturalization when the applicable criteria are satisfied, and denying it when they are not.  See Kungys, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 774, n.\u00a09 (opinion of Scalia, J.); id., at 787 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  And to ensure right results are reached, a court can reverse such a determination, at an applicant's request, based on its \"own findings of fact and conclusions of law.\"  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71421(c).  The entire system, in other words, is set up to provide little or no room for subjective preferences or personal whims.  Because that is so, the question of what any individual decisionmaker might have done with accurate information is beside the point: The defendant in a \u00a71425(a) case should neither benefit nor suffer from a wayward official's deviations from legal requirements.  Accordingly, the proper causal inquiry under \u00a71425(a) is framed in objective terms: To decide whether a defendant acquired citizenship by means of a lie, a jury must evaluate how knowledge of the real facts would have affected a reasonable government official properly applying naturalization law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the facts the defendant misrepresented are themselves disqualifying, the jury can make quick work of that inquiry.  In such a case, there is an obvious causal link between the defendant's lie and her procurement of citizenship.  To take an example: An applicant for citizenship must be physically present in the United States for more than half of the five-year period preceding her application.  See 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71427(a)(1).  Suppose a defendant misrepresented her travel history to convey she had met that requirement, when in fact she had not.  The Government need only expose that lie to establish that she obtained naturalization illegally--for had she told the truth instead, the official would have promptly denied her application.  Or consider another, perhaps more common case stemming from the \"good moral character\" criterion.  See \u00a71427(a)(3); supra, at 8.  That phrase is defined to exclude any person who has been convicted of an aggravated felony.  See \u00a71101(f\u00a0)(8).  If a defendant falsely denied such a conviction, she too would have gotten her citizenship by means of a lie--for otherwise the outcome would have been different.  In short, when the defendant misrepresents facts that the law deems incompatible with citizenship, her lie must have played a role in her naturalization.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that is not the only time a jury can find that a defendant's lie had the requisite bearing on a naturalization decision.  For even if the true facts lying behind a false statement would not \"in and of themselves justify denial of citizenship,\" they could have \"led to the discovery of other facts which would\" do so.  Chaunt v. United States, 364 U.\u00a0S. 350, 352-353 (1960).  We previously addressed that possibility when considering the civil statute that authorizes the Government to revoke naturalization.  See Kungys, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 774-777 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (interpreting 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71451(a)).5  As we explained in that context, a person whose lies throw investigators off a trail leading to disqualifying facts gets her citizenship by means of those lies--no less than if she had denied the damning facts at the very end of the trail.  See ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When relying on such an investigation-based theory, the Government must make a two-part showing to meet its burden.  As an initial matter, the Government has to prove that the misrepresented fact was sufficiently relevant to one or another naturalization criterion that it would have prompted reasonable officials, \"seeking only evidence concerning citizenship qualifications,\" to undertake further investigation.  Id., at 774, n.\u00a09.  If that much is true, the inquiry turns to the prospect that such an investigation would have borne disqualifying fruit.  As to that second link in the causal chain, the Government need not show definitively that its investigation would have unearthed a disqualifying fact (though, of course, it may).  Rather, the Government need only establish that the investigation \"would predictably have disclosed\" some legal disqualification.  Id., at 774; see id., at 783 (Brennan, J., concurring).  If that is so, the defendant's misrepresentation contributed to the citizenship award in the way we think \u00a71425(a) requires.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That standard reflects two real-world attributes of cases premised on what an unhindered investigation would have found.  First is the difficulty of proving that a hypothetical inquiry would have led to some disqualifying discovery, often several years after the defendant told her lies.  As witnesses and other evidence disappear, the Government's effort to reconstruct the course of a \"could have been\" investigation confronts ever-mounting obstacles.  See id., at 779 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Second, and critical to our analysis, is that the defendant--not the Government--bears the blame for that evidentiary predicament.  After all, the inquiry cannot get this far unless the defendant made an unlawful false statement and, by so doing, obstructed the normal course of an investigation.  See id., at 783 (Brennan, J., concurring) (emphasizing that \"the citizen's misrepresentation [in a naturalization proceeding] necessarily frustrated the Government's investigative efforts\"); see also Bigelow v. RKO Radio Pictures, Inc., 327 U.\u00a0S. 251, 265 (1946) (\"The most elementary conceptions of justice and public policy require that the wrongdoer shall bear the risk of the uncertainty which his own wrong has created\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1425(a) is best read to take those exigencies and equities into account, by enabling the Government (as just described) to rest on disqualifications that a thwarted investigation predictably would have uncovered.  A yet-stricter causal requirement, demanding proof positive that a disqualifying fact would have been found, sets the bar so high that \"we cannot conceive that Congress intended\" that result.  Kungys, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 777 (opinion of Scalia, J.).  And nothing in the statutory text requires that approach.  While \u00a71425(a) clearly imports some kind of causal or means-end relation, see supra, at 5-9, Congress left that relation's precise character unspecified.  Cf. Burrage v. United States, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 10) (noting that courts have not always construed criminal statutes to \"require[\u00a0] strict but-for causality,\" and have greater reason to reject such a reading when the laws do not use language like \"results from\" or \"because of\").  The open-endedness of the statutory language allows, indeed supports, our adoption of a demanding but still practicable causal standard.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even when the Government can make its two-part showing, however, the defendant may be able to overcome it.  Section 1425(a) is not a tool for denaturalizing people who, the available evidence indicates, were actually qualified for the citizenship they obtained.  When addressing the civil denaturalization statute, this Court insisted on a similar point: We provided the defendant with an opportunity to rebut the Government's case \"by showing, through a preponderance of the evidence, that the statutory requirement as to which [a lie] had a natural tendency  to produce a favorable decision was in fact met.\"  Kungys, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 777 (opinion of Scalia, J.) (emphasis deleted); accord, id., at 783-784 (Brennan, J., concurring).  Or said otherwise, we gave the defendant a chance to establish that she was qualified for citizenship, and held that she could not be denaturalized if she did so--even though she concealed or misrepresented facts that suggested the opposite.  And indeed, all our denaturalization decisions share this crucial feature: We have never read a statute to strip citizenship from someone who met the legal criteria for acquiring it.  See, e.g., Fedorenko v. United States, 449 U.\u00a0S. 490, 505-507 (1981); Costello v. United States, 365 U.\u00a0S. 265, 269-272 (1961); Schneiderman v. United States, 320 U.\u00a0S. 118, 122-123 (1943).  We will not start now.  Whatever the Government shows with respect to a thwarted investigation, qualification for citizenship is a complete defense to a prosecution brought under \u00a71425(a).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Measured against all we have said, the jury instructions in this case were in error.  As earlier noted, the District Court told the jury that it could convict based on any false statement in the naturalization process (i.e., any violation of \u00a71015(a)), no matter how inconsequential to the ultimate decision.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 86a; supra, at 3.  But as we have shown, the jury needed to find more than an unlawful false statement.  Recall that Maslenjak's lie in the naturalization process concerned her prior statements to immigration officials: She swore that she had been honest when applying for admission as a refugee, but in fact she had not.  See supra, at 2-3.  The jury could have convicted if that earlier dishonesty (i.e., the thing she misrepresented when seeking citizenship) were itself a reason to deny naturalization--say, because it counted as \"false testimony for the purpose of obtaining [immigration] benefits\" and thus demonstrated bad moral character.  See supra, at 11-12.  Or else, the jury could have convicted if (1) knowledge of that prior dishonesty would have led a reasonable official to make some further investigation (say, into the circumstances of her admission), (2) that inquiry would predictably have yielded a legal basis for rejecting her citizenship application, and (3) Maslenjak failed to show that (notwithstanding such an objective likelihood) she was in fact qualified to become a U.\u00a0S. citizen.  See supra, at 12-15.  This jury, however, was not asked to--and so did not--make any of those determinations.  Accordingly, Maslenjak was not convicted by a properly instructed jury of \"procur[ing], contrary to law, [her] naturalization.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government asserts that any instructional error in this case was harmless.  \"Had officials known the truth,\" the Government asserts, \"it would have affected their decision to grant [Maslenjak] citizenship.\"  Brief for United States 12.  Unsurprisingly, Maslenjak disagrees.  See  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-8; Reply to Brief in Opposition 9-10.  In keeping with our usual practice, we leave that dispute for resolution on remand.  See, e.g., Skilling v. United States, 561 U.\u00a0S. 358, 414 (2010).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nOpinion of Gorsuch, J.\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-309\nDIVNA MASLENJAK, PETITIONER v. UNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court holds that the plain text and structure of the statute before us require the Government to prove causation as an element of conviction: The defendant's illegal conduct must, in some manner, cause her naturalization.  I agree with this much and concur in Part II-A of the Court's opinion to the extent it so holds.  And because the jury wasn't instructed at all about causation, I agree too that reversal is required.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But, respectfully, there I would stop.  In an effort to \"operational[ize]\" the statute's causation requirement, the Court says a great deal more, offering, for example, two newly announced tests, the second with two more subparts, and a new affirmative defense--all while indicating that some of these new tests and defenses may apply only in some but not all cases.  See, e.g., ante, at 10-15.  The work here is surely thoughtful and may prove entirely sound.  But the question presented and the briefing before us focused primarily on whether the statute contains a materiality element, not on the contours of a causation requirement.  So the parties have not had the chance to join issue fully on the matters now decided.  Compare ante, at 10, n.\u00a04, with Brief for Petitioner, pp. i, 18-38; Brief for United States, pp. i, 12-51.  And, of course, the lower courts have not had a chance to pass on any of these questions in the first instance.  Most cited by the Court have (again) focused only on the materiality (not causation) question; none has tested the elaborate operational details advanced today; and at least one has found our prior unilateral and fractured foray into a related statute in Kungys v. United States, 485 U.\u00a0S. 759 (1988), \"maddening[\u00a0].\"  See ante, at 10, n.\u00a04 (collecting cases).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respectfully, it seems to me at least reasonably possible that the crucible of adversarial testing on which we usually depend, along with the experience of our thoughtful colleagues on the district and circuit benches, could yield insights (or reveal pitfalls) we cannot muster guided only by our own lights.  So while I agree with the Court that the parties will need guidance about the details of the statute's causation requirement, see ibid., I have no doubt that the Court of Appeals, with aid of briefing from the parties, can supply that on remand.  Other circuits may improve that guidance over time too.  And eventually we can bless the best of it.  For my part, I believe it is work enough for the day to recognize that the statute requires some proof of causation, that the jury instructions here did not, and to allow the parties and courts of appeals to take it from there as they usually do.  This Court often speaks most wisely when it speaks last.\n\nAlito, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-309\nDIVNA MASLENJAK, PETITIONER v.\nUNITED STATES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[June 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted review in this case to decide whether \"a naturalized American citizen can be stripped of her citizenship in a criminal proceeding based on an immaterial false statement.\"  Pet. for Cert. i.  The answer to that question is \"no.\"  Although the relevant criminal statute, 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71425(a), does not expressly refer to the concept of materiality, the critical statutory language effectively requires proof of materiality in a case involving false statements.  The statute makes it a crime for a person to \"procure\" naturalization \"contrary to law.\"  In false statement cases, then, the statute essentially imposes the familiar materiality requirement that applies in other contexts.  That is, a person violates the statute by procuring naturalization through an illegal false statement which has a \"natural tendency to influence\" the outcome--that is, the obtaining of naturalization.  Kungys v. United States, 485 U.\u00a0S. 759, 772 (1988).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Understood in this way, Section 1425(a) does not require proof that a false statement actually had some effect on the naturalization decision.  The operative statutory language--\"procure\" naturalization \"contrary to law\"--imposes no such requirement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here is an example.  Eight co-workers jointly buy two season tickets to see their favorite football team play.  They all write their names on a piece of paper and place the slips in a hat to see who will get the tickets for the big game with their team's traditional rival.  One of the friends puts his name in twice, and his name is drawn.  I would say that he \"procured\" the tickets \"contrary to\" the rules of the drawing even though he might have won if he had put his name in only once.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here is another example.  A runner who holds the world's record in an event wants to make sure she wins the gold medal at the Olympics, so she takes a performance enhancing drug.  She wins the race but fails a drug test and is disqualified.  The second-place time is slow, and sportswriters speculate that she would have won without taking the drug.  But it would be entirely consistent with standard English usage for the race officials to say that she \"procured\" her first-place finish \"contrary to\" the governing rules.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As these examples illustrate--and others could be added--the language of 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71425(a) does not require  that an illegal false statement have a demonstrable effect on the naturalization decision.  Instead, the statute applies when a person makes an illegal false statement to obtain naturalization, and that false statement is material to the outcome.  I see no indication that Congress meant to require more.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One additional point is worth mentioning.  Section 1425(a) not only makes it a crime to procure naturalization contrary to law; it applies equally to any person who \"attempts to procure, contrary to law .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. naturalization.\"  Therefore, if a defendant knowingly performs a substantial act that he or she thinks will procure naturalization, that is sufficient for conviction.  See United States v. Resendiz-Ponce, 549 U.\u00a0S. 102, 106-108 (2007).\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Compare 821 F.\u00a03d 675, 685-686 (CA6 2016) (case below), with United States v. Munyenyezi, 781 F.\u00a03d 532, 536 (CA1 2015) (requiring the Government to make some showing that a misrepresentation mattered to the naturalization decision); United States v. Latchin, 554 F.\u00a03d 709, 712-715 (CA7 2009) (same); United States v. Alferahin, 433 F.\u00a03d 1148, 1154-1156 (CA9 2006) (same); United States v. Aladekoba, 61 Fed. Appx. 27, 28 (CA4 2003) (same).\nFootnote 2\u00a0To be fair, the idea of \"obtaining citizenship illegally\" has one other possible meaning, but no one defends it here because it does not fit with the rest of \u00a71425.  On this alternative reading, a person would violate \u00a71425(a) by obtaining citizenship without the requisite legal qualifications--regardless of whether she committed another illegal act in the naturalization process.  To vary our earlier example, suppose someone told you that John procured a gun illegally.  You might think that meant John got the gun through independently unlawful conduct (e.g., he held up a gun store), as in the case of the painting.  But you might instead think that John was just not legally qualified to take possession of a gun--because, for example, he once committed a felony.  That alternative interpretation is plausible with respect to goods that not everyone is eligible to obtain, like guns--or like naturalization.  And indeed, we have interpreted a civil statute closely resembling \u00a71425(a)--which authorizes denaturalization when, inter alia, citizenship is \"illegally procured,\" 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71451(a)--to cover that qualifications-based species of illegality.  See Fedorenko v. United States, 449  U.\u00a0S. 490, 506 (1981).  But neither party urges that reading here, and for good reason.  Unlike its civil analogue, \u00a71425(a) has a companion provision--\u00a71425(b)--that makes it a crime to \"procure or obtain naturalization\" for \"[one]self or another person not entitled thereto.\"  If obtaining citizenship without legal entitlement were enough to violate \u00a71425(a), then that highly specific language in \u00a71425(b) would be superfluous.  Rather than reading those words to do no work, in violation of ordinary canons of statutory construction, we understand Congress to have defined two separate crimes in \u00a71425: Assuming the appropriate mens rea, subsection (a) covers illegal means of procurement, as described above, while subsection (b) covers simple lack of qualifications.  As we will explain, however, questions relating to citizenship qualifications play a significant role when applying \u00a71425(a)'s causal standard in cases (like this one) predicated on false statements.  See infra, at 10-11.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The list of disqualifying conduct is wide-ranging.  See, e.g., 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(f)(4) (illegal gambling); \u00a71101(f)(8) (aggravated felony conviction); \u00a71101(f)(9) (participation in genocide).\nFootnote 4\u00a0Justice Gorsuch would stop before answering that question, see post, at 2 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment), but we think that such a halfway-decision would fail to fulfill our responsibility to both parties and courts.  The Government needs to know what prosecutions to bring; defendants need to know what defenses to offer; and district courts need to know how to instruct juries.  Telling them only \"\u00a71425(a) has something to do with causation\" would not much help them make those decisions.  And we are well-positioned to provide further guidance.  The parties have had every opportunity to address the nature of the statute's causal standard, and both gave us considered views about how the law should work in practice.  See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 23-24, 30; Brief for United States 17-18, 48; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14-16, 23-25, 39-46.  Moreover, many lower courts have already addressed those same issues--including one that has called this Court's failure to provide clear guidance \"maddening[\u00a0].\"  Latchin, 554 F.\u00a03d, at 713; see, e.g., id., at 713-714; Munyenyezi, 781 F.\u00a03d, at 536-538; Alferahin, 433 F.\u00a03d, at 1155; Aladekoba, 61 Fed. Appx., at 27-28; United States v. Acheampong, 2015 WL 926113, *2-*3 (D Kan., Mar. 3, 2015); United States v. Odeh, 2014 WL 5473042, *7-*8 (ED Mich., Oct. 27, 2014).\nFootnote 5\u00a0Kungys concerned the part of that statute providing for the revocation of citizenship \"procured by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.\"  \u00a71451(a).  As noted earlier, the same statute includes a prong covering citizenship that is \"illegally procured.\"  See n. 2, supra.\n\n\n","50":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMATAL, INTERIM DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE v. TAM(2017)\nNo. 15-1293\nArgued: January 18, 2017Decided: June 19, 2017\n\n\nSimon Tam, lead singer of the rock group \"The Slants,\" chose this moniker in order to \"reclaim\" the term and drain its denigrating force as a derogatory term for Asian persons.  Tam sought federal registration of the mark \"THE SLANTS.\"  The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied the application under a Lanham Act provision prohibiting the registration of trademarks that may \"disparage .\u00a0.\u00a0. or bring .\u00a0.\u00a0. into contemp[t] or disrepute\" any \"persons, living or dead.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a).  Tam contested the denial of registration through the administrative appeals process, to no avail.  He then took the case to federal court, where the en banc Federal Circuit ultimately found the disparagement clause facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause.  \nHeld:\u00a0The judgment is affirmed.\n808 F.\u00a03d 1321, affirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, II, and III-A, concluding:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The disparagement clause applies to marks that disparage the members of a racial or ethnic group.  Tam's view, that the clause applies only to natural or juristic persons, is refuted by the plain terms of the clause, which uses the word \"persons.\"  A mark that disparages a \"substantial\" percentage of the members of a racial or ethnic group necessarily disparages many \"persons,\" namely, members of that group.  Tam's narrow reading also clashes with the breadth of the disparagement clause, which by its terms applies not just to \"persons,\" but also to \"institutions\" and \"beliefs.\"  \u00a71052(a).  Had Congress wanted to confine the reach of the clause, it could have used the phrase \"particular living individual,\" which it used in neighboring \u00a71052(c).  Tam contends that his interpretation is supported by legislative history and by the PTO's practice for many years of registering marks that plainly denigrated certain groups.  But an inquiry into the meaning of the statute's text ceases when, as here, \"the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\"  Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.\u00a0S. 438, 450 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Even if resort to legislative history and early enforcement practice were appropriate, Tam has presented nothing showing a congressional intent to adopt his interpretation, and the PTO's practice in the years following the disparagement clause's enactment is unenlightening.  Pp.\u00a08-12. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The disparagement clause violates the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause.  Contrary to the Government's contention, trademarks are private, not government speech.  Because the \"Free Speech Clause .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not regulate government speech,\" Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S. 460, 467, the government is not required to maintain viewpoint neutrality on its own speech.  This Court exercises great caution in extending its government-speech precedents, for if private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Government does not dream up the trademarks registered by the PTO.  Except as required by \u00a71052(a), an examiner may not reject a mark based on the viewpoint that it appears to express.  If the mark meets the Lanham Act's viewpoint-neutral requirements, registration is mandatory.  And once a mark is registered, the PTO is not authorized to remove it from the register unless a party moves for cancellation, the registration expires, or the Federal Trade Commission initiates proceedings based on certain grounds.  It is thus far-fetched to suggest that the content of a registered mark is government speech, especially given the fact that if trademarks become government speech when they are registered, the Federal Government is babbling prodigiously and incoherently.  And none of this Court's government-speech cases supports the idea that registered trademarks are government speech.  Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U.\u00a0S. 550; Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S. 460; and Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, distinguished.  Holding that the registration of a trademark converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the government-speech doctrine, for other systems of government registration (such as copyright) could easily be characterized in the same way.  Pp.\u00a012-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Breyer, concluded in Parts III-B, III-C, and IV:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Government's argument that this case is governed by the Court's subsidized-speech cases is unpersuasive.  Those cases all involved cash subsidies or their equivalent, e.g., funds to private parties for family planning services in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.\u00a0S. 173, and cash grants to artists in National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U.\u00a0S. 569.  The federal registration of a trademark is nothing like these programs.  The PTO does not pay money to parties seeking registration of a mark; it requires the payment of fees to file an application and to maintain the registration once it is granted.  The Government responds that registration provides valuable non-monetary benefits traceable to the Government's resources devoted to registering the marks, but nearly every government service requires the expenditure of government funds.  This is true of services that benefit everyone, like police and fire protection, as well as services that are utilized by only some, e.g., the adjudication of private lawsuits and the use of public parks and highways.  Pp.\u00a018-20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Also unpersuasive is the Government's claim that the disparagement clause is constitutional under a \"government-program\" doctrine, an argument which is based on a merger of this Court's government-speech cases and subsidy cases.  It points to two cases involving a public employer's collection of union dues from its employees, Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U.\u00a0S. 177, and Ysursa v. Pocatello Ed. Assn., 555 U.\u00a0S. 353, but these cases occupy a special area of First Amendment case law that is far removed from the registration of trademarks.  Cases in which government creates a limited public forum for private speech, thus allowing for some content- and speaker-based restrictions, see, e.g., Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.\u00a0S. 98, 106-107; Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819, 831, are potentially more analogous.  But even in those cases, viewpoint discrimination is forbidden.  The disparagement clause denies registration to any mark that is offensive to a substantial percentage of the members of any group.  That is viewpoint discrimination in the sense relevant here: Giving offense is a viewpoint.  The \"public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\"  Street v. New York, 394 U.\u00a0S. 576, 592.  Pp.\u00a020-23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The dispute between the parties over whether trademarks are commercial speech subject to the relaxed scrutiny outlined in Central Hudson Gas & Elect. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.\u00a0Y., 447 U.\u00a0S. 557, need not be resolved here because the disparagement clause cannot withstand even Central Hudson review.  Under Central Hudson, a restriction of speech must serve \"a substantial interest\" and be \"narrowly drawn.\"  Id., at 564-565 (internal quotation marks omitted).  One purported interest is in preventing speech expressing ideas that offend, but that idea strikes at the heart of the First Amendment.  The second interest asserted is protecting the orderly flow of commerce from disruption caused by trademarks that support invidious discrimination; but the clause, which reaches any trademark that disparages any person, group, or institution, is not narrowly drawn.  Pp. \u00a023-26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy, joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan, agreed that 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a) constitutes viewpoint discrimination, concluding: \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0With few narrow exceptions, a fundamental principle of the First Amendment is that the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or perspectives the speech conveys.  See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819, 828-829.  The test for viewpoint discrimination is whether--within the relevant subject category--the government has singled out a subset of messages for disfavor based on the views expressed.  Here, the disparagement clause identifies the relevant subject as \"persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols,\" \u00a71052(a); and within that category, an applicant may register a positive or benign mark but not a derogatory one.  The law thus reflects the Government's disapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive, the essence of viewpoint discrimination.  The Government's arguments in defense of the statute are unpersuasive.  Pp.\u00a02-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Regardless of whether trademarks are commercial speech, the viewpoint based discrimination here necessarily invokes heightened scrutiny.  See Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.\u00a0S. 552, 566.  To the extent trademarks qualify as commercial speech, they are an example of why that category does not serve as a blanket exemption from the First Amendment's requirement of viewpoint neutrality.  In the realm of trademarks, the metaphorical marketplace of ideas becomes a tangible, powerful reality.  To permit viewpoint discrimination in this context is to permit Government censorship.

But the band members believe that by taking that slur as the name of their group, they will help to \"reclaim\" the term and drain its denigrating force.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) denied the application based on a provision of federal law prohibiting the registration of trademarks that may \"disparage .\u00a0.\u00a0. or bring .\u00a0.\u00a0. into contemp[t] or disrepute\" any \"persons, living or dead.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a).  We now hold that this provision violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The principle underlying trademark protection is that distinctive marks--words, names, symbols, and the like--can help distinguish a particular artisan's goods from those of others.\"  B&B Hardware, Inc. v.

Trademarks and their precursors have ancient origins, and trademarks were protected at common law and in equity at the time of the founding of our country.  3 J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \u00a719:8 (4th ed. 2017) (hereinafter McCarthy); 1 id., \u00a7\u00a75:1, 5:2, 5:3; Pattishal, The Constitutional Foundations of American Trademark Law, 78 Trademark Rep. 456, 457-458 (1988); Pattishall, Two Hundred Years of American Trademark Law, 68 Trademark Rep. 121, 121-123 (1978); see Trade-Mark Cases, 100 U.\u00a0S. 82, 92 (1879).  For most of the 19th century, trademark protection was the province of the States.  See Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.\u00a0S. 763, 780-782 (1992) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 785 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  Eventually, Congress stepped in to provide a degree of national uniformity, passing the first federal legislation protecting trademarks in 1870.  See Act of July 8, 1870, \u00a7\u00a777-84, 16 Stat. 210-212.  The foundation of current federal trademark law is the Lanham Act, enacted in 1946.  See Act of July 5, 1946, ch. 540, 60 Stat. 427.  By that time, trademark had expanded far beyond phrases that do no more than identify a good or service.  Then, as now, trademarks often consisted of catchy phrases that convey a message.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Lanham Act, trademarks that are \"used in commerce\" may be placed on the \"principal register,\" that is, they may be federally registered.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71051(a)(1).  And some marks \"capable of distinguishing [an] applicant's goods or services and not registrable on the principal register .\u00a0.\u00a0. which are in lawful use in commerce by the owner thereof\" may instead be placed on a different federal register: the supplemental register.  \u00a71091(a).  There are now more than two million marks that have active federal certificates of registration.  PTO Performance and Accountability Report, Fiscal Year 2016, p. 192 (Table 15), https:\/\/www.uspto.gov\/sites\/default\/files\/ documents\/USPTOFY16PAR.pdf (all Internet materials as last visited June 16, 2017).  This system of federal registration helps to ensure that trademarks are fully protected and supports the free flow of commerce.  \"[N]ational protection of trademarks is desirable,\" we have explained, \"because trademarks foster competition and the maintenance of quality by securing to the producer the benefits of good reputation.\"  San Francisco Arts & Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., 483 U.\u00a0S. 522, 531 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Park 'N Fly, Inc., supra, at 198 (\"The Lanham Act provides national protection of trademarks in order to secure to the owner of the mark the goodwill of his business and to protect the ability of consumers to distinguish among competing producers\").\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Without federal registration, a valid trademark may still be used in commerce.  See 3 McCarthy \u00a719:8.  And an unregistered trademark can be enforced against would-be infringers in several ways.  Most important, even if a trademark is not federally registered, it may still be enforceable under \u00a743(a) of the Lanham Act, which creates a federal cause of action for trademark infringement.  See Two Pesos, supra, at 768 (\"Section 43(a) prohibits a broader range of practices than does \u00a732, which applies to registered marks, but it is common ground that \u00a743(a) protects qualifying unregistered trademarks\" (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).1  Unregistered trademarks may also be entitled to protection under other federal statutes, such as the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71125(d).  See 5 McCarthy \u00a725A:49, at 25A-198 (\"[T]here is no requirement [in the Anticybersquatting Act] that the protected 'mark' be registered: unregistered common law marks are protected by the Act\").  And an unregistered trademark can be enforced under state common law, or if it has been registered in a State, under that State's registration system.  See 3 id., \u00a719:3, at 19-23 (explaining that \"[t]he federal system of registration and protection does not preempt parallel state law protection, either by state common law or state registration\" and \"[i]n the vast majority of situations, federal and state trademark law peacefully coexist\"); id., \u00a722:1 (discussing state trademark registration systems).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal registration, however, \"confers important legal rights and benefits on trademark owners who register their marks.\"  B&B Hardware, 575 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Registration on the principal register (1) \"serves as 'constructive notice of the registrant's claim of ownership' of the mark,\" ibid. (quoting 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71072); (2) \"is 'prima facie evidence of the validity of the registered mark and of the registration of the mark, of the owner's ownership of the mark, and of the owner's exclusive right to use the registered mark in commerce on or in connection with the goods or services specified in the certificate,'\u00a0\" B\u00a0&\u00a0B Hardware, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___ (slip op., at 3) (quoting \u00a71057(b)); and (3) can make a mark \"\u00a0'incontestable'\u00a0\" once a mark has been registered for five years,\" ibid. (quoting \u00a7\u00a71065, 1115(b)); see Park 'N Fly, 469 U.\u00a0S., at 193.  Registration also enables the trademark holder \"to stop the importation into the United States of articles bearing an infringing mark.\"  3 McCarthy \u00a719:9, at 19-38; see 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71124.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Lanham Act contains provisions that bar certain trademarks from the principal register.  For example, a trademark cannot be registered if it is \"merely descriptive or deceptively misdescriptive\" of goods, \u00a71052(e)(1), or if it is so similar to an already registered trademark or trade name that it is \"likely .\u00a0.\u00a0. to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive,\" \u00a71052(d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At issue in this case is one such provision, which we will call \"the disparagement clause.\"  This provision prohibits the registration of a trademark \"which may disparage .\u00a0.\u00a0. persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute.\"  \u00a71052(a).2  This clause appeared in the original Lanham Act and has remained the same to this day.  See \u00a72(a), 60 Stat. 428.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When deciding whether a trademark is disparaging, an examiner at the PTO generally applies a \"two-part test.\"  The examiner first considers \"the likely meaning of the matter in question, taking into account not only dictionary definitions, but also the relationship of the matter to the other elements in the mark, the nature of the goods or services, and the manner in which the mark is used in the marketplace in connection with the goods or services.\"  Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure \u00a71203.03(b)(i) (Apr. 2017), p. 1200-150, http:\/\/tmep.uspto.gov.  \"If that meaning is found to refer to identifiable persons, institutions, beliefs or national symbols,\" the examiner moves to the second step, asking \"whether that meaning may be disparaging to a substantial composite3 of the referenced group.\"  Ibid.  If the examiner finds that a \"substantial composite, although not necessarily a majority, of the referenced group would find the proposed mark .\u00a0.\u00a0. to be disparaging in the context of contemporary attitudes,\" a prima facie case of disparagement is made out, and the burden shifts to the applicant to prove that the trademark is not disparaging.  Ibid.  What is more, the PTO has specified that \"[t]he fact that an applicant may be a member of that group or has good intentions underlying its use of a term does not obviate the fact that a substantial composite of the referenced group would find the term objectionable.\"  Ibid.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Simon Tam is the lead singer of \"The Slants.\"  In re Tam, 808 F.\u00a03d 1321, 1331 (CA Fed. 2015) (en banc), as corrected (Feb. 11, 2016).  He chose this moniker in order to \"reclaim\" and \"take ownership\" of stereotypes about people of Asian ethnicity.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The group \"draws inspiration for its lyrics from childhood slurs and mocking nursery rhymes\" and has given its albums names such as \"The Yellow Album\" and \"Slanted Eyes, Slanted Hearts.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tam sought federal registration of \"THE SLANTS,\" on the principal register, App. 17, but an examining attorney at the PTO rejected the request, applying the PTO's two-part framework and finding that \"there is .\u00a0.\u00a0. a substantial composite of persons who find the term in the applied-for mark offensive.\"  Id., at 30.  The examining attorney relied in part on the fact that \"numerous dictionaries define 'slants' or 'slant-eyes' as a derogatory or offensive term.\"  Id., at 29.  The examining attorney also relied on a finding that \"the band's name has been found offensive numerous times\"--citing a performance that was canceled because of the band's moniker and the fact that \"several bloggers and commenters to articles on the band have indicated that they find the term and the applied-for mark offensive.\"  Id., at 29-30.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tam contested the denial of registration before the examining attorney and before the PTO's Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) but to no avail.  Eventually, he took the case to federal court, where the en banc Federal Circuit ultimately found the disparagement clause facially unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause.  The majority found that the clause engages in viewpoint-based discrimination, that the clause regulates the expressive component of trademarks and consequently cannot be treated as commercial speech, and that the clause is subject to and cannot satisfy strict scrutiny.  See 808 F.\u00a03d, at 1334-1339.  The majority also rejected the Government's argument that registered trademarks constitute government speech, as well as the Government's contention that federal registration is a form of government subsidy.  See id., at 1339-1355.  And the majority opined that even if the disparagement clause were analyzed under this Court's commercial speech cases, the clause would fail the \"intermediate scrutiny\" that those cases prescribe.  See id., at 1355-1357.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Several judges wrote separately, advancing an assortment of theories.  Concurring, Judge O'Malley agreed with the majority's reasoning but added that the disparagement clause is unconstitutionally vague.  See id., at 1358-1363.  Judge Dyk concurred in part and dissented in part.  He argued that trademark registration is a government subsidy and that the disparagement clause is facially constitutional, but he found the clause unconstitutional as applied to THE SLANTS because that mark constitutes \"core expression\" and was not adopted for the purpose of disparaging Asian-Americans.  See id., at 1363-1374.  In dissent, Judge Lourie agreed with Judge Dyk that the clause is facially constitutional but concluded for a variety of reasons that it is also constitutional as applied in this case.  See id., at 1374-1376.  Judge Reyna also dissented, maintaining that trademarks are commercial speech and that the disparagement clause survives intermediate scrutiny because it \"directly advances the government's substantial interest in the orderly flow of commerce.\"  See id., at 1376-1382.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government filed a petition for certiorari, which we granted in order to decide whether the disparagement clause \"is facially invalid under the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.\"  Pet. for Cert. i; see sub. nom. Lee v. Tam, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before reaching the question whether the disparagement clause violates the First Amendment, we consider Tam's argument that the clause does not reach marks that disparage racial or ethnic groups.  The clause prohibits the registration of marks that disparage \"persons,\" and Tam claims that the term \"persons\" \"includes only natural and juristic persons,\" not \"non-juristic entities such as racial and ethnic groups.\"  Brief for Respondent 46.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tam never raised this argument before the PTO or the Federal Circuit, and we declined to grant certiorari on this question when Tam asked us to do so, see Brief Responding to Petition for Certiorari, pp. i, 17-21.  Normally, that would be the end of the matter in this Court.  See, e.g., Yee v. Escondido, 503 U.\u00a0S. 519, 534-538 (1992); Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.\u00a0S. 868, 894-895 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But as the Government pointed out in connection with its petition for certiorari, accepting Tam's statutory interpretation would resolve this case and leave the First Amendment question for another day.  See Reply Brief 9.  \"[W]e have often stressed\" that it is \"importan[t] [to] avoid[d] the premature adjudication of constitutional questions,\" Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.\u00a0S. 681, 690 (1997), and that \"we ought not to pass on questions of constitutionality .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless such adjudication is unavoidable,\" Spector Motor Service, Inc. v. McLaughlin, 323 U.\u00a0S. 101, 105 (1944).  See also Alabama State Federation of Labor v. McAdory, 325 U.\u00a0S. 450, 461 (1945); Burton v. United States, 196 U.\u00a0S. 283, 295 (1905).  We thus begin by explaining why Tam's argument about the definition of \"persons\" in the Lanham Act is meritless.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted, the disparagement clause prohibits the registration of trademarks \"which may disparage .\u00a0.\u00a0. persons, living or dead.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a).  Tam points to a definition of \"person\" in the Lanham Act, which provides that \"[i]n the construction of this chapter, unless the contrary is plainly apparent from the context .\u00a0.\u00a0. [t]he term 'person' and any other word or term used to designate the applicant or other entitled to a benefit or privilege or rendered liable under the provisions of this chapter includes a juristic person as well as a natural person.\"  \u00a71127.  Because racial and ethnic groups are neither natural nor \"juristic\" persons, Tam asserts, these groups fall outside this definition.  Brief for Respondent 46-48.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tam's argument is refuted by the plain terms of the disparagement clause.  The clause applies to marks that disparage \"persons.\"  A mark that disparages a \"substantial\" percentage of the members of a racial or ethnic group, Trademark Manual \u00a71203.03(b)(i), at 1200-150, necessarily disparages many \"persons,\" namely, members of that group.  Tam's argument would fail even if the clause used the singular term \"person,\" but Congress' use of the plural \"persons\" makes the point doubly clear.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tam's narrow reading of the term \"persons\" also clashes with the breadth of the disparagement clause.  By its terms, the clause applies to marks that disparage, not just \"persons,\" but also \"institutions\" and \"beliefs.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a).  It thus applies to the members of any group whose members share particular \"beliefs,\" such as political, ideological, and religious groups.  It applies to marks that denigrate \"institutions,\" and on Tam's reading, it also reaches \"juristic\" persons such as corporations, unions, and other unincorporated associations.  See \u00a71127.  Thus, the clause is not limited to marks that disparage a particular natural person.  If Congress had wanted to confine the reach of the disparagement clause in the way that Tam suggests, it would have been easy to do so.  A neighboring provision of the Lanham Act denies registration to any trademark that \"[c]onsists of or comprises a name, portrait, or signature identifying a particular living individual except by his written consent.\"  \u00a71052(c) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tam contends that his interpretation of the disparagement clause is supported by its legislative history and by the PTO's willingness for many years to register marks that plainly denigrated African-Americans and Native Americans.  These arguments are unpersuasive.  As always, our inquiry into the meaning of the statute's text ceases when \"the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\"  Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.\u00a0S. 438, 450 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, it is clear that the prohibition against registering trademarks \"which may disparage .\u00a0.\u00a0. persons,\"  \u00a71052(a), prohibits registration of terms that disparage persons who share a common race or  ethnicity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if resort to legislative history and early enforcement practice were appropriate, we would find Tam's arguments unconvincing.  Tam has not brought to our attention any evidence in the legislative history showing that Congress meant to adopt his interpretation.  And the practice of the PTO in the years following the enactment of the disparagement clause is unenlightening.  The admitted vagueness of the disparagement test5 and the huge volume of applications have produced a haphazard record of enforcement.  (Even today, the principal register is replete with marks that many would regard as disparaging to racial and ethnic groups.6)  Registration of the offensive marks that Tam cites is likely attributable not to the acceptance of his interpretation of the clause but to other factors--most likely the regrettable attitudes and sensibilities of the time in question.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the disparagement clause applies to marks that disparage the members of a racial or ethnic group, we must decide whether the clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  And at the outset, we must consider three arguments that would either eliminate any First Amendment protection or result in highly permissive rational-basis review.  Specifically, the Government contends (1) that trademarks are government speech, not private speech, (2) that trademarks are a form of government subsidy, and (3) that the constitutionality of the disparagement clause should be tested under a new \"government-program\" doctrine.  We address each of these arguments below.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Amendment prohibits Congress and other government entities and actors from \"abridging the freedom of speech\"; the First Amendment does not say that Congress and other government entities must abridge their own ability to speak freely.  And our cases recognize that \"[t]he Free Speech Clause .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not regulate government speech.\"  Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.\u00a0S. 460, 467 (2009); see Johanns v. Livestock Marketing Assn., 544 U.\u00a0S. 550, 553 (2005) (\"[T]he Government's own speech .\u00a0.\u00a0. is exempt from First Amendment scrutiny\"); Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U.\u00a0S. 217, 235 (2000).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As we have said, \"it is not easy to imagine how government could function\" if it were subject to the restrictions that the First Amendment imposes on private speech.  Summum, supra, at 468; see Walker v. Texas Div., Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 5-7).  \"\u00a0'[T]he First Amendment forbids the government to regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas at the expense of others,'\u00a0\" Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.\u00a0S. 384, 394 (1993), but imposing a requirement of viewpoint-neutrality on government speech would be paralyzing.  When a government entity embarks on a course of action, it necessarily takes a particular viewpoint and rejects others.  The Free Speech Clause does not require government to maintain viewpoint neutrality when its officers and employees speak about that venture.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here is a simple example.  During the Second World War, the Federal Government produced and distributed millions of posters to promote the war effort.7  There were posters urging enlistment, the purchase of war bonds, and the conservation of scarce resources.8  These posters expressed a viewpoint, but the First Amendment did not demand that the Government balance the message of these posters by producing and distributing posters encouraging Americans to refrain from engaging in these activities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But while the government-speech doctrine is important--indeed, essential--it is a doctrine that is susceptible to dangerous misuse.  If private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints.  For this reason, we must exercise great caution before extending our government-speech precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At issue here is the content of trademarks that are registered by the PTO, an arm of the Federal Government.  The Federal Government does not dream up these marks, and it does not edit marks submitted for registration.  Except as required by the statute involved here, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a), an examiner may not reject a mark based on the viewpoint that it appears to express.  Thus, unless that section is thought to apply, an examiner does not inquire whether any viewpoint conveyed by a mark is consistent with Government policy or whether any such viewpoint is consistent with that expressed by other marks already on the principal register.  Instead, if the mark meets the Lanham Act's viewpoint-neutral requirements, registration is mandatory.  Ibid. (requiring that \"[n]o trademark .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall be refused registration on the principal register on account of its nature unless\" it falls within an enumerated statutory exception).  And if an examiner finds that a mark is eligible for placement on the principal register, that decision is not reviewed by any higher official unless the registration is challenged.  See \u00a7\u00a71062(a), 1071; 37 CFR \u00a741.31(a) (2016).  Moreover, once a mark is registered, the PTO is not authorized to remove it from the register unless a party moves for cancellation, the registration expires, or the Federal Trade Commission initiates proceedings based on certain grounds.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71058(a), 1059, 1064; 37 CFR \u00a7\u00a72.111(b), 2.160.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of all this, it is far-fetched to suggest that the content of a registered mark is government speech.  If the federal registration of a trademark makes the mark government speech, the Federal Government is babbling prodigiously and incoherently.  It is saying many unseemly things.  See App. to Brief for Pro-Football, Inc., as Amicus Curiae.  It is expressing contradictory views.9  It is unashamedly endorsing a vast array of commercial products and services.  And it is providing Delphic advice to the consuming public.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, if trademarks represent government speech, what does the Government have in mind when it advises Americans to \"make.believe\" (Sony),10 \"Think different\" (Apple),11 \"Just do it\" (Nike),12 or \"Have it your way\" (Burger King)13?  Was the Government warning about a coming disaster when it registered the mark \"EndTime Ministries\"14?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The PTO has made it clear that registration does not constitute approval of a mark.  See In re Old Glory Condom Corp., 26 USPQ\u00a02d 1216, 1220, n.\u00a03 (TTAB 1993) (\"[I]ssuance of a trademark registration .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not a government imprimatur\").  And it is unlikely that more than a tiny fraction of the public has any idea what federal registration of a trademark means.  See Application of National Distillers & Chemical Corp., 49 C. C. P. A. (Pat.) 854, 863, 297 F.\u00a02d 941, 949 (1962) (Rich, J., concurring) (\"The purchasing public knows no more about trademark registrations than a man walking down the street in a strange city knows about legal title to the land and buildings he passes\" (emphasis deleted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of our government speech cases even remotely supports the idea that registered trademarks are government speech.  In Johanns, we considered advertisements promoting the sale of beef products.  A federal statute called for the creation of a program of paid advertising \"\u00a0'to advance the image and desirability of beef and beef products.'\u00a0\"  544 U.\u00a0S., at 561 (quoting 7 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a02902(13)).  Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture provided guidelines for the content of the ads, Department of Agriculture officials attended the meetings at which the content of specific ads was discussed, and the Secretary could edit or reject any proposed ad.  544 U.\u00a0S., at 561.  Noting that \"[t]he message set out in the beef promotions [was] from beginning to end the message established by the Federal Government,\" we held that the ads were government speech.  Id., at 560.  The Government's involvement in the creation of these beef ads bears no resemblance to anything that occurs when a trademark is registered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Summum is similarly far afield.  A small city park contained 15 monuments.  555 U.\u00a0S., at 464.  Eleven had been donated by private groups, and one of these displayed the Ten Commandments.  Id., at 464-465.  A religious group claimed that the city, by accepting donated monuments, had created a limited public forum for private speech and was therefore obligated to place in the park a monument expressing the group's religious beliefs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Holding that the monuments in the park represented government speech, we cited many factors.  Governments have used monuments to speak to the public since ancient times; parks have traditionally been selective in accepting and displaying donated monuments; parks would be overrun if they were obligated to accept all monuments offered by private groups; \"[p]ublic parks are often closely identified in the public mind with the government unit that owns the land\"; and \"[t]he monuments that are accepted .\u00a0.\u00a0. are meant to convey and have the effect of conveying a government message.\"  Id., at 472.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trademarks share none of these characteristics.  Trademarks have not traditionally been used to convey a Government message.  With the exception of the enforcement of 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a), the viewpoint expressed by a mark has not played a role in the decision whether to place it on the principal register.  And there is no evidence that the public associates the contents of trademarks with the Federal Government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This brings us to the case on which the Government relies most heavily, Walker, which likely marks the outer bounds of the government-speech doctrine.  Holding that the messages on Texas specialty license plates are government speech, the Walker Court cited three factors distilled from Summum.  576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 7-8).  First, license plates have long been used by the States to convey state messages.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 9-10).  Second, license plates \"are often closely identified in the public mind\" with the State, since they are manufactured and owned by the State, generally designed by the State, and serve as a form of \"government ID.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Third, Texas \"maintain[ed] direct control over the messages conveyed on its specialty plates.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  As explained above, none of these factors are present in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the federal registration of trademarks is vastly different from the beef ads in Johanns, the monuments in Summum, and even the specialty license plates in Walker.  Holding that the registration of a trademark converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the government-speech doctrine.  For if the registration of trademarks constituted government speech, other systems of government registration could easily be characterized in the same way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the most worrisome implication of the Government's argument concerns the system of copyright registration.  If federal registration makes a trademark government speech and thus eliminates all First Amendment protection, would the registration of the copyright for a book produce a similar transformation?  See 808 F.\u00a03d, at 1346 (explaining that if trademark registration amounts to government speech, \"then copyright registration\" which \"has identical accoutrements\" would \"likewise amount to government speech\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government attempts to distinguish copyright on the ground that it is \"\u00a0'the engine of free expression,'\u00a0\" Brief for Petitioner 47 (quoting Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.\u00a0S. 186, 219 (2003)), but as this case illustrates, trademarks often have an expressive content.  Companies spend huge amounts to create and publicize trademarks that convey a message.  It is true that the necessary brevity of trademarks limits what they can say.  But powerful messages can sometimes be conveyed in just a few words.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trademarks are private, not government, speech.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We next address the Government's argument that this case is governed by cases in which this Court has upheld the constitutionality of government programs that subsidized speech expressing a particular viewpoint.  These cases implicate a notoriously tricky question of constitutional law.  \"[W]e have held that the Government 'may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected .\u00a0.\u00a0. freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.'\u00a0\"  Agency for Int'l Development v. Alliance for Open Society Int'l, Inc., 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8) (some internal quotation marks omitted).  But at the same time, government is not required to subsidize activities that it does not wish to promote.  Ibid.  Determining which of these principles applies in a particular case \"is not always self-evident,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 11), but no difficult question is presented here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the present case, the decisions on which the Government relies all involved cash subsidies or their equivalent.  In Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.\u00a0S. 173 (1991), a federal law provided funds to private parties for family planning services.  In National Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U.\u00a0S. 569 (1998), cash grants were awarded to artists.  And federal funding for public libraries was at issue in United States v. American Library Assn., Inc., 539 U.\u00a0S. 194 (2003).  In other cases, we have regarded tax benefits as comparable to cash subsidies.  See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Wash., 461 U.\u00a0S. 540 (1983); Cammarano v. United States, 358 U.\u00a0S 498 (1959).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The federal registration of a trademark is nothing like the programs at issue in these cases.  The PTO does not pay money to parties seeking registration of a mark.  Quite the contrary is true: An applicant for registration must pay the PTO a filing fee of $225-$600.  37 CFR \u00a72.6(a)(1).  (Tam submitted a fee of $275 as part of his application to register THE SLANTS.  App. 18.)  And to maintain federal registration, the holder of a mark must pay a fee of $300-$500 every 10 years.  \u00a72.6(a)(5); see also 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71059(a).  The Federal Circuit concluded that these fees have fully supported the registration system for the past 27 years.  808 F.\u00a03d, at 1353.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government responds that registration provides valuable non-monetary benefits that \"are directly traceable to the resources devoted by the federal government to examining, publishing, and issuing certificates of registration for those marks.\"  Brief for Petitioner 27.  But just about every government service requires the expenditure of government funds.  This is true of services that benefit everyone, like police and fire protection, as well as services that are utilized by only some, e.g., the adjudication of private lawsuits and the use of public parks and highways.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trademark registration is not the only government registration scheme.  For example, the Federal Government registers copyrights and patents.  State governments and their subdivisions register the title to real property and security interests; they issue driver's licenses, motor vehicle registrations, and hunting, fishing, and boating licenses or permits.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cases like Rust and Finley are not instructive in analyzing the constitutionality of restrictions on speech imposed in connection with such services. \nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Government urges us to sustain the disparagement clause under a new doctrine that would apply to \"government-program\" cases.  For the most part, this argument simply merges our government-speech cases and the previously discussed subsidy cases in an attempt to construct a broader doctrine that can be applied to the registration of trademarks.  The only new element in this construct consists of two cases involving a public employer's collection of union dues from its employees.  But those cases occupy a special area of First Amendment case law, and they are far removed from the registration of trademarks.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Davenport v. Washington Ed. Assn., 551 U.\u00a0S. 177, 181-182 (2007), a Washington law permitted a public employer automatically to deduct from the wages of employees who chose not to join the union the portion of union dues used for activities related to collective bargaining.  But unless these employees affirmatively consented, the law did not allow the employer to collect the portion of union dues that would be used in election activities.  Id., at 180-182.  A public employee union argued that this law unconstitutionally restricted its speech based on its content; that is, the law permitted the employer to assist union speech on matters relating to collective bargaining but made it harder for the union to collect money to support its election activities.  Id., at 188.  Upholding this law, we characterized it as imposing a \"modest limitation\" on an \"extraordinary benefit,\" namely, taking money from the wages of non-union members and turning it over to the union free of charge.  Id., at 184.  Refusing to confer an even greater benefit, we held, did not upset the marketplace of ideas and did not abridge the union's free speech rights.  Id., at 189-190.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ysursa v. Pocatello Ed. Assn., 555 U.\u00a0S. 353 (2009), is similar.  There, we considered an Idaho law that allowed public employees to elect to have union dues deducted from their wages but did not allow such a deduction for money remitted to the union's political action committee.  Id., at 355.  We reasoned that the \"the government .\u00a0.\u00a0. [was] not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas.\"  Id., at 358; see also id., at 355 (\"The First Amendment .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not confer an affirmative right to use government payroll mechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expression\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Davenport and Ysursa are akin to our subsidy cases.  Although the laws at issue in Davenport and Ysursa did not provide cash subsidies to the unions, they conferred a very valuable benefit--the right to negotiate a collective-bargaining agreement under which non-members would be obligated to pay an agency fee that the public employer would collect and turn over to the union free of charge.  As in the cash subsidy cases, the laws conferred this benefit because it was thought that this arrangement served important government interests.  See Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.\u00a0S. 209, 224-226 (1977).  But the challenged laws did not go further and provide convenient collection mechanisms for money to be used in political activities.  In essence, the Washington and Idaho lawmakers chose to confer a substantial non-cash benefit for the purpose of furthering activities that they particularly desired to promote but not to provide a similar benefit for the purpose of furthering other activities.  Thus, Davenport and Ysursa are no more relevant for present purposes than the subsidy cases previously discussed.15\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Potentially more analogous are cases in which a unit of government creates a limited public forum for private speech.  See, e.g., Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 533 U.\u00a0S. 98, 106-107 (2001); Rosenberger v. Rec-tor and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819, 831 (1995); Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 392-393.  See also Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U.\u00a0S. 533, 541-544 (2001).  When government creates such a forum, in either a literal or \"metaphysical\" sense, see Rosenberger, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 830, some content- and speaker-based restrictions may be allowed, see id., at 830-831.  However, even in such cases, what we have termed \"viewpoint discrimination\" is forbidden.  Id., at 831.    \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our cases use the term \"viewpoint\" discrimination in a broad sense, see ibid., and in that sense, the disparagement clause discriminates on the bases of \"viewpoint.\"  To be sure, the clause evenhandedly prohibits disparagement of all groups.  It applies equally to marks that damn Democrats and Republicans, capitalists and socialists, and those arrayed on both sides of every possible issue.  It denies registration to any mark that is offensive to a substantial percentage of the members of any group.  But in the sense relevant here, that is viewpoint discrimination: Giving offense is a viewpoint.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have said time and again that \"the public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers.\"  Street v. New York, 394 U.\u00a0S. 576, 592 (1969).  See also Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.\u00a0S. 397, 414 (1989) (\"If there is a bedrock principle underlying the First Amendment, it is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself offensive or disagreeable\"); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.\u00a0S. 46, 55-56 (1988); Coates v. Cincinnati, 402 U.\u00a0S. 611, 615 (1971); Bachellar v. Maryland, 397 U.\u00a0S. 564, 567 (1970); Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.\u00a0S. 503, 509-514 (1969); Cox v. Louisiana, 379 U.\u00a0S. 536, 551 (1965); Edwards v. South Carolina, 372 U.\u00a0S. 229, 237-238 (1963); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.\u00a0S. 1, 4-5 (1949); Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.\u00a0S. 296, 311 (1940); Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U.\u00a0S. 147, 161 (1939); De\u00a0Jonge v. Oregon, 299 U.\u00a0S. 353, 365 (1937).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For this reason, the disparagement clause cannot be saved by analyzing it as a type of government program in which some content- and speaker-based restrictions are permitted.16 \nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having concluded that the disparagement clause cannot be sustained under our government-speech or subsidy cases or under the Government's proposed \"government-program\" doctrine, we must confront a dispute between the parties on the question whether trademarks are commercial speech and are thus subject to the relaxed scrutiny outlined in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.\u00a0Y., 447 U.\u00a0S. 557 (1980).  The Government and amici supporting its position argue that all trademarks are commercial speech.  They note that the central purposes of trademarks are commercial and that federal law regulates trademarks to promote fair and orderly interstate commerce.  Tam and his amici, on the other hand, contend that many, if not all, trademarks have an expressive component.  In other words, these trademarks do not simply identify the source of a product or service but go on to say something more, either about the product or service or some broader issue.  The trademark in this case illustrates this point.  The name \"The Slants\" not only identifies the band but expresses a view about social issues.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We need not resolve this debate between the parties because the disparagement clause cannot withstand even Central Hudson review.17  Under Central Hudson, a restriction of speech must serve \"a substantial interest,\" and it must be \"narrowly drawn.\"  Id., at 564-565 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This means, among other things, that \"[t]he regulatory technique may extend only as far as the interest it serves.\"  Id., at 565.  The disparagement clause fails this requirement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is claimed that the disparagement clause serves two interests.  The first is phrased in a variety of ways in the briefs.  Echoing language in one of the opinions below, the Government asserts an interest in preventing \"\u00a0'underrepresented groups'\u00a0\" from being \"\u00a0'bombarded with demeaning messages in commercial advertising.'\u00a0\"  Brief for Petitioner 48 (quoting 808 F.\u00a03d, at 1364 (Dyk, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  An amicus supporting the Government refers to \"encouraging racial tolerance and protecting the privacy and welfare of individuals.\"  Brief for Native American Organizations as Amici Curiae 21.  But no matter how the point is phrased, its unmistakable thrust is this: The Government has an interest in preventing speech expressing ideas that offend.  And, as we have explained, that idea strikes at the heart of the First Amendment.\u00a0 Speech that demeans on the basis of race, ethnicity, gender, religion, age, disability, or any other similar ground is hateful; but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express \"the thought that we hate.\"  United States v. Schwimmer, 279 U.\u00a0S. 644, 655 (1929) (Holmes, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second interest asserted is protecting the orderly flow of commerce.  See 808 F.\u00a03d, at 1379-1381 (Reyna, J., dissenting); Brief for Petitioner 49; Brief for Native American Organizations as Amicus Curiae 18-21.  Commerce, we are told, is disrupted by trademarks that \"involv[e] disparagement of race, gender, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sexual orientation, and similar demographic classification.\"  808 F.\u00a03d, at 1380-1381 (opinion of Reyna, J.).  Such trademarks are analogized to discriminatory conduct, which has been recognized to have an adverse effect on commerce.  See ibid.; Brief for Petitioner 49; Brief for Native American Organizations as Amici Curiae 18-20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A simple answer to this argument is that the disparagement clause is not \"narrowly drawn\" to drive out trademarks that support invidious discrimination.  The clause reaches any trademark that disparages any person, group, or institution.  It applies to trademarks like the following: \"Down with racists,\" \"Down with sexists,\" \"Down with homophobes.\"  It is not an anti-discrimination clause; it is a happy-talk clause.  In this way, it goes much further than is necessary to serve the interest asserted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The clause is far too broad in other ways as well.  The clause protects every person living or dead as well as every institution.  Is it conceivable that commerce would be disrupted by a trademark saying: \"James Buchanan was a disastrous president\" or \"Slavery is an evil institution\"?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is also a deeper problem with the argument that commercial speech may be cleansed of any expression likely to cause offense.  The commercial market is well stocked with merchandise that disparages prominent figures and groups, and the line between commercial and non-commercial speech is not always clear, as this case illustrates.  If affixing the commercial label permits the suppression of any speech that may lead to political or social \"volatility,\" free speech would be endangered.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, we hold that the disparagement clause violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.  The judgment of the Federal Circuit is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nOpinion of Kennedy, J.\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1293\nJOSEPH MATAL, INTERIM DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, PETITIONER v. SIMON SHIAO TAM\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit\n[June 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Sotomayor, and Justice Kagan join, concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) has denied the substantial benefits of federal trademark registration to the mark THE SLANTS.  The PTO did so under the mandate of the disparagement clause in 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a), which prohibits the registration of marks that may \"disparage .\u00a0.\u00a0. or bring .\u00a0.\u00a0. into contemp[t] or disrepute\" any \"persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court is correct to hold, \u00a71052(a) constitutes viewpoint discrimination--a form of speech suppression so potent that it must be subject to rigorous constitutional scrutiny.  The Government's action and the statute on which it is based cannot survive this scrutiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court is correct in its judgment, and I join Parts I, II, and III-A of its opinion.  This separate writing explains in greater detail why the First Amendment's protections against viewpoint discrimination apply to the trademark here.  It submits further that the viewpoint discrimination rationale renders unnecessary any extended treatment of other questions raised by the parties.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those few categories of speech that the government can regulate or punish--for instance, fraud, defamation, or incitement--are well established within our constitutional tradition.  See United States v. Stevens, 559 U.\u00a0S. 460, 468 (2010).  Aside from these and a few other narrow exceptions, it is a fundamental principle of the First Amendment that the government may not punish or suppress speech based on disapproval of the ideas or perspectives the speech conveys.  See Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819, 828-829 (1995).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Amendment guards against laws \"targeted at specific subject matter,\" a form of speech suppression known as content based discrimination.  Reed v. Town of Gilbert, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 12).  This category includes a subtype of laws that go further, aimed at the suppression of \"particular views .\u00a0.\u00a0. on a subject.\"  Rosenberger, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 829.  A law found to discriminate based on viewpoint is an \"egregious form of content discrimination,\" which is \"presumptively unconstitutional.\"  Id., at 829-830.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At its most basic, the test for viewpoint discrimination is whether--within the relevant subject category--the government has singled out a subset of messages for disfavor based on the views expressed.  See Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense & Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.\u00a0S. 788, 806 (1985) (\"[T]he government violates the First Amendment when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject\").  In the instant case, the disparagement clause the Government now seeks to implement and enforce identifies the relevant subject as \"persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols.\"  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a).  Within that category, an applicant may register a positive or benign mark but not a derogatory one.  The law thus reflects the Government's disapproval of a subset of messages it finds offensive.  This is the essence of viewpoint discrimination.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government disputes this conclusion.  It argues, to begin with, that the law is viewpoint neutral because it applies in equal measure to any trademark that demeans or offends.  This misses the point.  A subject that is first defined by content and then regulated or censored by mandating only one sort of comment is not viewpoint neutral.  To prohibit all sides from criticizing their opponents makes a law more viewpoint based, not less so.  Cf. Rosenberger, supra, at 831-832 (\"The .\u00a0.\u00a0. declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple ways\").  The logic of the Government's rule is that a law would be viewpoint neutral even if it provided that public officials could be praised but not condemned.  The First Amendment's viewpoint neutrality principle protects more than the right to identify with a particular side.  It protects the right to create and present arguments for particular positions in particular ways, as the speaker chooses.  By mandating positivity, the law here might silence dissent and distort the marketplace of ideas.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government next suggests that the statute is viewpoint neutral because the disparagement clause applies to trademarks regardless of the applicant's personal views or reasons for using the mark.  Instead, registration is denied based on the expected reaction of the applicant's audience.  In this way, the argument goes, it cannot be said that Government is acting with hostility toward a particular point of view.  For example, the Government does not dispute that respondent seeks to use his mark in a positive way.  Indeed, respondent endeavors to use The Slants to supplant a racial epithet, using new insights, musical talents, and wry humor to make it a badge of pride.  Respondent's application was denied not because the Government thought his object was to demean or offend but because the Government thought his trademark would have that effect on at least some Asian-Americans.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government may not insulate a law from charges of viewpoint discrimination by tying censorship to the reaction of the speaker's audience.  The Court has suggested that viewpoint discrimination occurs when the government intends to suppress a speaker's beliefs, Reed, supra, at ___-___ (slip op., at 11-12), but viewpoint discrimination need not take that form in every instance.  The danger of viewpoint discrimination is that the government is attempting to remove certain ideas or perspectives from a broader debate.  That danger is all the greater if the ideas or perspectives are ones a particular audience might think offensive, at least at first hearing.  An initial reaction may prompt further reflection, leading to a more reasoned, more tolerant position.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, a speech burden based on audience reactions is simply government hostility and intervention in a different guise.  The speech is targeted, after all, based on the government's disapproval of the speaker's choice of message.  And it is the government itself that is attempting in this case to decide whether the relevant audience would find the speech offensive.  For reasons like these, the Court's cases have long prohibited the government from justifying a First Amendment burden by pointing to the offensiveness of the speech to be suppressed.  See ante, at 23 (collecting examples).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government's argument in defense of the statute assumes that respondent's mark is a negative comment.  In addressing that argument on its own terms, this opinion is not intended to imply that the Government's interpretation is accurate.  From respondent's submissions, it is evident he would disagree that his mark means what the Government says it does.  The trademark will have the effect, respondent urges, of reclaiming an offensive term for the positive purpose of celebrating all that Asian-Americans can and do contribute to our diverse Nation.  Brief for Respondent 1-4, 42-43.  While thoughtful persons can agree or disagree with this approach, the dissonance between the trademark's potential to teach and the Government's insistence on its own, opposite, and negative interpretation confirms the constitutional vice of the statute.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties dispute whether trademarks are commercial speech and whether trademark registration should be considered a federal subsidy.  The former issue may turn on whether certain commercial concerns for the protection of trademarks might, as a general matter, be the basis for regulation.  However that issue is resolved, the viewpoint based discrimination at issue here necessarily invokes heightened scrutiny.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Commercial speech is no exception,\" the Court has explained, to the principle that the First Amendment \"requires heightened scrutiny whenever the government creates a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\"  Sorrell v. IMS Health Inc., 564 U.\u00a0S. 552, 566 (2011) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Unlike content based discrimination, discrimination based on viewpoint, including a regulation that targets speech for its offensiveness, remains of serious concern in the commercial context.  See Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products Corp., 463 U.\u00a0S. 60, 65, 71-72 (1983).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To the extent trademarks qualify as commercial speech, they are an example of why that term or category does not serve as a blanket exemption from the First Amendment's requirement of viewpoint neutrality.  Justice Holmes' reference to the \"free trade in ideas\" and the \"power of . . . thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,\" Abrams v. United States, 250 U.\u00a0S. 616, 630 (1919) (dissenting opinion), was a metaphor.  In the realm of trademarks, the metaphorical marketplace of ideas becomes a tangible, powerful reality.  Here that real marketplace exists as a matter of state law and our common-law tradition, quite without regard to the Federal Government.  See ante, at 2.  These marks make up part of the expression of everyday life, as with the names of entertainment groups, broadcast networks, designer clothing, newspapers, automobiles, candy bars, toys, and so on.  See Brief for Pro-Football, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 8 (collecting examples). Nonprofit organizations--ranging from medical-research charities and other humanitarian causes to political advocacy groups--also have trademarks, which they use to compete in a real economic sense for funding and other resources as they seek to persuade others to join their cause.  See id., at 8-9 (collecting examples).  To permit viewpoint discrimination in this context is to permit Government censorship.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case does not present the question of how other provisions of the Lanham Act should be analyzed under the First Amendment.  It is well settled, for instance, that to the extent a trademark is confusing or misleading the law can protect consumers and trademark owners.  See, e.g., FTC v. Winstead Hosiery Co., 285 U.\u00a0S. 483, 493 (1922) (\"The labels in question are literally false, and . . . palpably so.  All are, as the Commission found, calculated to deceive and do in fact deceive a substantial portion of the purchasing public\").  This case also does not involve laws related to product labeling or otherwise designed to protect consumers.  See Sorrell, supra, at 579 (\"[T]he government's legitimate interest in protecting consumers from commercial harms explains why commercial speech can be subject to greater governmental regulation than noncommercial speech\" (internal quotation marks omitted)). These considerations, however, do not alter the speech principles that bar the viewpoint discrimination embodied in the statutory provision at issue here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is telling that the Court's precedents have recognized just one narrow situation in which viewpoint discrimination is permissible: where the government itself is speaking or recruiting others to communicate a message on its behalf.  See Legal Services Corporation v. Velazquez, 531 U.\u00a0S. 533, 540-542 (2001); Board of Regents of Univ. of Wis. System v. Southworth, 529 U.\u00a0S. 217, 229, 235 (2000); Rosenberger, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 833.  The exception is necessary to allow the government to stake out positions and pursue policies.  See Southworth, supra, at 235; see also ante, at 13-14.  But it is also narrow, to prevent the government from claiming that every government program is exempt from the First Amendment.  These cases have identified a number of factors that, if present, suggest the government is speaking on its own behalf; but none are present here.  See ante, at 14-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There may be situations where private speakers are selected for a government program to assist the government in advancing a particular message.  That is not this case either.  The central purpose of trademark registration is to facilitate source identification.  To serve that broad purpose, the Government has provided the benefits of federal registration to millions of marks identifying every type of product and cause.  Registered trademarks do so by means of a wide diversity of words, symbols, and messages.  Whether a mark is disparaging bears no plausible relation to that goal.  While defining the purpose and scope of a federal program for these purposes can be complex, see, e.g., Agency for Int'l Development v. Alliance for Open Society Int'l, Inc., 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8), our cases are clear that viewpoint discrimination is not permitted where, as here, the Government \"expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers,\" Velazquez, supra, at 542 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all.  The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the government's benevolence.  Instead, our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, I join the Court's opinion in part and concur in the judgment.\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1293\nJOSEPH MATAL, INTERIM DIRECTOR, UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE, PETITIONER v.

Respondent failed to present his statutory argument either to the Patent and Trademark Office or to the Court of Appeals, and we declined respondent's invitation to grant certiorari on this question.  Ante, at 9.  I see no reason to address this legal question in the first instance.  See Star Athletica, L. L. C. v. Varsity Brands, Inc., 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 6).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I also write separately because \"I continue to believe that when the government seeks to restrict truthful speech in order to suppress the ideas it conveys, strict scrutiny is appropriate, whether or not the speech in question may be characterized as 'commercial.'\u00a0\"  Lorillard Tobacco Co. v. Reilly, 533 U.\u00a0S. 525, 572 (2001) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also, e.g., 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 517 U.\u00a0S. 484, 518 (1996) (same).  I nonetheless join Part IV of Justice Alito's opinion because it correctly concludes that the disparagement clause, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71052(a), is unconstitutional even under the less stringent test announced in Central Hudson Gas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.\u00a0Y., 447 U.\u00a0S. 557 (1980).\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In the opinion below, the Federal Circuit opined that although \"Section 43(a) allows for a federal suit to protect an unregistered trademark,\" \"it is not at all clear\" that respondent could bring suit under \u00a743(a) because \"there is no authority extending \u00a743(a) to marks denied under \u00a72(a)'s disparagement provision.\"  In re Tam, 808 F.\u00a03d 1321, 1344-1345, n.11 (en banc), as corrected (Feb. 11, 2016).  When drawing this conclusion, the Federal Circuit relied in part on our statement in Two Pesos that \"the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under \u00a72 of the Lanham Act are for the most part applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under \u00a743(a).\"  505 U.\u00a0S., at 768.  We need not decide today whether respondent could bring suit under \u00a743(a) if his application for federal registration had been lawfully denied under the disparagement clause.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The disparagement clause also prevents a trademark from being registered on the supplemental register.  \u00a71091(a).\nFootnote 3\u00a0By \"composite,\" we assume the PTO means component.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Tam advances a convoluted textual argument that goes as follows.  The definition of a \"person\" in 15 U. S. C. \u00a71127 does not include a \"non-juristic person,\" i.e., a group that cannot sue or be sued in its own right.  Brief for Respondent 46-47.  Such groups consist of multiple natural persons.  Therefore, the members of such groups are not \"persons\" under the disparagement clause.  Id., at 46-48.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument leads to the absurd result that no person is a \"person\" within the meaning of the disparagement clause.  This is so because every person is a member of a \"non-juristic\" group, e.g., right-handers, left-handers, women, men, people born on odd-numbered days, people born on even-numbered days.\nFootnote 5\u00a0The PTO has acknowledged that the guidelines \"for determining whether a mark is scandalous or disparaging are somewhat vague and the determination of whether a mark is scandalous or disparaging is necessarily a highly subjective one.\"  In re In Over Our Heads, Inc., 16 USPQ\u00a02d 1653, 1654 (TTAB 1990) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted).  The PTO has similarly observed that whether a mark is disparaging \"is highly subjective and, thus, general rules are difficult to postulate.\" Harjo v.

ALABAMA(2017)\nNo. 16-9282\nArgued: Decided: November 13, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan join, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Matthew Reeves was convicted by an Alabama jury of capital murder and sentenced to death.  He sought postconviction relief in state court based on, as relevant here, several claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.1  Among those claims, Reeves argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to hire an expert to evaluate him for intellectual disability, despite having sought and obtained funding and an appointment order from the state trial court to hire a specific neuropsychologist.  His postconviction counsel subsequently hired that same neuropsychologist, who concluded that Reeves was, in fact, intellectually disabled.  Reeves contended that this and other evidence could have been used during the penalty phase of his trial to establish mitigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alabama Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing on Reeves' postconviction petition, at which Reeves presented substantial evidence regarding his intellectual disability and his counsel's performance.  He did not, however, call his trial or appellate counsel to testify.  The court denied the petition, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.  In doing so, the Court of Criminal Appeals explained that a petitioner seeking postconviction relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel must question his counsel about his reasoning and actions.  Without considering the extensive record evidence before it regarding Reeves' counsel's performance or giving any explanation as to why that evidence did not prove that his counsel's actions were unreasonable, the Court of Criminal Appeals held that Reeves' failure to call his attorneys to testify was fatal to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.  The Alabama Supreme Court denied review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There can be no dispute that the imposition of a categorical rule that counsel must testify in order for a petitioner to succeed on a federal constitutional ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim contravenes our decisions requiring an objective inquiry into the adequacy and reasonableness of counsel's performance based on the full record before the court.  Even Alabama does not defend such a rule.  Instead, the dispute here is whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals in fact imposed such a rule in this case.  I believe it plainly did so.  For that reason, I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At his capital trial, Reeves was initially appointed two attorneys, Blanchard McLeod, Jr., and Marvin Wiggins, to represent him.  Before trial, McLeod and Wiggins filed a motion requesting that the court appoint Dr. John R. Goff, a clinical neuropsychologist, as an expert \"to evaluate, test, and interview\" Reeves and require the State to provide them with the necessary funds to hire Dr. Goff.  1 Record in No. 98-77 (Ala. Crim. App.), pp. 64-65 (Direct Appeal Record).  The trial court denied the motion, id., at 67, and McLeod and Wiggins requested rehearing.  In the rehearing request, the attorneys explained that they \"possesse[d] hundreds of pages of psychological, psychometric and behavioral analysis material\" and \"[t]hat a clinical neuropsychologist or a person of like standing and expertise [was] the only avenue open to the defense to compile [and] correlate this information, interview [Reeves,] and present this information in an orderly and informative fashion to the jury during the mitigation phase of the trial.\"  Id., at 68-69.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During a hearing on the request, McLeod represented that hiring Dr. Goff was critical to the attorneys' preparation for the mitigation phase of Reeves' trial.  He urged the importance of retaining Dr. Goff right away, as Dr. Goff would require time to review the existing records, interview people familiar with Reeves, and meet with Reeves several times prior to testifying.  3 Direct Appeal Record, Tr. in No. CC-97-31 (C.\u00a0C. Dallas Cty., Ala.), pp. 9-10.  As support for that point, McLeod recounted that, in a recent capital case in which another trial court had granted an \"identical\" motion to appoint Dr. Goff, the counsel there had filed \"at a very late date\" such that Dr. Goff \"did not have the time to adequately prepare\" for that defendant's hearing, and the death penalty was imposed.  Id., at 10.  The trial court reconsidered and granted the funding and appointment requests.  1 id., at 75.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly thereafter, McLeod withdrew as counsel and was replaced by Thomas Goggans.  Wiggins, however, remained as counsel on the case, and he and Goggans represented Reeves at trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite having received funding and an appointment order from the court, Reeves' trial counsel never contacted Dr. Goff, nor did they hire any other expert to evaluate Reeves for intellectual disability, notwithstanding the \"hundreds of pages\" of materials they possessed.  13 Record in No. CC-97-31.60 (Rule 32 Record), pp. 66-67; 4 id., at 697; 5 id., at 862.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the guilt phase of the trial concluded, the jury convicted Reeves of capital murder.  During the penalty phase, Reeves' trial counsel called three mitigation witnesses.  First, they called Detective Pat Grindle, the officer in charge of investigating the murder, who gave a physical description of Reeves' childhood home based on his search of the house during the investigation.  8 Direct Appeal Record, Tr. 1118-1122; ___ So. 3d ___, 2016 WL 3247447, *3 (Ala. Crim. App., June 10, 2016).  Next, petitioner's mother testified about Reeves' childhood, including that he had repeated two grades, was put in \"special classes,\" received mental health services starting in second or third grade, and was expelled in eighth grade.  8 Direct Appeal Record, Tr. 1127.  She also testified that, when he was young, Reeves had \"little blackout spells\" and would report \"seeing things,\" and that he was shot in the head a few months before the murder for which he was convicted.  Id., at 1127, 1131, 1137, 1120-1150.  Finally, Reeves' counsel called Dr. Kathleen Ronan, a court-appointed clinical psychologist, with whom counsel met and spoke for the first time shortly before she took the witness stand.  4 Rule 32 Record 609.  Dr. Ronan had evaluated Reeves for the purposes of assessing his competency to stand trial and his mental state at the time of the offense, but had not conducted a penalty-phase evaluation or evaluated Reeves for intellectual disability.  Ibid.  Dr. Ronan testified that she had given Reeves only the verbal part of an intelligence test, noting that this was the \"portion [of the test that] taps into the issues that were being asked by the Court,\" and had concluded based on that partial assessment that he was at \"the borderline of mental retardation.\"  8 Direct Appeal Record, Tr. 1165.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury deliberated for less than an hour.  8 Direct Appeal Record 1227.  By a vote of 10 to 2, they recommended that Reeves be sentenced to death.2  2 id., at 233.  The trial judge then considered the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and found two mitigating factors: Reeves' age and lack of significant prior criminal history.  Id., at 236.  He expressly refused to find that Reeves' \"capacity .\u00a0.\u00a0. to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.\"  Ala. Code \u00a713A-5-51(6) (2015); 2 Direct Appeal Record 237.  The trial judge found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the two mitigating ones and sentenced Reeves to death.  Id., at 239.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, during which Goggans continued to represent him, Reeves, with the assistance of new counsel, sought postconviction relief in state court pursuant to Rule 32 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.  He alleged, inter alia, ineffective assistance of both his trial and appellate counsel.  Among his claims were that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to hire Dr. Goff or another neuropsychologist to evaluate him for intellectual disability, failing to present expert testimony of intellectual disability during the penalty phase to establish a mitigating circumstance, and failing to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alabama Circuit Court held a 2-day hearing on Reeves' Rule 32 petition.  Reeves did not call McLeod, Wiggins, or Goggans to testify.3  He did, however, call Dr. Goff, who had evaluated Reeves for purposes of his postconviction petition.  Dr. Goff testified based on his review of Reeves' childhood and adolescent records and the results of a battery of tests designed to assess IQ, neuropsychological functioning, cognitive abilities, and adaptive functioning.  He concluded that Reeves had significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and significant deficits in multiple areas of adaptive functioning, both of which manifested before Reeves was 18 years old, and that Reeves therefore was intellectually disabled.  2016 WL 3247447, *11-*12.  Dr. Goff further testified that, had Reeves' trial counsel asked him to evaluate Reeves years earlier for purposes of testifying at trial, he would have performed similar evaluations and reached the same conclusion.  13 Rule 32 Record 21-22, 66-68; 4 id., at 704.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reeves also introduced testimony from Dr. Ronan about the limitations of her earlier evaluation.  She stated in an affidavit that even though she had been asked \"only to evaluate [Reeves] for the purposes of Competence to Stand Trial and Mental State at the Time of Offense, i.e., for the trial phase of the case,\" and \"was not requested to complete a sentencing phase evaluation\" or \"extensive clinical evaluation regarding mental retardation,\" Reeves' counsel nonetheless \"called [her] to testify at the sentencing phase.\"  Id., at 609.  Dr. Ronan explained that \"[t]he evaluation for [c]apital sentencing would contain different components than those for the trial phase evaluations, and would be more extensive in terms of testing and background investigation.\"  Id., at 610.  She confirmed that Reeves' counsel would have known about these differences, because she \"informed [them] as to the limitations of any testimony during [c]apital sentencing, in that the original evaluation was not performed for that purpose.\"  Id., at 609.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Reeves presented a report and testimony from Dr. Karen Salekin, a forensic and developmental psychologist who conducted a mitigation evaluation.  13 id., at 111, 118, 125.  Dr. Salekin testified about her assessment of the risk factors in Reeves' life and stated that, based on her review of the evidence presented at trial, Dr. Ronan and Reeves' mother had failed to identify several of those factors and had inadequately addressed the impact of others during their testimony at the sentencing hearing.  Id., at 130-190.  Among those factors were the harmful influence of Reeves' brother and Reeves' exposure to domestic violence, guns, and substance abuse as a child.  Id., at 140, 144-150.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State presented one rebuttal witness, Dr. Glen David King, a clinical and forensic psychologist who testified that, based on his testing and the information available to him, Reeves \"was in the borderline range of intellectual ability, but was not intellectually disabled.\"  2016 WL 3247447, *18.  On cross-examination, Dr. King acknowledged that Reeves had achieved a score of 68 on an IQ test Dr. King administered, and on that basis, suffered from significant subaverage intellectual functioning.  Ibid.  Dr. King also testified on cross-examination that his testing revealed that Reeves' adaptive functioning skills in three categories--domestic activity, prevocational\/vocational activity, and self-direction--were in the 25th percentile of developmentally disabled individuals.  Id., at *17-*18; 14 Rule 32 Record 265-268, 273-280; 2 id., at 385.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the Rule 32 hearing, the Circuit Court held that Reeves failed to prove his ineffective-assistance claims.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on the basis that Reeves did not present testimony of his former counsel.  The court stressed that \"\u00a0'to overcome the strong presumption of effectiveness, a Rule 32 petitioner must, at his evidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding his or her actions and reasoning.'\u00a0\"  2016 WL 3247447, *29 (quoting Stallworth v. State, 171 So. 3d 53, 92 (Ala. Crim. App. 2013); emphasis in original).  \"The burden was on Reeves to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his counsel's challenged decisions were not the result of reasonable strategy,\" the court explained.  2016 WL 3247447, *31.  \"[B]ecause Reeves failed to call his counsel to testify, the record is silent as to the reasons trial counsel\" made various decisions, including the choice \"not to hire Dr. Goff or another neuropsychologist to evaluate Reeves for intellectual disability\" and the choice \"not to present testimony from such an expert during the penalty phase of the trial\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0in order to establish a mitigating circumstance.\"  Ibid.  The court therefore concluded, without any consideration of the ample evidence before it of Reeves' counsel's actions and reasoning, that the presumption of effectiveness had not been disturbed and rejected Reeves' ineffective-assistance claims.  Id., at *32.  The Alabama Supreme Court denied review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reeves petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  He contended that the state appellate court's position that a defendant must present his counsel's testimony to establish that his counsel's performance was deficient is unreasonable under and at odds with Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984).  I agree.  Because I further agree that the proceeding below was tainted by this constitutional error, I would grant the petition and summarily reverse.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strickland established the legal principles governing ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.  Namely, a defendant must show both deficient performance and prejudice.  Id., at 687.  It is the first prong of the Strickland test that is at issue here.  In assessing deficiency, a court presumes that counsel \"rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\"  Id., at 690.  The burden to rebut that strong presumption rests with the defendant, id., at 687, who must present evidence of what his counsel did or did not do, see Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has never, however, required that a defendant present evidence of his counsel's actions or reasoning in the form of testimony from counsel, nor has it ever rejected an ineffective-assistance claim solely because the record did not include such testimony.  Rather, Strickland and its progeny establish that when a court is presented with an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, it should look to the full record presented by the defendant to determine whether the defendant satisfied his burden to prove deficient performance.  The absence of counsel's testimony may make it more difficult for a defendant to meet his burden, but that fact alone does not absolve a court of its duty to look at the whole record and evaluate the reasonableness of counsel's professional assistance in light of that evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That Strickland does not require testimony from counsel to succeed on an ineffective-assistance claim is clear from past decisions in which this Court has found deficient performance despite such testimony, based on review of the full record.  For example, in Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.\u00a0S. 510 (2003), the Court considered the decision of two attorneys \"to limit the scope of their investigation into potential mitigating evidence.\"  Id., at 521.  Counsel justified their limited investigation as reflecting a tactical judgment to pursue an alternative strategy, ibid., but the Court did not simply accept that explanation at face value.  Instead, it \"conduct[ed] an objective review of their performance.\"  Id., at 523.  In reviewing \"[t]he record as a whole,\" id., at 531, the Court considered, among other evidence, that the State had made funds available for the retention of a forensic social worker to prepare a social history report, yet counsel had decided not to commission such a report, id., at 516-517, 524.  Based on the record, the Court concluded that the attorneys' conduct was unreasonable, \"not reasoned strategic judgment\" as they had testified.  Id., at 526.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.\u00a0S. 30 (2009) (per curiam), the Court again addressed a claim of an attorney's alleged failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence.  Counsel there also testified at the postconviction hearing about his preparation for the penalty phase, but the Court still looked at the full record to assess whether the defendant had nevertheless demonstrated deficient performance.  For instance, the Court pointed to court-ordered competency evaluations in the record that discussed the defendant's academic history, military service, and wounds sustained during combat, and observed, based on that evidence, that counsel had \"ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which he should have been aware.\"  Id., at 40.  Again, here, trial counsel's testimony about his reasoning did not defeat the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, given the Court's consideration of the evidence in the record as a whole.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Porter and Wiggins illustrate, trial counsel's testimony is not sufficient to find adequate performance when the full record rebuts the reasonableness of the proffered justification.  It cannot be, then, that such testimony is necessary in every case.  Where counsel does not testify but the defendant offers other record evidence, a court can simply presume that counsel would have justified his actions as tactical decisions and then consider whether the record rebuts the reasonableness of that justification.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only is the imposition of a per\u00a0se rule requiring testimonial evidence from counsel inconsistent with our precedent, it is also at odds with the Court's observation in Massaro v. United States, 538 U.\u00a0S. 500 (2003), that ineffective-assistance claims need not always be brought on collateral review because \"[t]here may be cases in which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent from the record that appellate counsel will consider it advisable to raise the issue on direct appeal\" or an appellate court will address the deficiencies sua\u00a0sponte.  Id., at 508.  As a challenge on direct appeal is made without any further factual development, Massaro necessarily recognized that an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim can be proved even absent counsel's testimony.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, that courts have a duty to look to the whole record when considering whether a defendant has met his burden makes good practical sense.  There are many reasons why counsel may be unable or unwilling to testify about his reasoning, including death, illness, or memory loss.  Such circumstances should not in and of themselves defeat an ineffective-assistance claim.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alabama rightly does not attempt to defend the Court of Criminal Appeals' rule on its merits.  Instead, the State asserts that Reeves misreads the decision below.  The Court of Criminal Appeals, it maintains, did not hold that trial counsel's testimony is required to prove an ineffective-assistance claim.  Brief in Opposition 14.  Rather, in the State's view, the court \"made the sound decision that Reeves failed to prove his ineffective assistance of counsel claims\" because he \"failed to present any evidence, including the testimony of trial counsel, to prove that his attorney's strategic decisions were unreasonable.\"  Id., at 16.  That position, however, is belied by the record before the court and the decision's express language and analysis.  Reeves presented ample evidence in support of his claim that his counsel's performance was deficient, but the court never considered or explained why, in light of that evidence, his counsel's strategic decisions were reasonable.  It rested its decision solely on the fact that Reeves had not called his counsel to testify at the postconviction hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the course of explaining the requirement that a defendant must overcome the strong presumption that counsel acted reasonably with \"evidence to the contrary,\" 2016 WL 3247447, *28 (emphasis in original), the decision below plainly stated, with emphasis, that \"\u00a0'to overcome the strong presumption of effectiveness, a Rule 32 petitioner must, at his evidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding his or her actions and reasoning,'\u00a0\" id., at *29 (quoting Stallworth, 171 So. 3d, at 92).  That pronouncement was followed by citations to other Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals cases with explanatory parentheticals noting that those decisions had held \"that a petitioner failed to meet his burden of overcoming the presumption that counsel were effective because the petitioner failed to question .\u00a0.\u00a0. counsel regarding their reasoning.\"  2016 WL 3247447, *29 (citing Broadnax v. State, 130 So. 3d 1232, 155-156 (2013); Whitson v. State, 109 So. 3d 665, 676 (2012); Brooks v. State, 929 So.\u00a02d 491, 497 (2005); McGahee v. State, 885 So.\u00a02d 191, 221-222 (2003)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not mere stock language.  The appellate court unquestionably applied this requirement to Reeves' claims.  At the outset of its analysis, it announced that \"Reeves's failure to call his attorneys to testify is fatal to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"  2016 WL 3247447, *30.  As described above, the court explained that \"because Reeves failed to call his counsel to testify, the record [was] silent\" as to his counsel's reasons and actions, and the presumption of effective assistance therefore could not be rebutted.  Id., at *31, *32.  In total, the court emphasized that Reeves did not call his counsel to testify at five different points in the opinion.  Id., at *4, *28, *30, *31, *32.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the whole-record analysis undertaken in Wiggins and Porter, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals never considered whether the other, non-counsel-testimony evidence before it could rebut the presumption of reasonable professional assistance.  Its failure to do so is baffling given that there was ample such evidence in the record below, all of which Reeves pointed the court to in his brief.  See Brief for Appellant in No. CR-13-1504, pp. 58-82.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For instance, the Court of Criminal Appeals had before it trial counsel's two motions for the appointment and funding of Dr. Goff, in which they explained why his assistance and testimony would be critical to the case; the representations made by Reeves' counsel during the  pretrial hearing on the rehearing motion; and the trial court's order granting the request.  From those motions and representations, the court knew that trial counsel had in their possession voluminous materials bearing on Reeves' intellectual impairments.  The court further knew from the record and Dr. Goff's testimony at the Rule 32 hearing that, despite the appointment order and funding, Reeves' counsel never contacted him and never obtained any other intellectual disability evaluation in preparation for trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court also knew from Dr. Ronan's affidavit that the first time Reeves' counsel spoke with her was shortly before she took the stand and that she had not conducted a penalty-stage evaluation, evaluated Reeves for intellectual disability, or administered a complete IQ test.  Moreover, it knew that a capital sentencing evaluation would have involved different components and been more extensive, and that Reeves' attorneys were informed as to such differences.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court, too, knew that Dr. Salekin had presented significant mitigation evidence at the Rule 32 hearing that was not set forth in any testimony during the sentencing-phase hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was not free to ignore this evidence simply because Reeves did not call his counsel to testify at the postconviction hearing.  On this point, Strickland could not be more clear:\n\"[A] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel's challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel's conduct.  A convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.  The court must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 690.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reeves identified the omissions of his counsel that he alleged were constitutionally deficient.  He presented evidence of what his counsel knew, which included several red flags indicating intellectual disability; what his counsel believed to be necessary for his defense, which included funding for an expert to evaluate him for intellectual disability; what his counsel did, which included repeatedly asking for and securing such funding; and what his counsel did not do, which included failing to then use that funding to hire such an expert and failing to present evidence of intellectual disability as mitigation.  In so doing, Reeves upheld his end of the evidentiary bargain.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, on the other hand, did not.  It never explained, in light of the substantial record before it, why the choices Reeves' counsel made were reasonable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strickland and its progeny demand more.  In light of the constitutional error below, I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari, reverse, and remand so that the Court of Criminal Appeals could explain why, given the full factual record, Reeves' counsel's choices constituted reasonable performance.  Instead, the Court has cleared the way for Reeves' execution.  That is a result with which I cannot agree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n\n\nMATTHEW REEVES v. ALABAMA\non petition for writ of certiorari to the court of criminal appeals of alabama\nNo. 16-9282.\u2003Decided November 13, 2017\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg and Justice Kagan join, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Matthew Reeves was convicted by an Alabama jury of capital murder and sentenced to death.  He sought postconviction relief in state court based on, as relevant here, several claims of ineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel.1  Among those claims, Reeves argued that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to hire an expert to evaluate him for intellectual disability, despite having sought and obtained funding and an appointment order from the state trial court to hire a specific neuropsychologist.  His postconviction counsel subsequently hired that same neuropsychologist, who concluded that Reeves was, in fact, intellectually disabled.  Reeves contended that this and other evidence could have been used during the penalty phase of his trial to establish mitigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alabama Circuit Court held an evidentiary hearing on Reeves' postconviction petition, at which Reeves presented substantial evidence regarding his intellectual disability and his counsel's performance.  He did not, however, call his trial or appellate counsel to testify.  The court denied the petition, and the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed.  In doing so, the Court of Criminal Appeals explained that a petitioner seeking postconviction relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel must question his counsel about his reasoning and actions.  Without considering the extensive record evidence before it regarding Reeves' counsel's performance or giving any explanation as to why that evidence did not prove that his counsel's actions were unreasonable, the Court of Criminal Appeals held that Reeves' failure to call his attorneys to testify was fatal to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.  The Alabama Supreme Court denied review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There can be no dispute that the imposition of a categorical rule that counsel must testify in order for a petitioner to succeed on a federal constitutional ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim contravenes our decisions requiring an objective inquiry into the adequacy and reasonableness of counsel's performance based on the full record before the court.  Even Alabama does not defend such a rule.  Instead, the dispute here is whether the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals in fact imposed such a rule in this case.  I believe it plainly did so.  For that reason, I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At his capital trial, Reeves was initially appointed two attorneys, Blanchard McLeod, Jr., and Marvin Wiggins, to represent him.  Before trial, McLeod and Wiggins filed a motion requesting that the court appoint Dr. John R. Goff, a clinical neuropsychologist, as an expert \"to evaluate, test, and interview\" Reeves and require the State to provide them with the necessary funds to hire Dr. Goff.  1 Record in No. 98-77 (Ala. Crim. App.), pp. 64-65 (Direct Appeal Record).  The trial court denied the motion, id., at 67, and McLeod and Wiggins requested rehearing.  In the rehearing request, the attorneys explained that they \"possesse[d] hundreds of pages of psychological, psychometric and behavioral analysis material\" and \"[t]hat a clinical neuropsychologist or a person of like standing and expertise [was] the only avenue open to the defense to compile [and] correlate this information, interview [Reeves,] and present this information in an orderly and informative fashion to the jury during the mitigation phase of the trial.\"  Id., at 68-69.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During a hearing on the request, McLeod represented that hiring Dr. Goff was critical to the attorneys' preparation for the mitigation phase of Reeves' trial.  He urged the importance of retaining Dr. Goff right away, as Dr. Goff would require time to review the existing records, interview people familiar with Reeves, and meet with Reeves several times prior to testifying.  3 Direct Appeal Record, Tr. in No. CC-97-31 (C.\u00a0C. Dallas Cty., Ala.), pp. 9-10.  As support for that point, McLeod recounted that, in a recent capital case in which another trial court had granted an \"identical\" motion to appoint Dr. Goff, the counsel there had filed \"at a very late date\" such that Dr. Goff \"did not have the time to adequately prepare\" for that defendant's hearing, and the death penalty was imposed.  Id., at 10.  The trial court reconsidered and granted the funding and appointment requests.  1 id., at 75.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly thereafter, McLeod withdrew as counsel and was replaced by Thomas Goggans.  Wiggins, however, remained as counsel on the case, and he and Goggans represented Reeves at trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite having received funding and an appointment order from the court, Reeves' trial counsel never contacted Dr. Goff, nor did they hire any other expert to evaluate Reeves for intellectual disability, notwithstanding the \"hundreds of pages\" of materials they possessed.  13 Record in No. CC-97-31.60 (Rule 32 Record), pp. 66-67; 4 id., at 697; 5 id., at 862.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the guilt phase of the trial concluded, the jury convicted Reeves of capital murder.  During the penalty phase, Reeves' trial counsel called three mitigation witnesses.  First, they called Detective Pat Grindle, the officer in charge of investigating the murder, who gave a physical description of Reeves' childhood home based on his search of the house during the investigation.  8 Direct Appeal Record, Tr. 1118-1122; ___ So. 3d ___, 2016 WL 3247447, *3 (Ala. Crim. App., June 10, 2016).  Next, petitioner's mother testified about Reeves' childhood, including that he had repeated two grades, was put in \"special classes,\" received mental health services starting in second or third grade, and was expelled in eighth grade.  8 Direct Appeal Record, Tr. 1127.  She also testified that, when he was young, Reeves had \"little blackout spells\" and would report \"seeing things,\" and that he was shot in the head a few months before the murder for which he was convicted.  Id., at 1127, 1131, 1137, 1120-1150.  Finally, Reeves' counsel called Dr. Kathleen Ronan, a court-appointed clinical psychologist, with whom counsel met and spoke for the first time shortly before she took the witness stand.  4 Rule 32 Record 609.  Dr. Ronan had evaluated Reeves for the purposes of assessing his competency to stand trial and his mental state at the time of the offense, but had not conducted a penalty-phase evaluation or evaluated Reeves for intellectual disability.  Ibid.  Dr. Ronan testified that she had given Reeves only the verbal part of an intelligence test, noting that this was the \"portion [of the test that] taps into the issues that were being asked by the Court,\" and had concluded based on that partial assessment that he was at \"the borderline of mental retardation.\"  8 Direct Appeal Record, Tr. 1165.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury deliberated for less than an hour.  8 Direct Appeal Record 1227.  By a vote of 10 to 2, they recommended that Reeves be sentenced to death.2  2 id., at 233.  The trial judge then considered the aggravating and mitigating circumstances and found two mitigating factors: Reeves' age and lack of significant prior criminal history.  Id., at 236.  He expressly refused to find that Reeves' \"capacity .\u00a0.\u00a0. to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law was substantially impaired.\"  Ala. Code \u00a713A-5-51(6) (2015); 2 Direct Appeal Record 237.  The trial judge found that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the two mitigating ones and sentenced Reeves to death.  Id., at 239.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, during which Goggans continued to represent him, Reeves, with the assistance of new counsel, sought postconviction relief in state court pursuant to Rule 32 of the Alabama Rules of Criminal Procedure.  He alleged, inter alia, ineffective assistance of both his trial and appellate counsel.  Among his claims were that his trial counsel were ineffective for failing to hire Dr. Goff or another neuropsychologist to evaluate him for intellectual disability, failing to present expert testimony of intellectual disability during the penalty phase to establish a mitigating circumstance, and failing to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alabama Circuit Court held a 2-day hearing on Reeves' Rule 32 petition.  Reeves did not call McLeod, Wiggins, or Goggans to testify.3  He did, however, call Dr. Goff, who had evaluated Reeves for purposes of his postconviction petition.  Dr. Goff testified based on his review of Reeves' childhood and adolescent records and the results of a battery of tests designed to assess IQ, neuropsychological functioning, cognitive abilities, and adaptive functioning.  He concluded that Reeves had significantly subaverage intellectual functioning and significant deficits in multiple areas of adaptive functioning, both of which manifested before Reeves was 18 years old, and that Reeves therefore was intellectually disabled.  2016 WL 3247447, *11-*12.  Dr. Goff further testified that, had Reeves' trial counsel asked him to evaluate Reeves years earlier for purposes of testifying at trial, he would have performed similar evaluations and reached the same conclusion.  13 Rule 32 Record 21-22, 66-68; 4 id., at 704.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reeves also introduced testimony from Dr. Ronan about the limitations of her earlier evaluation.  She stated in an affidavit that even though she had been asked \"only to evaluate [Reeves] for the purposes of Competence to Stand Trial and Mental State at the Time of Offense, i.e., for the trial phase of the case,\" and \"was not requested to complete a sentencing phase evaluation\" or \"extensive clinical evaluation regarding mental retardation,\" Reeves' counsel nonetheless \"called [her] to testify at the sentencing phase.\"  Id., at 609.  Dr. Ronan explained that \"[t]he evaluation for [c]apital sentencing would contain different components than those for the trial phase evaluations, and would be more extensive in terms of testing and background investigation.\"  Id., at 610.  She confirmed that Reeves' counsel would have known about these differences, because she \"informed [them] as to the limitations of any testimony during [c]apital sentencing, in that the original evaluation was not performed for that purpose.\"  Id., at 609.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, Reeves presented a report and testimony from Dr. Karen Salekin, a forensic and developmental psychologist who conducted a mitigation evaluation.  13 id., at 111, 118, 125.  Dr. Salekin testified about her assessment of the risk factors in Reeves' life and stated that, based on her review of the evidence presented at trial, Dr. Ronan and Reeves' mother had failed to identify several of those factors and had inadequately addressed the impact of others during their testimony at the sentencing hearing.  Id., at 130-190.  Among those factors were the harmful influence of Reeves' brother and Reeves' exposure to domestic violence, guns, and substance abuse as a child.  Id., at 140, 144-150.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State presented one rebuttal witness, Dr. Glen David King, a clinical and forensic psychologist who testified that, based on his testing and the information available to him, Reeves \"was in the borderline range of intellectual ability, but was not intellectually disabled.\"  2016 WL 3247447, *18.  On cross-examination, Dr. King acknowledged that Reeves had achieved a score of 68 on an IQ test Dr. King administered, and on that basis, suffered from significant subaverage intellectual functioning.  Ibid.  Dr. King also testified on cross-examination that his testing revealed that Reeves' adaptive functioning skills in three categories--domestic activity, prevocational\/vocational activity, and self-direction--were in the 25th percentile of developmentally disabled individuals.  Id., at *17-*18; 14 Rule 32 Record 265-268, 273-280; 2 id., at 385.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the Rule 32 hearing, the Circuit Court held that Reeves failed to prove his ineffective-assistance claims.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed on the basis that Reeves did not present testimony of his former counsel.  The court stressed that \"\u00a0'to overcome the strong presumption of effectiveness, a Rule 32 petitioner must, at his evidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding his or her actions and reasoning.'\u00a0\"  2016 WL 3247447, *29 (quoting Stallworth v. State, 171 So. 3d 53, 92 (Ala. Crim. App. 2013); emphasis in original).  \"The burden was on Reeves to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that his counsel's challenged decisions were not the result of reasonable strategy,\" the court explained.  2016 WL 3247447, *31.  \"[B]ecause Reeves failed to call his counsel to testify, the record is silent as to the reasons trial counsel\" made various decisions, including the choice \"not to hire Dr. Goff or another neuropsychologist to evaluate Reeves for intellectual disability\" and the choice \"not to present testimony from such an expert during the penalty phase of the trial\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0in order to establish a mitigating circumstance.\"  Ibid.  The court therefore concluded, without any consideration of the ample evidence before it of Reeves' counsel's actions and reasoning, that the presumption of effectiveness had not been disturbed and rejected Reeves' ineffective-assistance claims.  Id., at *32.  The Alabama Supreme Court denied review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reeves petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  He contended that the state appellate court's position that a defendant must present his counsel's testimony to establish that his counsel's performance was deficient is unreasonable under and at odds with Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984).  I agree.  Because I further agree that the proceeding below was tainted by this constitutional error, I would grant the petition and summarily reverse.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strickland established the legal principles governing ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.  Namely, a defendant must show both deficient performance and prejudice.  Id., at 687.  It is the first prong of the Strickland test that is at issue here.  In assessing deficiency, a court presumes that counsel \"rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\"  Id., at 690.  The burden to rebut that strong presumption rests with the defendant, id., at 687, who must present evidence of what his counsel did or did not do, see Burt v. Titlow, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has never, however, required that a defendant present evidence of his counsel's actions or reasoning in the form of testimony from counsel, nor has it ever rejected an ineffective-assistance claim solely because the record did not include such testimony.  Rather, Strickland and its progeny establish that when a court is presented with an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, it should look to the full record presented by the defendant to determine whether the defendant satisfied his burden to prove deficient performance.  The absence of counsel's testimony may make it more difficult for a defendant to meet his burden, but that fact alone does not absolve a court of its duty to look at the whole record and evaluate the reasonableness of counsel's professional assistance in light of that evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That Strickland does not require testimony from counsel to succeed on an ineffective-assistance claim is clear from past decisions in which this Court has found deficient performance despite such testimony, based on review of the full record.  For example, in Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.\u00a0S. 510 (2003), the Court considered the decision of two attorneys \"to limit the scope of their investigation into potential mitigating evidence.\"  Id., at 521.  Counsel justified their limited investigation as reflecting a tactical judgment to pursue an alternative strategy, ibid., but the Court did not simply accept that explanation at face value.  Instead, it \"conduct[ed] an objective review of their performance.\"  Id., at 523.  In reviewing \"[t]he record as a whole,\" id., at 531, the Court considered, among other evidence, that the State had made funds available for the retention of a forensic social worker to prepare a social history report, yet counsel had decided not to commission such a report, id., at 516-517, 524.  Based on the record, the Court concluded that the attorneys' conduct was unreasonable, \"not reasoned strategic judgment\" as they had testified.  Id., at 526.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.\u00a0S. 30 (2009) (per curiam), the Court again addressed a claim of an attorney's alleged failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence.  Counsel there also testified at the postconviction hearing about his preparation for the penalty phase, but the Court still looked at the full record to assess whether the defendant had nevertheless demonstrated deficient performance.  For instance, the Court pointed to court-ordered competency evaluations in the record that discussed the defendant's academic history, military service, and wounds sustained during combat, and observed, based on that evidence, that counsel had \"ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which he should have been aware.\"  Id., at 40.  Again, here, trial counsel's testimony about his reasoning did not defeat the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, given the Court's consideration of the evidence in the record as a whole.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Porter and Wiggins illustrate, trial counsel's testimony is not sufficient to find adequate performance when the full record rebuts the reasonableness of the proffered justification.  It cannot be, then, that such testimony is necessary in every case.  Where counsel does not testify but the defendant offers other record evidence, a court can simply presume that counsel would have justified his actions as tactical decisions and then consider whether the record rebuts the reasonableness of that justification.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not only is the imposition of a per\u00a0se rule requiring testimonial evidence from counsel inconsistent with our precedent, it is also at odds with the Court's observation in Massaro v. United States, 538 U.\u00a0S. 500 (2003), that ineffective-assistance claims need not always be brought on collateral review because \"[t]here may be cases in which trial counsel's ineffectiveness is so apparent from the record that appellate counsel will consider it advisable to raise the issue on direct appeal\" or an appellate court will address the deficiencies sua\u00a0sponte.  Id., at 508.  As a challenge on direct appeal is made without any further factual development, Massaro necessarily recognized that an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim can be proved even absent counsel's testimony.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, that courts have a duty to look to the whole record when considering whether a defendant has met his burden makes good practical sense.  There are many reasons why counsel may be unable or unwilling to testify about his reasoning, including death, illness, or memory loss.  Such circumstances should not in and of themselves defeat an ineffective-assistance claim.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alabama rightly does not attempt to defend the Court of Criminal Appeals' rule on its merits.  Instead, the State asserts that Reeves misreads the decision below.  The Court of Criminal Appeals, it maintains, did not hold that trial counsel's testimony is required to prove an ineffective-assistance claim.  Brief in Opposition 14.  Rather, in the State's view, the court \"made the sound decision that Reeves failed to prove his ineffective assistance of counsel claims\" because he \"failed to present any evidence, including the testimony of trial counsel, to prove that his attorney's strategic decisions were unreasonable.\"  Id., at 16.  That position, however, is belied by the record before the court and the decision's express language and analysis.  Reeves presented ample evidence in support of his claim that his counsel's performance was deficient, but the court never considered or explained why, in light of that evidence, his counsel's strategic decisions were reasonable.  It rested its decision solely on the fact that Reeves had not called his counsel to testify at the postconviction hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the course of explaining the requirement that a defendant must overcome the strong presumption that counsel acted reasonably with \"evidence to the contrary,\" 2016 WL 3247447, *28 (emphasis in original), the decision below plainly stated, with emphasis, that \"\u00a0'to overcome the strong presumption of effectiveness, a Rule 32 petitioner must, at his evidentiary hearing, question trial counsel regarding his or her actions and reasoning,'\u00a0\" id., at *29 (quoting Stallworth, 171 So. 3d, at 92).  That pronouncement was followed by citations to other Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals cases with explanatory parentheticals noting that those decisions had held \"that a petitioner failed to meet his burden of overcoming the presumption that counsel were effective because the petitioner failed to question .\u00a0.\u00a0. counsel regarding their reasoning.\"  2016 WL 3247447, *29 (citing Broadnax v. State, 130 So. 3d 1232, 155-156 (2013); Whitson v. State, 109 So. 3d 665, 676 (2012); Brooks v. State, 929 So.\u00a02d 491, 497 (2005); McGahee v. State, 885 So.\u00a02d 191, 221-222 (2003)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This was not mere stock language.  The appellate court unquestionably applied this requirement to Reeves' claims.  At the outset of its analysis, it announced that \"Reeves's failure to call his attorneys to testify is fatal to his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel.\"  2016 WL 3247447, *30.  As described above, the court explained that \"because Reeves failed to call his counsel to testify, the record [was] silent\" as to his counsel's reasons and actions, and the presumption of effective assistance therefore could not be rebutted.  Id., at *31, *32.  In total, the court emphasized that Reeves did not call his counsel to testify at five different points in the opinion.  Id., at *4, *28, *30, *31, *32.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the whole-record analysis undertaken in Wiggins and Porter, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals never considered whether the other, non-counsel-testimony evidence before it could rebut the presumption of reasonable professional assistance.  Its failure to do so is baffling given that there was ample such evidence in the record below, all of which Reeves pointed the court to in his brief.  See Brief for Appellant in No. CR-13-1504, pp. 58-82.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For instance, the Court of Criminal Appeals had before it trial counsel's two motions for the appointment and funding of Dr. Goff, in which they explained why his assistance and testimony would be critical to the case; the representations made by Reeves' counsel during the  pretrial hearing on the rehearing motion; and the trial court's order granting the request.  From those motions and representations, the court knew that trial counsel had in their possession voluminous materials bearing on Reeves' intellectual impairments.  The court further knew from the record and Dr. Goff's testimony at the Rule 32 hearing that, despite the appointment order and funding, Reeves' counsel never contacted him and never obtained any other intellectual disability evaluation in preparation for trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court also knew from Dr. Ronan's affidavit that the first time Reeves' counsel spoke with her was shortly before she took the stand and that she had not conducted a penalty-stage evaluation, evaluated Reeves for intellectual disability, or administered a complete IQ test.  Moreover, it knew that a capital sentencing evaluation would have involved different components and been more extensive, and that Reeves' attorneys were informed as to such differences.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court, too, knew that Dr. Salekin had presented significant mitigation evidence at the Rule 32 hearing that was not set forth in any testimony during the sentencing-phase hearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals was not free to ignore this evidence simply because Reeves did not call his counsel to testify at the postconviction hearing.  On this point, Strickland could not be more clear:\n\"[A] court deciding an actual ineffectiveness claim must judge the reasonableness of counsel's challenged conduct on the facts of the particular case, viewed as of the time of counsel's conduct.  A convicted defendant making a claim of ineffective assistance must identify the acts or omissions of counsel that are alleged not to have been the result of reasonable professional judgment.  The court must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 690.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reeves identified the omissions of his counsel that he alleged were constitutionally deficient.  He presented evidence of what his counsel knew, which included several red flags indicating intellectual disability; what his counsel believed to be necessary for his defense, which included funding for an expert to evaluate him for intellectual disability; what his counsel did, which included repeatedly asking for and securing such funding; and what his counsel did not do, which included failing to then use that funding to hire such an expert and failing to present evidence of intellectual disability as mitigation.  In so doing, Reeves upheld his end of the evidentiary bargain.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals, on the other hand, did not.  It never explained, in light of the substantial record before it, why the choices Reeves' counsel made were reasonable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strickland and its progeny demand more.  In light of the constitutional error below, I would grant the petition for writ of certiorari, reverse, and remand so that the Court of Criminal Appeals could explain why, given the full factual record, Reeves' counsel's choices constituted reasonable performance.  Instead, the Court has cleared the way for Reeves' execution.  That is a result with which I cannot agree.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent from the denial of certiorari.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Reeves also argued in his postconviction petition that he was constitutionally ineligible for the death penalty pursuant to Atkins v. Vir- ginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304 (2002).  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals rejected that claim, and Reeves does not challenge that decision in his petition for writ of certiorari.  Instead, he maintains that regardless of whether he is ineligible for execution under Atkins, he has the right to effective assistance in presenting evidence of his intellectual disability as mitigation during the penalty phase of his trial.

But the trial judge declined to recuse himself, and (after that judge's indictment on federal charges) a different judge later denied Rippo's motion for a new trial.  The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed on direct appeal, reasoning in part that Rippo had not introduced evidence that state authorities were involved in the federal investigation.  Rippo v.

Livesay, 437 U.\u00a0S. 463, a 1978 decision, this Court held that the death-knell doctrine--which rested on courts' recognition that a denial of class certification would sometimes end a lawsuit for all practical purposes--did not warrant mandatory appellate jurisdiction of certification orders.  Id., at 470, 477.  Although the death-knell theory likely \"enhanced the quality of justice afforded a few litigants,\" it did so at a heavy cost to \u00a71291's finality requirement.  Id., at 473. First, the potential for multiple interlocutory appeals inhered in the doctrine.  See id., at 474.  Second, the death-knell theory forced appellate courts indiscriminately into the trial process, circumventing the two-tiered \"screening procedure\" Congress established for interlocutory appeals in 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71292(b).  Id., at 474, 476.  Finally, the doctrine \"operat[ed] only in favor of plaintiffs,\" even though the class-certification question may be critically important to defendants as well.

Instead of pursuing their individual claims to final judgment on the merits, respondents stipulated to a voluntary dismissal of their claims with prejudice, but reserved the right to revive their claims should the Court of Appeals reverse the District Court's certification denial.  Respondents then appealed, challenging only the interlocutory order striking their class allegations.  The Ninth Circuit held it had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under \u00a71291.  It then held that the District Court's rationale for striking respondents' class allegations was an impermissible one, but refused to opine on whether class certification was inappropriate for a different reason, leaving that question for the District Court on remand.\nHeld:\u00a0Federal courts of appeals lack jurisdiction under \u00a71291 to review an order denying class certification (or, as here, an order striking class allegations) after the named plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice.  Pp.\u00a011-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Section 1291's final-judgment rule preserves the proper balance between trial and appellate courts, minimizes the harassment and delay that would result from repeated interlocutory appeals, and promotes the efficient administration of justice.  This Court has resisted efforts to stretch \u00a71291 to permit appeals of right that would erode the finality principle and disserve its objectives.  See, e.g., Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.\u00a0S. 100, 112.  Attempts to secure appeal as of right from adverse class certification orders fit that bill.  Pp.\u00a011-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Respondents' voluntary-dismissal tactic, even more than the death-knell theory, invites protracted litigation and piecemeal appeals.  Under the death-knell doctrine, a court of appeals could decline to hear an appeal if it determined that the plaintiff \"ha[d] adequate incentive to continue\" despite the denial of class certification.  Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 471.  Under respondents' theory, however, the decision whether an immediate appeal will lie resides exclusively with the plaintiff, who need only dismiss her claims with prejudice in order to appeal the district court's order denying class certification.  And she may exercise that option more than once, interrupting district court proceedings with an interlocutory appeal again, should the court deny class certification on a different ground.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents contend that their position promotes efficiency, observing that after dismissal with prejudice the case is over if the plaintiff loses on appeal.  But plaintiffs with weak merits claims may readily assume that risk, mindful that class certification often leads to a hefty settlement.  And the same argument was evident in the death-knell context, yet this Court determined that the potential for piecemeal litigation was \"apparent and serious.\"  Id., at 474.  That potential is greater still under respondents' theory, where plaintiffs alone determine whether and when to appeal an adverse certification ruling.  Pp.\u00a012-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Also like the death-knell doctrine, respondents' theory allows indiscriminate appellate review of interlocutory orders.  Beyond disturbing the \"\u00a0'appropriate relationship between the respective courts,'\u00a0\" Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 476, respondents' dismissal tactic undercuts Rule 23(f)'s discretionary regime.  This consideration is \"[o]f prime significance to the jurisdictional issue\" in this case, Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U. S. 35, 46, because Congress has established rulemaking as the means for determining when a decision is final for purposes of \u00a71291 and for providing for appellate review of interlocutory orders not covered by statute, see \u00a7\u00a72072(c) and 1292(e).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents maintain that Rule 23(f) is irrelevant, for it concerns interlocutory orders, whereas this case involves an actual final judgment.  Yet permitting respondents' voluntary-dismissal tactic to yield an appeal of right would seriously undermine Rule 23(f)'s careful calibration, as well as Congress' designation of rulemaking \"as the preferred means for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable,\" Mohawk Industries, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 113.  Plaintiffs in putative class actions cannot transform a tentative interlocutory order into a final judgment within the meaning of \u00a71291 simply by dismissing their claims with prejudice.  Finality \"is not a technical concept of temporal or physical termination.\"  Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.\u00a0S. 323, 326.  It is one \"means [geared to] achieving a healthy legal system,\" ibid., and its contours are determined accordingly.  Pp.\u00a014-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The one-sidedness of respondents' voluntary-dismissal device reinforces the conclusion that it does not support mandatory appellate jurisdiction of refusals to grant class certification.  The tactic permits only plaintiffs, never defendants, to force an immediate appeal of an adverse certification ruling.  Yet the \"class issue\" may be just as important to defendants, Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 476, for class certification may force a defendant to settle rather than run the risk of ruinous liability.  P.\u00a017.\n797 F.\u00a03d 607, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Kennedy, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan, JJ., joined.

Orders granting or denying class certification, this Court has held, are \"inherently interlocutory,\" Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.\u00a0S. 463, 470 (1978), hence not immediately reviewable under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291, which provides for appeals from \"final decisions.\"  Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), promulgated in 1998, however, orders denying or granting class certification may be appealed immediately if the court of appeals so permits.  Absent such permission, plaintiffs may pursue their individual claims on the merits to final judgment, at which point the denial of class-action certification becomes ripe for review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs in the instant case, respondents here, were denied Rule 23(f) permission to appeal the District Court's refusal to grant class certification.  Instead of pursuing their individual claims to final judgment on the merits, respondents stipulated to a voluntary dismissal of their claims \"with prejudice,\" but reserved the right to revive their claims should the Court of Appeals reverse the District Court's certification denial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that the voluntary dismissal essayed by respondents does not qualify as a \"final decision\" within the compass of \u00a71291.  The tactic would undermine \u00a71291's firm finality principle, designed to guard against piecemeal appeals, and subvert the balanced solution Rule 23(f\u00a0) put in place for immediate review of class-action orders.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under \u00a71291 of the Judicial Code, federal courts of appeals are empowered to review only \"final decisions of the district courts.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291.1  Two guides, our decision in Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.\u00a0S. 463 (1978), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), control our application of that finality rule here.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Coopers & Lybrand, this Court considered whether a plaintiff in a putative class action may, under certain circumstances, appeal as of right a district court order striking class allegations or denying a motion for class certification.  We held unanimously that the so-called \"death-knell\" doctrine did not warrant mandatory appellate jurisdiction of such \"inherently interlocutory\" orders.  437 U.\u00a0S., at 470, 477.  Courts of Appeals employing the doctrine \"regarded [their] jurisdiction as depending on whether [rejection of class-action status] had sounded the 'death knell' of the action.\"  Id., at 466.  These courts asked whether the refusal to certify a class would end a lawsuit for all practical purposes because the value of the named plaintiff's individual claims made it \"economically imprudent to pursue his lawsuit to a final judgment and [only] then seek appellate review of [the] adverse class determination.\"  Id., at 469-470.  If, in the court of appeals' view, the order would terminate the litigation, the court deemed the order an appealable final decision under \u00a71291.  Id., at 471.  If, instead, the court determined that the plaintiff had \"adequate incentive to continue [litigating], the order [was] considered interlocutory.\"  Ibid.  Consequently, immediate appeal would be denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The death-knell theory likely \"enhance[d] the quality of justice afforded a few litigants,\" we recognized.  Id., at 473.  But the theory did so, we observed, at a heavy cost to \u00a71291's finality requirement, and therefore to \"the judicial system's overall capacity to administer justice.\"  Id., at 473; see id., at 471 (Section 1291 \"evinces a legislative judgment that 'restricting appellate review to final decisions prevents the debilitating effect on judicial administration caused by piecemeal appeal disposition.'\u00a0\" (quoting Eisen v. Carlisle & Jacquelin, 417 U.\u00a0S. 156, 170 (1974) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted))).  First, the potential for multiple interlocutory appeals inhered in the doctrine: When a ruling denying class certification on one ground was reversed on appeal, a death-knell plaintiff might again claim \"entitle[ment] to an appeal as a matter of right\" if, on remand, the district court denied class certification on a different ground.  Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 474.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the doctrine forced appellate courts indiscriminately into the trial process, thereby defeating a \"vital purpose of the final-judgment rule--that of maintaining the appropriate relationship between the respective courts.\"  Id., at 476 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 474.  The Interlocutory Appeals Act of 1958, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71292(b), we explained, had created a two-tiered \"screening procedure\" to preserve this relationship and to restrict the availability of interlocutory review to \"appropriate cases.\"  437 U.\u00a0S., at 474.  For a party to obtain review under \u00a71292(b), the district court must certify that the interlocutory order \"involves a controlling question of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\"  The court of appeals may then, \"in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order.\"  The death-knell doctrine, we stressed, \"circumvent[ed] [\u00a71292(b)'s] restrictions.\"  Id., at 475.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, we observed, the doctrine was one sided: It \"operate[d] only in favor of plaintiffs,\" even though the class-certification question is often \"of critical importance to defendants as well.\"  Id., at 476.  Just as a denial of class certification may sound the death knell for plaintiffs, \"[c]ertification of a large class may so increase the defendant's potential damages liability and litigation costs that he may find it economically prudent to settle and to abandon a meritorious defense.\"  Ibid.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In view of these concerns, the Court reached this conclusion in Coopers & Lybrand: \"The fact that an interlocutory order may induce a party to abandon his claim before final judgment is not a sufficient reason for considering [the order] a 'final decision' within the meaning of \u00a71291.\"  Id., at 477.3\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After Coopers & Lybrand, a party seeking immediate review of an adverse class-certification order had no easy recourse.  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure did not then \"contain any unique provisions governing appeals\" in class actions, id., at 470, so parties had to survive \u00a71292(b)'s two-level inspection, see id., at 474-475, and n.\u00a027; supra, at 3-4, or satisfy the extraordinary-circumstances test applicable to writs of mandamus, see Will v. United States, 389 U.\u00a0S. 90, 108 (1967) (Black, J., concurring) (\"[In] extraordinary circumstances, mandamus may be used to review an interlocutory order which is by no means 'final' and thus appealable under federal statutes.\"); cf. Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 466, n.\u00a06.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another avenue opened in 1998 when this Court approved Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f).  Seen as a response to Coopers & Lybrand, see, e.g., Blair v. Equifax Check Services, Inc., 181 F.\u00a03d 832, 834 (CA7 1999); Solimine & Hines, Deciding To Decide: Class Action Certification and Interlocutory Review by the United States Courts of Appeals Under Rule 23(f), 41 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 1531, 1568 (2000), Rule 23(f) authorizes \"permissive interlocutory appeal\" from adverse class-certification orders in the discretion of the court of appeals, Advisory Committee's 1998 Note on subd. (f) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App., p. 815 (hereinafter Committee Note on Rule 23(f)).  The Rule was adopted pursuant to \u00a71292(e), see Committee Note on Rule 23(f), which empowers this Court, in accordance with the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72072, to promulgate rules \"to provide for an appeal of an interlocutory decision to the courts of appeals that is not otherwise provided for [in \u00a71292].\"  \u00a71292(e).4  Rule 23(f) reads:\n\"A court of appeals may permit an appeal from an order granting or denying class-action certification .\u00a0.\u00a0. if a petition for permission to appeal is filed with the circuit clerk within 14 days after the order is entered.  An appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.\"5\nCourts of appeals wield \"unfettered discretion\" under Rule 23(f), akin to the discretion afforded circuit courts under \u00a71292(b).  Committee Note on Rule 23(f).  But Rule 23(f) otherwise \"departs from the \u00a71292(b) model,\" for it requires neither district court certification nor adherence to \u00a71292(b)'s other \"limiting requirements.\"  Committee Note on Rule 23(f); see supra, at 3-4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This resolution was the product of careful calibration.  By \"[r]emoving the power of the district court to defeat any opportunity to appeal,\" the drafters of Rule 23(f) sought to provide \"significantly greater protection against improvident certification decisions than \u00a71292(b)\" alone offered.  Judicial Conference of the United States, Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, Minutes of November 9-10, 1995.  But the drafters declined to go further and provide for appeal as a matter of right.  \"[A] right to appeal would lead to abuse\" on the part of plaintiffs and defendants alike, the drafters apprehended, \"increas[ing] delay and expense\" over \"routine class certification decisions\" unworthy of immediate appeal.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also Brief for Civil Procedure Scholars as Amici Curiae 6-7, 11-14 (\"Rule 23(f) was crafted to balance the benefits of immediate review against the costs of interlocutory appeals.\" (capitalization omitted)).  Rule 23(f\u00a0) therefore commits the decision whether to permit interlocutory appeal from an adverse certification decision to \"the sole discretion of the court of appeals.\"  Committee Note on Rule 23(f); see Federal Judicial Center, T. Willging, L. Hooper, & R. Niemic, Empirical Study of Class Actions in Four Federal District Courts: Final Report to the Advisory Committee on Civil Rules 86 (1996) (hereinafter Federal Judicial Center Study) (\"The discretionary nature of the proposed rule .\u00a0.\u00a0. is designed to be a guard against abuse of the appellate process.\").6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Rules Committee offered some guidance to courts of appeals considering whether to authorize appeal under Rule 23(f).  \"Permission is most likely to be granted,\" the Committee Note states, \"when the certification decision turns on a novel or unsettled question of law,\" or when \"the decision on certification is likely dispositive of the litigation,\" as in a death-knell or reverse death-knell situation.  Committee Note on Rule 23(f); see supra, at 4, and n.\u00a02.  Even so, the Rule allows courts of appeals to grant or deny review \"on the basis of any consideration.\"  Committee Note on Rule 23(f) (emphasis added).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With this background in mind, we turn to the putative class action underlying our jurisdictional inquiry.  The lawsuit is not the first of its kind.  A few years after petitioner Microsoft Corporation released its popular videogame console, the Xbox 360, a group of Xbox owners brought a putative class action against Microsoft based on an alleged design defect in the device.  See In\u00a0re Microsoft Xbox 360 Scratched Disc Litigation, 2009 WL 10219350, *1 (WD Wash., Oct. 5, 2009).  The named plaintiffs, advised by some of the same counsel representing respondents in this case, asserted that the Xbox scratched (and thus destroyed) game discs during normal game-playing conditions.  See ibid.  The District Court denied class certification, holding that individual issues of damages and causation predominated over common issues.  See id., at *6-*7.  The plaintiffs petitioned the Ninth Circuit under Rule 23(f) for leave to appeal the class-certification denial, but the Ninth Circuit denied the request.  See 851 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d 1274, 1276 (WD Wash. 2012).  Thereafter, the Scratched Disc plaintiffs settled their claims individually.  851 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1276.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two years later, in 2011, respondents filed this lawsuit in the same Federal District Court.  They proposed a nationwide class of Xbox owners based on the same design defect alleged in Scratched Disc Litigation.  See 851 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1275-1276.  The class-certification analysis in the earlier case did not control, respondents urged, because an intervening Ninth Circuit decision constituted a change in law sufficient to overcome the deference ordinarily due, as a matter of comity, the previous certification denial.  Id., at 1277-1278.  The District Court disagreed.  Concluding that the relevant Circuit decision had not undermined Scratched Disc Litigation's causation analysis, the court determined that comity required adherence to the earlier certification denial and therefore struck respondents' class allegations.  851 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d, at 1280-1281.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Invoking Rule 23(f), respondents petitioned the Ninth Circuit for permission to appeal that ruling.7  Interlocutory review was appropriate in this case, they argued, because the District Court's order striking the class allegations created a \"death-knell situation\": The \"small size of [their] claims ma[de] it economically irrational to bear the cost of litigating th[e] case to final judgment,\" they asserted, so the order would \"effectively kil[l] the case.\"  Pet. for Permission To Appeal Under Rule 23(f) in No. 12-80085 (CA9), App. 118.  The Ninth Circuit denied the petition.  Order in No. 12-80085 (CA9, June 12, 2012), App. 121.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents then had several options.  They could have settled their individual claims like their Scratched Disc predecessors or petitioned the District Court, pursuant to \u00a71292(b), to certify the interlocutory order for appeal, see supra, at 3-4.  They could also have proceeded to litigate their case, mindful that the District Court could later reverse course and certify the proposed class.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(c)(1)(C) (\"An order that grants or denies class certification may be altered or amended before final judgment.\"); Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 469 (a certification order \"is subject to revision in the District Court\").  Or, in the event the District Court did not change course, respondents could have litigated the case to final judgment and then appealed.  Id., at 469 (\"an order denying class certification is subject to effective review after final judgment at the behest of the named plaintiff\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead of taking one of those routes, respondents moved to dismiss their case with prejudice.  \"After the [c]ourt has entered a final order and judgment,\" respondents explained, they would \"appeal the .\u00a0.\u00a0. order striking [their] class allegations.\"  Motion To Dismiss in No. 11-cv-00722 (WD Wash., Sept. 25, 2012), App. 122-123.  In respondents' view, the voluntary dismissal enabled them \"to pursue their individual claims or to pursue relief solely on behalf of the class, should the certification decision be reversed.\"  Brief for Respondents 15. Microsoft stipulated to the dismissal, but maintained that respondents would have \"no right to appeal\" the order striking the class allegations after thus dismissing their claims.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a-36a.  The District Court granted the stipulated motion to dismiss, id., at 39a, and respondents appealed.  They challenged only the District Court's interlocutory order striking their class allegations, not the dismissal order which they invited.  See Brief for Plaintiffs-Appellants in No. 12-35946 (CA9).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit held it had jurisdiction to entertain the appeal under \u00a71291.  797 F.\u00a03d 607, 612 (2015).  The Court of Appeals rejected Microsoft's argument that respondents' voluntary dismissal, explicitly engineered to appeal the District Court's interlocutory order striking the class allegations, impermissibly circumvented Rule 23(f).  Ibid., n.\u00a03.  Because the stipulated dismissal \"did not involve a settlement,\" the court reasoned, it was \"\u00a0'a sufficiently adverse--and thus appealable--final decision'\u00a0\" under \u00a71291.  Id., at 612 (quoting Berger v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 741 F.\u00a03d 1061, 1065 (CA9 2014)); see id., at 1065 (relying on 7B C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71802, pp. 297-298 (3d ed. 2005), for the proposition \"that finality for appeal purposes can be achieved in this manner\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Satisfied of its jurisdiction, the Ninth Circuit held that the District Court had abused its discretion in striking respondents' class allegations.  797 F.\u00a03d, at 615.  The Court of Appeals \"express[ed] no opinion on whether\" respondents \"should prevail on a motion for class certification,\" ibid., concluding only that the District Court had misread recent Circuit precedent, see id., at 613-615, and therefore misapplied the comity doctrine, id., at 615.  Whether a class should be certified, the court said, was a question for remand, \"better addressed if and when [respondents] move[d] for class certification.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve a Circuit conflict over this question: Do federal courts of appeals have jurisdiction under \u00a71291 and Article III of the Constitution to review an order denying class certification (or, as here, an order striking class allegations) after the named plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed their claims with prejudice?8  577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  Because we hold that \u00a71291 does not countenance jurisdiction by these means, we do not reach the constitutional question, and therefore do not address the arguments and analysis discussed in the opinion concurring in the judgment.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"From the very foundation of our judicial system,\" the general rule has been that \"the whole case and every matter in controversy in it [must be] decided in a single appeal.\"  McLish v. Roff, 141 U.\u00a0S. 661, 665-666 (1891).  This final-judgment rule, now codified in \u00a71291, preserves the proper balance between trial and appellate courts, minimizes the harassment and delay that would result from repeated interlocutory appeals, and promotes the efficient administration of justice.  See Firestone Tire & Rubber Co. v. Risjord, 449 U.\u00a0S. 368, 374 (1981).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Construing \u00a71291 in line with these reasons for the rule, we have recognized that \"finality is to be given a practical rather than a technical construction.\"  Eisen, 417 U.\u00a0S., at 171 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Repeatedly we have resisted efforts to stretch \u00a71291 to permit appeals of right that would erode the finality principle and disserve its objectives.  See, e.g., Mohawk Industries, Inc. v. Carpenter, 558 U.\u00a0S. 100, 112 (2009); Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc., 511 U.\u00a0S. 863, 878-879, 884 (1994); Cobbledick v. United States, 309 U.\u00a0S. 323, 324-325, 330 (1940) (construing \u00a71291's predecessor statute).  Attempts to secure appeal as of right from adverse class-certification orders fit that bill.  See supra, at 2-4.  Because respondents' dismissal device subverts the final-judgment rule and the process Congress has established for refining that rule and for determining when nonfinal orders may be immediately appealed, see \u00a7\u00a72072(c) and 1292(e), the tactic does not give rise to a \"final decisio[n]\" under \u00a71291.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents' voluntary-dismissal tactic, even more than the death-knell theory, invites protracted litigation and piecemeal appeals.  Under the death-knell doctrine, a court of appeals could decline to hear an appeal if it determined that the plaintiff \"ha[d] adequate incentive to continue\" despite the denial of class certification.  Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 471.  Appellate courts lack even that authority under respondents' theory.  Instead, the decision whether an immediate appeal will lie resides exclusively with the plaintiff; she need only dismiss her claims with prejudice, whereupon she may appeal the district court's order denying class certification.  And, as under the death-knell doctrine, she may exercise that option more than once, stopping and starting the district court proceedings with repeated interlocutory appeals.  See id., at 474 (death-knell doctrine offered \"no assurance that the trial process [would] not again be disrupted by interlocutory review\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider this case.  The Ninth Circuit reviewed and rejected only the District Court's application of comity as a basis for striking respondents' class allegations.  797 F.\u00a03d, at 615.  The appeals court declined to reach Microsoft's other arguments against class certification.  See ibid.  It remained open to the District Court, in the Court of  Appeals' view, to deny class certification on a different ground, and respondents would be free, under their theory, to force appellate review of any new order denying certification by again dismissing their claims.  In designing Rule 23(f)'s provision for discretionary review, the Rules Committee sought to prevent such disruption and delay.  See supra, at 6-8.9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents nevertheless maintain that their position promotes efficiency, observing that after dismissal with prejudice the case is over if the plaintiff loses on appeal.  Brief for Respondents 38-39.  Their way, they say, means prompt resolution of many lawsuits and infrequent use of the voluntary-dismissal tactic, for \"most appeals lose\" and few plaintiffs will \"take th[e] risk\" of losing their claims for good.  Id., at 35-36.  Respondents overlook the prospect that plaintiffs with weak merits claims may readily assume that risk, mindful that class certification often leads to a hefty settlement.  See Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 476 (defendant facing the specter of classwide liability may \"abandon a meritorious defense\").  Indeed, the same argument--that the case was over if the plaintiff lost on appeal--was evident in the death-knell context, yet this Court determined that the potential for piecemeal litigation was \"apparent and serious.\"  Id., at 474.10  And that potential is greater still under respondents' theory, where plaintiffs alone determine whether and when to appeal an adverse certification ruling.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another vice respondents' theory shares with the death-knell doctrine, both allow indiscriminate appellate review of interlocutory orders.  Ibid.  Beyond disturbing the \"appropriate relationship between the respective courts,\" id., at 476 (internal quotation marks omitted), respondents' dismissal tactic undercuts Rule 23(f)'s discretionary regime.  This consideration is \"[o]f prime significance to the jurisdictional issue before us.\"  Swint v. Chambers County Comm'n, 514 U.\u00a0S. 35, 46 (1995) (pendent appellate jurisdiction in collateral-order context would undermine \u00a71292(b)); see supra, at 3-4 (death-knell doctrine impermissibly circumvented \u00a71292(b)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Rules Enabling Act, as earlier recounted, Congress authorized this Court to determine when a decision is final for purposes of \u00a71291, and to provide for appellate review of interlocutory orders not covered by statute.  See supra, at 5-6, and n.\u00a04.  These changes are to come from rulemaking, however, not judicial decisions in particular controversies or inventive litigation ploys.  See Swint, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 48.  In this case, the rulemaking process has dealt with the matter, yielding a \"measured, practical solutio[n]\" to the questions whether and when adverse certification orders may be immediately appealed.  Mohawk Industries, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 114.  Over years the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure studied the data on class-certification rulings and appeals, weighed various proposals, received public comment, and refined the draft rule and Committee Note.  See Solimine & Hines, 41 Wm. & Mary L. Rev., at 1564-1566, and nn. 178-189; Federal Judicial Center Study 80-87.  Rule 23(f) reflects the rulemakers' informed assessment, permitting, as explained supra, at 5-7, interlocutory appeals of adverse certification orders, whether sought by plaintiffs or defendants, solely in the discretion of the courts of appeals.  That assessment \"warrants the Judiciary's full respect.\"  Swint, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 48; see Mohawk Industries, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 118-119 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, however, the Ninth Circuit, after denying respondents permission to appeal under Rule 23(f), nevertheless assumed jurisdiction of their appeal challenging only the District Court's order striking the class allegations.  See supra, at 9-10.  According to respondents, even plaintiffs who altogether bypass Rule 23(f) may force an appeal by dismissing their claims with prejudice.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34.  Rule 23(f), respondents say, is irrelevant, for it \"address[es] interlocutory orders,\" whereas this case involves \"an actual final judgment.\"  Brief for Respondents 26, 28.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are not persuaded.  If respondents' voluntary-dismissal tactic could yield an appeal of right, Rule 23(f)'s careful calibration--as well as Congress' designation of rulemaking \"as the preferred means for determining whether and when prejudgment orders should be immediately appealable,\" Mohawk Industries, 558 U.\u00a0S., at 113 (majority opinion)--\"would be severely undermined,\" Swint, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 47.  Respondents, after all, \"[sought] review of only the [inherently interlocutory] orde[r]\" striking their class allegations; they \"d[id] not complain of the 'final' orde[r] that dismissed their cas[e].\"  Camesi v. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 729 F.\u00a03d 239, 244 (CA3 2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiffs in putative class actions cannot transform a tentative interlocutory order, see supra, at 9, into a final judgment within the meaning of \u00a71291 simply by dismissing their claims with prejudice--subject, no less, to the right to \"revive\" those claims if the denial of class certification is reversed on appeal, see Brief for Respondents 45; Tr. of Oral Arg. 31 (assertion by respondents' counsel that, if the appeal succeeds, \"everything would spring back to life\" on remand).  Were respondents' reasoning embraced by this Court, \"Congress['] final decision rule would end up a pretty puny one.\"  Digital Equipment Corp., 511 U.\u00a0S., at 872.  Contrary to respondents' argument, \u00a71291's firm final-judgment rule is not satisfied whenever a litigant persuades a district court to issue an order purporting to end the litigation.  Finality, we have long cautioned, \"is not a technical concept of temporal or physical termination.\"  Cobbledick, 309 U.\u00a0S., at 326.  It is one \"means [geared to] achieving a healthy legal system,\" ibid., and its contours are determined accordingly, see supra, at 12.11\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The one-sidedness of respondents' voluntary-dismissal device \"reinforce[s] our conclusion that [it] does not support appellate jurisdiction of prejudgment orders denying class certification.\"  Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 476; see supra, at 4.  Respondents' theory permits plaintiffs only, never defendants, to force an immediate appeal of an adverse certification ruling.  Yet the \"class issue\" may be just as important to defendants, Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 476, for \"[a]n order granting certification .\u00a0.\u00a0. may force a defendant to settle rather than .\u00a0.\u00a0. run the risk of potentially ruinous liability,\" Committee Note on Rule 23(f); see supra, at 4, and n.\u00a02 (defendants may face a \"reverse death knell\").  Accordingly, we recognized in Coopers & Lybrand that \"[w]hatever similarities or differences there are between plaintiffs and defendants in this context involve questions of policy for Congress.\"  437 U.\u00a0S., at 476.  Congress chose the rulemaking process to settle the matter, and the rulemakers did so by adopting Rule 23(f)'s evenhanded prescription.  It is not the prerogative of litigants or federal courts to disturb that settlement.  See supra, at 14-15.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nThomas, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-457\nMICROSOFT CORPORATION, PETITIONER v. SETH BAKER, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\n[June 12, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Alito join, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction over respondents' appeal, but I would ground that conclusion in Article III of the Constitution instead of 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71291.  I therefore concur only in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs in this case, respondents here, sued Microsoft, petitioner here, to recover damages after they purchased allegedly faulty video game consoles that Microsoft manufactured.  The plaintiffs brought claims for themselves (individual claims) and on behalf of a putative class of similarly situated consumers (class allegations).  Early in the litigation, the District Court granted Microsoft's motion to strike the class allegations, effectively declining to certify the class.  The Court of Appeals denied permission to appeal that decision under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f), which requires a party to obtain permission from the court of appeals before appealing a decision regarding class certification.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs decided not to pursue their individual claims, instead stipulating to a voluntary dismissal of those claims with prejudice.  They then filed a notice of appeal from the voluntary dismissal order.  On appeal, they did not ask the Court of Appeals to reverse the District Court's dismissal of their individual claims.  They instead asked the Court of Appeals to reverse the order striking their class allegations.  The question presented in this case is whether the Court of Appeals had jurisdiction to hear the appeal under both \u00a71291, which grants appellate jurisdiction to the courts of appeals over \"final decisions\" by district courts, and under Article III of the Constitution, which limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to \"cases\" and \"controversies.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today holds that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction under \u00a71291 because the voluntary dismissal with prejudice did not result in a \"final decision.\"  I disagree with that holding.  A decision is \"final\" for purposes of \u00a71291 if it \"ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment.\"  Catlin v. United States, 324 U.\u00a0S. 229, 233 (1945).  The order here dismissed all of the plaintiffs' claims with prejudice and left nothing for the District Court to do but execute the judgment.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a (\"direct[ing] the Clerk to enter Judgment .\u00a0.\u00a0. and close th[e] case\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court reaches the opposite conclusion, relying not on the text of \u00a71291 or this Court's precedents about finality, but on Rule 23(f).  Rule 23(f) makes interlocutory orders regarding class certification appealable only with the permission of the court of appeals.  The Court concludes that the plaintiffs' \"voluntary dismissal\" \"does not qualify as a 'final decision'\u00a0\" because allowing the plaintiffs' appeal would \"subvert the balanced solution Rule 23(f) put in place for immediate review of class-action orders.\"  Ante, at 2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's conclusion does not follow from its reasoning.  Whether a dismissal with prejudice is \"final\" depends on the meaning of \u00a71291, not Rule 23(f).  Rule 23(f) says nothing about finality, much less about the finality of an order dismissing individual claims with prejudice.  I agree with the Court that the plaintiffs are trying to avoid the requirements for interlocutory appeals under Rule 23(f), but our view of the balance struck in that rule should not warp our understanding of finality under \u00a71291.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although I disagree with the Court's reading of \u00a71291, I agree that the plaintiffs could not appeal in these circumstances.  In my view, they could not appeal because the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction under Article III of the Constitution.  The \"judicial Power\" of the United States extends only to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\"  Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72.  This requirement limits the jurisdiction of the federal courts to issues presented \"in an adversary context,\" Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.\u00a0S. 83, 95 (1968), in which the parties maintain an \"actual\" and \"concrete\" interest, Campbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Put another way, \"Article III denies federal courts the power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them, and confines them to resolving real and substantial controversies admitting of specific relief through a decree of a conclusive character.\"  Lewis v. Continental Bank Corp., 494 U.\u00a0S. 472, 477 (1990) (internal quotation marks, citation, and alteration omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs' appeal from their voluntary dismissal did not satisfy this jurisdictional requirement.  When the plaintiffs asked the District Court to dismiss their claims, they consented to the judgment against them and disavowed any right to relief from Microsoft.  The parties thus were no longer adverse to each other on any claims, and the Court of Appeals could not \"affect the[ir] rights\" in any legally cognizable manner.  Ibid.  Indeed, it has long been the rule that a party may not appeal from the voluntary dismissal of a claim, since the party consented to the judgment against it.  See, e.g., Evans v. Phillips, 4 Wheat. 73 (1819); Lord v. Veazie, 8 How. 251, 255-256 (1850); United States v. Babbitt, 104 U.\u00a0S. 767 (1882); Deakins v. Monaghan, 484 U.\u00a0S. 193, 199-200 (1988).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs contend that their interest in reversing the order striking their class allegations is sufficient to satisfy Article III's case-or-controversy requirement, but they misunderstand the status of putative class actions.  Class allegations, without an underlying individual claim, do not give rise to a \"case\" or \"controversy.\"  Those allegations are simply the means of invoking a procedural mechanism that enables a plaintiff to litigate his individual claims on behalf of a class.  See Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.\u00a0A. v. Allstate Ins. Co., 559 U.\u00a0S. 393, 408 (2010) (plurality opinion).  Thus, because the Court of Appeals lacked Article III jurisdiction to adjudicate the individual claims, it could not hear the plaintiffs' appeal of the order striking their class allegations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Plaintiffs' representation that they hope to \"revive their [individual] claims should they prevail\" on the appeal of the order striking their class allegations does not undermine this conclusion.  Brief for Respondents 45.  This Court has interpreted Article III \"to demand that an ac-tual controversy be extant at all stages of review, not merely at the time the complaint is filed.\"  Campbell Ewald Co., supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  And in any event, a favorable ruling on class certification would not \"revive\" their individual claims: A court's decision about class allegations \"in no way touch[es] the merits\" of those claims.  Gardner v. Westinghouse Broadcasting Co., 437 U.\u00a0S. 478, 482 (1978).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because I would hold that the Court of Appeals lacked jurisdiction under Article III to consider respondents' appeal, I concur in the judgment.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Section 1292, which authorizes review of certain interlocutory decisions, does not include among those decisions class-action certifications.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71292.\nFootnote 2\u00a0This scenario has been called a \"reverse death knell,\" Sullivan & Trueblood, Rule 23(f): A Note on Law and Discretion in the Courts of Appeals, 246 F. R. D. 277, 280 (2008), or \"inverse death knell,\" 7B C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a71802, p. 299 (3d ed. 2005), for it too ends the litigation as a practical matter.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Coopers & Lybrand also rejected the collateral-order doctrine as a basis for invoking \u00a71291 to appeal an order denying class certification.  The collateral-order doctrine applies only to a \"small class\" of decisions that are conclusive, that resolve important issues \"completely separate from the merits,\" and that are \"effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment.\"  437 U.\u00a0S., at 468.  An order concerning class certification, we explained, fails each of these criteria.  See id., at 469.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Congress amended the Rules Enabling Act, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72071 et\u00a0seq., in 1990 to authorize this Court to prescribe rules \"defin[ing] when a ruling of a district court is final for the purposes of appeal under section 1291.\"  \u00a72072(c).  Congress enacted \u00a71292(e) two years later, and that same year the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure began to review proposals for what would become Rule 23(f).  See Solimine & Hines, Deciding To Decide: Class Action Certification and Interlocutory Review by the United States Courts of Appeals Under Rule 23(f), 41 Wm. & Mary L.\u00a0Rev. 1531, 1563-1564, 1566, n. 189 (2000).\nFootnote 5\u00a0Rule 23(f) has changed little since its adoption in 1998.  See Advisory Committee's 2007 and 2009 Notes on subd. (f) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App., p. 820 (deleting a redundancy and increasing the time to petition for permission to appeal from ten to 14 days, respectively).\nFootnote 6\u00a0Legislation striking this balance was also introduced in Congress.  See H. R. 660, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997).  The bill, which would have amended \u00a71292(b) to provide for interlocutory appeal of adverse class determinations, likewise committed the decision whether an immediate appeal would lie exclusively to the courts of appeals: \"The court of appeals may, in its discretion, permit the appeal to be taken from such determination.\"  Ibid.  Upon learning that \"proposed Rule 23(f) [was] well advanced,\" the bill's sponsor, Representative Charles Canady, joined forces with the Rules Committee.  See Judicial Conference of the United States, Advisory Committee on Civil Rules, Minutes of May 1-2, 1997.\nFootnote 7\u00a0An order striking class allegations is \"functional[ly] equivalent\" to an order denying class certification and therefore appealable under Rule 23(f).  Scott v. Family Dollar Stores, Inc., 733 F.\u00a03d 105, 110-111, n.\u00a02 (CA4 2013) (quoting In\u00a0re Bemis Co., 279 F.\u00a03d 419, 421 (CA7 2002)).  See also United Airlines, Inc. v. McDonald, 432 U.\u00a0S. 385, 388, and n. 4 (1977) (equating order striking class allegations with \"a denial of class certification\").\nFootnote 8\u00a0Compare Berger v. Home Depot USA, Inc., 741 F.\u00a03d 1061, 1065 (CA9 2014) (assuming jurisdiction under these circumstances); Gary Plastic Packaging Corp. v. Merrill Lynch, 903 F.\u00a02d 176, 179 (CA2 1990) (assuming jurisdiction after dismissal for failure to prosecute), with Camesi v. University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, 729 F. 3d 239, 245-247 (CA3 2013) (no jurisdiction under \u00a71291 or Article III in this situation); Rhodes v. E.\u00a0I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., 636 F.\u00a03d 88, 100 (CA4 2011) (no jurisdiction under Article III).\nFootnote 9\u00a0Rule 23(f) avoids delay not only by limiting class-certification appeals to those permitted by the federal courts of appeals, but also by specifying that \"[a]n appeal does not stay proceedings in the district court unless the district judge or the court of appeals so orders.\"  See Blair v. Equifax Check Services, Inc., 181 F.\u00a03d 832, 835 (CA7 1999) (\"Rule 23(f) is drafted to avoid delay.\").  Respondents' dismissal tactic, by contrast, halts district court proceedings whenever invoked.\nFootnote 10\u00a0The very premise of the death-knell doctrine was that plaintiffs \"would not pursue their claims individually.\"  Coopers & Lybrand, 437 U.\u00a0S., at 466.  Having pressed such an argument for the benefit of immediate review, a death-knell plaintiff who lost on appeal would encounter the general proposition, long laid down, that \"where a party assumes a certain position in a legal proceeding, and succeeds in maintaining that position, he may not thereafter, simply because his interests have changed, assume a contrary position.\"  Davis v. Wakelee, 156 U.\u00a0S. 680, 689 (1895).\nFootnote 11\u00a0Respondents also invoke our decision in United States v. Procter & Gamble Co., 356 U.\u00a0S. 677 (1958), but that case--a civil antitrust enforcement action--involved neither class-action certification nor the sort of dismissal tactic at issue here.  See id., at 681 (the Government \"did not consent to a judgment against [it]\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n\n","54":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMIDLAND FUNDING, LLC v. JOHNSON(2017)\nNo. 16-348\nArgued: January 17, 2017Decided: May 15, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Midland Funding filed a proof of claim in respondent Johnson's Chapter 13 bankruptcy case, asserting that Johnson owed Midland credit-card debt and noting that the last time any charge appeared on Johnson's account was more than 10 years ago.  The relevant statute of limitations under Alabama law is six years.  Johnson objected to the claim, and the Bankruptcy Court disallowed it.  Johnson then sued Midland, claiming that its filing a proof of claim on an obviously time-barred debt was \"false,\" \"deceptive,\" \"misleading,\" \"unconscionable,\" and \"unfair\" within the meaning of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a71692e, 1692f.  The District Court held that the Act did not apply and dismissed the suit. The Eleventh Circuit reversed.\nHeld:\u00a0The filing of a proof of claim that is obviously time barred is not a false, deceptive, misleading, unfair, or unconscionable debt collection practice within the meaning of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  Pp.\u00a02-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Midland's proof of claim was not \"false, deceptive, or misleading.\"  The Bankruptcy Code defines the term \"claim\" as a \"right to payment,\" 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(5)(A), and state law usually determines whether a person has such a right, see Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U.\u00a0S. 443, 450-451.  The relevant Alabama law provides that a creditor has the right to payment of a debt even after the limitations period has expired.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson argues that the word \"claim\" means \"enforceable claim.\"  But the word \"enforceable\" does not appear in the Code's definition, and Johnson's interpretation is difficult to square with Congress's intent \"to adopt the broadest available definition of 'claim,'\u00a0\" Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U.\u00a0S. 78, 83.  Other Code provisions are still more difficult to square with Johnson's interpretation.  For example, \u00a7502(b)(1) says that if a \"claim\" is \"unenforceable\" it will be disallowed, not that it is not a \"claim.\"  Other provisions make clear that the running of a limitations period constitutes an affirmative defense that a debtor is to assert after the creditor makes a \"claim.\"  \u00a7\u00a7502, 558.  The law has long treated unenforceability of a claim (due to the expiration of the limitations period) as an affirmative defense, and there is nothing misleading or deceptive in the filing of a proof of claim that follows the Code's similar system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, to determine whether a statement is misleading normally \"requires consideration of the legal sophistication of its audience,\" Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.\u00a0S. 350, 383, n. 37, which in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy includes a trustee who is likely to understand that a proof of claim is a statement by the creditor that he or she has a right to payment that is subject to disallowance, including disallowance based on untimeliness.  Pp.\u00a02-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Several circumstances, taken together, lead to the conclusion that Midland's proof of claim was not \"unfair\" or \"unconscionable\" within the terms of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson points out that several lower courts have found or indicated that, in the context of an ordinary civil action to collect a debt, a debt collector's assertion of a claim known to be time barred is \"unfair.\"  But those courts rested their conclusions upon their concern that a consumer might unwittingly repay a time-barred debt.  Such considerations have significantly diminished force in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, where the consumer initiates the proceeding, see \u00a7\u00a7301, 303(a); where a knowledgeable trustee is available, see \u00a71302(a); where procedural rules more directly guide the evaluation of claims, see Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3001(c)(3)(A); and where the claims resolution process is \"generally a more streamlined and less unnerving prospect for a debtor than facing a collection lawsuit,\" In\u00a0re Gatewood, 533 B.\u00a0R. 905, 909.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also unpersuasive is Johnson's argument that there is no legitimate reason for allowing a practice like this one that risks harm to the debtor.  The bankruptcy system treats untimeliness as an affirmative defense and normally gives the trustee the burden of investigating claims to see if one is stale.  And, at least on occasion, the assertion of even a stale claim can benefit the debtor.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, a change in the simple affirmative-defense approach, carving out an exception, would require defining the exception's boundaries.  Does it apply only where a claim's staleness appears on the face of the proof of claim?  Does it apply to other affirmative defenses or only to the running of the limitations period? Neither the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act nor the Bankruptcy Code indicates that Congress intended an ordinary civil court applying the Act to determine answers to such bankruptcy-related questions.  The Act and the Code have different purposes and structural features.  The Act seeks to help consumers by preventing consumer bankruptcies in the first place, while the Code creates and maintains the \"delicate balance of a debtor's protections and obligations,\" Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U.\u00a0S. 642, 651.  Applying the Act in this context would upset that \"delicate balance.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Contrary to the argument of the United States, the promulgation of Bankruptcy Rule 9011 did not resolve this issue.

In this case, a debt collector filed a written statement in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding claiming that the debtor owed the debt collector money.  The statement made clear, however, that the 6-year statute of limitations governing collection of the claimed debt had long since run.  The question before us is whether the debt collector's filing of that statement falls within the scope of the aforementioned provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  We conclude that it does not.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In March 2014, Aleida Johnson, the respondent, filed for personal bankruptcy under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code (or Code), 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71301 et\u00a0seq, in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.  Two months later, Midland Funding, LLC, the petitioner, filed a \"proof of claim,\" a written statement asserting that Johnson owed Midland a credit-card debt of $1,879.71.  The statement added that the last time any charge appeared on Johnson's account was in May 2003, more than 10 years before Johnson filed for bankruptcy.  The relevant statute of limitations is six years.  See Ala. Code \u00a76-2-34 (2014).  Johnson, represented by counsel, objected to the claim; Midland did not respond to the objection; and the Bankruptcy Court disallowed the claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsequently, Johnson brought this lawsuit against Midland seeking actual damages, statutory damages, attorney's fees, and costs for a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692k.  The District Court decided that the Act did not apply and therefore dismissed the action.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit disagreed and reversed the District Court.  823 F.\u00a03d 1334 (2016).  Midland filed a petition for certiorari, noting a division of opinion among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether the conduct at issue here is \"false,\" \"deceptive,\" \"misleading,\" \"unconscionable,\" or \"unfair\" within the meaning of the Act.  Compare ibid. (finding the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applicable) with In\u00a0re Dubois, 834 F.\u00a03d 522 (CA4 2016) (finding the Act inapplicable); Owens v. LVNV Funding, LLC, 832 F.\u00a03d 726 (CA7 2016) (same); and Nelson v. Midland Credit Management, Inc., 828 F.\u00a03d 749 (CA8 2016) (same).  We granted the petition.  We now reverse the Court of Appeals.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like the majority of Courts of Appeals that have considered the matter, we conclude that Midland's filing of a proof of claim that on its face indicates that the limitations period has run does not fall within the scope of any of the five relevant words of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  We believe it reasonably clear that Midland's proof of claim was not \"false, deceptive, or misleading.\"  Midland's proof of claim falls within the Bankruptcy Code's definition of the term \"claim.\"  A \"claim\" is a \"right to payment.\"  11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(5)(A).  State law usually determines whether a person has such a right.  See Travelers Casualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & Elec. Co., 549 U.\u00a0S. 443, 450-451 (2007).  The relevant state law is the law of Alabama.  And Alabama's law, like the law of many States, provides that a creditor has the right to payment of a debt even after the limitations period has expired.  See Ex\u00a0parte HealthSouth Corp., 974 S. 2d 288, 296 (Ala. 2007) (passage of time extinguishes remedy but the right remains); see also, e.g., Sallaz v. Rice, 161 Idaho 223, ___, 384 P.\u00a03d 987, 992-993 (2016) (similar); Notte v. Merchants Mut. Ins. Co., 185 N.\u00a0J. 490, 499-500, 888 A.\u00a02d 464, 469 (2006) (similar); Potterton v.

Co. of N.\u00a0Y. v. Lackland, 175 Va. 178, 185-187, 8 S.\u00a0E. 2d 306, 309 (1940) (similar); Insurance Co. v. Dunscomb, 108 Tenn. 724, 728-731, 69 S.\u00a0W. 345, 346 (1902) (similar); but see, e.g., Miss. Code Ann. \u00a715-1-3(1) (2012) (expiration of the limitations period extinguishes the remedy and the right); Wis. Stat. \u00a7893.05 (2011-2012) (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson argues that the Code's word \"claim\" means \"enforceable claim.\"  She notes that this Court once referred to a bankruptcy \"claim\" as \"an enforceable obligation.\"  Pennsylvania Dept. of Public Welfare v. Davenport, 495 U.\u00a0S. 552, 559 (1990).  And, she concludes, Midland's \"proof of claim\" was false (or deceptive or misleading) because its \"claim\" was not enforceable.  Brief for Respondent 22; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 18-20 (making a similar argument).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But we do not find this argument convincing.  The word \"enforceable\" does not appear in the Code's definition of \"claim.\"  See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101(5).  The Court in Davenport likely used the word \"enforceable\" descriptively, for that case involved an enforceable debt.  495 U.\u00a0S., at 559.  And it is difficult to square Johnson's interpretation with our later statement that \"Congress intended .\u00a0.\u00a0. to adopt the broadest available definition of 'claim.'\u00a0\"  Johnson v. Home State Bank, 501 U.\u00a0S. 78, 83 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is still more difficult to square Johnson's interpretation with other provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  Section 502(b)(1) of the Code, for example, says that, if a \"claim\" is \"unenforceable,\" it will be disallowed.  It does not say that an \"unenforceable\" claim is not a \"claim.\"  Similarly, \u00a7101(5)(A) says that a \"claim\" is a \"right to payment,\" \"whether or not such right is .\u00a0.\u00a0. fixed, contingent, .\u00a0.\u00a0. [or] disputed.\"  If a contingency does not arise, or if a claimant loses a dispute, then the claim is unenforceable.  Yet this section makes clear that the unenforceable claim is nonetheless a \"right to payment,\" hence a \"claim,\" as the Code uses those terms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Johnson looks for support to other provisions that govern bankruptcy proceedings, including \u00a7502(a) of the Bankruptcy Code, which states that a claim will be allowed in the absence of an objection, and Rule 3001(f) of the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure, which states that a properly filed \"proof of claim .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall constitute prima facie evidence of the validity and amount of the claim.\"  But these provisions do not discuss the scope of the term \"claim.\"  Rather, they restate the Bankruptcy Code's system for determining whether a claim will be allowed.  Other provisions make clear that the running of a limitations period constitutes an affirmative defense, a defense that the debtor is to assert after a creditor makes a \"claim.\"  \u00a7\u00a7502, 558.  The law has long treated unenforceability of a claim (due to the expiration of the limitations period) as an affirmative defense.  See, e.g., Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\u00a08(c)(1); 13 Encyclopaedia of Pleading and Practice 200 (W. McKinney ed. 1898).  And we see nothing misleading or deceptive in the filing of a proof of claim that, in effect, follows the Code's similar system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, to determine whether a statement is misleading normally \"requires consideration of the legal sophistication of its audience.\"  Bates v. State Bar of Ariz., 433 U.\u00a0S. 350, 383, n.\u00a037 (1977).  The audience in Chapter 13 bankruptcy cases includes a trustee, 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71302(a), who must examine proofs of claim and, where appropriate, pose an objection, \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(5), 1302(b)(1) (including any timeliness objection, \u00a7\u00a7502(b)(1), 558).  And that trustee is likely to understand that, as the Code says, a proof of claim is a statement by the creditor that he or she has a right to payment subject to disallowance (including disallowance based upon, and following, the trustee's objection for untimeliness).  \u00a7\u00a7101(5)(A), 502(b), 704(a)(5), 1302(b)(1).  (We do not address the appropriate standard in ordinary civil litigation.)\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Whether Midland's assertion of an obviously time-barred claim is \"unfair\" or \"unconscionable\" (within the terms of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act) presents a closer question.  First, Johnson points out that several lower courts have found or indicated that, in the context of an ordinary civil action to collect a debt, a debt collector's assertion of a claim known to be time barred is \"unfair.\"  See, e.g., Phillips v. Asset Acceptance, LLC, 736 F.\u00a03d 1076, 1079 (CA7 2013) (holding as much); Kimber v. Federal Financial Corp., 668 F.\u00a0Supp. 1480, 1487 (MD Ala. 1987) (same); Huertas v. Galaxy Asset Management, 641 F.\u00a03d 28, 32-33 (CA3 2011) (indicating as much); Castro v. Collecto, Inc., 634 F.\u00a03d 779, 783 (CA5 2011) (same); Freyermuth v. Credit Bureau Servs., Inc., 248 F.\u00a03d 767, 771 (CA8 2001) (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are not convinced, however, by this precedent.  It considers a debt collector's assertion in a civil suit of a claim known to be stale.  We assume, for argument's sake, that the precedent is correct in that context (a matter this Court itself has not decided and does not now decide).  But the context of a civil suit differs significantly from the present context, that of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding.  The lower courts rested their conclusions upon their concern that a consumer might unwittingly repay a time-barred debt.  Thus the Seventh Circuit pointed out that \"\u00a0'few unsophisticated consumers would be aware that a statute of limitations could be used to defend against lawsuits based on stale debts.'\u00a0\"  Phillips, supra, at 1079 (quoting Kimber, supra, at 1487).  The \"\u00a0'passage of time,'\u00a0\" the Circuit wrote, \"\u00a0'dulls the consumer's memory of the circumstances and validity of the debt'\u00a0\" and the consumer may no longer have \"\u00a0'personal records.'\u00a0\"  736 F.\u00a03d, at 1079 (quoting Kimber, supra, at 1487).  Moreover, a consumer might pay a stale debt simply to avoid the cost and embarrassment of suit.  736 F.\u00a03d, at 1079.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These considerations have significantly diminished force in the context of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy.  The consumer initiates such a proceeding, see 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7301, 303(a), and consequently the consumer is not likely to pay a stale claim just to avoid going to court.  A knowledgeable trustee is available.  See \u00a71302(a).  Procedural bankruptcy rules more directly guide the evaluation of claims.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 3001(c)(3)(A); Advisory Committee's Notes on Rule 3001-2011 Amdt., 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. App., p. 678.  And, as the Eighth Circuit Bankruptcy Appellate Panel put it, the claims resolution process is \"generally a more streamlined and less unnerving prospect for a debtor than facing a collection lawsuit.\"  In\u00a0re Gatewood, 533 B.\u00a0R. 905, 909 (2015); see also, e.g., 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7502 (outlining generally the claims resolution process).  These features of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding make it considerably more likely that an effort to collect upon a stale claim in bankruptcy will be met with resistance, objection, and disallowance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, Johnson argues that the practice at least risks harm to the debtor and that there is not \"a single legitimate reason\" for allowing this kind of behavior.  Brief for Respondent 32.  Would it not be obviously \"unfair,\" she asks, for a debt collector to adopt a practice of buying up stale claims cheaply and asserting them in bankruptcy knowing they are stale and hoping for careless trustees?  The United States, supporting Johnson, adds its view that the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure make the practice open to sanction, and argues that sanctionable conduct is unfair conduct.  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 20.  See Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011(b)(2) (sanction possible if party violates the Rule that by \"presenting to the [bankruptcy] court\" any \"paper,\" a \"party is certifying that to the best of\" his or her \"knowledge, .\u00a0.\u00a0. the claims .\u00a0.\u00a0. therein are warranted by existing law\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are ultimately not persuaded by these arguments.  The bankruptcy system, as we have already noted, treats untimeliness as an affirmative defense.  The trustee normally bears the burden of investigating claims and pointing out that a claim is stale.  See supra, at 4-5.  Moreover, protections available in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding minimize the risk to the debtor.  See supra, at 6.  And, at least on occasion, the assertion of even a stale claim can benefit a debtor.  Its filing and disallowance \"discharge[s]\" the debt.  11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71328(a).  And that discharge means that the debt (even if unenforceable) will not remain on a credit report potentially affecting an individual's ability to borrow money, buy a home, and perhaps secure employment.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71681c(a)(4) (debt may remain on a credit report for seven years); cf. Ala. Code \u00a76-2-34 (6-year statute of limitations); Md. Cts. & Jud. Proc. Code Ann. \u00a75-101 (2013) (3-year statute of limitations); cf. 16 CFR pt. 600, App. \u00a7607, \u00b66 (1991) (a credit report may include discharged debt only if \"the debt [is reported] as having a zero balance due to reflect the fact that the consumer is no longer liable for the discharged debt\"); FTC, 40 Years of Experience with the Fair Credit Reporting Act: An FTC Staff Report with Summary of Interpretations 66 (2011) (similar).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, a change in the simple affirmative-defense approach, carving out an exception, itself would require defining the boundaries of the exception.  Does it apply only where (as Johnson alleged in the complaint) a claim's staleness appears \"on [the] face\" of the proof of claim?  Does it apply to other affirmative defenses or only to the running of a limitations period?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, we do not find in either the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act or the Bankruptcy Code good reason to believe that Congress intended an ordinary civil court applying the Act to determine answers to these bankruptcy-related questions.  The Act and the Code have different purposes and structural features.  The Act seeks to help consumers, not necessarily by closing what Johnson and the United States characterize as a loophole in the Bankruptcy Code, but by preventing consumer bankruptcies in the first place.  See, e.g., 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692(a) (recognizing the \"abundant evidence of the use of abusive, deceptive, and unfair debt collection practices [which] contribute to the number of personal bankruptcies\"); see also \u00a71692(b) (\"Existing laws and procedures .\u00a0.\u00a0. are inadequate to protect consumers\"); \u00a71692(e) (statute seeks to \"eliminate abusive debt collection practices\").  The Bankruptcy Code, by way of contrast, creates and maintains what we have called the \"delicate balance of a debtor's protections and obligations.\"  Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U.\u00a0S. 642, 651 (1974).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To find the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act applicable here would upset that \"delicate balance.\"  From a substantive perspective it would authorize a new significant bankruptcy-related remedy in the absence of language in the Code providing for it.  Administratively, it would permit postbankruptcy litigation in an ordinary civil court concerning a creditor's state of mind--a matter often hard to determine.  See 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692k(c) (safe harbor for any debt collector who \"shows by a preponderance of evidence that the violation was not intentional and resulted from a bona fide error notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid any such error\").  Procedurally, it would require creditors (who assert a claim) to investigate the merits of an affirmative defense (typically the debtor's job to assert and prove) lest the creditor later be found to have known the claim was untimely.  The upshot could well be added complexity, changes in settlement incentives, and a shift from the debtor to the creditor the obligation to investigate the staleness of a claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the United States, we do not believe that the Advisory Committee on Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure settled the issue when it promulgated Bankruptcy Rule 9011.  The Committee, in considering amendments to the Federal Rules of Bankruptcy Procedure in 2009, specifically rejected a proposal that would have required a creditor to certify that there is no valid statute of limitations defense.  See Agenda Book for Meeting 86-87 (Mar. 26-27, 2009).  It did so in part because the working group did not want to impose an affirmative obligation on a creditor to make a prefiling investigation of a potential time-bar defense.  Ibid.  In rejecting that proposal, the Committee did note that Rule 9011 imposes a general \"obligation on a claimant to undertake an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances to determine .\u00a0.\u00a0. that a claim is warranted by existing law and that factual contentions have evidentiary support,\" and to certify as much on the proof of claim.  Id., at 87.  The Committee also acknowledged, however, that this requirement would \"not addres[s] the statute of limitation issue,\" but would only ensure \"the accuracy of the information provided.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We recognize that one Bankruptcy Court has held that filing a time-barred claim without a prefiling investigation of a potential time-bar defense merits sanctions under Rule 9011.  In\u00a0re Sekema, 523 B.\u00a0R. 651, 654 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ind. 2015).  But others have held to the contrary.  See, e.g., In\u00a0re Freeman, 540 B.\u00a0R. 129, 143-144 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Pa. 2015); In\u00a0re Jenkins, 538 B.\u00a0R. 129, 134-136 (Bkrcty. Ct. ND Ala. 2015); In\u00a0re Keeler, 440 B.\u00a0R. 354, 366-369 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ED Pa. 2009); see also In\u00a0re Andrews, 394 B.\u00a0R. 384, 387-388 (Bkrtcy. Ct. EDNC 2008) (recognizing that \"[m]any courts have .\u00a0.\u00a0. found that sanctions [under Rule 9011] were not warranted for filing stale claims\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These circumstances, taken together, convince us that we cannot find the practice at issue here \"unfair\" or \"unconscionable\" within the terms of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, we conclude that filing (in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding) a proof of claim that is obviously time barred is not a false, deceptive, misleading, unfair, or unconscionable debt collection practice within the meaning of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

The Court today wrongfully holds that a debt collector that knowingly attempts to collect a time-barred debt in bankruptcy proceedings has violated neither of these prohibitions.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Professional debt collectors have built a business out of buying stale debt, filing claims in bankruptcy proceedings to collect it, and hoping that no one notices that the debt is too old to be enforced by the courts.  This practice is both \"unfair\" and \"unconscionable.\"  I respectfully dissent from the Court's conclusion to the contrary.1\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Americans owe trillions of dollars in consumer debt to creditors--credit card companies, schools, and car dealers, among others.  See Fed. Reserve Bank of N.\u00a0Y., Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit 3 (2017).  Most people will repay their debts, but some cannot do so.  The debts they do not pay are increasingly likely to end up in the hands of professional debt collectors--companies whose business it is to collect debts that are owed to other companies.  See Consumer Financial Protection Bur., Fair Debt Collection Practices Act: Annual Report 2016, p. 8 (CFPB Report).  Debt collection is a lucrative and growing industry.  Last year, the Nation's 6,000 debt collection agencies earned over $13 billion in revenue.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although many debt collectors are hired by creditors to work on a third-party basis, more and more collectors also operate as \"debt buyers\"--purchasing debts from creditors outright and attempting to collect what they can, with the profits going to their own accounts.2  See FTC, The Structure and Practices of the Debt Buying Industry 11-12 (2013) (FTC Report); CFPB Report 10.  Debt buyers now hold hundreds of billions of dollars in consumer debt; indeed, a study conducted by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in 2009 found that nine of the leading debt buyers had purchased over $140 billion in debt just in the previous three years.  FTC Report, at i-ii, T-3 (Table 3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because creditors themselves have given up trying to collect the debts they sell to debt buyers, they sell those debts for pennies on the dollar.  Id., at 23.  The older the debt, the greater the discount: While debt buyers pay close to eight cents per dollar for debts under three years old, they pay as little as two cents per dollar for debts greater than six years old, and \"effectively nothing\" for debts greater than 15 years old.  Id., at 23-24.  These prices reflect the basic fact that older debts are harder to collect.  As time passes, consumers move or forget that they owe the debts; creditors have more trouble documenting the debts and proving their validity; and debts begin to fall within state statutes of limitations--time limits that \"operate to bar a plaintiff's suit\" once passed.  CTS Corp. v. Waldburger, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 5).  Because a creditor (or a debt collector) cannot enforce a time-barred debt in court, the debt is inherently worth very little indeed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But statutes of limitations have not deterred debt buyers.  For years, they have filed suit in state courts--often in small-claims courts, where formal rules of evidence do not apply--to collect even debts too old to be enforced by those courts.3  See Holland, The One Hundred Billion Dollar Problem in Small-Claims Court, 6 J. Bus. & Tech. L. 259, 261 (2011).  Importantly, the debt buyers' only hope in these cases is that consumers will fail either to invoke the statute of limitations or to respond at all: In most States the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, meaning that a consumer must appear in court and raise it in order to dismiss the suit.  See ante, at 4-5 (majority opinion).  But consumers do fail to defend themselves in court--in fact, according to the FTC, over 90% fail to appear at all.  FTC Report 45.  The result is that debt buyers have won \"billions of dollars in default judgments\" simply by filing suit and betting that consumers will lack the resources to respond.  Holland, supra, at 263.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FDCPA's prohibitions on \"misleading\" and \"unfair\" conduct have largely beaten back this particular practice.  Every court to have considered the question has held that a debt collector that knowingly files suit in court to collect a time-barred debt violates the FDCPA.  See Phillips v. Asset Acceptance, LLC, 736 F. 3d 1076, 1079 (CA7 2013); Kimber v. Federal Financial Corp., 668 F. Supp. 1480, 1487 (MD Ala. 1987); see also ante, at 5-6 (majority opinion) (citing other cases).  In 2015, petitioner and its parent company entered into a consent decree with the Government prohibiting them from filing suit to collect time-barred debts and ordering them to pay $34 million in restitution.  See Consent Order in In\u00a0re Encore Capital Group, Inc., No. 2015-CFPB-0022 (Sept. 9, 2015), pp. 38, 46.  And the leading trade association has now adopted a resolution barring the practice.  See Brief for DBA International, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 2-3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Stymied in state courts, the debt buyers have now turned to a new forum: bankruptcy courts.  The same debt buyers that for years filed thousands of lawsuits in state courts across the country have begun to do the same thing in bankruptcy courts--specifically, in cases governed by Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code, which allows consumers earning regular incomes to restructure their debts and repay as many as they can over a period of several years.  See 8 Collier on Bankruptcy \u00b61300.01 (A. Resnick & H. Sommer eds., 16th ed. 2016).  As in ordinary civil cases, a debtor in a Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding is entitled to have dismissed any claim filed against his estate that is barred by a statute of limitations.  See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7558.  As in ordinary civil cases, the statute of limitations is an affirmative defense, one that must be raised by either the debtor or the trustee of his estate before it is honored.  \u00a7\u00a7502, 558.  And so--just as in ordinary civil cases--debt collectors may file claims in bankruptcy proceedings for stale debts and hope that no one notices that they are too old to be enforced.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And that is exactly what the debt buyers have done.  As a wide variety of courts and commentators have observed, debt buyers have \"deluge[d]\" the bankruptcy courts with claims \"on debts deemed unenforceable under state statutes of limitations.\"  Crawford v. LVNV Funding, LLC, 758 F.\u00a03d 1254, 1256 (CA11 2014); see also In\u00a0re Jenkins, 456 B.\u00a0R. 236, 239, n.\u00a02 (Bkrtcy. Ct. EDNC 2011) (noting a \"plague of stale claims\"); Brief for National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 9 (noting study describing \"hundreds of thousands of proofs of claim asserting hundreds of millions of dollars of consumer indebtedness, all in a single year\").  This practice has become so widespread that the Government sued one debt buyer last year \"to address [its] systemic abuse of the bankruptcy process\"--including a \"business model\" of \"knowingly and strategically\" filing thousands of claims for time-barred debt.  Complaint in In\u00a0re Freeman-Clay v. Resurgent Capital Servs., L.\u00a0P., No. 14-41871 (Bkrtcy. Ct. WD Mo.), \u00b6\u00b61, 35 (Resurgent Complaint).  This practice, the Government explained, \"manipulates the bankruptcy process by systematically shifting the burden\" to trustees and debtors to object even to \"frivolous claims\"--especially given that filing an objection is costly, time consuming, and easy to overlook.  Id., at \u00b6\u00b635, 43-44.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FDCPA prohibits professional debt collectors from engaging in \"unfair\" and \"unconscionable\" practices.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692f.4  Filing a claim in bankruptcy court for debt that a collector knows to be time barred--like filing a lawsuit in a court to collect such a debt--is just such a practice.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Begin where the debt collectors themselves began: with their practice of filing suit in ordinary civil courts to collect debts that they know are time barred.  Every court to have considered this practice holds that it violates the FDCPA. There is no sound reason to depart from this conclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statutes of limitations \"are not simply technicalities.\"  Board of Regents of Univ. of State of N. Y. v. Tomanio, 446 U.\u00a0S. 478, 487 (1980).  They reflect strong public-policy determinations that \"it is unjust to fail to put [an] adversary on notice to defend within a specified period of time.\"  United States v. Kubrick, 444 U.\u00a0S. 111, 117 (1979).  And they \"promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\"  Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 321 U.\u00a0S. 342, 348-349 (1944).  Such concerns carry particular weight in the context of small-dollar consumer debt collection.  As one thoughtful opinion explains:\n\"Because few unsophisticated consumers would be aware that a statute of limitations could be used to defend against lawsuits based on stale debts, such consumers would unwittingly acquiesce to such lawsuits.  And, even if the consumer realizes that she can use time as a defense, she will more than likely still give in rather than fight the lawsuit because she must still expend energy and resources and subject herself to the embarrassment of going into court to present the defense .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  Kimber, 668 F.\u00a0Supp., at 1487.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Debt buyers' efforts to pursue stale debt in ordinary civil litigation may also entrap debtors into forfeiting their time defenses altogether.  When a debt collector sues or threatens to sue to collect a debt, many consumers respond by offering a small partial payment to forestall suit.  In many States, a consumer who makes an offer like this has--unbeknownst to him--forever given up his ability to claim the debt is unenforceable.  That is because in most States a consumer's partial payment on a time-barred debt--or his promise to resume payments on such a debt--will restart the statute of limitations.  FTC Report 47; see, e.g., Young v. Sorenson, 47 Cal. App. 3d 911, 914, 121 Cal. Rptr. 236, 237 (1975) (\"\u00a0'The theory on which this is based is that the payment is an acknowledgement on the existence of the indebtedness which raises an implied promise to continue the obligation and to pay the balance'\u00a0\").  Debt collectors' efforts to entrap consumers in this way have no place in honest business practice.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same dynamics are present in bankruptcy proceedings.  A proof of claim filed in bankruptcy court represents the debt collector's belief that it is entitled to payment, even though the debt should not be enforced as a matter of public policy.  The debtor's claim will be allowed, and will be incorporated in a debtor's payment plan, unless the debtor or his trustee objects.  But such objections require ordinary and unsophisticated people (and their overworked trustees) to be on guard not only against mistaken claims but also against claims that debt collectors know will fail under law if an objection is raised.  Debt collectors do not file these claims in good faith; they file them hoping and expecting that the bankruptcy system will fail.  Such a practice is \"unfair\" and \"unconscionable\" in violation of the FDCPA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court disagrees.  But it does so on narrow grounds.  To begin with, the Court does not hold that the Bankruptcy Code altogether displaces the FDCPA, leaving it with no role to play in bankruptcy proceedings.  Such a conclusion would be wrong.  Although the Code and the FDCPA \"have different purposes and structural features,\" ante, at 8, the Court has held that Congress, in passing the FDCPA's predecessor, did so on the understanding that \"the provisions and the purposes\" of the two statutes were intended to \"coexist.\"  Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U.\u00a0S. 642, 650 (1974).  Although petitioner suggests that the FDCPA is best read \"to have no application to [a] debt collector's conduct\" in a bankruptcy proceeding, Brief for Petitioner 41, the majority declines its invitation to adopt such a sweeping rule.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does the majority take a position on whether a debt collector violates the FDCPA by filing suit in an ordinary court to collect a debt it knows is time barred.  Ante, at 6.  Instead, the majority concludes, even assuming that such a practice would violate the FDCPA, a debt collector does not violate the Act by doing the same thing in bankruptcy proceedings.  Bankruptcy, the majority argues, is different.  True enough.  But none of the distinctions that the majority identifies bears the weight placed on it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the majority contends, structural features of the bankruptcy process reduce the risk that a stale debt will go unnoticed and thus be allowed.  Ante, at 6-7.  But there is virtually no evidence that the majority's theory holds true in practice.  The majority relies heavily on the presence of a bankruptcy trustee, appointed to act on the debtor's behalf and empowered to (among other things) object to claims that he believes lack merit.  See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7704(a)(5), 1302(b).  In the majority's view, the trustee's gatekeeping role makes it \"considerably more likely that an effort to collect upon a stale claim in bankruptcy will be met with resistance, objection, and disallowance.\"  Ante, at 7.  The problem with the majority's ipse dixit is that everyone with actual experience in the matter insists that it is false.  The Government, which oversees bankruptcy trustees, tells us that trustees \"cannot realistically be expected to identify every time-barred .\u00a0.\u00a0. claim filed in every bankruptcy.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 25-26; see also Resurgent Complaint \u00b643 (\"Filing objections to all of [one collector]'s unenforceable claims would clog the docket of this Court and other courts with objections to frivolous claims\").  The trustees themselves (appearing here as amici curiae) agree, describing the practice as \"wasteful\" and \"exploit[ative].\"  Brief for National Association of Chapter Thirteen Trustees as Amicus Curiae 12.  And courts across the country recognize that Chapter 13 trustees are struggling under a \"deluge\" of stale debt.  Crawford, 758 F.\u00a03d, at 1256.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the other features of the bankruptcy process that the majority believes will serve as a backstop against frivolous claims are even less likely to do so in practice.  The majority implies that a person who files for bankruptcy is more sophisticated than the average consumer debtor because the initiation of bankruptcy is a choice made by a debtor.  Ante, at 6.  But a person who has filed for bankruptcy will rarely be in such a superior position; he has, after all, just declared that he is unable to meet his financial obligations and in need of the assistance of the courts.  It is odd to speculate that such a person is better situated to monitor court filings and lodge objections than an ordinary consumer.  The majority also suggests that the rules of bankruptcy help \"guide the evaluation of claims.\"  Ibid.  But the rules of bankruptcy in fact facilitate the allowance of claims: Claims are automatically allowed and made part of a plan unless an objection is made.  See 11 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7502(a).  A debtor is arguably more vulnerable in bankruptcy--not less--to the oversights that the debt buyers know will occur.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the majority suggests, in some cases a consumer will actually benefit if a claim for an untimely debt is filed.  Ante, at 7-8.  If such a claim is filed but disallowed, the majority explains, the debt will eventually be discharged, and the creditor will be barred from collecting it.  See \u00a71328(a).  Here, too, practice refutes the majority's rosy portrait of these proceedings.  A debtor whose trustee does not spot and object to a stale debt will find no comfort  in the knowledge that other consumers with more attentive trustees may have their debts disallowed and discharged.  Moreover, given the high rate at which debtors are unable to fully pay off their debts in Chapter 13 proceedings, see Porter, The Pretend Solution: An Empirical Study of Bankruptcy Outcomes, 90 Texas L.\u00a0Rev. 103, 111-112 (2011), most debtors who fail to object to a stale claim will end up worse off than had they never entered bankruptcy at all: They will make payments on the stale debts, thereby resuscitating them, see supra, at\u00a06-7, and may thus walk out of bankruptcy court owing more to their creditors than they did when they entered it.  There is no benefit to anyone in such a proceeding--except the debt collectors.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It does not take a sophisticated attorney to understand why the practice I have described in this opinion is unfair.  It takes only the common sense to conclude that one should not be able to profit on the inadvertent inattention of others.  It is said that the law should not be a trap for the unwary.  Today's decision sets just such a trap.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I take comfort only in the knowledge that the Court's decision today need not be the last word on the matter.  If Congress wants to amend the FDCPA to make explicit what in my view is already implicit in the law, it need only say so.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Because I believe the practice at issue here is \"unfair\" and \"unconscionable,\" and thus violates 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71692f, I do not address the Court's conclusion that the practice is not \"false, deceptive, or misleading\" in violation of \u00a71692e.\nFootnote 2\u00a0A case pending before this Court, Henson v. Santander Consumer USA Inc., No. 16-349, asks whether a certain kind of debt buyer is a \"debt collector\" under the FDCPA.  Midland does not dispute that it is a debt collector under the Act.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Petitioner's parent alone filed 245,000 lawsuits in 2009.  See Silver-Greenberg, Boom in Debt Buying Fuels Another Boom--in Lawsuits, Wall Street Journal, Nov. 29, 2010, pp. A1, A16.  Petitioner itself filed 110 lawsuits on just one date in a single state court.  Id., at A1.\nFootnote 4\u00a0This Court has not had occasion to construe the terms \"unfair\" and \"unconscionable\" in \u00a71692f.  The FDCPA's legislative history suggests that Congress intended these terms as a backstop that would enable \"courts, where appropriate, to proscribe other improper conduct .\u00a0.\u00a0. not specifically addressed\" by the statute.  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 95-382, p.\u00a04 (1977).  Courts have construed these terms, consistent with other federal and state statutes that employ them, to borrow from equitable and common-law traditions.  See, e.g., LeBlanc v. Unifund CCR Partners, 601 F.\u00a03d 1185, 1200-1201 (CA11 2010) (per curiam); Beler v. Blatt, Hasenmiller, Leibsker & Moore, LLC, 480 F.\u00a03d 470, 473-474 (CA7 2007).\nFootnote 5\u00a0The majority does lean heavily on its fear that, were we to conclude that the FDCPA bars the practice at issue, we would be licensing \"postbankruptcy litigation in an ordinary civil court\" concerning matters best left to bankruptcy courts.  Ante, at 9.  But to do so would not, as the majority suggests, \"upset [the] 'delicate balance'\u00a0\" struck by the Code.  Ibid. (quoting Kokoszka v. Belford, 417 U.\u00a0S., at 651).  For one, nothing requires a debtor to engage in satellite litigation in order to sue a debt collector under the FDCPA; a debtor can easily file an adversary proceeding asserting an FDCPA claim with the bankruptcy court itself, and in many cases will be better served by doing so.  See, e.g., Simon v. FIA Card Servs., N.\u00a0A., 732 F.\u00a03d 259, 263 (CA3 2013).  Nor is there any risk that finding the FDCPA applicable here will authorize bankruptcy courts (or, for that matter, civil courts) to engage in novel and unfettered inquiries into \"a creditor's state of mind.\"  Ante, at 9.  Both Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 11 and its bankruptcy counterpart, Fed. Rule Bkrtcy. Proc. 9011, authorize a court to impose sanctions on parties who willfully file meritless claims (a category that includes the debt buyers here, see In re Sekema, 523 B. R. 651, 654-655 (Bkrtcy. Ct. ND Ind. 2015)).  So there is nothing new about the inquiry that courts would be required to undertake; it is no different than analyses they conduct every day.\n\n\n","55":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nMOORE v. TEXAS(2017)\nNo. 15-797\nArgued: November 29, 2016Decided: March 28, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Moore was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death for fatally shooting a store clerk during a botched robbery that occurred when Moore was 20 years old.  A state habeas court subsequently determined that, under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304, and Hall v. Florida, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, Moore qualified as intellectually disabled and that his death sentence therefore violated the Eighth Amendment's proscription of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\"  The court consulted current medical diagnostic standards--the 11th edition of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities clinical manual (AAIDD-11) and the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association.  The habeas court followed the generally accepted intellectual-disability definition, which identifies three core elements: (1) intellectual-functioning deficits, (2) adaptive deficits, and (3) the onset of these deficits while still a minor.  Moore's IQ scores, the court determined, established subaverage intellectual functioning.  The court credited six scores, the average of which (70.66) indicated mild intellectual disability.  And relying on testimony from mental-health professionals, the court found significant adaptive deficits in all three skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).  Based on its findings, the habeas court recommended to the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) that Moore be granted relief.  The CCA declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the habeas court.  The CCA held instead that the habeas court erred by not following the CCA's 2004 decision in Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 1, which adopted the definition of, and standards for assessing, intellectual disability contained in the 1992 (ninth) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation manual (AAMR-9), predecessor to the current AAIDD-11 manual.  Briseno also incorporated the AAMR-9's requirement that adaptive deficits must be \"related\" to intellectual-functioning deficits, and it recited, without citation to any medical or judicial authority, seven evidentiary factors relevant to the intellectual-disability inquiry.  Based on only two of Moore's IQ scores (of 74 and 78), the CCA concluded that Moore had not shown significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.  And even if he had, the CCA continued, his adaptive strengths undercut any adaptive weaknesses.  The habeas court also failed, the CCA determined, to inquire into relatedness.  Among alternative causes for Moore's adaptive deficits, the CCA suggested, were an abuse-filled childhood, undiagnosed learning disorders, multiple elementary-school transfers, racially motivated harassment and violence at school, and a history of academic failure, drug abuse, and absenteeism.  Briseno's seven evidentiary factors, the CCA further determined, weighed against finding that Moore had satisfied the relatedness requirement.\nHeld:\u00a0By rejecting the habeas court's application of medical guidance and by following the Briseno standard, including the nonclinical Briseno factors, the CCA's decision does not comport with the Eighth Amendment and this Court's precedents.  Pp.\u00a09-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Eighth Amendment, which \"\u00a0'reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons,'\u00a0\" Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___, prohibits the execution of any intellectually disabled individual, Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 321.  While Atkins and Hall left to the States \"the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce\" the restriction on executing the intellectually disabled, Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (internal quotation marks omitted), States' discretion is not \"unfettered,\" id., at ___, and must be \"informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework,\" id., at ___-___.  Relying on the most recent (and still current) versions of the leading diagnostic manuals, the Court concluded in Hall that Florida had \"disregard[ed] established medical practice,\" id., at ___, and had parted ways with practices and trends in other States, id., at ___-___.  Hall indicated that being informed by the medical community does not demand adherence to everything stated in the latest medical guide.  But neither does precedent license disregard of current medical standards.  Pp.\u00a09-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The CCA's conclusion that Moore's IQ scores established that he is not intellectually disabled is irreconcilable with Hall, which instructs that, where an IQ score is close to, but above, 70, courts must account for the test's \"standard error of measurement.\"  See 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___, ___-___.  Because the lower range of Moore's adjusted IQ score of 74 falls at or below 70, the CCA had to move on to consider Moore's adaptive functioning.  Pp.\u00a010-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The CCA's consideration of Moore's adaptive functioning also deviated from prevailing clinical standards and from the older clinical standards the CCA deemed applicable.  Pp.\u00a012-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0The CCA overemphasized Moore's perceived adaptive strengths--living on the streets, mowing lawns, and playing pool for money--when the medical community focuses the adaptive-functioning inquiry on adaptive deficits.  The CCA also stressed Moore's improved behavior in prison, but clinicians caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed in controlled settings.  Pp.\u00a012-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The CCA further concluded that Moore's record of academic failure, along with a history of childhood abuse and suffering, detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related.  The medical community, however, counts traumatic experiences as risk factors for intellectual disability.  The CCA also departed from clinical practice by requiring Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to \"a personality disorder.\"  Mental-health professionals recognize that intellectually disabled people may have other co-existing mental or physical impairments, including, e.g., attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and autism.  Pp.\u00a013-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3)\u00a0The CCA's attachment to the seven Briseno evidentiary factors further impeded its assessment of Moore's adaptive functioning.  By design and in operation, the lay perceptions advanced by Briseno \"creat[e] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed.\"  Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  The medical profession has endeavored to counter lay stereotypes, and the Briseno factors are an outlier, in comparison both to other States' handling of intellectual-disability pleas and to Texas' own practices in contexts other than the death penalty.  Pp.\u00a014-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0States have some flexibility, but not \"unfettered discretion,\" in enforcing Atkins' holding, Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___, and the medical community's current standards, reflecting improved understanding over time, constrain States' leeway in this area.  Here, the habeas court applied current medical standards in reaching its conclusion, but the CCA adhered to the standard it laid out in Briseno, including the nonclinical Briseno factors.  The CCA therefore failed adequately to inform itself of the \"medical community's diagnostic framework,\" Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___.  Because Briseno pervasively infected the CCA's analysis, the decision of that court cannot stand.

TEXAS\non writ of certiorari to the court of  criminal appeals of texas\n[March 28, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Bobby James Moore fatally shot a store clerk during a botched robbery.  He was convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death.  Moore challenged his death sentence on the ground that he was intellectually disabled and therefore exempt from execution.  A state habeas court made detailed factfindings and determined that, under this Court's decisions in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304 (2002), and Hall v. Florida, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014), Moore qualified as intellectually disabled.  For that reason, the court concluded, Moore's death sentence violated the Eighth Amendment's proscription of \"cruel and unusual punishments.\"  The habeas court therefore recommended that Moore be granted relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA)1 declined to adopt the judgment recommended by the state habeas court.2  In the CCA's view, the habeas court erroneously employed intellectual-disability guides currently used in the medical community rather than the 1992 guides adopted by the CCA in Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 1 (2004).  See Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 481, 486-487 (2015).  The appeals court further determined that the evidentiary factors announced in Briseno \"weigh[ed] heavily\" against upsetting Moore's death sentence.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 526.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We vacate the CCA's judgment.  As we instructed in Hall, adjudications of intellectual disability should be \"informed by the views of medical experts.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19); see id., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  That instruction cannot sensibly be read to give courts leave to diminish the force of the medical community's consensus.  Moreover, the several factors Briseno set out as indicators of intellectual disability are an invention of the CCA untied to any acknowledged source.  Not aligned with the medical community's information, and drawing no strength from our precedent, the Briseno factors \"creat[e] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed,\" 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  Accordingly, they may not be used, as the CCA used them, to restrict qualification of an individual as intellectually disabled.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In April 1980, then-20-year-old Bobby James Moore and two others were engaged in robbing a grocery store.  Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 481, 490-491 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015); App. 58.  During the episode, Moore fatally shot a store clerk.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 490.  Some two months later, Moore was convicted and sentenced to death.  See id., at 492.  A federal habeas court later vacated that sentence based on ineffective assistance of trial counsel, see Moore v. Collins, 1995 U.\u00a0S. Dist. LEXIS 22859, *35 (SD Tex., Sept. 29, 1995), and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, see Moore v. Johnson, 194 F.\u00a03d 586, 622 (1999).  Moore was resentenced to death in 2001, and the CCA affirmed on direct appeal.  See Moore v. State, 2004 WL 231323, *1 (Jan. 14, 2004), cert. denied, 543 U.\u00a0S. 931 (2004).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moore subsequently sought state habeas relief.  In 2014, the state habeas court conducted a two-day hearing on whether Moore was intellectually disabled.  See Ex\u00a0parte Moore, No. 314483-C (185th Jud. Dist., Harris Cty., Tex., Feb. 6, 2015), App. to Pet. for Cert. 129a.  The court received affidavits and heard testimony from Moore's family members, former counsel, and a number of court-appointed mental-health experts.  The evidence revealed that Moore had significant mental and social difficulties beginning at an early age.  At 13, Moore lacked basic understanding of the days of the week, the months of the year, and the seasons; he could scarcely tell time or comprehend the standards of measure or the basic principle that subtraction is the reverse of addition.  Id., at 187a.  At school, because of his limited ability to read and write, Moore could not keep up with lessons.  Id., at 146a, 182a-183a.  Often, he was separated from the rest of the class and told to draw pictures.  Ibid.  Moore's father, teachers, and peers called him \"stupid\" for his slow reading and speech.  Id., at 146a, 183a.  After failing every subject in the ninth grade, Moore dropped out of high school.  Id., at 188a.  Cast out of his home, he survived on the streets, eating from trash cans, even after two bouts of food poisoning.  Id., at 192a-193a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In evaluating Moore's assertion of intellectual disability, the state habeas court consulted current medical diagnostic standards, relying on the 11th edition of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD) clinical manual, see AAIDD, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (2010) (hereinafter AAIDD-11), and on the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), see APA, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (2013) (hereinafter DSM-5).  App. to Pet. for Cert. 150a-151a, 202a.  The court followed the generally accepted, uncontroversial intellectual-disability diagnostic definition, which identifies three core elements:  (1) intellectual-functioning deficits (indicated by an IQ score \"approximately two standard deviations below the mean\"--i.e., a score of roughly 70--adjusted for \"the standard error of measurement,\" AAIDD-11, at 27); (2) adaptive deficits (\"the inability to learn basic skills and adjust behavior to changing circumstances,\" Hall v. Flor- ida, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8)); and (3) the onset of these deficits while still a minor.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 150a (citing AAIDD-11, at 1).  See also Hall, 572 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moore's IQ scores, the habeas court determined, established subaverage intellectual functioning.  The court credited six of Moore's IQ scores, the average of which (70.66) indicated mild intellectual disability.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 167a-170a.4  And relying on testimony from several mental-health experts, the habeas court found significant adaptive deficits.  In determining the significance of adaptive deficits, clinicians look to whether an individual's adaptive performance falls two or more standard deviations below the mean in any of the three adaptive skill sets (conceptual, social, and practical).  See AAIDD-11, at 43.  Moore's performance fell roughly two standard deviations below the mean in all three skill categories.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a-201a.  Based on this evidence, the state habeas court recommended that the CCA reduce Moore's sentence to life in prison or grant him a new trial on intellectual disability.  See id., at 203a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA rejected the habeas court's recommendations and denied Moore habeas relief.  See 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 481.  At the outset of its opinion, the CCA reaffirmed Ex\u00a0parte Briseno, 135 S. W. 3d 1 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), as paramount precedent on intellectual disability in Texas capital cases.  See 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 486-487.  Briseno adopted the definition of, and standards for assessing, intellectual disability contained in the 1992 (ninth) edition of the American Association on Mental Retardation (AAMR) manual, predecessor to the current AAIDD-11 manual.  See 135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 7 (citing AAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports (9th ed. 1992) (hereinafter AAMR-9)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Briseno incorporated the AAMR-9's requirement that adaptive deficits be \"related\" to intellectual-functioning deficits.  135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 7 (quoting AAMR-9, at 25).5  To determine whether a defendant has satisfied the relatedness requirement, the CCA instructed in this case, Texas courts should attend to the \"seven evidentiary factors\" first set out in Briseno.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 489.6  No citation to any authority, medical or judicial, accompanied the Briseno court's recitation of the seven factors.  See 135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 8-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The habeas judge erred, the CCA held, by \"us[ing] the most current position, as espoused by AAIDD, regarding the diagnosis of intellectual disability rather than the test .\u00a0.\u00a0. in Briseno.\"  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 486.  This Court's decision in Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304 (2002), the CCA emphasized, \"left it to the States to develop appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction\" on the execution of the intellectually disabled.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 486.  Thus, even though \"[i]t may be true that the AAIDD's and APA's positions regarding the diagnosis of intellectual disability have changed since Atkins and Briseno,\" the CCA retained Briseno's instructions, both because of \"the subjectivity surrounding the medical diagnosis of intellectual disability\" and because the Texas Legislature had  not displaced Briseno with any other guideposts.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 486-487.  The Briseno inquiries, the court said, \"remai[n] adequately 'informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework.'\u00a0\"  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 487 (quoting Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19-20)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Employing Briseno, the CCA first determined that Moore had failed to prove significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 514-519.  Rejecting as unreliable five of the seven IQ tests the habeas court had considered, the CCA limited its appraisal to Moore's scores of 78 in 1973 and 74 in 1989.  Id., at 518-519.  The court then discounted the lower end of the standard-error range associated with those scores.  Id., at 519; see infra, at 10-11 (describing standard error of measurement).  Regarding the score of 74, the court observed that Moore's history of academic failure, and the fact that he took the test while \"exhibit[ing] withdrawn and depressive behavior\" on death row, might have hindered his performance.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 519.  Based on the two scores, but not on the lower portion of their ranges, the court concluded that Moore's scores ranked \"above the intellectually disabled range\" (i.e., above 70).  Ibid.; see id., at 513.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Even if [Moore] had proven that he suffers from significantly sub-average general intellectual functioning,\" the court continued, he failed to prove \"significant and related limitations in adaptive functioning.\"  Id., at 520.  True, the court acknowledged, Moore's and the State's experts agreed that Moore's adaptive-functioning test scores fell more than two standard deviations below the mean.  Id., at 521; see supra, at 4.  But the State's expert ultimately discounted those test results because Moore had \"no exposure\" to certain tasks the testing included, \"such as writing a check and using a microwave oven.\"  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 521-522.  Instead, the expert emphasized Moore's adaptive strengths in school, at trial, and in prison.  Id., at 522-524.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA credited the state expert's appraisal.  Id., at 524.  The habeas court, the CCA concluded, had erred by concentrating on Moore's adaptive weaknesses.  Id., at 489.  Moore had demonstrated adaptive strengths, the CCA spelled out, by living on the streets, playing pool and mowing lawns for money, committing the crime in a sophisticated way and then fleeing, testifying and representing himself at trial, and developing skills in prison.  Id., at 522-523.  Those strengths, the court reasoned, undercut the significance of Moore's adaptive limitations.  Id., at 524-525.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The habeas court had further erred, the CCA determined, by failing to consider whether any of Moore's adaptive deficits were related to causes other than his intellectualfunctioning deficits.  Id., at 488, 526.  Among alternative causes for Moore's adaptive deficits, the CCA suggested, were an abuse-filled childhood, undiagnosed learning  disorders, multiple elementary-school transfers, racially motivated harassment and violence at school, and a history of academic failure, drug abuse, and absenteeism.  Ibid.  Moore's significant improvement in prison, in the CCA's view, confirmed that his academic and social difficulties were not related to intellectual-functioning deficits.  Ibid.  The court then examined each of the seven Briseno evidentiary factors, see supra, at 5-6, and n.\u00a06, concluding that those factors \"weigh[ed] heavily\" against finding that Moore had satisfied the relatedness requirement.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 526-527.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Alcala dissented.  Atkins and Hall, she would have held, require courts to consult current medical standards to determine intellectual disability.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 530.  She criticized the majority for relying on manuals superseded in the medical community, id., at 530-534, 536-539, and for disregarding the habeas court's credibility determinations, id., at 535-536, 538-539.  Judge Alcala questioned the legitimacy of the seven Briseno factors, recounting wide criticism of the factors and explaining how they deviate from the current medical consensus.  See 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 529-530, and n.\u00a05.  Most emphatically, she urged, the CCA \"must consult the medical community's current views and standards in determining whether a defendant is intellectually disabled\"; \"reliance on .\u00a0.\u00a0. standard[s] no longer employed by the medical community,\" she objected, \"is constitutionally unacceptable.\"  Id., at 533.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to determine whether the CCA's adherence to superseded medical standards and its reliance on Briseno comply with the Eighth Amendment and this Court's precedents.  578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eighth Amendment prohibits \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" and \"reaffirms the duty of the government to respect the dignity of all persons,\" Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.\u00a0S. 551, 560 (2005)).  \"To enforce the Constitution's protection of human dignity,\" we \"loo[k] to the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,\" recognizing that \"[t]he Eighth Amendment is not fastened to the obsolete.\"  Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Atkins v. Virginia, we held that the Constitution \"restrict[s] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the State's power to take the life of\" any intellectually disabled individual.  536 U.\u00a0S., at 321.  See also Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6); Roper, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 563-564.  Executing intellectually disabled individuals, we concluded in Atkins, serves no penological purpose, see 536 U.\u00a0S., at 318-320; runs up against a national consensus against the practice, see id., at 313-317; and creates a \"risk that the death penalty will be imposed in spite of factors which may call for a less severe penalty,\" id., at 320 (internal quotation marks omitted); see id., at 320-321.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Hall v. Florida, we held that a State cannot refuse to entertain other evidence of intellectual disability when a defendant has an IQ score above 70.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 21-22).  Although Atkins and Hall left to the States \"the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce\" the restriction on executing the intellectually disabled, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17) (quoting Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 317), States' discretion, we cautioned, is not \"unfettered,\" 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  Even if \"the views of medical experts\" do not \"dictate\" a court's intellectual-disability determination, id., at ___ (slip op., at 19), we clarified, the determination must be \"informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework,\" id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 19-20).  We relied on the most recent (and still current) versions of the leading diagnostic manuals--the DSM-5 and AAIDD-11.  Id., at ___, ___, ___-___, ___-___ (slip op., at 3, 8, 10-11, 20-21).  Florida, we concluded, had violated the Eighth Amendment by \"disregard[ing] established medical practice.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  We further noted that Florida had parted ways with practices and trends in other States.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 12-16).  Hall indicated that being informed by the medical community does not demand adherence to everything stated in the latest medical guide.  But neither  does our precedent license disregard of current medical standards.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA's conclusion that Moore's IQ scores established that he is not intellectually disabled is irreconcilable with Hall.  Hall instructs that, where an IQ score is close to, but above, 70, courts must account for the test's \"standard error of measurement.\"  See id., at ___-___, ___-___ (slip op., at 10-11, 21-22).  See also Brumfield v. Cain, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10) (relying on Hall to find unreasonable a state court's conclusion that a score of 75 precluded an intellectual-disability finding).  As we explained in Hall, the standard error of measurement is \"a statistical fact, a reflection of the inherent imprecision of the test itself.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  \"For purposes of most IQ tests,\" this imprecision in the testing instrument \"means that an individual's score is best understood as a range of scores on either side of the recorded score .\u00a0.\u00a0. within which one may say an individual's true IQ score lies.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  A test's standard error of measurement \"reflects the reality that an individual's intellectual functioning cannot be reduced to a single numerical score.\"  Ibid.  See also id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 10-12); DSM-5, at 37; AAIDD, User's Guide: Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 22-23 (11th ed. 2012) (hereinafter AAIDD-11 User's Guide).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moore's score of 74, adjusted for the standard error of measurement, yields a range of 69 to 79, see 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 519, as the State's retained expert acknowledged, see Brief for Petitioner 39, n.\u00a018; App. 185, 189-190.  Because the lower end of Moore's score range falls at or below 70, the CCA had to move on to consider Moore's adaptive functioning.  See Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 21-22); 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 536 (Alcala, J., dissenting) (even if the majority correctly limited the scores it would consider, \"current medical standards .\u00a0.\u00a0. would still require [the CCA] to examine whether [Moore] has adaptive deficits\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Both Texas and the dissent maintain that the CCA properly considered factors unique to Moore in disregarding the lower end of the standard-error range.  Post, at 14-15; Brief for Respondent 41-42; see supra, at 6-7; 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 519.  But the presence of other sources of imprecision in administering the test to a particular individual, see post, at 14-16, and n.\u00a03, cannot narrow the test-specific standard-error range.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In requiring the CCA to move on to consider Moore's adaptive functioning in light of his IQ evidence, we do not suggest that \"the Eighth Amendment turns on the slightest numerical difference in IQ score,\" post, at 15-16.  Hall invalidated Florida's strict IQ cutoff because the cutoff took \"an IQ score as final and conclusive evidence of a defendant's intellectual capacity, when experts in the field would consider other evidence.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  Here, by contrast, we do not end the intellectual-disability inquiry, one way or the other, based on Moore's IQ score.  Rather, in line with Hall, we require that courts continue the inquiry and consider other evidence of intellectual disability where an individual's IQ score, adjusted for the test's standard error, falls within the clinically established range for intellectual-functioning deficits.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA's consideration of Moore's adaptive functioning also deviated from prevailing clinical standards and from the older clinical standards the court claimed to apply.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In concluding that Moore did not suffer significant adaptive deficits, the CCA overemphasized Moore's perceived adaptive strengths.  The CCA recited the strengths it perceived, among them, Moore lived on the streets, mowed lawns, and played pool for money.  See 470 S. W. 3d, at 522-523, 526-527.  Moore's adaptive strengths, in the CCA's view, constituted evidence adequate to overcome the considerable objective evidence of Moore's adaptive deficits, see supra, at 4; App. to Pet. for Cert. 180a-202a.  See 470 S. W. 3d, at 522-524, 526-527.  But the medical community focuses the adaptive-functioning inquiry on adaptive deficits.  E.g., AAIDD-11, at 47 (\"significant limitations in conceptual, social, or practical adaptive skills [are] not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills\"); DSM-5, at 33, 38 (inquiry should focus on \"[d]eficits in adaptive functioning\"; deficits in only one of the three adaptive-skills domains suffice to show adaptive deficits); see Brumfield, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (\"[I]ntellectually disabled persons may have 'strengths in social or physical capabilities, strengths in some adaptive skill areas, or strengths in one aspect of an adaptive skill in which they otherwise show an overall limitation.'\u00a0\" (quoting AAMR, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 8 (10th ed. 2002)).8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the CCA stressed Moore's improved behavior in prison.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 522-524, 526-527.  Clinicians, however, caution against reliance on adaptive strengths developed \"in a controlled setting,\" as a prison surely is.  DSM-5, at 38 (\"Adaptive functioning may be difficult to assess in a controlled setting (e.g., prisons, detention centers); if possible, corroborative information reflecting functioning outside those settings should be obtained.\"); see AAIDD-11 User's Guide 20 (counseling against reliance on \"behavior in jail or prison\").\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA furthermore concluded that Moore's record of academic failure, along with the childhood abuse and suffering he endured, detracted from a determination that his intellectual and adaptive deficits were related.  See 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 488, 526; supra, at 5, 7-8.  Those traumatic experiences, however, count in the medical community as \"risk factors\" for intellectual disability.  AAIDD-11, at 59-60 (emphasis added).  Clinicians rely on such factors as cause to explore the prospect of intellectual disability further, not to counter the case for a disability determination.  See id., at 60 (\"[A]t least one or more of the risk factors [described in the manual] will be found in every case of\" intellectual disability.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA also departed from clinical practice by requiring Moore to show that his adaptive deficits were not related to \"a personality disorder.\"  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 488; see id., at 526 (Moore's problems in kindergarten were \"more likely cause[d]\" by \"emotional problems\" than by intellectual disability).  As mental-health professionals recognize, however, many intellectually disabled people also have other mental or physical impairments, for example, attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and autism.  DSM-5, at 40 (\"[c]o-occurring mental, neurodevelopmental, medical, and physical conditions are frequent in intellectual disability, with rates of some conditions (e.g., mental disorders, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy) three to four times higher than in the general population\"); see AAIDD-11, at 58-63.  Coexisting conditions frequently encountered in intellectually disabled individuals have been described in clinical literature as \"[c]omorbidit[ies].\"  DSM-5, at 40.  See also Brief for AAIDD et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 20, and n.\u00a025.  The existence of a personality disorder or mental-health issue, in short, is \"not evidence that a person does not also have intellectual disability.\"  Brief for American Psychological Association, APA, et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 19.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA's attachment to the seven Briseno evidentiary factors further impeded its assessment of Moore's adaptive functioning.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By design and in operation, the Briseno factors \"creat[e] an unacceptable risk that persons with intellectual disability will be executed,\" Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  After observing that persons with \"mild\" intellectual disability might be treated differently under clinical standards than under Texas' capital system, the CCA defined its objective as identifying the \"consensus of Texas citizens\" on who \"should be exempted from the death penalty.\"  Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 6 (emphasis added).  Mild levels of intellectual disability, although they may fall outside Texas citizens' consensus, nevertheless remain intellectual disabilities, see Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 17-18); Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 308, and n.\u00a03; AAIDD-11, at 153, and States may not execute anyone in \"the entire category of [intellectually disabled] offenders,\" Roper, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 563-564 (emphasis added); see supra, at 9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Skeptical of what it viewed as \"exceedingly subjective\" medical and clinical standards, the CCA in Briseno advanced lay perceptions of intellectual disability.  135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 8; see supra, at 5-6, and n.\u00a06.  Briseno asks, for example, \"Did those who knew the person best during the developmental stage--his family, friends, teachers, employers, authorities--think he was mentally retarded at that time, and, if so, act in accordance with that determination?\"  135 S. W. 3d, at 8.  Addressing that question here, the CCA referred to Moore's education in \"normal classrooms during his school career,\" his father's reactions to his academic challenges, and his sister's perceptions of Moore's intellectual abilities.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 526-527.  But the medical profession has endeavored to counter lay stereotypes of the intellectually disabled.  See AAIDD-11 User's Guide 25-27; Brief for AAIDD et\u00a0al. as Amici Cu- riae 9-14, and nn.\u00a011-15.  Those stereotypes, much  more than medical and clinical appraisals, should spark skepticism.9\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Briseno factors are an outlier, in comparison both to other States' handling of intellectual-disability pleas and to Texas' own practices in other contexts.  See Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (consensus in the States provides \"objective indicia of society's standards in the context of the Eighth Amendment\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  No state legislature has approved the use of the Briseno factors or anything similar.  In the 12 years since Texas adopted the factors, only one other state high court and one state intermediate appellate court have authorized their use.  See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Bracey, 632 Pa. 75, ___-___, 117 A.\u00a03d 270, 286-287 (2015); Howell v. State, 2011 WL 2420378, *18 (Tenn. Crim. App., June 14, 2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, Texas itself does not follow Briseno in contexts other than the death penalty.  See Brief for Constitution Project as Amicus Curiae 14-17.  For example, the related-ness requirement Texas defends here, see supra, at 5-6,  is conspicuously absent from the standards the State uses to assess students for intellectual disabilities.  See 19 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a789.1040(c)(5) (2015).  And even within Texas' criminal-justice system, the State requires the intellectual-disability diagnoses of juveniles to be based on \"the latest edition of the DSM.\"  37 Tex. Admin. Code \u00a7380.8751(e)(3) (2016).  Texas cannot satisfactorily explain why it applies current medical standards for diagnosing intellectual disability in other contexts, yet clings to superseded standards when an individual's life is at stake.10\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted supra, at 9, States have some flexibility, but not \"unfettered discretion,\" in enforcing Atkins' holding.  Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 17).  \"If the States were to have complete autonomy to define intellectual disability as they wished,\" we have observed, \"Atkins could become a nullity, and the Eighth Amendment's protection of human dignity would not become a reality.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 18-19).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The medical community's current standards supply one constraint on States' leeway in this area.  Reflecting improved understanding over time, see DSM-5, at 7; AAIDD-11, at xiv-xv, current manuals offer \"the best available description of how mental disorders are expressed and can be recognized by trained clinicians,\" DSM-5, at xli.  See also Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___, ___, ___-___, ___-___ (slip op., at 2, 3, 8, 10-11, 20-21) (employing current clinical standards); Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 308, n.\u00a03, 317, n.\u00a022 (relying on then-current standards).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Moore's case, the habeas court applied current medical standards in concluding that Moore is intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible for the death penalty.  See, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 150a-151a, 200a-203a.  The CCA, however, faulted the habeas court for \"disregarding [the CCA's] case law and employing the definition of intellectual disability presently used by the AAIDD.\"  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 486.  The CCA instead fastened its  intellectual-disability determination to \"the AAMR's 1992 definition of intellectual disability that [it] adopted in Briseno for Atkins claims presented in Texas death-penalty cases.\"  Ibid.  By rejecting the habeas court's application of medical guidance and clinging to the standard it laid out in Briseno, including the wholly nonclinical Briseno factors, the CCA failed adequately to inform itself of the \"medical community's diagnostic framework,\" Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 19-20).  Because Briseno pervasively infected the CCA's analysis, the decision of that court cannot stand.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nRoberts, C. J., dissenting\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-797\nBOBBY JAMES MOORE, PETITIONER v. TEXAS\non writ of certiorari to the court of  criminal appeals of texas\n[March 28, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Alito join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) concluded that Bobby James Moore was not intellectually disabled so as to be exempt from the death penalty under Atkins v. Virginia, 536 U.\u00a0S. 304 (2002).  It reached that conclusion based on its findings that he had failed to establish either significantly subaverage intellectual functioning or related significant deficits in adaptive behavior.  The latter conclusion was based, in part, on the CCA's analysis of a set of seven \"evidentiary factors\" from Ex parte Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 1, 8 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).  I agree with the Court today that those factors are an unacceptable method of enforcing the guarantee of Atkins, and that the CCA therefore erred in using them to analyze adaptive deficits.  But I do not agree that the CCA erred as to Moore's intellectual functioning.  Because the CCA's determination on that ground is an independent basis for its judgment, I would affirm the decision below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My broader concern with today's opinion, however, is that it abandons the usual mode of analysis this Court has employed in Eighth Amendment cases.  The Court overturns the CCA's conclusion that Moore failed to present sufficient evidence of both inadequate intellectual functioning and significant deficits in adaptive behavior without even considering \"objective indicia of society's standards\" reflected in the practices among the States.  Hall v. Florida, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12) (quoting Roper v. Simmons, 543 U.\u00a0S. 551, 563 (2005)).  The Court instead crafts a constitutional holding based solely on what it deems to be medical consensus about intellectual disability.  But clinicians, not judges, should determine clinical standards; and judges, not clinicians, should determine the content of the Eighth Amendment.  Today's opinion confuses those roles, and I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On April 25, 1980, Moore and two others were throwing dice when they decided to commit a robbery to obtain money for car payments.  Moore provided the group with two firearms, and the three men began to drive around Houston looking for a target.  Eventually they settled on the Birdsall Super Market.  After negotiating their respective shares of the money they intended to steal and donning disguises, the three went inside, heading straight to a courtesy booth staffed by James McCarble and Edna Scott.  When Scott realized a robbery was occurring and screamed, Moore shot McCarble in the head, killing the 70-year-old instantly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moore fled Houston and remained on the run until his arrest in Louisiana ten days after the murder.  After giving a written statement admitting his participation in the robbery and killing, Moore was charged with capital murder.  A jury convicted him and sentenced him to death.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Over the next three decades, Moore's case traversed the state and federal court systems, finally reaching the Atkins hearing at issue today in 2014.  The state habeas court conducted a two-day evidentiary hearing, during which it heard testimony from family members, a fellow inmate, a prison official, and four mental health professionals.  The court concluded that Moore had shown intellectual disability and recommended that he be granted relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But it was just that: a recommendation.  Under Texas law, the CCA, not the habeas court, is the ultimate factfinder in habeas corpus proceedings.  Ex\u00a0parte Reed, 271 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 698, 727 (Tex. Crim. App. 2008); see also Ex\u00a0parte Moore, 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 481, 489 (Tex. Crim. App. 2015).  Assuming that role, the CCA declined to adopt the habeas court's findings and conclusions, instead conducting its own review of the record to determine whether Moore had shown he was intellectually disabled.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA began by considering the appropriate legal standard for assessing intellectual disability.  Following our instruction to the States to \"develop[\u00a0] appropriate ways to enforce\" Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 317 (internal quotation marks omitted), the CCA had set out a legal definition for intellectual disability in its prior decision in Ex parte Briseno.  Rather than follow that test, the habeas court below crafted its own standards for intellectual disability.  But \"[t]he decision to modify the legal standard for intellectual disability in the capital-sentencing context,\" the CCA explained, \"rests with this Court unless and until the Legislature acts.\"  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 487.  Just as we have corrected lower courts for taking it upon themselves to dismiss our precedent as outdated, see, e.g., Bosse v. Okla- homa, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2), so too the CCA rebuked the habeas court for ignoring binding CCA precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA went on to explain why there was no reason to modify the legal standard it had previously set out.  Briseno had stated a rule that in order for an Atkins claimant to demonstrate intellectual disability he must show (1) significantly subaverage general intellectual functioning and (2) related limitations in adaptive functioning, (3) which had appeared prior to age 18.  See 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 486.  It also laid out a set of seven evidentiary factors--the \"Briseno factors\"--designed to assist \"factfinders .\u00a0.\u00a0. in weighing evidence\" of intellectual disability.  Briseno, 135 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The three-prong definition of intellectual disability came directly from the ninth edition of the manual published by what is now the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities (AAIDD).  Id., at 7; see American Association on Mental Retardation, Mental Retardation: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 5 (9th ed. 1992).  By the time Moore's case reached the CCA, the AAIDD no longer included the requirement that adaptive deficits be \"related\" to intellectual functioning.  But, as the CCA noted, the most recent version of the other leading diagnostic manual, the DSM-5, did include that requirement.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 487, n.\u00a05; American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 38 (5th ed. 2013) (hereinafter DSM-5).  So the CCA was faced with a choice in Moore: Keeping the relatedness requirement would be inconsistent with the AAIDD's current guidance; dropping it would be out of step with the newest version of the DSM.  The CCA concluded that \"the legal test we established in Briseno remains adequately 'informed by the medical community's diagnostic framework,'\u00a0\" and went on to evaluate the case under that approach.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 487 (quoting Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 19-20)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Starting with intellectual functioning, the CCA conducted a painstaking analysis of the battery of tests Moore had taken over the past 40 years.  The CCA concluded that five of the tests the habeas court had considered were unreliable: two of them were neuropsychological tests rather than formal IQ measures; two were group-administered tests, which Moore's own experts had criticized, App. 12 (Otis-Lennon Mental Abilities Test \"not accepted as an instrument appropriate for the assessment of mental retardation or intellectual deficiency\"); id., at 115-116 (Slosson is \"not the greatest test\" and \"not the most reliable approach\"); and the administrator of the fifth test concluded it was \"not .\u00a0.\u00a0. a valid score\" because of evidence of suboptimal effort, id., at 203.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That left two scores for the CCA to analyze: a 78 and a 74.  Significantly subaverage intellectual functioning is \"generally shown by an [IQ] of 70 or less.\"  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 486.  \"Taking into account the standard error of measurement\" for the 78 score yielded a range of 73 to 83--i.e., a range that did not include an IQ of 70 or less.  Id., at 519.  As for the 74, the CCA again considered the standard error of measurement, which yielded a score range of 69 to 79.  The lower end of that range placed Moore within the parameters for significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.  The CCA found, however, that Moore's score was unlikely to be in the lower end of the error-generated range because he was likely exerting poor effort and experiencing depression at the time the test was administered--both factors that Moore's experts agreed could artificially deflate IQ scores.  Id., at 516-517, 519; App. 46, 92.  The CCA accordingly concluded that Moore had failed to present sufficient evidence of significantly subaverage intellectual functioning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having failed one part of the CCA's three-part test, Moore could not be found intellectually disabled.  The CCA nonetheless went on to consider the second prong of the test, Moore's adaptive deficits.  Moore had taken a standardized test of adaptive functioning in which he scored more than two standard deviations below the mean. But Dr. Kristi Compton, the state expert who had administered that test, explained that it was not an accurate measure of Moore's abilities.  She reached this conclusion not because of Moore's adaptive strengths but instead because \"she had to assign zeroes to questions asking about areas to which [Moore] had no exposure, such as writing a check and using a microwave oven.\"  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 522.  Dr. Compton further opined that her evaluation of Moore and review of documentary evidence--including school, trial, and prison records--did not show adaptive deficits sufficient for an intellectual disability diagnosis.  App. 185; see 470 S.\u00a0W. 3d, at 521-524.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CCA also considered and recounted the testimony of the other experts who, unlike Dr. Compton, concluded that Moore had shown significant adaptive deficits.  As factfinders often do in confronting conflicting evidence, the CCA made a credibility determination.  The opinion of Dr. Compton, the CCA concluded, was \"far more credible and reliable\" than those of Moore's experts, given Dr. Compton's \"considerable experience,\" \"thorough[\u00a0] and rigorous[\u00a0] review[\u00a0] [of] a great deal of material,\" and personal evaluation of Moore.  Id., at 524.  Based on Dr. Compton's expert opinion, the CCA concluded Moore had failed to demonstrate significant adaptive deficits.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the CCA considered whether, even assuming that Moore had made sufficient showings as to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits, those two were related.  Again finding Dr. Compton's testimony the most credible, the CCA concluded that \"the record overwhelmingly supports the conclusion\" that Moore's observed academic and social difficulties stemmed, not from low intellectual abilities, but instead from outside factors like the trauma and abuse he suffered as a child and his drug use at a young age.  Id., at 526.  The CCA explained that, in addition to Dr. Compton's expert testimony, consideration of the seven Briseno factors reinforced that relatedness conclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that Moore had failed to present sufficient evidence on intellectual functioning or related adaptive deficits, the CCA \"conclude[d] that for Eighth Amendment purposes,\" Moore had not shown he was intellectually disabled.  470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 527.  Accordingly, he was not exempt from execution under Atkins.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's precedents have emphasized the importance of state legislative judgments in giving content to the Eighth Amendment ban on cruel and unusual punishment.  \"Eighth Amendment judgments should not be .\u00a0.\u00a0. merely the subjective views of individual Justices.\"  Coker v. Georgia, 433 U.\u00a0S. 584, 592 (1977) (plurality opinion).  For that reason, we have emphasized that \"judgment should be informed by objective factors to the maximum possible extent.\"  Ibid.  The \"clearest and most reliable objective evidence of contemporary values\" comes from state legislative judgments.  Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 312 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Such legislative judgments are critical because in \"a democratic society legislatures, not courts, are constituted to respond to the will and consequently the moral values of the people.\"  Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.\u00a0S. 153, 175 (1976) (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And we have focused on state enactments in this realm because of the \"deference we owe to the decisions of the state legislatures under our federal system\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. where the specification of punishments is concerned.\"  Id., at 176.  For these reasons, we have described state legislative judgments as providing \"essential instruction\" in conducting the Eighth Amendment inquiry.  Roper, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 564.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decisions addressing capital punishment for the intellectually disabled recognize the central significance of state consensus.  In holding that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the execution of intellectually disabled individuals in Atkins, the Court first identified a national consensus against the practice and then, applying our own \"independent evaluation of the issue,\" concluded that there was \"no reason to disagree\" with that consensus.  536 U.\u00a0S., at 321.  The scope of our holding--guided as it was by the national consensus--swept only as far as that consensus.  We recognized that there remained the potential for \"serious disagreement .\u00a0.\u00a0. in determining which offenders are in fact retarded.\"  Id., at 317.  And we did not seek to provide \"definitive procedural or substantive guides for determining when a person who claims mental retardation will be so impaired as to fall within Atkins' compass.\"  Bobby v. Bies, 556 U.\u00a0S. 825, 831 (2009) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  Instead, we left \"to the States the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction upon their execution of sentences.\"  Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 317 (quoting Ford v. Wainwright, 477 U.\u00a0S. 399, 416-417 (1986); alterations omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twelve years after Atkins, the Court confronted one State's attempt to enforce the holding of that case.  Hall v. Florida considered Florida's rule requiring a prisoner to present an IQ score of 70 or below to make out an Atkins claim.  Although the Court thought it \"proper to consider the psychiatric and professional studies that elaborate on the purpose and meaning of IQ scores,\" it emphasized that \"[t]he legal determination of intellectual disability is distinct from a medical diagnosis.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 7, 19).  It was \"the Court's duty\"--not that of medical experts--\"to interpret the Constitution.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19).  The Court's conclusion that Florida's rule was \"in direct opposition to the views of those who design, administer, and interpret the IQ test\" was not enough to decide the case.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 22).  Instead, consistent with our settled approach, the Court canvassed \"the legislative policies of various States,\" as well as \"the holdings of state courts,\" because it was state policies that provided \"essential instruction\" for determining the scope of the constitutional guarantee.  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 7, 19) (quoting Roper, 543 U.\u00a0S., at 564).  State policy, the Court concluded, indicated a \"consensus that our society does not regard [Florida's rule] as proper or humane,\" and that \"consensus .\u00a0.\u00a0. instruct[ed us] how to decide the specific issue presented.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 7, 16).  The Court was sharply divided on that conclusion, see id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 4-7) (Alito, J., dissenting), but not on the fact that our precedent mandated such an inquiry.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's decision departs from this Court's precedents, followed in Atkins and Hall, establishing that the determination of what is cruel and unusual rests on a judicial judgment about societal standards of decency, not a medical assessment of clinical practice.  The Court rejects the CCA's conclusion that Moore failed to make the requisite showings with respect to intellectual functioning and adaptive deficits, without any consideration of the state practices that were, three Terms ago, \"essential\" to the Eighth Amendment question.  Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19).  The Court instead finds error in the CCA's analysis based solely on what the Court views to be departure from typical clinical practice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The clinical guides on which the Court relies today are \"designed to assist clinicians in conducting clinical assessment, case formulation, and treatment planning.\"  DSM-5, at 25.  They do not seek to dictate or describe who is morally culpable--indeed, the DSM-5 cautions its readers about \"the imperfect fit between the questions of ultimate concern to the law and the information contained\" within its pages.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eighth Amendment, under our precedent, is supposed to impose a moral backstop on punishment, prohibiting sentences that our society deems repugnant.  The Court, however, interprets that constitutional guarantee as turning on clinical guidelines that do not purport to reflect standards of decency.  The Court's refusal even to address what we previously \"pinpointed\" as \"the clearest and most reliable objective evidence\" of such standards--the practices among the States--goes unexplained by the majority.  Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 312 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A second problem with the Court's approach is the lack of guidance it offers to States seeking to enforce the holding of Atkins.  Recognizing that we have, in the very recent past, held that \"\u00a0'the views of medical experts' do not 'dictate' a court's intellectual-disability determination,\" the Court assures us that it is not requiring adherence \"to everything stated in the latest medical guide,\" ante, at 9-10 (quoting Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19)); States have \"some flexibility\" but cannot \"disregard\" medical standards.  Ante, at 10, 17.  Neither the Court's articulation of this standard nor its application sheds any light on what it means.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start with the Court's stated principle.  \"Disregard\" normally means to dismiss as unworthy of attention, and that is plainly not what the CCA did here.  For example, the Court faults the CCA for placing too much weight on Moore's adaptive strengths and functioning in prison, implying that this marked a dismissal of clinical standards.  Yet the CCA was aware of and, in a prior decision, had addressed the fact that some clinicians would counsel against considering such information.  See 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 489 (citing Ex\u00a0parte Cathey, 451 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 1, 26-27 (2014)).  Both because \"[m]ost courts .\u00a0.\u00a0. consider all of the person's functional abilities\" and because it seemed \"foolhardy\" to ignore strengths, the CCA thought it proper to take note of them.  Id., at 27.  As to prison conduct, the CCA decided that the fundamental questions the Atkins inquiry sought to answer were best considered--and \"sound scientific principles\" best served--by taking account of \"all possible data that sheds light on a person's adaptive functioning, including his conduct in a prison society.\"  451 S.\u00a0W. 3d, at 26-27.  The CCA considered clinical standards and explained why it decided that departure from those standards was warranted.  The court did not \"disregard\" medical standards.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor do the Court's identified errors clarify the scope of the \"flexibility\" we are told States retain in this area.  The Court faults the CCA for \"overemphasiz[ing]\" strengths and \"stress[ing]\" Moore's conduct in prison, ante, at 12-13, suggesting that some--but not too much--consideration of strengths and prison functioning is acceptable.  The Court's only guidance on when \"some\" becomes \"too much\"?  Citations to clinical guides.  See ibid.  But if courts do have \"flexibility\" in enforcing the guarantee of Atkins and need not \"adhere[\u00a0]\" to these guides in every instance or particular, ante, at 10, 17, then clinical texts, standing alone, cannot answer the question of why the CCA placed too much weight on adaptive strengths and prison conduct.  The line between the permissible--consideration, maybe even emphasis--and the forbidden--\"overemphasis\"--is not only thin, but totally undefined by today's decision.  It is not at all clear when a State's deviation from medical consensus becomes so great as to \"diminish the force\" of that consensus, ante, at 2, and thereby violate the Constitution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Court's decision constitutionalizes rules for which there is not even clinical consensus--a consequence that will often arise from the approach charted by the Court today.  Consider the Court's conclusion that, contrary to \"the medical community['s] focus[\u00a0] .\u00a0.\u00a0. on adaptive deficits,\" \"the CCA overemphasized Moore's perceived adaptive strengths.\"  Ante, at 12.  In support of this proposition, the Court cites the AAIDD's direction that \"significant limitations in conceptual, social, or practical adaptive skills [are] not outweighed by the potential strengths in some adaptive skills.\"  AAIDD, Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 47 (11th ed. 2010) (hereinafter AAIDD-11).  Even assuming that all clinicians would agree with this statement, there are a number of ways it might be interpreted: as meaning that strengths in one of the three adaptive skill areas--conceptual, social, and practical--should not cancel out deficits in another; as meaning that strengths should not outweigh deficits within the same skill area; or as meaning that evidence of some ability to perform a skill should not offset evidence of the inability to perform that same skill.  And it appears that clinicians do, in fact, disagree about what this direction means.  Compare, e.g., Brief for AAIDD et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 17 (\"The clinician's diagnostic focus does not--and cannot--involve any form of 'balancing' deficits against the abilities or strengths which the particular individual may also possess\" (emphasis added)) with Hagan, Drogin, & Guilmette, Assessing Adaptive Functioning in Death Penalty Cases after Hall and DSM-5, 44 J. Am. Acad. Psychiatry & L. 96, 98 (2016) (\"Any assessment of adaptive functioning must give sufficient consideration to assets and deficits alike.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [I]nventorying only assets or deficits .\u00a0.\u00a0. departs from DSM-5, [the AAIDD-11], and all other established frameworks\" (footnotes omitted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same is true about consideration of prison conduct.  The two primary clinical guides do offer caution about considering functioning in prison.  But the stringency of their caution differs, with the AAIDD seeming to enact a flat ban on ever looking to functioning in prison and the DSM urging \"if possible\" to consider \"corroborative information reflecting functioning outside\" of prison.  AAIDD, User's Guide: Intellectual Disability: Definition, Classification, and Systems of Supports 20 (11th ed. 2012); DSM-5, at 38.  The CCA followed the DSM-5's instruction, relying on Dr. Compton's conclusion that \"even before [Moore] went to prison\" he demonstrated a \"level of adaptive functioning .\u00a0.\u00a0. too great .\u00a0.\u00a0. to support an intellectual-disability diagnosis.\"  470 S. W. 3d, at 526.  In determining that the CCA erred in this regard, the Court implicitly rejects the DSM-5's approach to the proper consideration of prison conduct and accepts what it takes to be that of the AAIDD.  The Court does not attempt to explain its justification for why the Eighth Amendment should favor one side over the other in this clinical debate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Psychiatry is not .\u00a0.\u00a0. an exact science.\"  Ake v. Oklahoma, 470 U.\u00a0S. 68, 81 (1985).  \"[B]ecause there often is no single, accurate psychiatric conclusion,\" we have emphasized the importance of allowing the \"primary factfinder[\u00a0]\" to \"resolve differences in opinion .\u00a0.\u00a0. on the basis of the evidence offered by each party.\"  Ibid.  You would not know it from reading the Court's opinion today, but that is precisely what the CCA--the factfinder under Texas law--did in the decision below: Confronted with dueling expert opinions about how to evaluate adaptive functioning and what conclusion to reach, the CCA resolved the dispute before it by accepting the testimony of the expert it deemed most credible.  Of course, reliance on an expert opinion does not insulate a decision from further judicial review.  But, unlike the Court, I am unwilling to upset the considered judgment of the forensic psychologist that the factfinding court deemed the most credible based on my own interpretation of a few sentences excised from medical texts.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for how I would resolve this case, there is one aspect of the CCA's approach to intellectual disability that is incompatible with the Eighth Amendment: the Briseno factors.  As the Court explains, no state legislature has approved the use of these or any similar factors.  Although the CCA reviewed these factors to determine whether Moore's adaptive deficits were \"related\" to his intellectual functioning, it may be that consideration of those factors tainted the whole of the CCA's adaptive functioning analysis.  I need not decide this question, however, because the CCA reached the issue of Moore's adaptive functioning only after concluding that he had failed to demonstrate intellectual functioning sufficiently low to warrant a finding of intellectual disability, regardless of his adaptive deficits or their relation to his IQ.  Moore has not presented sufficient reason to upset that independent holding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court concludes that the CCA's assessment of Moore's IQ scores is \"irreconcilable with Hall.\"  Ante, at 10.  Not so.  Hall rejected a Florida rule that required a prisoner to present an IQ score of 70 or below to demonstrate intellectual disability, thereby barring consideration of the standard error of measurement (SEM) of an over-70 score.  But the CCA did not apply Florida's rule--or anything like it.  The court in fact began by taking account of the SEM, explaining that Moore's tested score of 74 led to an IQ range between 69 and 79.  The court went on to consider additional expert testimony about potential factors affecting that score.  Based on that evidence, the CCA discounted portions of the SEM-generated range and concluded that Moore's IQ did not lie in the relevant range for intellectual disability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Hall provided no definitive guidance on this sort of approach: recognizing the inherent imprecision of IQ tests, but considering additional evidence to determine whether an SEM-generated range of scores accurately reflected a prisoner's actual IQ.1  Indeed, in its catalog of States that \"ha[d] taken a position contrary to that of Florida,\" the Court in Hall included a State that granted trial courts discretion to draw \"reasonable inferences\" about IQ scores and, where appropriate, decline to consider the full range of the SEM.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 15, 16) (quoting Pizzuto v. State, 146 Idaho 720, 729, 202 P.\u00a03d 642, 651 (2008)).2  That is the approach the CCA took here.  If that approach was \"contrary\" to Florida's rule in Hall, I do not understand how Hall can be read to reject that approach today.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's ruling on intellectual functioning turns solely on the fact that Moore's IQ range was 69 to 79 rather than 70 to 80.  See ante, at 11 (\"Because the lower end of Moore's score range falls at or below 70, the CCA had to move on to consider Moore's adaptive functioning\").  The CCA certainly did not \"disregard\" SEM in assessing Moore's IQ, and it explained why other factors led it to conclude that his actual score did not fall near the lower end of the SEM range.  Only by insisting on the absolute conformity to medical standards the Court disclaims can it find a violation of the Eighth Amendment based on that one-point difference.3 Ibid.  In concluding that the Eighth Amendment turns on the slightest numerical difference in IQ score, the Court today is just as wrong as the Florida Supreme Court was in Hall.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's decision is not compelled by Hall; it is an expansion of it.  Perhaps there are reasons to expand Hall's holding--to say that States must read IQ tests as rigidly encompassing the entire SEM range, regardless of any other evidentiary considerations, or to say that the reasons that the CCA gave for discounting the lower end of Moore's IQ range were improper.  But before holding that the Constitution demands either result, our precedent requires consulting state judgments on the matter to determine whether a national consensus has developed.  Moore has presented no argument as to such a consensus, and the majority does not claim that there is one.  Without looking to any such \"objective evidence of contemporary values,\" Atkins, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 312 (internal quotation marks omitted), there is a real danger that Eighth Amendment judgments will embody \"merely the subjective views of individual Justices,\" Coker, 433 U.\u00a0S., at 592 (plurality opinion).  As Justice Frankfurter cautioned, \"[o]ne must be on guard against finding in personal disapproval a reflection of more or less prevailing condemnation.\"  Louisiana ex rel. Francis v. Resweber, 329 U.\u00a0S. 459, 471 (1947) (concurring opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The CCA is Texas' court of last resort in criminal cases.

But even if clinicians would consider adaptive strengths alongside adaptive weaknesses within the same adaptive-skill domain, neither Texas nor the dissent identifies any clinical authority permitting the arbitrary offsetting of deficits against unconnected strengths in which the CCA engaged, see 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 520-526.\nFootnote 9\u00a0As elsewhere in its opinion, the CCA, in its deployment of the Briseno factors, placed undue emphasis on adaptive strengths, see supra, at 12-13; 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 527, and regarded risk factors for intellectual disability as evidence of the absence of intellectual disability, see supra, at 13-14; 470 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d, at 526-527.\nFootnote 10\u00a0Given the Briseno factors' flaws, it is unsurprising that scholars and experts have long criticized the factors.  See, e.g., American Bar Assn., Evaluating Fairness and Accuracy in State Death Penalty Systems: The Texas Capital Punishment Assessment Report 395 (2013) (\"The Briseno factors create an especially high risk that [an intellectually disabled defendant] will be executed because, in many ways, they contradict established methods for diagnosing [intellectual disability].\"); Blume, Johnson, & Seeds, Of Atkins and Men: Deviations from Clinical Definitions of Mental Retardation in Death Penalty Cases (footnote omitted), 18 Cornell J.

Flor- ida, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11).  The Court's definition of deficient intellectual functioning as shown by \"an IQ score\" of roughly 70, ante, at 4 (emphasis added), is dicta and cannot be read to call into question the approach of States that would not treat a single IQ score as dispositive evidence where the prisoner presented additional higher scores.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The Court correctly notes that Hall cited Pizzuto as an instance of a State that had enacted \"legislation allowing a defendant to present additional evidence of intellectual disability even when an IQ test score is above 70.\"  Hall, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  The \"additional evidence\" that Pizzuto considered, however, was evidence that would indicate where within the SEM range a prisoner's IQ likely fell, 146 Idaho, at 729, 202 P.\u00a03d, at 651--that is, the same sort of evidence that the CCA considered below.\nFootnote 3\u00a0It is not obvious that clinicians would ignore evidence beyond the SEM in determining the appropriate range that an IQ score represents.

WISCONSIN ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-214\nArgued: March 20, 2017Decided: June 23, 2017\n\n\nThe St. Croix River, which forms part of the boundary between Wisconsin and Minnesota, is protected under federal, state, and local law.  Petitioners own two adjacent lots--Lot E and Lot F--along the lower portion of the river in the town of Troy, Wisconsin.  For the area where petitioners' property is located, state and local regulations prevent the use or sale of adjacent lots under common ownership as separate building sites unless they have at least one acre of land suitable for development.  A grandfather clause relaxes this restriction for substandard lots which were in separate ownership from adjacent lands on January 1, 1976, the regulation's effective date.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners' parents purchased Lots E and F separately in the 1960's, and maintained them under separate ownership until transferring Lot F to petitioners in 1994 and Lot E to petitioners in 1995.  Both lots are over one acre in size, but because of their topography they each have less than one acre suitable for development.  The unification of the lots under common ownership therefore implicated the rules barring their separate sale or development.  Petitioners became interested in selling Lot E as part of an improvement plan for the lots, and sought variances from the St. Croix County Board of Adjustment.  The Board denied the request, and the state courts affirmed in relevant part.  In particular, the State Court of Appeals found that the local ordinance effectively merged the lots, so petitioners could only sell or build on the single combined lot.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners filed suit, alleging that the regulations worked a regulatory taking that deprived them of all, or practically all, of the use of Lot E.  The County Circuit Court granted summary judgment to the State, explaining that petitioners had other options to enjoy and use their property, including eliminating the cabin and building a new residence on either lot or across both.  The court also found that petitioners had not been deprived of all economic value of their property, because the decrease in market value of the unified lots was less than 10 percent.  The State Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the takings analysis properly focused on Lots E and F together and that, using that framework, the merger regulations did not effect a taking.  \nHeld:\u00a0The State Court of Appeals was correct to analyze petitioners' property as a single unit in assessing the effect of the challenged governmental action.

First, \"with certain qualifications .\u00a0.\u00a0. a regulation which 'denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land' will require compensation under the Takings Clause.\"  Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.\u00a0S. 606, 617 (quoting Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.\u00a0S. 1003, 1015).  Second, a taking may be found based on \"a complex of factors,\" including (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action. Palazzolo, supra, at 617 (citing Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U. S. 104, 124).  Yet even the complete deprivation of use under Lucas will not require compensation if the challenged limitations \"inhere .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the restrictions that background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance already placed upon land ownership.\"  Lucas, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 1029.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A central dynamic of the Court's regulatory takings jurisprudence thus is its flexibility.  This is a means to reconcile two competing objectives central to regulatory takings doctrine: the individual's right to retain the interests and exercise the freedoms at the core of private property ownership, cf. id., at 1027, and the government's power to \"adjus[t] rights for the public good,\" Andrus v.

First, courts should give substantial weight to the property's treatment, in particular how it is bounded or divided, under state and local law.  Second, courts must look to the property's physical characteristics, including the physical relationship of any distinguishable tracts, topography, and the surrounding human and ecological environment.  Third, courts should assess the property's value under the challenged regulation, with special attention to the effect of burdened land on the value of other holdings.  Pp.\u00a011-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The formalistic rules for which the State of Wisconsin and petitioners advocate do not capture the central legal and factual principles informing reasonable expectations about property interests.  Wisconsin would tie the definition of the parcel to state law, but it is also necessary to weigh whether the state enactments at issue accord with other indicia of reasonable expectations about property.  Petitioners urge the Court to adopt a presumption that lot lines control, but lot lines are creatures of state law, which can be overridden by the State in the reasonable exercise of its power to regulate land.  The merger provision here is such a legitimate exercise of state power, as reflected by its consistency with a long history of merger regulations and with the many merger provisions that exist nationwide today.  Pp.\u00a014-17.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c) Under the appropriate multifactor standard, it follows that petitioners' property should be evaluated as a single parcel consisting of Lots E and F together.  First, as to the property's treatment under state and local law, the valid merger of the lots under state law informs the reasonable expectation that the lots will be treated as a single property.  Second, turning to the property's physical characteristics, the lots are contiguous.  Their terrain and shape make it reasonable to expect their range of potential uses might be limited; and petitioners could have anticipated regulation of the property due to its location along the river, which was regulated by federal, state, and local law long before they acquired the land.  Third, Lot E brings prospective value to Lot F.  The restriction on using the individual lots is mitigated by the benefits of using the property as an integrated whole, allowing increased privacy and recreational space, plus an optimal location for any improvements.  This relationship is evident in the lots' combined valuation.  The Court of Appeals was thus correct to treat the contiguous properties as one parcel.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Considering petitioners' property as a whole, the state court was correct to conclude that petitioners cannot establish a compensable taking.  They have not suffered a taking under Lucas, as they have not been deprived of all economically beneficial use of their property.  See 505 U.\u00a0S., at 1019.  Nor have they suffered a taking under the more general test of Penn Central, supra, at 124.

MURR, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. WISCONSIN, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of wisconsin, district iii\n[June 23, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The classic example of a property taking by the government is when the property has been occupied or otherwise seized.  In the case now before the Court, petitioners contend that governmental entities took their real property--an undeveloped residential lot--not by some physical occupation but instead by enacting burdensome regulations that forbid its improvement or separate sale because it is classified as substandard in size.  The relevant governmental entities are the respondents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Against the background justifications for the challenged restrictions, respondents contend there is no regulatory taking because petitioners own an adjacent lot.  The regulations, in effecting a merger of the property, permit the continued residential use of the property including for a single improvement to extend over both lots.  This retained right of the landowner, respondents urge, is of sufficient offsetting value that the regulation is not severe enough to be a regulatory taking.  To resolve the issue whether the landowners can insist on confining the analysis just to the lot in question, without regard to their ownership of the adjacent lot, it is necessary to discuss the background principles that define regulatory takings.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The St. Croix River originates in northwest Wisconsin and flows approximately 170 miles until it joins the Mississippi River, forming the boundary between Minnesota and Wisconsin for much of its length.  The lower portion of the river slows and widens to create a natural water area known as Lake St. Croix.  Tourists and residents of the region have long extolled the picturesque grandeur of the river and surrounding area.  E.g., E. Ellett, Summer Rambles in the West 136-137 (1853).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the river was designated, by 1972, for federal protection.  \u00a73(a)(6), 82 Stat. 908, 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71274(a)(6) (designating Upper St. Croix River); Lower Saint Croix River Act of 1972, \u00a72, 86 Stat. 1174, 16 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71274(a)(9) (adding Lower St. Croix River).  The law required the States of Wisconsin and Minnesota to develop \"a management and development program\" for the river area.  41 Fed. Reg. 26237 (1976).  In compliance, Wisconsin authorized the State Department of Natural Resources to promulgate rules limiting development in order to \"guarantee the protection of the wild, scenic and recreational qualities of the river for present and future generations.\"  Wis. Stat. \u00a730.27(l) (1973).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners are two sisters and two brothers in the Murr family.  Petitioners' parents arranged for them to receive ownership of two lots the family used for recreation along the Lower St. Croix River in the town of Troy, Wisconsin.  The lots are adjacent, but the parents purchased them separately, put the title of one in the name of the family business, and later arranged for transfer of the two lots, on different dates, to petitioners.  The lots, which are referred to in this litigation as Lots E and F, are described in more detail below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the area where petitioners' property is located, the Wisconsin rules prevent the use of lots as separate building sites unless they have at least one acre of land suitable for development.  Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7\u00a7\u00a0NR\u00a0118.04(4), 118.03(27), 118.06(1)(a)(2)(a), 118.06(1)(b) (2017).  A grand-father clause relaxes this restriction for substandard lots which were \"in separate ownership from abutting lands\" on January 1, 1976, the effective date of the regulation.  \u00a7\u00a0NR\u00a0118.08(4)(a)(1).  The clause permits the use of qualifying lots as separate building sites.  The rules also include a merger provision, however, which provides that adjacent lots under common ownership may not be \"sold or developed as separate lots\" if they do not meet the size requirement.  \u00a7\u00a0NR\u00a0118.08(4)(a)(2).  The Wisconsin rules require localities to adopt parallel provisions, see \u00a7\u00a0NR\u00a0118.02(3), so the St. Croix County zoning ordinance contains identical restrictions, see St. Croix County, Wis., Ordinance \u00a717.36I.4.a (2005).  The Wisconsin rules also authorize the local zoning authority to grant variances from the regulations where enforcement would create \"unnecessary hardship.\"  \u00a7\u00a0NR\u00a0118.09(4)(b); St. Croix County Ordinance \u00a717.09.232.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners' parents purchased Lot F in 1960 and built a small recreational cabin on it.  In 1961, they transferred title to Lot F to the family plumbing company.  In 1963, they purchased neighboring Lot E, which they held in their own names.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lots have the same topography.  A steep bluff cuts through the middle of each, with level land suitable for development above the bluff and next to the water below it.  The line dividing Lot E from Lot F runs from the riverfront to the far end of the property, crossing the blufftop along the way.  Lot E has approximately 60 feet of river frontage, and Lot F has approximately 100 feet.  Though each lot is approximately 1.25 acres in size, because of the waterline and the steep bank they each have less than one acre of land suitable for development.  Even when combined, the lots' buildable land area is only 0.98 acres due to the steep terrain.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lots remained under separate ownership, with Lot F owned by the plumbing company and Lot E owned by petitioners' parents, until transfers to petitioners.  Lot F was conveyed to them in 1994, and Lot E was conveyed to them in 1995.  Murr v. St. Croix County Bd. of Adjustment, 2011 WI App 29, 332 Wis. 2d 172, 177-178, 184-185, 796 N.\u00a0W. 2d 837, 841, 844 (2011); 2015 WI App 13, 359 Wis. 2d 675, 859 N.\u00a0W. 2d 628 (unpublished opinion), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-3, \u00b6\u00b64-5.  (There are certain ambiguities in the record concerning whether the lots had merged earlier, but the parties and the courts below appear to have assumed the merger occurred upon transfer to petitioners.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A decade later, petitioners became interested in moving the cabin on Lot F to a different portion of the lot and selling Lot E to fund the project.  The unification of the lots under common ownership, however, had implicated the state and local rules barring their separate sale or development.  Petitioners then sought variances from the St. Croix County Board of Adjustment to enable their building and improvement plan, including a variance to allow the separate sale or use of the lots.  The Board denied the requests, and the state courts affirmed in relevant part.  In particular, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals agreed with the Board's interpretation that the local ordinance \"effectively merged\" Lots E and F, so petitioners \"could only sell or build on the single larger lot.\"  Murr, supra, at 184, 796 N.\u00a0W. 2d, at 844.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners filed the present action in state court, alleging that the state and county regulations worked a regulatory taking by depriving them of \"all, or practically all, of the use of Lot E because the lot cannot be sold or developed as a separate lot.\"  App. 9.  The parties each submitted appraisal numbers to the trial court.  Respondents' appraisal included values of $698,300 for the lots together as regulated; $771,000 for the lots as two distinct build-able properties; and $373,000 for Lot F as a single lot with improvements.  Record 17-55, 17-56.  Petitioners' appraisal included an unrebutted, estimated value of $40,000 for Lot E as an undevelopable lot, based on the counterfactual assumption that it could be sold as a separate property.  Id., at 22-188.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Circuit Court of St. Croix County granted summary judgment to the State, explaining that petitioners retained \"several available options for the use and enjoyment of their property.\"  Case No. 12-CV-258 (Oct. 31, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. B-9.  For example, they could preserve the existing cabin, relocate the cabin, or eliminate the cabin and build a new residence on Lot E, on Lot F, or across both lots.  The court also found petitioners had not been deprived of all economic value of their property.  Considering the valuation of the property as a single lot versus two separate lots, the court found the market value of the property was not significantly affected by the regulations because the decrease in value was less than 10 percent.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed.  The court explained that the regulatory takings inquiry required it to \"\u00a0'first determine what, precisely, is the property at issue.'\u00a0\"  Id., at A-9, \u00b617.  Relying on Wisconsin Supreme Court precedent in Zealy v. Waukesha, 201 Wis. 2d 365, 548 N.\u00a0W. 2d 528 (1996), the Court of Appeals rejected petitioners' request to analyze the effect of the regulations on Lot E only.  Instead, the court held the takings analysis \"properly focused\" on the regulations' effect \"on the Murrs' property as a whole\"--that is, Lots E and F together.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-12, \u00b622.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Using this framework, the Court of Appeals concluded the merger regulations did not effect a taking.  In particular, the court explained that petitioners could not reasonably have expected to use the lots separately because they were \"\u00a0'charged with knowledge of the existing zoning laws'\u00a0\" when they acquired the property.  Ibid. (quoting Murr, supra, at 184, 796 N.\u00a0W. 2d, at 844).  Thus, \"even if [petitioners] did intend to develop or sell Lot E separately, that expectation of separate treatment became unreasonable when they chose to acquire Lot E in 1995, after their having acquired Lot F in 1994.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-17, \u00b630.  The court also discounted the severity of the economic impact on petitioners' property, recognizing the Circuit Court's conclusion that the regulations diminished the property's combined value by less than 10 percent.  The Supreme Court of Wisconsin denied discretionary review.  This Court granted certiorari, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides that private property shall not \"be taken for public use, without just compensation.\"  The Clause is made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment.  Chicago, B. & Q. R. Co. v. Chicago, 166 U.\u00a0S. 226 (1897).  As this Court has recognized, the plain language of the Takings Clause \"requires the payment of compensation whenever the government acquires private property for a public purpose,\" see Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.\u00a0S. 302, 321 (2002), but it does not address in specific terms the imposition of regulatory burdens on private property.  Indeed, \"[p]rior to Justice Holmes's exposition in Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.\u00a0S. 393 (1922), it was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a direct appropriation of property, or the functional equivalent of a practical ouster of the owner's possession,\" like the permanent flooding of property.  Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.\u00a0S. 1003, 1014 (1992) (citation, brackets, and internal quotation marks omitted); accord, Horne v. Department of Agriculture, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7); see also Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.\u00a0S. 419, 427 (1982).  Mahon, however, initiated this Court's regulatory takings jurisprudence, declaring that \"while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\"  260 U.\u00a0S., at 415.  A regulation, then, can be so burdensome as to become a taking, yet the Mahon Court did not formulate more detailed guidance for determining when this limit is reached.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the near century since Mahon, the Court for the most part has refrained from elaborating this principle through definitive rules.  This area of the law has been characterized by \"ad\u00a0hoc, factual inquiries, designed to allow careful examination and weighing of all the relevant circumstances.\"  Tahoe-Sierra, supra, at 322 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court has, however, stated two guidelines relevant here for determining when government regulation is so onerous that it constitutes a taking.  First, \"with certain qualifications .\u00a0.\u00a0. a regulation which 'denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land' will require compensation under the Takings Clause.\"  Palazzolo v. Rhode Island, 533 U.\u00a0S. 606, 617 (2001) (quoting Lucas, supra, at 1015).  Second, when a regulation impedes the use of property without depriving the owner of all economically beneficial use, a taking still may be found based on \"a complex of factors,\" including (1) the economic impact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character of the governmental action.  Palazzolo, supra, at 617 (citing Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.\u00a0S. 104, 124 (1978)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By declaring that the denial of all economically beneficial use of land constitutes a regulatory taking, Lucas stated what it called a \"categorical\" rule.  See 505 U.\u00a0S., at 1015.  Even in Lucas, however, the Court included a caveat recognizing the relevance of state law and land-use customs: The complete deprivation of use will not require compensation if the challenged limitations \"inhere .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the restrictions that background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance already placed upon land ownership.\"  Id., at 1029; see also id., at 1030-1031 (listing factors for courts to consider in making this determination).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A central dynamic of the Court's regulatory takings jurisprudence, then, is its flexibility.  This has been and remains a means to reconcile two competing objectives central to regulatory takings doctrine.  One is the individual's right to retain the interests and exercise the freedoms at the core of private property ownership.  Cf. id., at 1028 (\"[T]he notion .\u00a0.\u00a0. that title is somehow held subject to the 'implied limitation' that the State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use is inconsistent with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part of our constitutional culture\").  Property rights are necessary to preserve freedom, for property ownership empowers persons to shape and to plan their own destiny in a world where governments are always eager to do so for them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The other persisting interest is the government's well-established power to \"adjus[t] rights for the public good.\"  Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.\u00a0S. 51, 65 (1979).  As Justice Holmes declared, \"Government hardly could go on if to some extent values incident to property could not be diminished without paying for every such change in the general law.\"  Mahon, supra, at 413.  In adjudicating regulatory takings cases a proper balancing of these principles requires a careful inquiry informed by the specifics of the case.  In all instances, the analysis must be driven \"by the purpose of the Takings Clause, which is to prevent the government from 'forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.'\u00a0\"  Palazzolo, supra, at 617-618 (quoting Armstrong v. United States, 364 U.\u00a0S. 40, 49 (1960)).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case presents a question that is linked to the ultimate determination whether a regulatory taking has occurred: What is the proper unit of property against which to assess the effect of the challenged governmental action?  Put another way, \"[b]ecause our test for regulatory taking requires us to compare the value that has been taken from the property with the value that remains in the property, one of the critical questions is determining how to define the unit of property 'whose value is to furnish the denominator of the fraction.'\u00a0\"  Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.\u00a0S. 470, 497 (1987) (quoting Michelman, Property, Utility, and Fairness, 80 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1165, 1992 (1967)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As commentators have noted, the answer to this question may be outcome determinative.  See Eagle, The Four-Factor Penn Central Regulatory Takings Test, 118 Pa. St. L.\u00a0Rev. 601, 631 (2014); see also Wright, A New Time for Denominators, 34 Env. L. 175, 180 (2004).  This Court, too, has explained that the question is important to the regulatory takings inquiry.  \"To the extent that any portion of property is taken, that portion is always taken in its entirety; the relevant question, however, is whether the property taken is all, or only a portion of, the parcel in question.\"  Concrete Pipe & Products of Cal., Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern Cal., 508 U.\u00a0S. 602, 644 (1993).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Defining the property at the outset, however, should not necessarily preordain the outcome in every case.  In some, though not all, cases the effect of the challenged regulation must be assessed and understood by the effect on the entire property held by the owner, rather than just some part of the property that, considered just on its own, has been diminished in value.  This demonstrates the contrast between regulatory takings, where the goal is usually to determine how the challenged regulation affects the property's value to the owner, and physical takings, where the impact of physical appropriation or occupation of the property will be evident.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the Court has not set forth specific guidance on how to identify the relevant parcel for the regulatory taking inquiry, there are two concepts which the Court has indicated can be unduly narrow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court has declined to limit the parcel in an artificial manner to the portion of property targeted by the challenged regulation.  In Penn Central, for example, the Court rejected a challenge to the denial of a permit to build an office tower above Grand Central Terminal.  The Court refused to measure the effect of the denial only against the \"air rights\" above the terminal, cautioning that \"\u00a0'[t]aking' jurisprudence does not divide a single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated.\"  438 U.\u00a0S., at 130.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a similar way, in Tahoe-Sierra, the Court refused to \"effectively sever\" the 32 months during which petitioners' property was restricted by temporary moratoria on development \"and then ask whether that segment ha[d] been taken in its entirety.\"  535 U.\u00a0S., at 331.  That was because \"defining the property interest taken in terms of the very regulation being challenged is circular.\"  Ibid.  That approach would overstate the effect of regulation on property, turning \"every delay\" into a \"total ban.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second concept about which the Court has expressed caution is the view that property rights under the Takings Clause should be coextensive with those under state law.  Although property interests have their foundations in state law, the Palazzolo Court reversed a state- court decision that rejected a takings challenge to regulations that predated the landowner's acquisition of title.  533 U.\u00a0S., at 626-627.  The Court explained that States do not have the unfettered authority to \"shape and define property rights and reasonable investment-backed expectations,\" leaving landowners without recourse against unreasonable regulations.  Id., at 626.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the same measure, defining the parcel by reference to state law could defeat a challenge even to a state enactment that alters permitted uses of property in ways inconsistent with reasonable investment-backed expectations.  For example, a State might enact a law that consolidates nonadjacent property owned by a single person or entity in different parts of the State and then imposes development limits on the aggregate set.  If a court defined the parcel according to the state law requiring consolidation, this improperly would fortify the state law against a takings claim, because the court would look to the retained value in the property as a whole rather than considering whether individual holdings had lost all value.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the foregoing discussion makes clear, no single consideration can supply the exclusive test for determining the denominator.  Instead, courts must consider a number of factors.  These include the treatment of the land under state and local law; the physical characteristics of the land; and the prospective value of the regulated land.  The endeavor should determine whether reasonable expectations about property ownership would lead a landowner to anticipate that his holdings would be treated as one parcel, or, instead, as separate tracts.  The inquiry is objective, and the reasonable expectations at issue derive from background customs and the whole of our legal tradition.  Cf. Lucas, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 1035 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\"The expectations protected by the Constitution are based on objective rules and customs that can be understood as reasonable by all parties involved\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, courts should give substantial weight to the treatment of the land, in particular how it is bounded or divided, under state and local law.  The reasonable expectations of an acquirer of land must acknowledge legitimate restrictions affecting his or her subsequent use and dispensation of the property.  See Ballard v. Hunter, 204 U.\u00a0S. 241, 262 (1907) (\"Of what concerns or may concern their real estate men usually keep informed, and on that probability the law may frame its proceedings\").  A valid takings claim will not evaporate just because a purchaser took title after the law was enacted.  See Palazzolo, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 627 (some \"enactments are unreasonable and do not become less so through passage of time or title\").  A reasonable restriction that predates a landowner's acquisition, however, can be one of the objective factors that most landowners would reasonably consider in forming fair expectations about their property.  See ibid. (\"[A] prospective enactment, such as a new zoning ordinance, can limit the value of land without effecting a taking because it can be understood as reasonable by all concerned\").  In a similar manner, a use restriction which is triggered only after, or because of, a change in ownership should also guide a court's assessment of reasonable private expectations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, courts must look to the physical characteristics of the landowner's property.  These include the physical relationship of any distinguishable tracts, the parcel's topography, and the surrounding human and ecological environment.  In particular, it may be relevant that the property is located in an area that is subject to, or likely to become subject to, environmental or other regulation.  Cf. Lucas, supra, at 1035 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\"Coastal property may present such unique concerns for a fragile land system that the State can go further in regulating its development and use than the common law of nuisance might otherwise permit\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, courts should assess the value of the property under the challenged regulation, with special attention to the effect of burdened land on the value of other holdings.  Though a use restriction may decrease the market value of the property, the effect may be tempered if the regulated land adds value to the remaining property, such as by increasing privacy, expanding recreational space, or preserving surrounding natural beauty.  A law that limits use of a landowner's small lot in one part of the city by reason of the landowner's nonadjacent holdings elsewhere may decrease the market value of the small lot in an unmitigated fashion.  The absence of a special relationship between the holdings may counsel against consideration of all the holdings as a single parcel, making the restrictive law susceptible to a takings challenge.  On the other hand, if the landowner's other property is adjacent to the small lot, the market value of the properties may well increase if their combination enables the expansion of a structure, or if development restraints for one part of the parcel protect the unobstructed skyline views of another part.  That, in turn, may counsel in favor of treatment as a single parcel and may reveal the weakness of a regulatory takings challenge to the law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0State and federal courts have considerable experience in adjudicating regulatory takings claims that depart from these examples in various ways.  The Court anticipates that in applying the test above they will continue to exercise care in this complex area.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State of Wisconsin and petitioners each ask this Court to adopt a formalistic rule to guide the parcel inquiry.  Neither proposal suffices to capture the central legal and factual principles that inform reasonable expectations about property interests.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wisconsin would tie the definition of the parcel to state law, considering the two lots here as a single whole due to their merger under the challenged regulations.  That approach, as already noted, simply assumes the answer to the question: May the State define the relevant parcel in a way that permits it to escape its responsibility to justify regulation in light of legitimate property expectations?  It is, of course, unquestionable that the law must recognize those legitimate expectations in order to give proper weight to the rights of owners and the right of the State to pass reasonable laws and regulations.  See Palazzolo, supra, at 627.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Wisconsin bases its position on a footnote in Lucas, which suggests the answer to the denominator question \"may lie in how the owner's reasonable expectations have been shaped by the State's law of property--i.e., whether and to what degree the State's law has accorded legal recognition and protection to the particular interest in land with respect to which the takings claimant alleges a diminution in (or elimination of) value.\"  505 U.\u00a0S., at 1017, n.\u00a07.  As an initial matter, Lucas referenced the parcel problem only in dicta, unnecessary to the announcement or application of the rule it established.  See ibid. (\"[W]e avoid th[e] difficulty\" of determining the relevant parcel \"in the present case\").  In any event, the test the Court adopts today is consistent with the respect for state law described in Lucas.  The test considers state law but in addition weighs whether the state enactments at issue accord with other indicia of reasonable expectations about property.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners propose a different test that is also flawed.  They urge the Court to adopt a presumption that lot lines define the relevant parcel in every instance, making Lot E the necessary denominator.  Petitioners' argument, however, ignores the fact that lot lines are themselves creatures of state law, which can be overridden by the State in the reasonable exercise of its power.  In effect, petitioners ask this Court to credit the aspect of state law that favors their preferred result (lot lines) and ignore that which does not (merger provision).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This approach contravenes the Court's case law, which recognizes that reasonable land-use regulations do not work a taking.  See Palazzolo, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 627; Mahon, 260 U.\u00a0S., at 413.  Among other cases, Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.\u00a0S. 255 (1980), demonstrates the validity of this proposition because it upheld zoning regulations as a legitimate exercise of the government's police power.  Of course, the Court's later opinion in Lingle v. Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. recognized that the test articulated in Agins--that regulation effects a taking if it \"\u00a0'does not substantially advance legitimate state interests'\u00a0\"--was improper because it invited courts to engage in heightened review of the effectiveness of government regulation.  544 U.\u00a0S. 528, 540 (2005) (quoting Agins, supra, at 260).  Lingle made clear, however, that the holding of Agins survived, even if its test was \"imprecis[e].\"  See 544 U.\u00a0S., at 545-546, 548.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The merger provision here is likewise a legitimate exercise of government power, as reflected by its consistency with a long history of state and local merger regulations that originated nearly a century ago.  See Brief for National Association of Counties et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 5-10.  Merger provisions often form part of a regulatory scheme that establishes a minimum lot size in order to preserve open space while still allowing orderly development.  See E. McQuillin, Law of Municipal Corporations \u00a725:24 (3d ed. 2010); see also Agins, supra, at 262 (challenged \"zoning ordinances benefit[ed] the appellants as well as the public by serving the city's interest in assuring careful and orderly development of residential property with provision for open-space areas\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When States or localities first set a minimum lot size, there often are existing lots that do not meet the new requirements, and so local governments will strive to reduce substandard lots in a gradual manner.  The regulations here represent a classic way of doing this: by implementing a merger provision, which combines contiguous substandard lots under common ownership, alongside a grandfather clause, which preserves adjacent substandard lots that are in separate ownership.  Also, as here, the harshness of a merger provision may be ameliorated by the availability of a variance from the local zoning authority for landowners in special circumstances.  See 3 E. Ziegler, Rathkopf's Law of Zoning and Planning \u00a749:13 (39th ed. 2017).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners' insistence that lot lines define the relevant parcel ignores the well-settled reliance on the merger provision as a common means of balancing the legitimate goals of regulation with the reasonable expectations of landowners.  Petitioners' rule would frustrate municipalities' ability to implement minimum lot size regulations by casting doubt on the many merger provisions that exist nationwide today.  See Brief for National Association of Counties et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 12-31 (listing over 100 examples of merger provisions).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners' reliance on lot lines also is problematic for another reason.  Lot lines have varying degrees of formality across the States, so it is difficult to make them a standard measure of the reasonable expectations of property owners.  Indeed, in some jurisdictions, lot lines may be subject to informal adjustment by property owners, with minimal government oversight.  See Brief for California et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 17; 1 J. Kushner, Subdivision Law and Growth Management \u00a75:8 (2d ed. 2017) (lot line adjustments that create no new parcels are often exempt from subdivision review); see, e.g., Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \u00a766412(d) (West 2016) (permitting adjustment of lot lines subject to limited conditions for government approval).  The ease of modifying lot lines also creates the risk of gamesmanship by landowners, who might seek to alter the lines in anticipation of regulation that seems likely to affect only part of their property.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the appropriate multifactor standard, it follows that for purposes of determining whether a regulatory taking has occurred here, petitioners' property should be evaluated as a single parcel consisting of Lots E and F together.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the treatment of the property under state and local law indicates petitioners' property should be treated as one when considering the effects of the restrictions.  As the Wisconsin courts held, the state and local regulations merged Lots E and F.  E.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. A-3, \u00b66 (\"The 1995 transfer of Lot E brought the lots under common ownership and resulted in a merger of the two lots under [the local ordinance]\").  The decision to adopt the merger provision at issue here was for a specific and legitimate purpose, consistent with the widespread understanding that lot lines are not dominant or controlling in every case.  See supra, at ___.  Petitioners' land was subject to this regulatory burden, moreover, only because of voluntary conduct in bringing the lots under common ownership after the regulations were enacted.  As a result, the valid merger of the lots under state law informs the reasonable expectation they will be treated as a single property.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the physical characteristics of the property support its treatment as a unified parcel.  The lots are contiguous along their longest edge.  Their rough terrain and narrow shape make it reasonable to expect their range of potential uses might be limited.  Cf. App. to Pet. for Cert. A-5, \u00b68 (\"[Petitioners] asserted Lot E could not be put to alternative uses like agriculture or commerce due to its size, location and steep terrain\").  The land's location along the river is also significant.  Petitioners could have anticipated public regulation might affect their enjoyment of their property, as the Lower St. Croix was a regulated area under federal, state, and local law long before petitioners possessed the land.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, the prospective value that Lot E brings to Lot F supports considering the two as one parcel for purposes of determining if there is a regulatory taking.  Petitioners are prohibited from selling Lots E and F separately or from building separate residential structures on each.  Yet this restriction is mitigated by the benefits of using the property as an integrated whole, allowing increased privacy and recreational space, plus the optimal location of any improvements.  See Case No. 12-CV-258, App. to Pet. for Cert. B-9 (\"They have an elevated level of privacy because they do not have close neighbors and are able to swim and play volleyball at the property\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The special relationship of the lots is further shown by their combined valuation.  Were Lot E separately saleable but still subject to the development restriction, petitioners' appraiser would value the property at only $40,000.  We express no opinion on the validity of this figure.  We also note the number is not particularly helpful for understanding petitioners' retained value in the properties because Lot E, under the regulations, cannot be sold without Lot F.  The point that is useful for these purposes is that the combined lots are valued at $698,300, which is far greater than the summed value of the separate regulated lots (Lot F with its cabin at $373,000, according to respondents' appraiser, and Lot E as an undevelopable plot at $40,000, according to petitioners' appraiser).  The value added by the lots' combination shows their complementarity and supports their treatment as one parcel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State Court of Appeals was correct in analyzing petitioners' property as a single unit.  Petitioners allege that in doing so, the state court applied a categorical rule that all contiguous, commonly owned holdings must be combined for Takings Clause analysis.  See Brief for Petitioners i (\"[D]oes the 'parcel as a whole' concept .\u00a0.\u00a0. establish a rule that two legally distinct, but commonly owned contiguous parcels, must be combined for takings analysis purposes\").  This does not appear to be the case, however, for the precedent relied on by the Court of Appeals addressed multiple factors before treating contiguous properties as one parcel.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A-9-A-11, \u00b6\u00b617-19 (citing Zealy v. Waukesha, 201 Wis. 2d 365, 548 N.\u00a0W. 2d 528); see id., at 378, 548 N.\u00a0W. 2d, at 533 (considering the property as a whole because it was \"part of a single purchase\" and all 10.4 acres were undeveloped).  The judgment below, furthermore, may be affirmed on any ground permitted by the law and record.  See Thigpen v. Roberts, 468 U.\u00a0S. 27, 30 (1984).  To the extent the state court treated the two lots as one parcel based on a bright-line rule, nothing in this opinion approves that methodology, as distinct from the result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Considering petitioners' property as a whole, the state court was correct to conclude that petitioners cannot establish a compensable taking in these circumstances.  Petitioners have not suffered a taking under Lucas, as they have not been deprived of all economically beneficial use of their property.  See 505 U.\u00a0S., at 1019.  They can use the property for residential purposes, including an enhanced, larger residential improvement.  See Palazzolo, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 631 (\"A regulation permitting a landowner to build a substantial residence .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not leave the property 'economically idle'\u00a0\").  The property has not lost all economic value, as its value has decreased by less than 10 percent.  See Lucas, supra, at 1019, n.\u00a08 (suggesting that even a landowner with 95 percent loss may not recover).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners furthermore have not suffered a taking under the more general test of Penn Central.  See 438 U.\u00a0S., at 124. The expert appraisal relied upon by the state courts refutes any claim that the economic impact of the regulation is severe.  Petitioners cannot claim that they reasonably expected to sell or develop their lots separately given the regulations which predated their acquisition of both lots.  Finally, the governmental action was a reasonable land-use regulation, enacted as part of a coordinated federal, state, and local effort to preserve the river and surrounding land.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like the ultimate question whether a regulation has gone too far, the question of the proper parcel in regulatory takings cases cannot be solved by any simple test.  See Arkansas Game and Fish Comm'n v. United States, 568 U.\u00a0S. 23, 31 (2012).  Courts must instead define the parcel in a manner that reflects reasonable expectations about the property.  Courts must strive for consistency with the central purpose of the Takings Clause: to \"bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\"  Armstrong, 364 U.\u00a0S., at 49.  Treating the lot in question as a single parcel is legitimate for purposes of this takings inquiry, and this supports the conclusion that no regulatory taking occurred here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Wisconsin Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case. \n\nRoberts, C. J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-214\nJOSEPH P. MURR, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. WISCONSIN, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of wisconsin, district iii\n[June 23, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Thomas and Justice Alito join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Murr family owns two adjacent lots along the Lower St. Croix River.  Under a local regulation, those two properties may not be \"sold or developed as separate lots\" because neither contains a sufficiently large area of buildable land.  Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7NR\u00a0118.08(4)(a)(2) (2017).  The Court today holds that the regulation does not effect a taking that requires just compensation.  This bottom-line conclusion does not trouble me; the majority presents a fair case that the Murrs can still make good use of both lots, and that the ordinance is a commonplace tool to preserve scenic areas, such as the Lower St. Croix River, for the benefit of landowners and the public alike.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where the majority goes astray, however, is in concluding that the definition of the \"private property\" at issue in a case such as this turns on an elaborate test looking not only to state and local law, but also to (1) \"the physical characteristics of the land,\" (2) \"the prospective value of the regulated land,\" (3) the \"reasonable expectations\" of the owner, and (4)\u00a0\"background customs and the whole of our legal tradition.\"  Ante, at 11-12.  Our decisions have, time and again, declared that the Takings Clause protects private property rights as state law creates and defines them.  By securing such established property rights, the Takings Clause protects individuals from being forced to bear the full weight of actions that should be borne by the public at large.  The majority's new, malleable definition of \"private property\"--adopted solely \"for purposes of th[e] takings inquiry,\" ante, at 20--undermines that protection.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would stick with our traditional approach: State law defines the boundaries of distinct parcels of land, and those boundaries should determine the \"private property\" at issue in regulatory takings cases.  Whether a regulation effects a taking of that property is a separate question, one in which common ownership of adjacent property may be taken into account.  Because the majority departs from these settled principles, I respectfully dissent.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Takings Clause places a condition on the government's power to interfere with property rights, instructing that \"private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\"  Textually and logically, this Clause raises three basic questions that individuals, governments, and judges must consider when anticipating or deciding whether the government will have to provide reimbursement for its actions.  The first is what \"private property\" the government's planned course of conduct will affect.  The second, whether that property has been \"taken\" for \"public use.\"  And if \"private property\" has been \"taken,\" the last item of business is to calculate the \"just compensation\" the owner is due.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Step one--identifying the property interest at stake--requires looking outside the Constitution.  The word \"property\" in the Takings Clause means \"the group of rights inhering in [a] citizen's relation to [a] .\u00a0.\u00a0. thing, as the right to possess, use and dispose of it.\"  United States v. General Motors Corp., 323 U.\u00a0S. 373, 378 (1945).  The Clause does not, however, provide the definition of those rights in any particular case.  Instead, \"property interests .\u00a0.\u00a0. are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\"  Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 U.\u00a0S. 986, 1001 (1984) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).  By protecting these established rights, the Takings Clause stands as a buffer between property owners and governments, which might naturally look to put private property to work for the public at large.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When government action interferes with property rights, the next question becomes whether that interference amounts to a \"taking.\"  \"The paradigmatic taking .\u00a0.\u00a0. is a direct government appropriation or physical invasion of private property.\"  Lingle v. Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc., 544 U.\u00a0S. 528, 537 (2005).  These types of actions give rise to \"per se taking[s]\" because they are \"perhaps the most serious form[s] of invasion of an owner's property interests, depriving the owner of the rights to possess, use and dispose of the property.\"  Horne v. Department of Agriculture, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But not all takings are so direct: Governments can infringe private property interests for public use not only through appropriations, but through regulations as well.  If compensation were required for one but not the other, \"the natural tendency of human nature\" would be to extend regulations \"until at last private property disappears.\"  Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.\u00a0S. 393, 415 (1922).  Our regulatory takings decisions, then, have recognized that, \"while property may be regulated to a certain extent, if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\"  Ibid.  This rule strikes a balance between property owners' rights and the government's authority to advance the common good.  Owners can rest assured that they will be compensated for particularly onerous regulatory actions, while governments maintain the freedom to adjust the benefits and burdens of property ownership without incurring crippling costs from each alteration.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Depending, of course, on how far is \"too far.\"  We have said often enough that the answer to this question generally resists per se rules and rigid formulas.  There are, however, a few fixed principles: The inquiry \"must be conducted with respect to specific property.\"  Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.\u00a0S. 470, 495 (1987) (internal quotation marks omitted).  And if a \"regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land,\" the interference categorically amounts to a taking.  Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.\u00a0S. 1003, 1015 (1992).  For the vast array of regulations that lack such an extreme effect, a flexible approach is more fitting.  The factors to consider are wide ranging, and include the economic impact of the regulation, the owner's investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action.  The ultimate question is whether the government's imposition on a property has forced the owner \"to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\"  Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.\u00a0S. 104, 123 (1978) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, if a taking has occurred, the remaining matter is tabulating the \"just compensation\" to which the property owner is entitled.  \"[J]ust compensation normally is to be measured by the market value of the property at the time of the taking.\"  Horne, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because a regulation amounts to a taking if it completely destroys a property's productive use, there is an incentive for owners to define the relevant \"private property\" narrowly.  This incentive threatens the careful balance between property rights and government authority that our regulatory takings doctrine strikes: Put in terms of the familiar \"bundle\" analogy, each \"strand\" in the bundle of rights that comes along with owning real property is a distinct property interest.  If owners could define the relevant \"private property\" at issue as the specific \"strand\" that the challenged regulation affects, they could convert nearly all regulations into per\u00a0se takings.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And so we do not allow it.  In Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, we held that property owners may not \"establish a 'taking' simply by showing that they have been denied the ability to exploit a property interest.\"  438 U.\u00a0S., at 130.  In that case, the owner of Grand Central Terminal in New York City argued that a restriction on the owner's ability to add an office building atop the station amounted to a taking of its air rights.  We rejected that narrow definition of the \"property\" at issue, concluding that the correct unit of analysis was the owner's \"rights in the parcel as a whole.\"  Id., at 130-131.  \"[W]here an owner possesses a full 'bundle' of property rights, the destruction of one strand of the bundle is not a taking, because the aggregate must be viewed in its entirety.\"  Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.\u00a0S. 51, 65-66 (1979); see Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, 535 U.\u00a0S. 302, 327 (2002).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question presented in today's case concerns the \"parcel as a whole\" language from Penn Central.  This enigmatic phrase has created confusion about how to identify the relevant property in a regulatory takings case when the claimant owns more than one plot of land.  Should the impact of the regulation be evaluated with respect to each individual plot, or with respect to adjacent plots grouped together as one unit?  According to the majority, a court should answer this question by considering a number of facts about the land and the regulation at issue.  The end result turns on whether those factors \"would lead a landowner to anticipate that his holdings would be treated as one parcel, or, instead, as separate tracts.\"  Ante, at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think the answer is far more straightforward: State laws define the boundaries of distinct units of land, and those boundaries should, in all but the most exceptional circumstances, determine the parcel at issue.  Even in regulatory takings cases, the first step of the Takings Clause analysis is still to identify the relevant \"private property.\"  States create property rights with respect to particular \"things.\"  And in the context of real property, those \"things\" are horizontally bounded plots of land.  Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 331 (\"An interest in real property is defined by the metes and bounds that describe its geographic dimensions\").  States may define those plots differently--some using metes and bounds, others using government surveys, recorded plats, or subdivision maps.  See 11 D. Thomas, Thompson on Real Property \u00a794.07(s) (2d ed. 2002); Powell on Real Property \u00a781A.05(2)(a) (M. Wolf ed. 2016).  But the definition of property draws the basic line between, as P.\u00a0G. Wodehouse would put it, meum and tuum.  The question of who owns what is pretty important: The rules must provide a readily ascertainable definition of the land to which a particular bundle of rights attaches that does not vary depending upon the purpose at issue.  See, e.g., Wis. Stat. \u00a7236.28 (2016) (\"[T]he lots in [a] plat shall be described by the name of the plat and the lot and block .\u00a0.\u00a0. for all purposes, including those of assessment, taxation, devise, descent and conveyance\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following state property lines is also entirely consistent with Penn Central.  Requiring consideration of the \"parcel as a whole\" is a response to the risk that owners will strategically pluck one strand from their bundle of property rights--such as the air rights at issue in Penn Central--and claim a complete taking based on that strand alone.  That risk of strategic unbundling is not present when a legally distinct parcel is the basis of the regulatory takings claim.  State law defines all of the interests that come along with owning a particular parcel, and both property owners and the government must take those rights as they find them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority envisions that relying on state law will create other opportunities for \"gamesmanship\" by landowners and States: The former, it contends, \"might seek to alter [lot] lines in anticipation of regulation,\" while the latter might pass a law that \"consolidates .\u00a0.\u00a0. property\" to avoid a successful takings claim.  Ante, at 11, 17.  But such obvious attempts to alter the legal landscape in anticipation of a lawsuit are unlikely and not particularly difficult to detect and disarm.  We rejected the strategic splitting of property rights in Penn Central, and courts could do the same if faced with an attempt to create a takings-specific definition of \"private property.\"  Cf. Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.\u00a0S. 156, 167 (1998) (\"[A] State may not sidestep the Takings Clause by disavowing traditional property interests long recognized under state law\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Once the relevant property is identified, the real work begins.  To decide whether the regulation at issue amounts to a \"taking,\" courts should focus on the effect of the regulation on the \"private property\" at issue.  Adjacent land under common ownership may be relevant to that inquiry.  The owner's possession of such a nearby lot could, for instance, shed light on how the owner reasonably expected to use the parcel at issue before the regulation.  If the court concludes that the government's action amounts to a taking, principles of \"just compensation\" may also allow the owner to recover damages \"with regard to a separate parcel\" that is contiguous and used in conjunction with the parcel at issue.  4A L. Smith & M. Hansen, Nichols' Law of Eminent Domain, ch. 14B, \u00a714B.02 (rev. 3d ed. 2010).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the \"parcel as a whole\" requirement prevents a property owner from identifying a single \"strand\" in his bundle of property rights and claiming that interest has been taken.  Allowing that strategic approach to defining \"private property\" would undermine the balance struck by our regulatory takings cases.  Instead, state law creates distinct parcels of land and defines the rights that come along with owning those parcels.  Those established bundles of rights should define the \"private property\" in regulatory takings cases.  While ownership of contiguous properties may bear on whether a person's plot has been \"taken,\" Penn Central provides no basis for disregarding state property lines when identifying the \"parcel as a whole.\"\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The lesson that the majority draws from Penn Central is that defining \"the proper parcel in regulatory takings cases cannot be solved by any simple test.\"  Ante, at 20.  Following through on that stand against simplicity, the majority lists a complex set of factors theoretically designed to reveal whether a hypothetical landowner might expect that his property \"would be treated as one parcel, or, instead, as separate tracts.\"  Ante, at 11.  Those factors, says the majority, show that Lots E and F of the Murrs' property constitute a single parcel and that the local ordinance requiring the Murrs to develop and sell those lots as a pair does not constitute a taking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In deciding that Lots E and F are a single parcel, the majority focuses on the importance of the ordinance at issue and the extent to which the Murrs may have been especially surprised, or unduly harmed, by the application of that ordinance to their property.  But these issues should be considered when deciding if a regulation constitutes a \"taking.\"  Cramming them into the definition of \"private property\" undermines the effectiveness of the Takings Clause as a check on the government's power to shift the cost of public life onto private individuals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem begins when the majority loses track of the basic structure of claims under the Takings Clause.  While it is true that we have referred to regulatory takings claims as involving \"essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries,\" we have conducted those wide-ranging investigations when assessing \"the question of what constitutes a 'taking'\u00a0\" under Penn Central.  Ruckelshaus, 467 U.\u00a0S., at 1004 (emphasis added); see Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 326 (\"[W]e have generally eschewed any set formula for determining how far is too far\" (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted)).  And even then, we reach that \"ad hoc\" Penn Central framework only after determining that the regulation did not deny all productive use of the parcel.  See Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 331.  Both of these inquiries presuppose that the relevant \"private property\" has already been identified.  See Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn., Inc., 452 U.\u00a0S. 264, 295 (1981) (explaining that \"[t]hese 'ad\u00a0hoc, factual inquiries' must be conducted with respect to specific property\").  There is a simple reason why the majority does not cite a single instance in which we have made that identification by relying on anything other than state property principles--we have never done so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In departing from state property principles, the majority authorizes governments to do precisely what we rejected in Penn Central: create a litigation-specific definition of \"property\" designed for a claim under the Takings Clause.  Whenever possible, governments in regulatory takings cases will ask courts to aggregate legally distinct properties into one \"parcel,\" solely for purposes of resisting a particular claim.  And under the majority's test, identifying the \"parcel as a whole\" in such cases will turn on the reasonableness of the regulation as applied to the claimant.  The result is that the government's regulatory interests will come into play not once, but twice--first when identifying the relevant parcel, and again when determining whether the regulation has placed too great a public burden on that property.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Regulatory takings, however--by their very nature--pit the common good against the interests of a few.  There is an inherent imbalance in that clash of interests.  The widespread benefits of a regulation will often appear far weightier than the isolated losses suffered by individuals.  And looking at the bigger picture, the overall societal good of an economic system grounded on private property will appear abstract when cast against a concrete regulatory problem.  In the face of this imbalance, the Takings Clause \"prevents the public from loading upon one individual more than his just share of the burdens of government,\" Monongahela Nav. Co. v. United States, 148 U.\u00a0S. 312, 325 (1893), by considering the effect of a regulation on specific property rights as they are established at state law.  But the majority's approach undermines that protection, defining property only after engaging in an ad hoc, case-specific consideration of individual and community interests.  The result is that the government's goals shape the playing field before the contest over whether the challenged regulation goes \"too far\" even gets underway.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suppose, for example, that a person buys two distinct plots of land--known as Lots A and B--from two different owners.  Lot A is landlocked, but the neighboring Lot B shares a border with a local beach.  It soon comes to light, however, that the beach is a nesting habitat for a species of turtle.  To protect this species, the state government passes a regulation preventing any development or recreation in areas abutting the beach--including Lot B.  If that lot became the subject of a regulatory takings claim, the purchaser would have a strong case for a per se taking: Even accounting for the owner's possession of the other property, Lot B had no remaining economic value or productive use.  But under the majority's approach, the government can argue that--based on all the circumstances and the nature of the regulation--Lots A and B should be considered one \"parcel.\"  If that argument succeeds, the owner's per se takings claim is gone, and he is left to roll the dice under the Penn Central balancing framework, where the court will, for a second time, throw the reasonableness of the government's regulatory action into the balance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority assures that, under its test, \"[d]efining the property .\u00a0.\u00a0. should not necessarily preordain the outcome in every case.\"  Ante, at 10 (emphasis added).  The underscored language cheapens the assurance.  The framework laid out today provides little guidance for identifying whether \"expectations about property ownership would lead a landowner to anticipate that his holdings would be treated as one parcel, or, instead, as separate tracts.\"  Ante, at 12.  Instead, the majority's approach will lead to definitions of the \"parcel\" that have far more to do with the reasonableness of applying the challenged regulation to a particular landowner.  The result is clear double counting to tip the scales in favor of the government: Reasonable government regulation should have been anticipated by the landowner, so the relevant parcel is defined consistent with that regulation.  In deciding whether there is a taking under the second step of the analysis, the regulation will seem eminently reasonable given its impact on the pre-packaged parcel.  Not, as the Court assures us, \"necessarily\" in \"every\" case, but surely in most.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, given its focus on the particular challenged regulation, the majority's approach must mean that two lots might be a single \"parcel\" for one takings claim, but separate \"parcels\" for another.  See ante, at 13.  This is just another opportunity to gerrymander the definition of \"private property\" to defeat a takings claim.  The majority also emphasizes that courts trying to identify the relevant parcel \"must strive\" to ensure that \"some people alone [do not] bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\"  Ante, at 20 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But this refrain is the traditional touchstone for spotting a taking, not for defining private property.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Put simply, today's decision knocks the definition of \"private property\" loose from its foundation on stable state law rules and throws it into the maelstrom of multiple factors that come into play at the second step of the takings analysis.  The result: The majority's new framework compromises the Takings Clause as a barrier between individuals and the press of the public interest.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Staying with a state law approach to defining \"private property\" would make our job in this case fairly easy.  The Murr siblings acquired Lot F in 1994 and Lot E a year later.  Once the lots fell into common ownership, the challenged ordinance prevented them from being \"sold or developed as separate lots\" because neither contained a sufficiently large area of buildable land.  Wis. Admin. Code \u00a7NR\u00a0118.08(4)(a)(2).  The Murrs argued that the ordinance amounted to a taking of Lot E, but the State of Wisconsin and St. Croix County proposed that both lots together should count as the relevant \"parcel.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The trial court sided with the State and County, and the Wisconsin Court of Appeals affirmed.  Rather than considering whether Lots E and F are separate parcels under Wisconsin law, however, the Court of Appeals adopted a takings-specific approach to defining the relevant parcel.  See 2015 WI App 13, 359 Wis. 2d 675, 859 N.\u00a0W. 2d 628 (unpublished opinion), App. to Pet. for Cert. A-9, \u00b617 (framing the issue as \"whether contiguous property is analytically divisible for purposes of a regulatory takings claim\").  Relying on what it called a \"well-established rule\" for \"regulatory takings cases,\" the court explained \"that contiguous property under common ownership is considered as a whole regardless of the number of parcels contained therein.\"  Id., at A-11, \u00b620.  And because Lots E and F were side by side and owned by the Murrs, the case was straightforward: The two lots were one \"parcel\" for the regulatory takings analysis.  The court therefore evaluated the effect of the ordinance on the two lots considered together.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As I see it, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals was wrong to apply a takings-specific definition of the property at issue.  Instead, the court should have asked whether, under general state law principles, Lots E and F are legally distinct parcels of land.  I would therefore vacate the judgment below and remand for the court to identify the relevant property using ordinary principles of Wisconsin property law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After making that state law determination, the next step would be to determine whether the challenged ordinance amounts to a \"taking.\"  If Lot E is a legally distinct parcel under state law, the Court of Appeals would have to perform the takings analysis anew, but could still consider many of the issues the majority finds important.  The majority, for instance, notes that under the ordinance the Murrs can use Lot E as \"recreational space,\" as the \"location of any improvements,\" and as a valuable addition to Lot F.  Ante, at 18.  These facts could be relevant to whether the \"regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use\" of Lot E.  Lucas, 505 U.\u00a0S., at 1015.  Similarly, the majority touts the benefits of the ordinance and observes that the Murrs had little use for Lot E independent of Lot F and could have predicted that Lot E would be regulated.  Ante, at 18.  These facts speak to \"the economic impact of the regulation,\" interference with \"investment-backed expectations,\" and the \"character of the governmental action\"--all things we traditionally consider in the Penn Central analysis.  438 U.\u00a0S., at 124.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would be careful, however, to confine these considerations to the question whether the regulation constitutes a taking.  As Alexander Hamilton explained, \"the security of Property\" is one of the \"great object[s] of government.\"  1 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, p. 302 (M. Farrand ed. 1911).  The Takings Clause was adopted to ensure such security by protecting property rights as they exist under state law.  Deciding whether a regulation has gone so far as to constitute a \"taking\" of one of those property rights is, properly enough, a fact-intensive task that relies \"as much on the exercise of judgment as on the application of logic.\"  MacDonald, Sommer & Frates v. Yolo County, 477 U.\u00a0S. 340, 349 (1986) (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).  But basing the definition of \"property\" on a judgment call, too, allows the government's interests to warp the private rights that the Takings Clause is supposed to secure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-214\nJOSEPH P.

The Court, however, has never purported to ground those precedents in the Constitution as it was originally understood.  In Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.\u00a0S. 393, 415 (1922), the Court announced a \"general rule\" that \"if regulation goes too far it will be recognized as a taking.\"  But we have since observed that, prior to Mahon, \"it was generally thought that the Takings Clause reached only a 'direct appropriation' of property, Legal Tender Cases, 12 Wall. 457, 551 (1871), or the functional equivalent of a 'practical ouster of [the owner's] possession,' Transportation Co. v. Chicago, 99 U. S. 635, 642 (1879).\"  Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.\u00a0S. 1003, 1014 (1992).  In my view, it would be desirable for us to take a fresh look at our regulatory takings jurisprudence, to see whether it can be grounded in the original public meaning of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment or the Privileges or Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  See generally Rappaport, Originalism and Regulatory Takings: Why the Fifth Amendment May Not Protect Against Regulatory Takings, but the Fourteenth Amendment May, 45 San Diego L.\u00a0Rev. 729 (2008) (describing the debate among scholars over those questions).\n\n\n\n","57":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD v. SW GENERAL, INC., DBA SOUTHWEST AMBULANCE(2017)\nNo. 15-1251\nArgued: November 7, 2016Decided: March 21, 2017\n\n\nArticle II of the Constitution requires that the President obtain \"the Advice and Consent of the Senate\" before appointing \"Officers of the United States.\"  \u00a72, cl.\u00a02.  Given this provision, the responsibilities of an office requiring Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation (PAS office) may go unperformed if a vacancy arises and the President and Senate cannot promptly agree on a replacement.  Congress has accounted for this reality by giving the President limited authority to appoint acting officials to temporarily perform the functions of a vacant PAS office without first obtaining Senate approval.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The current version of that authorization is the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA).  Section 3345(a) of the FVRA permits three categories of Government officials to perform acting service in a vacant PAS office.  Subsection (a)(1) prescribes the general rule that, if a vacancy arises in a PAS office, the first assistant to that office \"shall perform\" the office's \"functions and duties temporarily in an acting capacity.\"  Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) provide that, \"notwithstanding paragraph (1),\" the President \"may direct\" a person already serving in another PAS office, or a senior employee in the relevant agency, to serve in an acting capacity instead.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3345 also makes certain individuals ineligible for acting service.  Subsection (b)(1) states: \"Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section\" if the President nominates him for the vacant PAS office and, during the 365-day period preceding the vacancy, the person \"did not serve in the position of first assistant\" to that office or \"served in [that] position . . . for less than 90 days.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or the Board) is a PAS office.  In June 2010, a vacancy arose in that office, and the President directed Lafe Solomon to serve as acting general counsel.  Solomon qualified for acting service under subsection (a)(3) of the FVRA, because he was a senior employee at the NLRB.  In January 2011, the President nominated Solomon to serve as the NLRB's general counsel on a permanent basis.  The Senate never took action on the nomination, and the President ultimately withdrew Solomon's name in favor of a new candidate, whom the Senate confirmed in October 2013.  Throughout this entire period Solomon served as the acting general counsel to the NLRB.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In January 2013, an NLRB Regional Director, exercising authority on Solomon's behalf, issued an unfair labor practices complaint against respondent SW General, Inc.  An Administrative Law Judge concluded that SW General had committed unfair labor practices, and the NLRB agreed.  SW General sought review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, arguing that the complaint was invalid because, under subsection (b)(1) of the FVRA, Solomon could not perform the duties of general counsel to the NLRB after having been nominated to fill that position.  The NLRB countered that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under subsection (a)(1), not to acting officers who, like Solomon, serve under (a)(2) or (a)(3).  The Court of Appeals vacated the Board's order.  It concluded that the prohibition on acting service by nominees contained in subsection (b)(1) applies to all acting officers, regardless of whether they serve pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3).  As a result, Solomon became ineligible to perform the duties of general counsel in an acting capacity once the President nominated him to fill that post.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0Subsection (b)(1) of the FVRA prevents a person who has been nominated to fill a vacant PAS office from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity.  The prohibition applies to anyone performing acting service under the FVRA.  It is not limited to first assistants performing acting service under subsection (a)(1).  Pp.\u00a08-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The text of the FVRA requires this conclusion.  Pp.\u00a08-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0Subsection (b)(1) applies to any \"person\" and prohibits service \"as an acting officer for an office under this section.\"  \"Person\" has an expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who performs acting duties under the FVRA.  See Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.\u00a0S. 308, 312.  And \"under this section\" clarifies that subsection (b)(1) applies to all of \u00a73345: The FVRA contains cross-references to specific subsections and paragraphs.  But subsection (b)(1) refers to \u00a73345, which contains all of the ways a person may become an acting officer.  The rest of the FVRA also uses the pairing of \"person\" and \"section\" to encompass anyone serving as an acting officer under the FVRA, and Congress could readily have used more specific language if it intended subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants acting under (a)(1).  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dependent clause at the beginning of subsection (b)(1)--\"[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\"--confirms the breadth of the prohibition on acting service by nominees.  In statutes, \"notwithstanding\" clauses show that one provision prevails over another in the event of a conflict.  Here, that means that subsection (b)(1) applies even when it conflicts with the default rule in (a)(1) that first assistants \"shall perform\" acting duties.  Pp.\u00a08-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2) The Board argues that, because the phrase \"notwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\" does not mention (a)(2) or (a)(3), Congress did not intend the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) to apply to people serving as acting officers under those provisions.  The Board relies on the \"interpretive canon, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, expressing one item of [an] associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned.\"  Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.\u00a0S. 73, 80 (internal quotation marks omitted). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This interpretive canon applies, however, only when \"circumstances support[\u00a0] a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded.\"  Id., at 81.  A \"notwithstanding\" clause does not naturally give rise to such an inference; it just shows which of two or more provisions prevails in the event of a conflict.  Singling out one conflict generally does not suggest that other, unaddressed conflicts should be resolved in the opposite manner.  Here, the conflict between (a)(1) and (b)(1) is unique: The former uses mandatory language--the first assistant \"shall perform\" acting duties--while the latter identifies who \"may not\" serve as an acting officer.  The \"notwithstanding\" clause clarifies that the mandatory language in subsection (a)(1) does not prevail over subsection (b)(1) in the event of a conflict.  Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) lack that mandatory language, so the natural inference is that Congress left these provisions out of the \"notwithstanding\" clause because they differ from subsection (a)(1), not to implicitly exempt them from the prohibition in subsection (b)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, subsection (b)(2) specifies that (b)(1) \"shall not apply\" to certain people who are \"serving as the first assistant.\"  If (b)(1) applied only to first assistants, stating that limitation would be superfluous.  Pp.\u00a010-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) Because the text is clear, the Board's arguments about legislative history, purpose, and post-enactment practice need not be considered.  In any event, its arguments are not compelling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The original draft of the FVRA contained a prohibition on nominees serving as acting officers, but explicitly limited that prohibition to first assistants.  The Board argues that, when Congress revised this original draft, it made changes to give the President more flexibility to appoint acting officers and did not intend to broaden the prohibition on nominees performing acting service.  The glitch in this argument is that Congress did change the prohibition on nominees performing acting service, revising it to clearly apply to all acting officers.  The fact that certain Senators stated that they wanted to give the President more flexibility to appoint acting officials does not mean that they got exactly what they wanted.  Nor does a statement by one of the sponsors of the FVRA--who said that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants--overcome the clear text, particularly given that the very next Senator to speak offered a contradictory account of the provision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board also argues that, since the FVRA was enacted, Congress has not objected when Presidents have nominated individuals who were serving as acting officers under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3), and that the Office of Legal Counsel and Government Accountability Office have issued guidance construing subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants.  Relying on NLRB v. Noel Canning, the Board contends that this \"historical practice\" is entitled to \"significant weight.\"  573 U.\u00a0S. ___.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[H]istorical practice\" is too grand a title for the Board's evidence.  The FVRA was not enacted until 1998, and the evidence the Board cites is not significant enough to warrant the conclusion that Congress's failure to speak up implies that it has acquiesced in the view that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants.  By contrast, the Court's decision in Noel Canning dealt with the President's constitutional authority under the Recess Appointments Clause; an issue that had attracted intense attention from Presidents, Attorneys General, and the Senate dating back to the beginning of the Republic.  Pp.\u00a014-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. Applying the FVRA to this case is straightforward.  Subsection (b)(1) prohibited Solomon from continuing his service as acting general counsel once the President nominated him to fill the position permanently.  The President could have appointed another person to serve as acting officer in Solomon's place, but did not do so.

SW GENERAL, INC., dba SOUTHWEST AMBULANCE\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit\n[March 21, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article II of the Constitution requires that the President obtain \"the Advice and Consent of the Senate\" before appointing \"Officers of the United States.\"  \u00a72, cl.\u00a02.  Given this provision, the responsibilities of an office requiring Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation--known as a \"PAS\" office--may go unperformed if a vacancy arises and the President and Senate cannot promptly agree on a replacement.  Congress has long accounted for this reality by authorizing the President to direct certain officials to temporarily carry out the duties of a vacant PAS office in an acting capacity, without Senate confirmation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA), 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73345 et\u00a0seq., is the latest version of that authorization.  Section 3345(a) of the FVRA authorizes three classes of Government officials to become acting officers.  The general rule is that the first assistant to a vacant office shall become the acting officer.  The President may override that default rule by directing either a person serving in a different PAS office or a senior employee within the relevant agency to become the acting officer instead.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FVRA, however, prohibits certain persons from serving as acting officers if the President has nominated them to fill the vacant office permanently.  The question presented is whether that limitation applies only to first assistants who have automatically assumed acting duties, or whether it also applies to PAS officers and senior employees serving as acting officers at the President's behest.  We hold that it applies to all three categories of acting officers.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Senate's advice and consent power is a critical \"structural safeguard[\u00a0] of the constitutional scheme.\"  Edmond v. United States, 520 U.\u00a0S. 651, 659 (1997).  The Framers envisioned it as \"an excellent check upon a spirit of favoritism in the President\" and a guard against \"the appointment of unfit characters .\u00a0.\u00a0. from family connection, from personal attachment, or from a view to popularity.\"  The Federalist No. 76, p. 457 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A. Hamilton).  The constitutional process of Presidential appointment and Senate confirmation, however, can take time: The President may not promptly settle on a nominee to fill an office; the Senate may be unable, or unwilling, to speedily confirm the nominee once submitted.  Yet neither may desire to see the duties of the vacant office go unperformed in the interim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since President Washington's first term, Congress has given the President limited authority to appoint acting officials to temporarily perform the functions of a vacant PAS office without first obtaining Senate approval.  The earliest statutes authorized the appointment of \"any person or persons\" to fill specific vacancies in the Departments of State, Treasury, and War.  Act of May 8, 1792, ch. 37, \u00a78, 1 Stat. 281.  Congress at first allowed acting officers to serve until the permanent officeholder could resume his duties or a successor was appointed, ibid., but soon imposed a six-month limit on acting service, Act of Feb. 13, 1795, ch. 21, 1 Stat. 415.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress revisited the issue in the 1860s, ultimately passing the Vacancies Act of 1868.  The Vacancies Act expanded the number of PAS offices that the President could fill with acting officers.  Act of July 23, 1868, ch. 227, 15 Stat. 168; see also Act of Feb. 20, 1863, ch. 45, 12 Stat. 656.  With that expansion came new constraints.  The authority to appoint \"any person or persons\" as an acting officer gave way to a default rule that the \"first or sole assistant .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall\" perform that function, with an exception allowing the President to instead fill the post with a person already serving in a PAS office.  15 Stat. 168.  And rather than six months of acting service, the Vacancies Act generally authorized only ten days.  Ibid.  That narrow window of acting service was later lengthened to 30 days.  Act of Feb. 6, 1891, ch. 113, 26 Stat. 733.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the 1970s and 1980s, interbranch conflict arose over the Vacancies Act.  The Department of Justice took the position that, in many instances, the head of an executive agency had independent authority apart from the Vacancies Act to temporarily fill vacant offices.  The Comptroller General disagreed, arguing that the Act was the exclusive authority for temporarily filling vacancies in executive agencies.  See M. Rosenberg, Congressional Research Service Report for Congress, The New Vacancies Act: Congress Acts to Protect the Senate's Confirmation Prerogative 2-4 (1998) (Rosenberg).  Congress then amended the Vacancies Act to clarify that it applies to such agencies, while at the same time lengthening the term of permissible acting service to 120 days, with a tolling period while a nomination is pending.  Id., at 3; see Presidential Transitions Effectiveness Act, \u00a77, 102 Stat. 988.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But tensions did not ease.  By 1998, approximately 20 percent of PAS offices in executive agencies were occupied by \"temporary designees, most of whom had served beyond the 120-day limitation period .\u00a0.\u00a0. without presidential submissions of nominations.\"  Rosenberg 1.  These acting officers filled high-level positions, sometimes in obvious contravention of the Senate's wishes.  One, for instance, was brought in from outside Government to serve as Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department, immediately after the Senate refused to confirm him for that very office.  Ibid.; see M. Rosenberg, Congressional Research Service, Validity of Designation of Bill Lann Lee as Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights 1-3 (1998).  Perceiving a threat to the Senate's advice and consent power, see Rosenberg 6, Congress acted again.  In 1998, it replaced the Vacancies Act with the FVRA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3345(a) of the FVRA permits three categories of Government officials to perform acting service in a vacant PAS office.  Subsection (a)(1) prescribes a general rule: If a person serving in a PAS office dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform his duties, the first assistant to that office \"shall perform\" the office's \"functions and duties .\u00a0.\u00a0. temporarily in an acting capacity.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The next two paragraphs of \u00a73345(a) identify alternatives.  Subsection (a)(2) provides that \"notwithstanding paragraph (1),\" the President \"may direct a person\" who already serves in a PAS office to \"perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity.\"  Subsection (a)(3) adds that \"notwithstanding paragraph (1),\" the President \"may direct\" a person to perform acting duties if the person served in a senior position in the relevant agency for at least 90 days in the 365-day period preceding the vacancy.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3345 also makes certain individuals ineligible for acting service.  Subsection (b)(1) states: \"Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section\" if the President nominates him for the vacant PAS office and, during the 365-day period preceding the vacancy, the individual \"did not serve in the position of first assistant\" to that office or \"served in [that] position .\u00a0.\u00a0. for less than 90 days.\"  Subsection (b)(2) creates an exception to this prohibition, providing that \"[p]aragraph (1) shall not apply to any person\" serving in a first assistant position that itself requires the Senate's advice and consent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other sections of the FVRA establish time limits on acting service and penalties for noncompliance.  In most cases, the statute permits acting service for \"210 days beginning on the date the vacancy occurs\"; tolls that time limit while a nomination is pending; and starts a new 210-day clock if the nomination is \"rejected, withdrawn, or returned.\"  \u00a7\u00a73346(a)-(b)(1).  Upon a second nomination, the time limit tolls once more, and an acting officer can serve an additional 210 days if the second nomination proves unsuccessful.  \u00a73346(b)(2).  The FVRA ensures compliance by providing that, in general, \"any function or duty of a vacant office\" performed by a person not properly serving under the statute \"shall have no force or effect.\"  \u00a73348(d).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board) is charged with administering the National Labor Relations Act.  By statute, its general counsel must be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.  29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7153(d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In June 2010, the NLRB's general counsel--who had been serving with Senate confirmation--resigned.  The President directed Lafe Solomon to serve temporarily as the NLRB's acting general counsel, citing the FVRA as the basis for the appointment.  See Memorandum from President Barack Obama to L. Solomon (June 18, 2010).  Solomon satisfied the requirements for acting service under subsection (a)(3) of the FVRA because he had spent the previous ten years in the senior position of Director of the NLRB's Office of Representation Appeals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The President had bigger plans for Solomon than acting service.  On January 5, 2011, he nominated Solomon to serve as the NLRB's general counsel on a permanent basis.  The Senate had other ideas.  That body did not act upon the nomination during the 112th Congress, so it was returned to the President when the legislative session expired.  159 Cong. Rec. S17 (Jan. 3, 2013).  The President resubmitted Solomon's name for consideration in the spring of 2013, id., at S3884 (May 23, 2013), but to no avail.  The President ultimately withdrew Solomon's nomination and put forward a new candidate, whom the Senate confirmed on October 29, 2013.  Id., at S7635.  Throughout this entire period, Solomon served as the NLRB's acting general counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Solomon's responsibilities included exercising \"final authority\" to issue complaints alleging unfair labor practices.  29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7153(d), 160(b).  In January 2013, an NLRB Regional Director, exercising authority on Solomon's behalf, issued a complaint alleging that respondent SW General, Inc.--a company that provides ambulance services--had improperly failed to pay certain bonuses to long-term employees.  An Administrative Law Judge concluded that SW General had committed unfair labor practices, and the NLRB agreed.  360 N.\u00a0L.\u00a0R.\u00a0B. 109 (2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SW General filed a petition for review in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  It argued that the unfair labor practices complaint was invalid because, under subsection (b)(1) of the FVRA, Solomon could not legally perform the duties of general counsel after having been nominated to fill that position.  The NLRB defended Solomon's actions.  It contended that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under subsection (a)(1), not to acting officers who, like Solomon, serve under (a)(2) or (a)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals granted SW General's petition for review and vacated the Board's order.  It reasoned that \"the text of subsection (b)(1) squarely supports\" the conclusion that the provision's restriction on nominees serving as acting officers \"applies to all acting officers, no matter whether they serve pursuant to subsection (a)(1), (a)(2) or (a)(3).\"  796 F.\u00a03d 67, 78 (CADC 2015).  As a result, Solomon became \"ineligible to serve as Acting General Counsel once the President nominated him to be General Counsel.\"  Id., at 72.2  We granted certiorari, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now affirm.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsection (b)(1) of the FVRA prevents a person who has been nominated for a vacant PAS office from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity.  In full, it states:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section, if--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A) during the 365-day period preceding the date of the death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve, such person--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) did not serve in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) served in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer for less than 90 days; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(B) the President submits a nomination of such person to the Senate for appointment to such office.\"\nSubsection (b)(2) adds that \"[p]aragraph (1) shall not apply\" to a person serving in a first assistant position that itself requires the advice and consent of the Senate.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We conclude that the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) applies to anyone performing acting service under the FVRA.  It is not, as the Board contends, limited to first assistants performing acting service under subsection (a)(1).  The text of the prohibition extends to any \"person\" who serves \"as an acting officer .\u00a0.\u00a0. under this section,\" not just to \"first assistants\" serving under subsection (a)(1).  The phrase \"[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\" does not limit the reach of (b)(1), but instead clarifies that the prohibition applies even when it conflicts with the default rule that first assistants shall perform acting duties.\nA\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our analysis of subsection (b)(1) begins with its text.  Subsection (b)(1) applies to any \"person\" and prohibits service \"as an acting officer for an office under this section.\"  The key words are \"person\" and \"section.\"  They clearly indicate that (b)(1) applies to all acting officers under \u00a73345, regardless of the means of appointment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start with \"person.\"  The word has a naturally expansive meaning that can encompass anyone who performs acting duties under the FVRA.  See Pfizer Inc. v. Government of India, 434 U.\u00a0S. 308, 312 (1978).  Important as they may be, first assistants are not the only \"person[s]\" of the bunch.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now add \"under this section.\"  The language clarifies that subsection (b)(1) applies to all persons serving under \u00a73345.  Congress often drafts statutes with hierarchical schemes--section, subsection, paragraph, and on down the line.  See Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc. v. Nigh, 543 U.\u00a0S. 50, 60-61 (2004); L. Filson, The Legislative Drafter's Desk Reference 222 (1992).  Congress used that structure in the FVRA and relied on it to make precise cross-references.  When Congress wanted to refer only to a particular subsection or paragraph, it said so.  See, e.g., \u00a73346(a)(2) (\"subsection (b)\"); \u00a73346(b)(2) (\"paragraph (1)\").  But in (b)(1) Congress referred to the entire section--\u00a73345--which subsumes all of the ways a person may become an acting officer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rest of the FVRA uses the pairing of \"person\" and \"section\" the same way.  Section 3346, for example, specifies how long \"the person serving as an acting officer as described under section 3345 may serve in the office.\"  (Emphasis added.)  And \u00a73348(d)(1) describes the consequences of noncompliance with the FVRA by referring to the actions \"taken by any person who is not acting under section 3345, 3346, or 3347.\"  (Emphasis added.)  No one disputes that both provisions apply to anyone serving as an acting officer under the FVRA, not just first assistants serving under subsection (a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Had Congress intended subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants acting under (a)(1), it could easily have chosen clearer language.  Replacing \"person\" with \"first assistant\" would have done the trick.  So too would replacing \"under this section\" with \"under subsection (a)(1).\"  \"The fact that [Congress] did not adopt [either] readily available and apparent alternative strongly supports\" the conclusion that subsection (b)(1) applies to any acting officer appointed under any provision within \u00a73345.  Knight v. Commissioner, 552 U.\u00a0S. 181, 188 (2008).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The dependent clause at the beginning of subsection (b)(1)--\"[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\"--confirms that the prohibition on acting service applies even when it conflicts with the default rule that the first assistant shall perform acting duties.  The ordinary meaning of \"notwithstanding\" is \"in spite of,\" or \"without prevention or obstruction from or by.\"  Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1545 (1986); Black's Law Dictionary 1091 (7th ed. 1999) (\"Despite; in spite of\").  In statutes, the word \"shows which provision prevails in the event of a clash.\"  A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 126-127 (2012).  Subsection (a)(1) sets the rule that first assistants \"shall perform\" the vacant office's \"functions and duties .\u00a0.\u00a0. in an acting capacity.\"  But the \"notwithstanding\" clause in subsection (b)(1) means that, even if a first assistant is serving as an acting officer under this statutory mandate, he must cease that service if the President nominates him to fill the vacant PAS office.  That subsection (b)(1) also applies to acting officers serving at the President's behest is already clear from the broad text of the independent clause--they are all \"person[s]\" serving \"under this section.\"\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board takes a different view of the phrase \"[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1).\"  It begins by noting that \u00a73345(a) uses three different subsections to \"create three separate paths for becoming an acting official.\"  Reply Brief 2.  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1), the Board continues, \"applies '[n]otwithstanding' only one of these subsections--'subsection (a)(1).'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  In the Board's view, singling out subsection (a)(1) carries a negative implication: that \"Congress did not intend Subsection (b)(1) to override the alternative mechanisms for acting service in Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3).\"  Id., at 3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We disagree.  The Board relies on the \"interpretive canon, expressio unius est exclusio alterius, 'expressing one item of [an] associated group or series excludes another left unmentioned.'\u00a0\"  Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Echazabal, 536 U.\u00a0S. 73, 80 (2002) (quoting United States v. Vonn, 535 U.\u00a0S. 55, 65 (2002)).  If a sign at the entrance to a zoo says \"come see the elephant, lion, hippo, and giraffe,\" and a temporary sign is added saying \"the giraffe is sick,\" you would reasonably assume that the others are in good health.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The force of any negative implication, however, depends on context.\"  Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9).  The expressio unius canon applies only when \"circumstances support[\u00a0] a sensible inference that the term left out must have been meant to be excluded.\"  Echazabal, 536 U.\u00a0S., at 81.  A \"notwithstanding\" clause does not naturally give rise to such an inference; it just shows which of two or more provisions prevails in the event of a conflict.  Such a clause confirms rather than constrains breadth.  Singling out one potential conflict might suggest that Congress thought the conflict was particularly difficult to resolve, or was quite likely to arise.  But doing so generally does not imply anything about other, unaddressed conflicts, much less that they should be resolved in the opposite manner.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suppose a radio station announces: \"We play your favorite hits from the '60s, '70s, and '80s.  Notwithstanding the fact that we play hits from the '60s, we do not play music by British bands.\"  You would not tune in expecting to hear the 1970s British band \"The Clash\" any more than the 1960s \"Beatles.\"  The station, after all, has announced that \"we do not play music by British bands.\"  The \"notwithstanding\" clause just establishes that this applies even to music from the '60s, when British bands were prominently featured on the charts.  No one, however, would think the station singled out the '60s to convey implicitly that its categorical statement \"we do not play music by British bands\" actually did not apply to the '70s and '80s.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drawing a negative inference from the \"notwithstanding\" clause in subsection (b)(1) is similarly inapt.  Without that clause, subsection (b)(1) plainly would apply to all persons serving as acting officers under \u00a73345(a).  Adding \"notwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\" makes sense because (a)(1) conflicts with (b)(1) in a unique manner.  The former is mandatory and self-executing: The first assistant \"shall perform\" acting duties.  The latter, by contrast, speaks to who \"may not\" be an acting officer.  So if a vacancy arises and the President nominates the first assistant to fill the position, (a)(1) says the first assistant \"shall perform\" the duties of that office in an acting capacity while the nomination is pending, and (b)(1) says he \"may not.\"  The \"notwithstanding\" clause clarifies that the language of (a)(1) does not prevail if that conflict occurs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compare the mandatory language of subsection (a)(1) to (a)(2) and (a)(3).  People appointed under those provisions are just as much acting officers as first assistants who assume the role.  But there is no freestanding directive that they perform acting duties; subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) just say that the President \"may direct\" them to do so.  The natural inference, then, is that Congress left these provisions out of the \"notwithstanding\" clause because they are different from subsection (a)(1), not to exempt from the broad prohibition in subsection (b)(1) those officers serving under (a)(2) and (a)(3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, \"notwithstanding\" is used the same way in other parts of \u00a73345.  Subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3) are each preceded by the phrase \"notwithstanding paragraph (1).\"  The phrase recognizes that subsection (a)(1) is unique, and resolves the potential conflict between the mandatory \"shall perform\" in that provision and the permissive \"may direct\" in (a)(2) and (a)(3).  But it implies nothing about other potential conflicts that may arise in the statutory scheme.  In subsection (b)(1), it works the same way: The \"notwithstanding\" clause simply shows that (b)(1) overrides (a)(1), and nothing more.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Step back from the Board's focus on \"notwithstanding\" and another problem appears: Its interpretation of subsection (b)(1) makes a mess of (b)(2).  Subsection (b)(2) specifies that (b)(1) \"shall not apply to any person\" if (A) that person \"is serving as the first assistant\"; (B) the first assistant position is itself a PAS office; and (C) \"the Senate has approved the appointment of such person\" to that office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board's interpretation makes the first requirement superfluous, a result we typically try to avoid.  Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.\u00a0S. 362, 404 (2000) (\"It is .\u00a0.\u00a0. a cardinal principle of statutory construction that we must give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  If subsection (b)(1) applied only to first assistants, there would be no need to state the requirement in (b)(2)(A) that \"such person is serving as the first assistant.\"  The Board proposes that Congress did so for clarity, but the same could be said of most superfluous language.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board and the dissent counter that applying the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) to anyone performing acting service under \u00a73345(a) has its own problem: Doing so would also require applying it to \u00a73345(c)(1), which \"would nullify\" that provision.  Reply Brief 9.  The dissent deems this \"no way to read a statute.\"  Post, at 6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We agree, and it is not the way we read it.  Under our reading, subsection (b)(1) has no effect on (c)(1).  Subsection (b)(1) addresses nominations generally, prohibiting any person who has been nominated to fill any vacant office from performing that office's duties in an acting capacity.  Subsection (c)(1) speaks to a specific nomination scenario: When a person is \"nominated by the President for reappointment for an additional term to the same office .\u00a0.\u00a0. without a break in service.\"  In this particular situation, the FVRA authorizes the nominee \"to continue to serve in that office.\"  \u00a73345(c).  \"[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general.\"  RadLAX Gateway Hotel, LLC v. Amalgamated Bank, 566 U.\u00a0S. 639, 645 (2012).  The general prohibition on acting service by nominees yields to the more specific authorization allowing officers up for reappointment to remain at their posts.  Applying subsection (b)(1) to \u00a73345(a) hardly compels a different result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text of subsection (b)(1) is clear: Subject to one narrow exception, it prohibits anyone who has been nominated to fill a vacant PAS office from performing the duties of that office in an acting capacity, regardless of whether the acting officer was appointed under subsection (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3).  It is not limited to first assistants who automatically assume acting duties under (a)(1).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board contends that legislative history, purpose, and post-enactment practice uniformly show that subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants.  The text is clear, so we need not consider this extra-textual evidence.  See State Farm Fire & Casualty Co. v. United States ex\u00a0rel. Rigsby, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016) (slip op., at 9).  In any event, the Board's evidence is not compelling.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board argues that subsection (b)(1) was designed to serve a specific purpose: preventing the President from having his nominee serve as an acting officer by making him first assistant after (or right before) a vacancy arises.  Brief for Petitioner 38.  The original draft of the FVRA authorized first assistants and PAS officers to perform acting service.  Subsection (b) of that draft provided that if a first assistant was nominated to fill the vacant office, he could not perform that office's duties in an acting capacity unless he had been the first assistant for at least 180 days before the vacancy.  Several Senators thought the FVRA too restrictive.  They asked to add senior agency officials to the list of potential acting officers and to shorten the 180-day length-of-service requirement in subsection (b).  Their requests, the Board says, were granted; the final version of the FVRA included subsection (a)(3) for senior employees and shortened the length-of-service requirement to 90 days.  There was no intent to extend the prohibition in subsection (b) beyond first assistants.  Id., at 45-46.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The glitch in this argument is of course the text of subsection (b)(1).  Congress did amend the statute to allow senior employees to become acting officers under subsection (a)(3).  The only substantive change that was requested in (b) was to reduce the length-of-service requirement.  Congress could have done that with a few tweaks to the original version of subsection (b).  Instead, Congress went further: It also removed language that expressly limited subsection (b) to first assistants.  And it added a provision--subsection (b)(2)--that makes sense only if (b)(1) applies to all acting officers.  In short, Congress took a provision that explicitly applied only to first assistants and turned it into one that applies to all acting officers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board protests that Congress would not have expanded the prohibition on nominees serving as acting officers after Senators asked to give the President more flexibility.  See Brief for Petitioner 45-46.  That certain Senators made specific demands, however, does not mean that they got exactly what they wanted.  Passing a law often requires compromise, where even the most firm public demands bend to competing interests.  See Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, Inc., 535 U.\u00a0S. 81, 93-94 (2002).  What Congress ultimately agrees on is the text that it enacts, not the preferences expressed by certain legislators.  See Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc., 523 U.\u00a0S. 75, 79 (1998) (\"[I]t is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Compromise is precisely what happened here: \"[A] period of intense negotiations\" took place after Senators demanded changes to the original draft of the FVRA, and the final bill was \"a compromise measure.\"  Rosenberg 9.  The legislation as passed did expand the pool of individuals the President could appoint as acting officers, by adding senior employees in subsection (a)(3).  But it also expanded the scope of the limitation on acting service in (b)(1), by dropping the language making (b)(1) applicable only to first assistants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Board contends that this compromise must not have happened because Senator Thompson, one of the sponsors of the FVRA, said that subsection (b)(1) \"applies only when the acting officer is the first assistant, and not when the acting officer is designated by the President pursuant to \u00a7\u00a73345(a)(2) or 3345(a)(3).\"  144 Cong. Rec. 27496 (1998).  But Senator Byrd--the very next speaker--offered a contradictory account: A nominee may not \"serve as an acting officer\" if \"he is not the first assistant\" or \"has been the first assistant for less than 90 .\u00a0.\u00a0. days, and has not been confirmed for the position.\"  Id., at 27498.  This is a good example of why floor statements by individual legislators rank among the least illuminating forms of legislative history.  See Milner v. Department of Navy, 562 U.\u00a0S. 562, 572 (2011) (\"Those of us who make use of legislative history believe that clear evidence of congressional intent may illuminate ambiguous text.  We will not take the opposite tack of allowing ambiguous legislative history to muddy clear statutory language.\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Board supports its interpretation with post-enactment practice.  It notes that the Office of Legal Counsel and the Government Accountability Office have issued guidance construing subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants.  And three Presidents have, without congressional objection, submitted the nominations of 112 individuals who were serving as acting officers under subsections (a)(2) and (a)(3).  The Board contends that this \"historical practice\" is entitled to \"significant weight\" because the FVRA \"concern[s] the allocation of power between two elected branches of Government.\"  Brief for Petitioner 49 (quoting NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2014) (slip op., at 6-7); internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[H]istorical practice\" is too grand a title for the Board's evidence.  The FVRA was not enacted until 1998, and the 112 nominations that the Board cites make up less than two percent of the thousands of nominations to positions in executive agencies that the Senate has considered in the years since its passage.  Even the guidance documents the Board cites paid the matter little attention; both made conclusory statements about subsection (b)(1), with no analysis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this context, Congress's failure to speak up does not fairly imply that it has acquiesced in the Board's interpretation.  See Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.\u00a0S. 168, 185, n.\u00a021 (1969); Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.\u00a0S. 275, 292 (2001).  The Senate may not have noticed that certain nominees were serving as acting officers in violation of the FVRA, or it may have chosen not to reject a qualified candidate just to make a point about compliance with the statute.  Either is at least as plausible as the theory that the Legislature's inaction reflects considered acceptance of the Executive's practice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our decision in Noel Canning--the chief opinion on which the Board relies--is a sharp contrast.  That case dealt with the President's constitutional authority under the Recess Appointments Clause, an issue that has attracted intense attention and written analysis from Presidents, Attorneys General, and the Senate.  573 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 22-32).  The voluminous historical record dated back to \"the beginning of the Republic,\" and included \"thousands of intra-session recess appointments.\"  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 8, 12).  That the chronicle of the Recess Appointments Clause weighed heavily in Noel Canning offers no support to the Board here.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying the FVRA to this case is straightforward.  Solomon was appointed as acting general counsel under subsection (a)(3).  Once the President submitted his nomination to fill that position in a permanent capacity, subsection (b)(1) prohibited him from continuing his acting service.  This does not mean that the duties of general counsel to the NLRB needed to go unperformed; the President could have appointed another person to serve as the acting officer in Solomon's place.  And he had a wide array of individuals to choose from: any one of the approximately 250 senior NLRB employees or the hundreds of individuals in PAS positions throughout the Government.  The President, however, did not do so, and Solomon's continued service violated the FVRA.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDIX\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3345 of the FVRA provides:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(a) If an officer of an Executive agency (including the Executive Office of the President, and other than the Government Accountability Office) whose appointment to office is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1) the first assistant to the office of such officer shall perform the functions and duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity subject to the time limitations of section 3346;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2) notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President (and only the President) may direct a person who serves in an office for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity subject to the time limitations of section 3346; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3) notwithstanding paragraph (1), the President (and only the President) may direct an officer or employee of such Executive agency to perform the functions and duties of the vacant office temporarily in an acting capacity, subject to the time limitations of section 3346, if--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A) during the 365-day period preceding the date of death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve of the applicable officer, the officer or employee served in a position in such agency for not less than 90 days; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(B) the rate of pay for the position described under subparagraph (A) is equal to or greater than the minimum rate of pay payable for a position at GS-15 of the General Schedule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section, if--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A) during the 365-day period preceding the date of the death, resignation, or beginning of inability to serve, such person--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(i) did not serve in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) served in the position of first assistant to the office of such officer for less than 90 days; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(B) the President submits a nomination of such person to the Senate for appointment to such office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any person if--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(A) such person is serving as the first assistant to the office of an officer described under subsection (a);\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(B) the office of such first assistant is an office for which appointment is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(C) the Senate has approved the appointment of such person to such office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a)(1), the President (and only the President) may direct an officer who is nominated by the President for reappointment for an office in an Executive department without a break in service, to continue to serve in that office subject to the time limitations in section 3346, until such time as the Senate has acted to confirm or reject the nomination, notwithstanding adjournment sine\u00a0die.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2) For purposes of this section and sections 3346, 3347, 3348, 3349, 3349a, and 3349d, the expiration of a term of office is an inability to perform the functions and duties of such office.\"\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1251\nNATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD, PETITIONER v.

The dissent's conclusion that the FVRA authorized the appointment in this case, however, implicates an important constitutional question that the Court's interpretation does not: Whether directing Lafe Solomon to serve as acting general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB or Board), without the advice and consent of the Senate, complied with the Constitution.  I write separately to explain my view that the Appointments Clause likely prohibited Solomon's appointment.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Appointments Clause prescribes the exclusive process by which the President may appoint \"officers of the United States.\"  United States v. Germaine, 99 U.\u00a0S. 508, 510 (1879); accord, Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.\u00a0S. 1, 132 (1976) (per curiam) (\"[A]ll officers of the United States are to be appointed in accordance with the Clause .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  No class or type of officer is excluded because of its special functions\").  It provides that the President\n\"shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\"  U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. II, \u00a72, cl.\u00a02.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[F]or purposes of appointment,\" the Clause divides all officers into two classes--\"inferior officers\" and noninferior officers, which we have long denominated \"principal\" officers.  Germaine, supra, at 509, 511.  Principal officers must be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.  See Edmond v. United States, 520 U.\u00a0S. 651, 660 (1997).  That process \"is also the default manner of appointment for inferior officers.\"  Ibid.  But the Clause provides a limited exception for the appointment of inferior officers: Congress may \"by Law\" authorize the President, the head of an executive department, or a court of law to appoint inferior officers without the advice and consent of the Senate.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FVRA governs the process by which the President may temporarily fill a vacancy in an Executive Branch office normally occupied by an officer of the United States.  As relevant in this case, when a vacancy arises, the President may \"direct\" an official to \"perform the functions and duties of the office temporarily.\"  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a73345(a)(2), (3).  That official may be an officer previously appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to any office, or certain high-ranking employees of the agency in which the vacancy arose.  Ibid.  The FVRA does not, however, require the President to seek the advice and consent of the Senate before directing the official to perform the functions of the vacant office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the President \"direct[s]\" someone to serve as an officer pursuant to the FVRA, he is \"appoint[ing]\" that person as an \"officer of the United States\" within the meaning of the Appointments Clause.  Around the time of the framing, the verb \"appoint\" meant \"[t]o establish anything by decree,\" 1 S. Johnson, A Dictionary of the English Language (def. 3) (6th ed. 1785); T. Sheridan, A Complete Dictionary of the English Language (To Appoint) (6th ed. 1796), or \"[t]o allot, assign, or designate,\" 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (def. 3) (1828).  When the President \"direct[s]\" a person to serve as an acting officer, he is \"assign[ing]\" or \"designat[ing]\" that person to serve as an officer.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FVRA authorizes the President to appoint both inferior and principal officers without first obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate.  Appointing inferior officers in this manner raises no constitutional problems.  That is because the Appointments Clause authorizes Congress to enact \"Law[s],\" like the FVRA, \"vest[ing] the Appointment of such inferior Officers .\u00a0.\u00a0. in the President alone.\"  Appointing principal officers under the FVRA, however, raises grave constitutional concerns because the Appointments Clause forbids the President to appoint principal officers without the advice and consent of the Senate.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because we interpret the FVRA to forbid Solomon's appointment in this case, we need not confront these concerns.  But the dissent's contrary interpretation necessarily raises the question whether that appointment complied with the requirements of the Appointments Clause.  That inquiry turns on two considerations: (1) whether the general counsel of the NLRB is an \"Officer of the United States\" within the meaning of the Appointments Clause and, if so, (2) whether he is a principal officer who can be appointed only by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.1  In my view, the general counsel plainly is an officer of the United States.  I also think he is likely a principal officer. \nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an initial matter, the NLRB's general counsel is an \"officer of the United States\" whose appointment is governed by the Appointments Clause.  \"Extensive evidence suggests\" that, at the time of the framing, this phrase was understood to encompass \"all federal officials with responsibility for an ongoing statutory duty.\"  Mascott, Who are \"Officers of the United States\"? 70 Stan. L.\u00a0Rev. (forthcoming 2017) (manuscript, at 74, online at https:\/\/ssrn.com\/abstract=2918952 (as last visited Mar. 17, 2017)); see also Officers of the United States Within the Meaning of the Appointments Clause, 31 Op. O.\u00a0L.\u00a0C. 73, 77 (2007) (an officer of the United States was originally understood to be an official who \"hold[s] a position with delegated sovereign authority\" and whose office was \"\u00a0'continuing,'\u00a0\" rather than \"\u00a0'incidental'\u00a0\" or \"ad\u00a0hoc\").  And this Court has previously held that an \"Officer of the United States\" is \"any appointee exercising significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States.\"  Buckley, 424 U.\u00a0S., at 126; see also Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.\u00a0S. 477, 539-540 (2010) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (collecting cases addressing who counts as an officer).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general counsel is an officer of the United States under both the probable original meaning of the Clause and this Court's precedents.  He is charged by statute with carrying out significant duties.  He \"exercise[s] general supervision over all attorneys employed by the Board .\u00a0.\u00a0. and over the officers and employees in the regional offices.\"  29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7153(d).  He has \"final authority, on behalf of the Board, in respect of the investigation of charges and issuances of complaints .\u00a0.\u00a0. and in respect of the prosecution of such complaints before the Board.\"  Ibid.  The general counsel is effectively the Nation's labor-law prosecutor and is therefore an officer of the United States.  See Edmond, 520 U.\u00a0S., at 666 (treating the general counsel of the Department of Transportation as an officer).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although a closer question, the general counsel also is likely a principal officer.  In Edmond, we explained that an \"\u00a0'inferior'\u00a0\" officer is one \"whose work is directed and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of the Senate.\"  Id., at 663.  That view is consistent with the original meaning of the term and with the practices of the early Congresses.  See id., at 663-664; Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.\u00a0S. 654, 719-721 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting); see also, e.g., Sheridan, supra, (Inferiour); 1 Johnson, supra, (Inferiour (def. 2)); 1 Webster, supra, (Inferior).2  By contrast, a principal officer is one who has no superior other than the President.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The general counsel of the NLRB appears to satisfy that definition.  Before 1947, the Board \"controlled not only the filing of complaints, but their prosecution and adjudication\" as well.  NLRB v. Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U.\u00a0S. 112, 117 (1987).  The Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, ch. 120, 61 Stat. 136, however, \"effected an important change\" in the NLRB's structure by \"separat[ing] the prosecuting from the adjudicating function, to place the former in the General Counsel, and to make him an independent official appointed by the President.\"  Lewis v. NLRB, 357 U.\u00a0S. 10, 16, n.\u00a010 (1958).  Congress thus separated the NLRB into \"two independent branches,\" Food & Commercial Workers, 484 U.\u00a0S., at 129, and made the general counsel \"independent of the Board's supervision and review,\" id., at 118; see also id., at 129 (Congress \"decided to place the General Counsel within the agency, but to make the office independent of the Board's authority\").  Moreover, the general counsel's prosecutorial decisions are unreviewable by either the Board or the Judiciary.  NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.\u00a0S. 132, 138 (1975); Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.\u00a0S. 171, 182 (1967).  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Board has power to define some of the general counsel's duties, see 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7153(d), and the general counsel represents the Board in certain judicial proceedings, see Higgins, Labor Czars--Commissars--Keeping Women in the Kitchen--The Purpose and Effects of the Administrative Changes Made by Taft-Hartley, 47 Cath. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 941, 967 (1998), the statute does not give the Board the power to remove him or otherwise generally to control his activities, see Edmond, supra, at 664 (\"The power to remove officers, we have recognized, is a powerful tool for control\"); see also Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.\u00a0S., at 510 (holding that executive officials were inferior officers in large part because they were subject to a superior's removal).  Because it appears that the general counsel answers to no officer inferior to the President, he is likely a principal officer.3  Accordingly, the President likely could not lawfully have appointed Solomon to serve in that role without first obtaining the advice and consent of the Senate.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recognize that the \"burdens on governmental processes\" that the Appointments Clause imposes may \"often seem clumsy, inefficient, even unworkable.\"  INS v. Chadha, 462 U.\u00a0S. 919, 959 (1983).  Granting the President unilateral power to fill vacancies in high offices might contribute to more efficient Government.  But the Appointments Clause is not an empty formality.  Although the Framers recognized the potential value of leaving the selection of officers to \"one man of discernment\" rather than to a fractious, multimember body, see The Federalist No. 76, p. 510 (J. Cooke ed., 1961), they also recognized the serious risk for abuse and corruption posed by permitting one person to fill every office in the Government, see id., at 513; 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71524, p. 376 (1833).  The Framers \"had lived under a form of government that permitted arbitrary governmental acts to go unchecked,\" Chadha, supra, at 959, and they knew that liberty could be preserved only by ensuring that the powers of Government would never be consolidated in one body, see The Federalist No. 51, p. 348.  They thus empowered the Senate to confirm principal officers on the view that \"the necessity of its co-operation in the business of appointments will be a considerable and salutary restraint upon the conduct of\" the President.  The Federalist No. 76, at 514; 3 Story, supra, \u00a71525, at 376-377.  We cannot cast aside the separation of powers and the Appointments Clause's important check on executive power for the sake of administrative convenience or efficiency.  See Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.\u00a0S. 714, 736 (1986). \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That the Senate voluntarily relinquished its advice-and-consent power in the FVRA does not make this end-run around the Appointments Clause constitutional.  The Clause, like all of the Constitution's structural provisions, \"is designed first and foremost not to look after the interests of the respective branches, but to protect individual liberty.\"  NLRB v. Noel Canning, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3) (internal quotation marks and bracket omitted).  It is therefore irrelevant that \"the encroached-upon branch approves the encroachment.\"  Free Enterprise Fund, supra, at 497 (internal quotation marks omitted).  \"Neither Congress nor the Executive can agree to waive\" the structural provisions of the Constitution any more than they could agree to disregard an enumerated right.  Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.\u00a0S. 868, 880 (1991).

SW GENERAL, INC., dba SOUTHWEST AMBULANCE\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit\n[March 21, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many high-level offices in the Executive Branch may be filled only by a person who has been nominated to the position by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  The Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998 (FVRA) cedes the Senate's confirmation authority, partially and on a temporary basis, to allow executive agencies to continue to function when one of those high-level offices becomes vacant.  It authorizes certain categories of officials to perform the duties of vacant offices on an acting basis.  One of its provisions pulls back that authorization when an official has been nominated to fill the vacant office on a permanent basis.  The scope of that provision is at issue here.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the Court that the provision applies to first assistants to a vacant office who serve as acting officials automatically, by operation of the FVRA.  I dis-agree with the Court's conclusion that the provision also applies to other officials who may serve as acting officials if the President directs them to serve in that capacity.  The Court gives the provision a broader reach than the text can bear with no support from the history of, or practice under, the FVRA.  I respectfully dissent.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court explains, the FVRA governs vacancies in offices held by persons \"whose appointment to office is required to be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.\"  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73345(a).  These are known as \"PAS\" offices.  When an official in a PAS office \"dies, resigns, or is otherwise unable to perform the functions and duties of the office\" the FVRA steps in.  Ibid.; see also \u00a73345(c)(2) (an \"expiration of a term of office\" makes an official unable \"to perform the functions and duties\" of the office).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 3345 of the FVRA authorizes four categories of officials to perform the duties of a vacant office.  Subsection (a)(1) contains a default rule: The \"first assistant to the office\" automatically assumes the vacant office and performs \"the functions and duties of the office temporarily in an acting capacity.\"  \u00a73345(a)(1).  Subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1) authorize the President to override that default rule.  The President may direct a person already confirmed by the Senate to a PAS office to serve as the acting officer.  See \u00a73345(a)(2).  The President may direct certain senior officials in the same agency to serve as the acting officer.  See \u00a73345(a)(3).  Or the President may direct a person whose Senate-confirmed term in the office has expired and who has been nominated to a subsequent term in that same office to serve as the acting officer until the Senate acts on the nomination.  See \u00a73345(c)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Subsection (b)(1) takes away this authorization in a specific situation.  It provides that, \"[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\"--the first assistant default rule--a person may not serve as an acting official while nominated to fill the office if the person was not the first assistant to the office for at least 90 of the 365 days preceding the vacancy.  \u00a73345(b)(1).  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1) does not apply to a person serving as the Senate-confirmed first assistant to the vacant office.  See \u00a73345(b)(2).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, the text, purpose, and history of the FVRA make clear that the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) applies only to a first assistant who performs the duties of a vacant office under subsection (a)(1).\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court observes, subsection (b)(1) contains some potentially broad language.  The provision specifies when \"a person may not serve as an acting officer for an office under this section\"--that is, \u00a73345.  The words \"person\" and \"this section,\" taken in isolation, could signal that the prohibition applies to subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1) and thus covers all acting officials.  But context matters.  And here, the context cabins those words and gives subsection (b)(1) a more limited reach.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text of subsection (b)(1) contains a clear signal that its prohibition applies only to first assistants who automatically assume a vacant office under subsection (a)(1): It begins with the clause \"[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1).\"  A notwithstanding clause identifies a potential conflict between two or more provisions and specifies which provision will prevail.  Under the familiar expressio unius est exclusio alterius interpretive canon, the choice to single out subsection (a)(1)--and only subsection (a)(1)--in this notwithstanding clause strongly suggests that the prohibition reaches, and conflicts with, subsection (a)(1), and only subsection (a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rest of \u00a73345 confirms this conclusion.  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1) establishes who may not perform the duties of a vacant office.  In doing so, it introduces a potential conflict with subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1), which identify four categories of persons who may perform the duties of a vacant office.  By stating that its prohibition applies \"[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1),\" subsection (b)(1) expressly states that its prohibition takes precedence over the default rule set out in subsection (a)(1).  The omission of any reference to subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1), in spite of the parallel potential for conflict with those subsections, suggests that the omission was a \"\u00a0'deliberate choice, not inadvertence.'\u00a0\"  Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U.\u00a0S. 223, 232-233 (2011) (quoting Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., 537 U.\u00a0S. 149, 168 (2003)). That choice means that subsection (b)(1) trumps subsection (a)(1) but not subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nothing about a notwithstanding clause renders it impervious to this established rule of statutory interpretation.  The Court says that the rule has less force in the context of a notwithstanding clause because such a clause \"confirms rather than constrains\" the breadth of the provision to which it is attached.  Ante, at 11.  But the breadth of the attached provision is precisely the question here, and the clause's specific reference to subsection (a)(1) and only subsection (a)(1) strongly supports reading the attached prohibition to limit only subsection (a)(1).  See Preseault v. ICC, 494 U.\u00a0S. 1, 13-14 (1990) (a reference to \"\u00a0'this Act'\u00a0\" in a notwithstanding clause limited the scope of the attached provision (emphasis deleted)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court claims that the reference to subsection (a)(1) may serve a different purpose.  In its view, the reference might instead demonstrate a congressional concern that a conflict between subsection (b)(1) and subsection (a)(1) would be \"quite likely to arise\" or \"particularly difficult to resolve.\"  Ante, at 11.  A closer examination does not bear out this hypothesis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text itself refutes the theory that subsection (b)(1) is more likely to conflict with subsection (a)(1) than the other subsections.  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1) does not apply to a person who served as the first assistant to the vacant office for more than 90 days in the year before the vacancy arose, \u00a73345(b)(1)(A), or who serves as a Senate-confirmed first assistant to the office, \u00a73345(b)(2).  A person serving under subsection (a)(1)--by definition, only a first assistant--has a leg up in meeting those conditions and avoiding subsection (b)(1)'s prohibition altogether.  Those serving under subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1)--PAS officials, senior agency officials, or officials whose terms in the vacant office have expired--do not.  The prohibition in subsection (b)(1) is thus more likely, not less likely, to conflict with subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And true enough, subsection (a)(1) sets out an automatic rule under which the first assistant assumes acting status upon a vacancy, whereas subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1) set out conditional rules, under which the President may choose to direct other officials to assume acting status.  But that distinction makes no difference when asking whether a conflict between subsections (b)(1) and (a)(1) would be harder to resolve without guidance than a conflict between subsection (b)(1) and the other subsections.  In stating who may not assume acting status, subsection (b)(1) conflicts equally with the rules about who may assume acting status set out in subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), and (c)(1).  The reference to subsection (a)(1) in subsection (b)(1)'s notwithstanding clause thus cannot be understood as a means to resolve a particularly vexing conflict.  The same conflict exists for all four categories.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the Court's explanations make the notwithstanding clause in subsection (b)(1) superfluous.  If the notwithstanding clause serves only to confirm the breadth of subsection (b)(1) and singles out subsection (a)(1) to address a conflict shared equally by other subsections, then it does no real work.  The clause could be deleted without changing the meaning of subsection (b)(1), as the Court all but admits.  See ante, at 12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Worse still, a broad interpretation of subsection (b)(1) renders subsection (c)(1) superfluous.  Under subsection (c)(1), the President may designate a person whose term in an office has expired and who has been nominated to a subsequent term to serve as the acting official.  It is unlikely, even implausible, that a person who serves out a set term will have served as the first assistant to her own office during the year before her term expired.  Yet subsection (b)(1) requires such service before a person can serve as both an acting official and a nominee.1  As a result, if subsection (b)(1) applies to all acting officials, it would prohibit what subsection (c)(1) expressly permits: acting service by a person nominated by the President to serve out a consecutive Senate-confirmed term in the vacant office.  That is no way to read a statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not a problem, the Court says.  \"[S]ubsection (b)(1) has no effect on (c)(1)\" because subsection (c)(1) contains a specific rule about acting service by a nominee for a second term that, under ordinary principles of statutory interpretation, controls over the general rule governing acting service by a nominee in subsection (b)(1).  Ante, at 14.  The Court's reasoning on this point undercuts its opening claim that the words \"person\" and \"under this section\" in subsection (b)(1) must refer to \"anyone who performs acting duties under the FVRA.\"  Ante, at 9.  And it underscores why the \"[n]otwithstanding subsection (a)(1)\" clause in subsection (b)(1) is superfluous under the Court's reading.  The general authorization of acting service by a first assistant in subsection (a)(1) would yield to the specific prohibition on acting service by certain nominees in subsection (b)(1) even without the notwithstanding clause.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In contrast, reading subsection (b)(1) to apply only to a first assistant serving as an acting official under subsection (a)(1) renders no other provision superfluous.  The Court reasons that subsection (b)(2)(A)'s reference to a person \"serving as the first assistant to the office\" would be superfluous if subsection (b)(1) applies only to first assistants serving under subsection (a)(1).  See ante, at 13.  But recall that subsection (b)(2) creates an exception to subsection (b)(1).  Subsection (b)(1) provides that a person cannot serve as an acting official while nominated if that person was not the first assistant to the vacant office for at least 90 of the 365 days before the vacancy arose.  Subsection (b)(2) states that those requirements do \"not apply to\" current Senate-confirmed first assistants.  Put another way, subsection (b)(1) imposes requirements based on a person's past service, and subsection (b)(2) lifts those requirements based on a person's current service.  The reference in subsection (b)(2)(A) to a person \"serving as the first assistant to the office\" is thus necessary to convey the relevant time period of the service that triggers the exception to subsection (b)(1).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The events leading up to and following the enactment of the FVRA further support interpreting subsection (b)(1) to apply only to first assistants serving under subsection (a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, nothing in the legislative history of the FVRA indicates that subsection (b)(1) was enacted as a broad prohibition on acting service by all nominees.  Under the Vacancies Act of 1868, the FVRA's predecessor, the first assistant to a vacant office served as the acting official unless the President directed another PAS official to do so.  See Act of July 23, 1868, ch. 227, 15 Stat. 168-169.  The Act did not prohibit any person, first assistant or otherwise, from serving as an acting official while nominated to fill the office.  This structure remained in place for over a century.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The events that prompted the FVRA's enactment confirm, in line with the reading above, that the Act altered this pre-existing structure to prohibit certain first assistants from serving in an acting capacity while nominated to the vacant office.  The service of one acting official, Bill Lann Lee, was the turning point in a broader, long-running dispute between the political branches over Executive Branch compliance with the Vacancies Act of 1868.  In 1997, Lee was brought into the Department of Justice to serve as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division after his nomination to the position failed.  He continued to serve in an acting capacity after he was renominated to the position.  The decision to bring Lee in to serve in the Department of Justice after his failed nomination led to strong congressional criticism.  See, e.g., Letter from A. Fois, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legislative Affairs, to Sen. S. Thurmond, pp. 3-4 (Feb. 24, 1998).  Subsection (b)(1) addresses the Lee incident and prevents its recurrence.  See S. Rep. No. 105-250, p. 13 (1998) (explaining that an earlier version of subsection (b)(1) \"prevent[s] manipulation of first assistants to include persons highly unlikely to be career officials\").  It bars a first assistant from serving under subsection (a)(1) while nominated unless the person was the first assistant for a significant period of time before the vacancy arose (90 of the previous 365 days) or the person is the Senate-confirmed first assistant to the vacant office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In contrast, there is no indication of an intent to depart further from the century-old practice under the Vacancies Act of 1868 and prohibit acting service by other officials nominated to a vacant office.  No one has identified congressional statements expressing concern with such service or calling for a broader prohibition.  Indeed, an earlier version of subsection (b)(1) unquestionably applied only to first assistants serving under subsection (a)(1), even though the bill permitted the President to designate a PAS official as the acting official instead of the first assistant.  See id., at 25.  The legislative history does not document the reason for the changes to this subsection.  The Court suggests that an unspoken congressional compromise led to an expanded subsection (b)(1).  Ante, at 15-16.  While the compromise it hypothesizes is possible, no evidence supports it, and the absence of any hint that the compromise was hoped for during the development of or debate on the FVRA means that it is not probable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, under the Court's reading of subsection (b)(1), the Executive Branch began violating the FVRA almost immediately after its enactment.  Within months, the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) advised Executive Branch agencies that the prohibition in subsection (b)(1) \"applies only to persons who serve as acting officers by virtue of having been the first assistant to the office.\"  Guidance on Application of Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, 23 Op. OLC 60, 64 (1999).  The Government Accountability Office, tasked with aiding congressional enforcement of the FVRA, later reached the same conclusion.  See Letter from C. Joyner, Dir., Strategic Issues, to F. Thompson, Chairman, U. S. Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, Subject: Eligibility Criteria for Individuals To Temporarily Fill Vacant Positions Under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, pp.\u00a03-4 (GAO-01-468R, Feb. 23, 2001).  Since the enactment of the FVRA, the Senate has received over 100 nominations of persons who continued to serve in an acting capacity after their nomination but had not satisfied the conditions in subsection (b)(1) for acting service by a nominee.  See App. A to Brief for United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And yet, this legion of would-be violations prompted no response.  No evidence suggests that the Senate reacted by requiring any of those nominees to cease their acting service.  Cf. Pet. for Cert. 28-29 (citing objections raised after the decision below).  The failure to object is all the more glaring in light of the enforcement mechanism written into the FVRA.  Section 3349 requires each Executive Branch agency to \"immediately\" notify the Comptroller General, who heads the Government Accountability Office, and both Houses of Congress of \"a vacancy .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the date such vacancy occurred,\" \"the name of any person serving in an acting capacity and the date such service began,\" \"the name of any person nominated to the Senate to fill the vacancy and the date such nomination is submitted,\" and the date a nomination is acted upon.  This provision leaves no doubt that Congress had all the information it needed to object to any FVRA violations it perceived.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congressional silence in the face of a decade-plus practice of giving subsection (b)(1) a narrow reach casts serious doubt on the broader interpretation.  It indicates that Congress, like the Executive Branch, interpreted subsection (b)(1) in line with its text to reach only first assistants to the vacant office serving pursuant to subsection (a)(1).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The FVRA prohibits a limited set of acting officials--non-Senate confirmed first assistants who serve under subsection (a)(1) and did not serve as the first assistant to the vacant office for at least 90 of the 365 days before the vacancy arose--from performing the duties of a vacant office while also serving as the President's nominee to fill that office.  Reading the provision more broadly to apply to all acting officials disregards the full text of the FVRA and finds no support in its purpose or history.  The Court prefers that reading.  I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0A senior position is one that has a rate of pay equal to or greater than the minimum rate \"for a position at GS-15 of the General Schedule.\"  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73345(a)(3)(B).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The FVRA exempts \"the General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board\" from the general rule that actions taken in violation of the FVRA are void ab initio.  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73348(e)(1).  The Court of Appeals \"assume[d] that section 3348(e)(1) renders the actions of an improperly serving Acting General Counsel voidable\" and rejected the Board's argument against voiding Solomon's actions.  796 F.\u00a03d, at 79-82.  The Board did not seek certiorari on this issue, so we do not consider it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition, the unfair labor practice complaint in this case was issued after the Senate had returned Solomon's nomination the first time but before the President had renominated him to the same position.  In the proceedings below, the Board did not argue that this timing made any difference, and the court assumed it had no bearing on the proper application of the FVRA to this case.  Id., at 72, n.\u00a03.  We proceed on the same assumption.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0That Solomon was appointed \"temporarily\" to serve as acting general counsel does not change the analysis.  I do not think the structural protections of the Appointments Clause can be avoided based on such trivial distinctions.  Solomon served for more than three years in an office limited by statute to a 4-year term, and he exercised all of the statutory duties of that office.  29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7153(d).  There was thus nothing \"special and temporary\" about Solomon's appointment.  United States v. Eaton, 169 U.\u00a0S. 331, 343 (1898).\nFootnote 2\u00a0In Morrison, the Court used a multifactor test to determine whether an independent counsel under the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a749, 591 (1982 ed., Supp. V), was an \"Inferior officer.\"  487 U.\u00a0S., at 671-672. Although we did not explicitly overrule Morrison in Edmond, it is difficult to see how Morrison's nebulous approach survived our opinion in Edmond.  Edmond is also consistent with the Constitution's original meaning and therefore should guide our view of the principal-inferior distinction.  See Calabresi & Lawson, The Unitary Executive, Jurisdiction Stripping, and the Hamdan Opinions: A Textualist Response to Justice Scalia, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 1002, 1018-1019 (2007).\nFootnote 3\u00a0I think the general counsel would likely qualify as a principal officer even under Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.\u00a0S. 654 (1988).  See id., at 671-672. \nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Subsection (b)(2)'s exception would not apply, as a person \"nominated .\u00a0.\u00a0. for reappointment for an additional term to the same office .\u00a0.\u00a0. without a break in service,\" 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73345(c)(1), will of course not be a Senate-confirmed first assistant to that office.\nFootnote 2\u00a0SW General offers a different response that a person directed to perform the duties of a vacant office under subsection (c)(1) does not \"serve as an acting officer,\" \u00a73345(b)(1).  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 30.  This also misses the mark.  Like subsections (a)(1), (a)(2), and (a)(3), subsection (c)(1) is located in \u00a73345, titled, \"Acting officer.\"  Div. C, \u00a7151(b), 112 Stat. 2681-611.  Like those subsections, it addresses who may fill a vacant office.  See 5 U. S. C. \u00a73345(c)(2).  And like those subsections, it expressly subjects service to the time limits in \u00a73346, which apply to \"the person serving as an acting officer as described under section 3345.\"  \u00a73346(a).  Moreover, relegating officials directed to serve under subsection (c)(1) to some statutorily unnamed, non-acting official status would muddle other provisions of the FVRA.  See \u00a73347(a) (making \u00a7\u00a73345 and 3346 \"the exclusive means for temporarily authorizing an acting official\" to serve in a PAS office); \u00a73349(a)(2) (requiring reporting of \"the name of any person serving in an acting capacity and the date such service began immediately upon the designation\").\n\n\n","58":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNELSON v. COLORADO(2017)\nNo. 15-1256\nArgued: January 9, 2017Decided: April 19, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Shannon Nelson was convicted by a Colorado jury of two felonies and three misdemeanors arising from the alleged sexual and physical abuse of her four children.  The trial court imposed a prison term of 20 years to life and ordered her to pay $8,192.50 in court costs, fees, and restitution.  On appeal, Nelson's conviction was reversed for trial error, and on retrial, she was acquitted of all charges.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Louis Alonzo Madden was convicted by a Colorado jury of attempting to patronize a prostituted child and attempted sexual assault.  The trial court imposed an indeterminate prison sentence and ordered him to pay $4,413.00 in costs, fees, and restitution.  After one of Madden's convictions was reversed on direct review and the other vacated on postconviction review, the State elected not to appeal or retry the case.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Colorado Department of Corrections withheld $702.10 from Nelson's inmate account between her conviction and acquittal, and Madden paid the State $1,977.75 after his conviction.  In both cases, the funds were allocated to costs, fees, and restitution.  Once their convictions were invalidated, both petitioners moved for return of the funds.  Nelson's trial court denied her motion outright, and Madden's postconviction court allowed a refund of costs and fees, but not restitution.  The Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that both petitioners were entitled to seek refunds of all they had paid, but the Colorado Supreme Court reversed.  It reasoned that Colorado's Compensation for Certain Exonerated Persons statute (Exoneration Act or Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a713-65-101, 13-65-102, 13-65-103, provided the exclusive authority for refunds and that, because neither Nelson nor Madden had filed a claim under that Act, the courts lacked authority to order refunds.  The Colorado Supreme Court also held that there was no due process problem under the Act, which permits Colorado to retain conviction-related assessments unless and until the prevailing defendant institutes a discrete civil proceeding and proves her innocence by clear and convincing evidence.\nHeld:\u00a0The Exoneration Act's scheme does not comport with the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process.  Pp.\u00a05-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The procedural due process inspection required by Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.\u00a0S. 319, governs these cases.  Medina v. California, 505 U.\u00a0S. 437, controls when state procedural rules that are part of the criminal process are at issue.  These cases, in contrast, concern the continuing deprivation of property after a conviction has been reversed or vacated, with no prospect of reprosecution.

The State may not retain these funds simply because Nelson's and Madden's convictions were in place when the funds were taken, for once those convictions were erased, the presumption of innocence was restored.  See, e.g., Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U.\u00a0S. 578, 585.  And Colorado may not presume a person, adjudged guilty of no crime, nonetheless guilty enough for monetary exactions.  Pp.\u00a06-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0Colorado's scheme creates an unacceptable risk of the erroneous deprivation of defendants' property.  The Exoneration Act conditions refund on defendants' proof of innocence by clear and convincing evidence, but defendants in petitioners' position are presumed innocent.  Moreover, the Act provides no remedy for assessments tied to invalid misdemeanor convictions.  And when, as here, the recoupment amount sought is not large, the cost of mounting a claim under the Act and retaining counsel to pursue it would be prohibitive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colorado argues that an Act that provides sufficient process to compensate a defendant for the loss of her liberty must suffice to compensate a defendant for the lesser deprivation of money.  But Nelson and Madden seek the return of their property, not compensation for its temporary deprivation.  Just as restoration of liberty on reversal of a conviction is not compensation, neither is the return of money taken by the State on account of the conviction.  Other procedures cited by Colorado--the need for probable cause to support criminal charges, the jury-trial right, and the State's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt--do not address the risk faced by a defendant whose conviction has been overturned that she will not recover funds taken from her based solely on a conviction no longer valid.

COLORADO\nLOUIS A. MADDEN, PETITIONER v. COLORADO\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of colorado\n[April 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a criminal conviction is invalidated by a reviewing court and no retrial will occur, is the State obliged to refund fees, court costs, and restitution exacted from the defendant upon, and as a consequence of, the conviction?  Our answer is yes.  Absent conviction of a crime, one is presumed innocent.  Under the Colorado law before us in these cases, however, the State retains conviction-related assessments unless and until the prevailing defendant institutes a discrete civil proceeding and proves her innocence by clear and convincing evidence.  This scheme, we hold, offends the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of due process.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two cases are before us for review.  Petitioner Shannon Nelson, in 2006, was convicted by a Colorado jury of five counts--two felonies and three misdemeanors--arising from the alleged sexual and physical abuse of her four children.  362 P.\u00a03d 1070, 1071 (Colo. 2015); App. 25-26.  The trial court imposed a prison sentence of 20 years to life and ordered Nelson to pay court costs, fees, and restitution totaling $8,192.50.  362 P.\u00a03d, at 1071.  On appeal, Nelson's conviction was reversed for trial error.  Ibid.  On retrial, a new jury acquitted Nelson of all charges.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Louis Alonzo Madden, in 2005, was convicted by a Colorado jury of attempting to patronize a prostituted child and attempted third-degree sexual assault by force.  See 364 P.\u00a03d 866, 867 (Colo. 2015).  The trial court imposed an indeterminate prison sentence and ordered Madden to pay costs, fees, and restitution totaling $4,413.00.  Ibid.  The Colorado Supreme Court reversed one of Madden's convictions on direct review, and a postconviction court vacated the other.  Ibid.  The State elected not to appeal or retry the case.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Between Nelson's conviction and acquittal, the Colorado Department of Corrections withheld $702.10 from her inmate account, $287.50 of which went to costs and fees1 and $414.60 to restitution.  See 362 P.\u00a03d, at 1071, and n.\u00a01.  Following Madden's conviction, Madden paid Colorado $1,977.75, $1,220 of which went to costs and fees2 and $757.75 to restitution.  See 364 P.\u00a03d, at 867.  The sole legal basis for these assessments was the fact of Nelson's and Madden's convictions.3  Absent those convictions, Colorado would have no legal right to exact and retain petitioners' funds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Their convictions invalidated, both petitioners moved for return of the amounts Colorado had taken from them.  In Nelson's case, the trial court denied the motion outright.  362 P.\u00a03d, at 1071.  In Madden's case, the postconviction court allowed the refund of costs and fees, but not restitution.  364 P.\u00a03d, at 867-868.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same Colorado Court of Appeals panel heard both cases and concluded that Nelson and Madden were entitled to seek refunds of all they had paid, including amounts allocated to restitution.  See People v. Nelson, 369 P.\u00a03d 625, 628-629 (2013); People v. Madden, 2013 WL 1760869, *1 (Apr. 25, 2013).  Costs, fees, and restitution, the court held, must be \"tied to a valid conviction,\" 369 P.\u00a03d, at 627-628, absent which a court must \"retur[n] the defendant to the status quo ante,\" 2013 WL 1760869, at *2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Colorado Supreme Court reversed in both cases.  A court must have statutory authority to issue a refund, that court stated.  362 P.\u00a03d, at 1077; 364 P.\u00a03d, at 868.  Colorado's Compensation for Certain Exonerated Persons statute (Exoneration Act or Act), Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a713-65-101, 13-65-102, 13-65-103 (2016), passed in 2013, \"provides the proper procedure for seeking a refund,\" the court ruled.  362 P.\u00a03d, at 1075, 1077.  As no other statute addresses refunds, the court concluded that the Exoneration Act is the \"exclusive process for exonerated defendants seeking a refund of costs, fees, and restitution.\"  Id., at 1078.4  Because neither Nelson nor Madden had filed a claim under the Act, the court further determined, their trial courts lacked authority to order a refund.  Id., at 1075, 1078; 364 P.\u00a03d, at 867.5  There was no due process problem, the court continued, because the Act \"provides sufficient process for defendants to seek refunds of costs, fees, and restitution that they paid in connection with their conviction.\"  362 P.\u00a03d, at 1078.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Hood dissented in both cases.  Because neither petitioner has been validly convicted, he explained, each must be presumed innocent.  Id., at 1079 (Nelson); 364 P.\u00a03d, at 870 (adopting his reasoning from Nelson in Madden).  Due process therefore requires some mechanism \"for the return of a defendant's money,\" Justice Hood maintained, 362 P.\u00a03d, at 1080; as the Exoneration Act required petitioners to prove their innocence, the Act, he concluded, did not supply the remedy due process demands, id., at 1081.  We granted certiorari.  579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Exoneration Act provides a civil claim for relief \"to compensate an innocent person who was wrongly convicted.\"  362 P.\u00a03d, at 1075.  Recovery under the Act is available only to a defendant who has served all or part of a term of incarceration pursuant to a felony conviction, and whose conviction has been overturned for reasons other than insufficiency of evidence or legal error unrelated to actual innocence.  See \u00a713-65-102.  To succeed on an Exoneration Act claim, a petitioner must show, by clear and convincing evidence, her actual innocence of the offense of conviction.  \u00a7\u00a713-65-101(1), 13-65-102(1).  A successful petitioner may recoup, in addition to compensation for time served,6 \"any fine, penalty, court costs, or restitution .\u00a0.\u00a0. paid .\u00a0.\u00a0. as a result of his or her wrongful conviction.\"  Id., at 1075 (quoting \u00a713-65-103(2)(e)(V)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Colorado's legislation, as just recounted, a defendant must prove her innocence by clear and convincing evidence to obtain the refund of costs, fees, and restitution paid pursuant to an invalid conviction.  That scheme, we hold, does not comport with due process.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The familiar procedural due process inspection instructed by Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.\u00a0S. 319 (1976), governs these cases.  Colorado argues that we should instead apply the standard from Medina v. California, 505 U.\u00a0S. 437, 445 (1992), and inquire whether Nelson and Madden were exposed to a procedure offensive to a fundamental principle of justice.  Medina \"provide[s] the appropriate framework for assessing the validity of state procedural rules\" that \"are part of the criminal process.\"  Id., at 443.  Such rules concern, for example, the allocation of burdens of proof and the type of evidence qualifying as admissible.7  These cases, in contrast, concern the continuing deprivation of property after a conviction has been reversed or vacated, with no prospect of reprosecution.  See Kaley v. United States, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a04 (2014) (Roberts, C.\u00a0J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10-11, n.\u00a04) (explaining the different offices of Mathews and Medina).  Because no further criminal process is implicated, Mathews \"provides the relevant inquiry.\"  571 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11, n.\u00a04).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Mathews balancing test, a court evaluates (A)\u00a0the private interest affected; (B)\u00a0the risk of erroneous deprivation of that interest through the procedures used; and (C)\u00a0the governmental interest at stake.  424 U.\u00a0S., at 335.  All three considerations weigh decisively against Colorado's scheme.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nelson and Madden have an obvious interest in regaining the money they paid to Colorado.  Colorado urges, however, that the funds belong to the State because Nelson's and Madden's convictions were in place when the funds were taken.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 29-31.  But once those convictions were erased, the presumption of their innocence was restored.  See, e.g., Johnson v. Mississippi, 486 U.\u00a0S. 578, 585 (1988) (After a \"conviction has been reversed, unless and until [the defendant] should be retried, he must be presumed innocent of that charge.\").8  \"[A]xiomatic and elementary,\" the presumption of innocence \"lies at the foundation of our criminal law.\"  Coffin v. United States, 156 U.\u00a0S. 432, 453 (1895).9  Colorado may not retain funds taken from Nelson and Madden solely because of their now-invalidated convictions, see supra, at 2-3, and n.\u00a03, for Colorado may not presume a person, adjudged guilty of no crime, nonetheless guilty enough for monetary exactions.10\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That petitioners prevailed on subsequent review rather than in the first instance, moreover, should be inconsequential.  Suppose a trial judge grants a motion to set aside a guilty verdict for want of sufficient evidence.  In that event, the defendant pays no costs, fees, or restitution.  Now suppose the trial court enters judgment on a guilty verdict, ordering cost, fee, and restitution payments by reason of the conviction, but the appeals court upsets the conviction for evidentiary insufficiency.  By what right does the State retain the amount paid out by the defendant?  \"[I]t should make no difference that the reviewing court, rather than the trial court, determined the evidence to be insufficient.\"  Burks v. United States, 437 U.\u00a0S. 1, 11 (1978).  The vulnerability of the State's argument that it can keep the amounts exacted so long as it prevailed in the court of first instance is more apparent still if we assume a case in which the sole penalty is a fine.  On Colorado's reasoning, an appeal would leave the defendant emptyhanded; regardless of the outcome of an appeal, the State would have no refund obligation.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 41, 44.11\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is there a risk of erroneous deprivation of defendants' interest in return of their funds if, as Colorado urges, the Exoneration Act is the exclusive remedy?  Indeed yes, for the Act conditions refund on defendants' proof of innocence by clear and convincing evidence.  \u00a713-65-101(1)(a).  But to get their money back, defendants should not be saddled with any proof burden.  Instead, as explained supra, at 6-7, they are entitled to be presumed innocent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, as Justice Hood noted in dissent, the Act provides no remedy at all for any assessments tied to invalid misdemeanor convictions (Nelson had three).  362 P.\u00a03d, at 1081, n.\u00a01; see \u00a713-65-102(1)(a).  And when amounts a defendant seeks to recoup are not large, as is true in Nelson's and Madden's cases, see supra, at 2, the cost of mounting a claim under the Exoneration Act and retaining a lawyer to pursue it would be prohibitive.12\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colorado argued on brief that if the Exoneration Act provides sufficient process to compensate a defendant for the loss of her liberty, the Act should also suffice \"when a defendant seeks compensation for the less significant deprivation of monetary assessments paid pursuant to a conviction that is later overturned.\"  Brief for Respondent 40.  The comparison is inapt.  Nelson and Madden seek restoration of funds they paid to the State, not compensation for temporary deprivation of those funds.  Petitioners seek only their money back, not interest on those funds for the period the funds were in the State's custody.  Just as the restoration of liberty on reversal of a conviction is not compensation, neither is the return of money taken by the State on account of the conviction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colorado also suggests that \"numerous pre- and post-deprivation procedures\"--including the need for probable cause to support criminal charges, the jury-trial right, and the State's burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt--adequately minimize the risk of erroneous deprivation of property.  Id., at 31; see id., at 31-35.  But Colorado misperceives the risk at issue.  The risk here involved is not the risk of wrongful or invalid conviction any criminal defendant may face.  It is, instead, the risk faced by a defendant whose conviction has already been overturned that she will not recover funds taken from her solely on the basis of a conviction no longer valid.  None of the above-stated procedures addresses that risk, and, as just explained, the Exoneration Act is not an adequate remedy for the property deprivation Nelson and Madden experienced.13\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colorado has no interest in withholding from Nelson and Madden money to which the State currently has zero claim of right.  \"Equitable [c]onsiderations,\" Colorado suggests, may bear on whether a State may withhold funds from criminal defendants after their convictions are overturned.  Brief for Respondent 20-22.  Colorado, however, has identified no such consideration relevant to petitioners' cases, nor has the State indicated any way in which the Exoneration Act embodies \"equitable considerations.\"\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colorado's scheme fails due process measurement because defendants' interest in regaining their funds is high, the risk of erroneous deprivation of those funds under the Exoneration Act is unacceptable, and the State has shown no countervailing interests in retaining the amounts in question.  To comport with due process, a State may not impose anything more than minimal procedures on the refund of exactions dependent upon a conviction subsequently invalidated.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgments of the Colorado Supreme Court are reversed, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\nAlito, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1256\nSHANNON NELSON, PETITIONER v. COLORADO\nLOUIS A. MADDEN, PETITIONER v. COLORADO\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of colorado\n[April 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I agree that the judgments of the Colorado Supreme Court must be reversed, but I reach that conclusion by a different route.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proper framework for analyzing these cases is provided by Medina v. California, 505 U.\u00a0S. 437 (1992).  Medina applies when we are called upon to \"asses[s] the validity of state procedural rules which .\u00a0.\u00a0. are part of the criminal process,\" id., at 443, and that is precisely the situation here.  These cases concern Colorado's rules for determining whether a defendant can obtain a refund of money that he or she was required to pay pursuant to a judgment of conviction that is later reversed.  In holding that these payments must be refunded, the Court relies on a feature of the criminal law, the presumption of innocence.  And since the Court demands that refunds occur either automatically or at least without imposing anything more than \"minimal\" procedures, see ante, at 10, it appears that they must generally occur as part of the criminal case.  For these reasons, the refund obligation is surely \"part of the criminal process\" and thus falls squarely within the scope of Medina.  The only authority cited by the Court in support of its contrary conclusion is a footnote in a dissent.  See ante, at 6 (citing Kaley v. United States, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n.\u00a04 (2014) (opinion of Roberts, C. J.) (slip op., at 10-11, n.\u00a04)).  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Medina, a state rule of criminal procedure not governed by a specific rule set out in the Bill of Rights violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment only if it offends a fundamental and deeply rooted principle of justice.  505 U.\u00a0S., at 445.  And \"[h]istorical practice is probative of whether a procedural rule can be characterized as fundamental.\"  Id., at 446.  Indeed, petitioners invite us to measure the Colorado scheme against traditional practice, reminding us that our \"\u00a0'first due process cases'\u00a0\" recognized that \"\u00a0'traditional practice provides a touchstone for constitutional analysis,'\u00a0\" Brief for Petitioners 26 (quoting Honda Motor Co. v. Oberg, 512 U.\u00a0S. 415, 430 (1994)).  Petitioners then go on to argue at some length that \"[t]he traditional rule has always been that when a judgment is reversed, a person who paid money pursuant to that judgment is entitled to receive the money back.\"  Brief for Petitioners 26; see id., at 26-30.  See also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 4-14 (discussing traditional practice).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court, by contrast, turns its back on historical practice, preferring to balance the competing interests according to its own lights.  The Court applies the balancing test set out in Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.\u00a0S. 319 (1976), a modern invention \"first conceived\" to decide what procedures the government must observe before depriving persons of novel forms of property such as welfare or Social Security disability benefits.  Dusenbery v. United States, 534 U.\u00a0S. 161, 167 (2002).  Because these interests had not previously been regarded as \"property,\" the Court could not draw on historical practice for guidance.  Mathews has subsequently been used more widely in civil cases, but we should pause before applying its balancing test in matters of state criminal procedure.  \"[T]he States have considerable expertise in matters of criminal procedure and the criminal process is grounded in centuries of common-law tradition.\"  Medina, supra, at 445-446.  Applying the Mathews balancing test to established rules of criminal practice and procedure may result in \"undue interference with both considered legislative judgments and the careful balance that the Constitution strikes between liberty and order.\"  Medina, supra, at 443.  Where long practice has struck a particular balance between the competing interests of the State and those charged with crimes, we should not lightly disturb that determination.  For these reasons, Medina's historical inquiry, not Mathews, provides the proper framework for use in these cases.1\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under Medina, the Colorado scheme at issue violates due process.  American law has long recognized that when an individual is obligated by a civil judgment to pay money to the opposing party and that judgment is later reversed, the money should generally be repaid.  See, e.g., Northwestern Fuel Co. v. Brock, 139 U.\u00a0S. 216, 219 (1891) (\"The right of restitution of what one has lost by the enforcement of a judgment subsequently reversed has been recognized in the law of England from a very early period .\u00a0.\u00a0. \"); Bank of United States v. Bank of Washington, 6 Pet. 8, 17 (1832) (\"On the reversal of an erroneous judgment, the law raises an obligation in the party to the record, who has received the benefit of the erroneous judgment, to make restitution to the other party for what he has lost\").  This was \"a remedy well known at common law,\" memorialized as \"a part of the judgment of reversal which directed 'that the defendant be restored to all things which he has lost on occasion of the judgment aforesaid.'\u00a0\"  2 Ruling Case Law \u00a7248, p. 297 (W. McKinney and B. Rich eds. 1914); Duncan v. Kirkpatrick, 13 Serg. & Rawle 292, 294 (Pa. 1825).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As both parties acknowledge, this practice carried over to criminal cases.  When a conviction was reversed, defendants could recover fines and monetary penalties assessed as part of the conviction.  Brief for Respondent 20-21, and n.\u00a07; Reply Brief 7-8, 11; see, e.g., Annot., Right To Recover Back Fine or Penalty Paid in Criminal Proceeding, 26 A. L. R. 1523, 1532, \u00a7VI(a) (1923) (\"When a judgment imposing a fine, which is paid, is vacated or reversed on appeal, the court may order restitution of the amount paid .\u00a0.\u00a0. \"); 25 C.\u00a0J. \u00a739, p. 1165 (W. Mack, W. Hale, & D. Kiser eds. 1921) (\"Where a fine illegally imposed has been paid, on reversal of the judgment a writ of restitution may issue against the parties who received the fine\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rule regarding recovery, however, \"even though general in its application, [was] not without exceptions.\"  Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Florida, 295 U.\u00a0S. 301, 309 (1935) (Cardozo, J.).  The remedy was \"equitable in origin and function,\" and return of the money was \"\u00a0'not of mere right,'\u00a0\" but \"\u00a0'rest[ed] in the exercise of a sound discretion.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 309, 310 (quoting Gould v. McFall, 118 Pa. 455, 456 (1888)).  This was true in both civil and criminal cases.  See, e.g., 25 C.\u00a0J., at 1165 (noting that \"restitution [of fines paid on a conviction later reversed] is not necessarily a matter of right\"); Annot., 26 A. L. R., at 1532, \u00a7VI(a) (Restitution for fines upon reversal of a conviction \"is not a matter of strict legal right, but rather one for the exercise of the court's discretion\").  The central question courts have asked is whether \"the possessor will give offense to equity and good conscience if permitted to retain [the successful appellant's money].\"  Atlantic Coast Line, supra, at 309.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This history supports the Court's rejection of the Colorado Exoneration Act's procedures.  The Act places a heavy burden of proof on defendants, provides no opportunity for a refund for defendants (like Nelson) whose misdemeanor convictions are reversed, and excludes defendants whose convictions are reversed for reasons unrelated to innocence.  Brief for Respondent 8, 35, n.\u00a018.  These stringent requirements all but guarantee that most defendants whose convictions are reversed have no realistic opportunity to prove they are deserving of refunds.  Colorado has abandoned historical procedures that were more generous to successful appellants and incorporated a court's case-specific equitable judgment.  Instead, Colorado has adopted a system that is harsh, inflexible, and prevents most defendants whose convictions are reversed from demonstrating entitlement to a refund.  Indeed, the Colorado General Assembly made financial projections based on the assumption that only one person every five years would qualify for a financial award under the Exoneration Act.  Colorado Legislative Council Staff Fiscal Note, State and Local Revised Fiscal Impact, HB 13-1230, p.\u00a02 (Apr. 22, 2013), online at http:\/\/leg.colorado.gov (as last visited Apr. 17, 2017).  Accordingly, the Exoneration Act does not satisfy due process requirements.  See Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.\u00a0S. 348, 356 (1996) (A state rule of criminal procedure may violate due process where \"a rule significantly more favorable to the defendant has had a long and consistent application\").\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although long-established practice supports the Court's judgment, the Court rests its decision on different grounds.  In its Mathews analysis, the Court reasons that the reversal of petitioners' convictions restored the presumption of their innocence and that \"Colorado may not presume a person, adjudged guilty of no crime, nonetheless guilty enough for monetary exactions.\"  Ante, at 7.  The implication of this brief statement is that under Mathews, reversal restores the defendant to the status quo ante, see ante, at 3.  But the Court does not confront the obvious implications of this reasoning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, if the status quo ante must be restored, why shouldn't the defendant be compensated for all the adverse economic consequences of the wrongful conviction?2  After all, in most cases, the fines and payments that a convicted defendant must pay to the court are minor in comparison to the losses that result from conviction and imprisonment, such as attorney's fees, lost income, and damage to reputation.  The Court cannot convincingly explain why Mathews' amorphous balancing test stops short of requiring a full return to the status quo ante when a conviction is reversed.  But Medina does.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The American legal system has long treated compensation for the economic consequences of a reversed conviction very differently from the refund of fines and other payments made by a defendant pursuant to a criminal judgment.  Statutes providing compensation for time wrongfully spent in prison are a 20th-century innovation: By 1970, only the Federal Government and four States had passed such laws.  King, Compensation of Persons Erroneously Confined by the State, 118 U.\u00a0Pa. L.\u00a0Rev. 1091, 1109 (1970); United States v. Keegan, 71 F.\u00a0Supp. 623, 626 (SDNY 1947) (\"[T]here seems to have been no legislation by our Government on this subject\" until 1938).  Many other jurisdictions have done so since, but under most such laws, compensation is not automatic.  Instead, the defendant bears the burden of proving actual innocence (and, sometimes, more).  King, supra, at 1110 (\"The burden of proving innocence in the compensation proceeding has from the start been placed upon the claimant\"); see also Kahn, Presumed Guilty Until Proven Innocent: The Burden of Proof in Wrongful Conviction Claims Under State Compensation Statutes, 44 U. Mich. J.\u00a0L. Reform 123, 145 (2010) (Most U.\u00a0S. compensation statutes \"require that claimants prove their innocence either by a preponderance of the evidence or by clear and convincing evidence\" (footnote omitted)).  In construing the federal statute, courts have held that a compensation proceeding \"is not .\u00a0.\u00a0. a criminal trial\" and that the burden of proof can be placed on the petitioner.  United States v. Brunner, 200 F.\u00a02d 276, 279 (CA6 1952).  As noted, Colorado and many other States have similar statutes designed narrowly to compensate those few persons who can demonstrate that they are truly innocent.  The Court apparently acknowledges that these statutes pose no constitutional difficulty.  That is the correct conclusion, but it is best justified by reference to history and tradition.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's disregard of historical practice is particularly damaging when it comes to the question of restitution.  The Court flatly declares that the State is \"obliged to refund .\u00a0.\u00a0. restitution\" in just the same way as fees and court costs.  Ante, at 1.  This conclusion is not supported by historical practice, and it overlooks important differences between restitution, which is paid to the victims of an offense, and fines and other payments that are kept by the State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although restitution may be included in a criminal judgment, it has many attributes of a civil judgment in favor of the victim.  This is clear under Colorado law.  Although the obligation to pay restitution is included in the defendant's sentence, restitution results in a final civil judgment against the defendant in favor of the State and the victim.  Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a718-1.3-603(4)(a)(I) (2016).  Entitlement to restitution need not be established beyond a reasonable doubt or in accordance with standard rules of evidence or criminal procedure.  People v. Pagan, 165 P.\u00a03d 724, 729 (Colo. App. 2006); Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a718-1.3-603(2)-(3).  And the judgment may be enforced either by the State or the victim.  \u00a7\u00a716-18.5-106(2), \u00a7\u00a716-18.5-107(1)-(4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court ignores the distinctive attributes of restitution, but they merit attention.  Because a restitution order is much like a civil judgment, the reversal of the defendant's criminal conviction does not necessarily undermine the basis for restitution.  Suppose that a victim successfully sues a criminal defendant civilly and introduces the defendant's criminal conviction on the underlying conduct as (potentially preclusive) evidence establishing an essential element of a civil claim.  See, e.g., 2 K. Broun, McCormick on Evidence \u00a7298, 473-477 (7th ed. 2013) (discussing the admissibility, and potential preclusive effect, of a criminal conviction in subsequent civil litigation).  And suppose that the defendant's criminal conviction is later reversed for a trial error that did not (and could not) infect the later civil proceeding: for example, the admission of evidence barred by the exclusionary rule or a Confrontation Clause violation.  It would be unprecedented to suggest that due process requires unwinding the civil judgment simply because it rests in part on a criminal conviction that has since been reversed.  And a very similar scenario could unfold with respect to a Colorado restitution judgment.  The only salient difference would be that, in the Colorado case, the civil judgment would have been obtained as part of the criminal proceeding itself.  It is not clear (and the Court certainly does not explain) why that formal distinction should make a substantive difference.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is especially startling to insist that a State must provide a refund after enforcing a restitution judgment on the victims' behalf in reliance on a final judgment that is then vacated on collateral review.  Faced with this fact pattern, the Ninth Circuit declined to require reimbursement, reasoning that the Government was a mere \"escrow agent\" executing a then-valid final judgment in favor of a third party.  United States v. Hayes, 385 F.\u00a03d 1226, 1230 (2004).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court regrettably mentions none of this.  Its treatment of restitution is not grounded in any historical analysis, and--save for a brief footnote, ante, at 2-3, n.\u00a03--the Court does not account for the distinctive civil status of restitution under Colorado law (or the laws of the many other affected jurisdictions that provide this remedy to crime victims).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor does the Court consider how restitution's unique characteristics might affect the balance that it strikes under Mathews.  Ante, at 10.  The Court summarily rejects the proposition that \"\u00a0'equitable considerations'\u00a0\" might militate against a blanket rule requiring the refund of money paid as restitution, see ibid., but why is this so?  What if the evidence amply establishes that the defendant injured the victims to whom restitution was paid but the defendant's conviction is reversed on a ground that would be inapplicable in a civil suit?  In that situation, is it true, as the Court proclaims, that the State would have \"no interest\" in withholding a refund?  Would the Court reach that conclusion if state law mandated a refund from the recipients of the restitution?  And if the States and the Federal Government are always required to foot the bill themselves, would  that risk discourage them from seeking restitution--or at least from providing funds to victims until the conclusion of appellate review?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It was unnecessary for the Court to issue a sweeping pronouncement on restitution.  But if the Court had to address this subject to dispose of these cases, it should have acknowledged that--at least in some circumstances--refunds of restitution payments made under later reversed judgments are not constitutionally required.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, I concur only in the judgment.\n\nThomas, J., dissenting\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-1256\nSHANNON NELSON, PETITIONER v. COLORADO\nLOUIS A. MADDEN, PETITIONER v. COLORADO\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of colorado\n[April 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority and concurring opinions debate whether the procedural due process framework of Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.\u00a0S. 319 (1976), or that of Medina v. California, 505 U.\u00a0S. 437 (1992), governs the question before us.  But both opinions bypass the most important question in these cases: whether petitioners can show a substantive entitlement to a return of the money they paid pursuant to criminal convictions that were later reversed or vacated.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court assumes, without reference to either state or federal law, that defendants whose convictions have been reversed have a substantive right to any money exacted on the basis of those convictions.  By doing so, the Court assumes away the real issue in these cases.  As the parties have agreed, the existence of Colorado's obligation to provide particular procedures depends on whether petitioners have a substantive entitlement to the money.  Colorado concedes that \"if [petitioners] have a present entitlement\" to the money--that is, if \"it is their prop-erty\"--\"then due process requires [the State to accord] them some procedure to get it back.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.  And Colorado acknowledges that the procedural hurdles it could impose before returning the money \"would be fairly minimal,\" id., at 51, because petitioners would need to prove only that their convictions had been reversed and that they had paid a certain sum of money, see ibid.  Similarly, petitioners concede that if defendants in their position do not have a substantive right to recover the money--that is, if the money belongs to the State--then Colorado need not \"provide any procedure to give it back.\"  Id., at 53.  If defendants in their position have no entitlement to the money they paid pursuant to their reversed convictions, there would be nothing to adjudicate.  In light of these concessions, I can see no justification for the Court's decision to address the procedures for adjudicating a substantive entitlement while failing to determine whether a substantive entitlement exists in the first place.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, petitioners have not demonstrated that defendants whose convictions have been reversed possess a substantive entitlement, under either state law or the Constitution, to recover money they paid to the State pursuant to their convictions.  Accordingly, I cannot agree with the Court's decision to reverse the judgments of the Colorado Supreme Court.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fourteenth Amendment provides that no State shall \"deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\"  U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 14, \u00a71 (emphasis added).1  To show that Colorado has violated the Constitution's procedural guarantees, as relevant here, petitioners must first establish that they have been deprived of a protected property interest.  See Castle Rock v. Gonzales, 545 U.\u00a0S. 748, 756 (2005) (\"The procedural component of the Due Process Clause does not protect everything that might be described as a benefit: To have a property interest in a benefit, a person clearly must have .\u00a0.\u00a0. a legitimate claim of entitlement to it\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  \"Because the Constitution protects rather than creates property interests, the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to 'existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.'\u00a0\"  Phillips v. Washington Legal Foundation, 524 U.\u00a0S. 156, 164 (1998) (quoting Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.\u00a0S. 564, 577 (1972)).  Petitioners undoubtedly have an \"interest in regaining the money they paid to Colorado.\"  Ante, at 6.  But to succeed on their procedural due process claim, petitioners must first point to a recognized property interest in that money, under state or federal law, within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties dispute whether, under Colorado law, the petitioners or the State have a property interest in the money paid by petitioners pursuant to their convictions.  Petitioners contend that the money remains their property under state law.  Reply Brief 1-3; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 52-54.  Colorado counters that when petitioners paid the money pursuant to their convictions, the costs and fees became property of the State and the restitution became property of the victims.  See id., at 28-30; Brief for Respondent 41.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The key premise of the Colorado Supreme Court's holdings in these cases is that moneys lawfully exacted pursuant to a valid conviction become public funds (or the victims' money) under Colorado law.  The Colorado Supreme Court explained in petitioner Shannon Nelson's case that \"the trial court properly ordered [her] to pay costs, fees, and restitution pursuant to valid statutes\" and that \"the court correctly distributed th[ose] funds to victims and public funds, as ordered by the statutes.\"  362 P.\u00a03d 1070, 1076 (2015) (emphasis added); accord, 364 P.\u00a03d 866, 868-870 (2016) (applying the same analysis to petitioner Louis Madden's case).  The Colorado Supreme Court further noted that, \"[o]nce the state disburses restitution to the victims, the state no longer controls that money.\" 362 P.\u00a03d, at 1077, n.\u00a04.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Colorado Supreme Court explained that \"Colorado's constitution protects\" the Colorado Legislature's \"control over public money,\" and thus a \"court may authorize refunds from public funds only pursuant to statutory authority.\"  Id., at 1076-1077.  The Exoneration Act, the Colorado Supreme Court held, provides the only statutory authority for refunding costs, fees, and restitution when a defendant's conviction is overturned.  Id., at 1077-1078.  Because petitioners had not sought a refund under the Exoneration Act, \"the trial court lacked the authority to order a refund of Nelson's costs, fees, and restitution.\"  Id., at 1078; 364 P.\u00a03d, at 867.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At no point in this litigation have petitioners attempted to demonstrate that they satisfy the requirements of the Exoneration Act.  Under the Act, Colorado recognizes a substantive entitlement to the kind of property at issue in these cases only if, among other things, the defendant can prove that he is \"actually innocent.\"2  Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a713-65-101, 13-65-102 (2016).  It is the Exoneration Act alone which defines the scope of the substantive entitlement.  This Court has interpreted the Due Process Clause to require that the States provide certain procedures, such as notice and a hearing, by which an individual can prove a substantive entitlement to (or defend against a deprivation of\u00a0) property.  But the Clause, properly understood, has nothing to say about the existence or scope of the substantive entitlement itself.  See Part I-B, infra.  If petitioners want this Court to rewrite the contours of the substantive entitlement contained in the Exoneration Act, they err in invoking procedural due process. See Reply Brief 1-2 (\"Our argument sounds in procedural due process\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority responds by asserting, without citing any state law, that Colorado \"had no legal right to retain [petitioners'] money\" once their convictions were invalidated.  Ante, at 8, n.\u00a011.  If this were true as a matter of state law, then certain provisions of the Exoneration Act--which require the State to return costs, fees, and restitution only in limited circumstances following a conviction's reversal--would be superfluous.  Thus, to the extent the majority implicitly suggests that petitioners have a state-law right to an automatic refund (a point about which the majority is entirely unclear), it is plainly incorrect.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because defendants in petitioners' position do not have a substantive right to recover the money they paid to Colorado under state law, petitioners' asserted right to an automatic refund must arise, if at all, from the Due Process Clause itself.  But the Due Process Clause confers no substantive rights.  McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.\u00a0S. 742, 811 (2010) (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\"The notion that a constitutional provision that guarantees only 'process' before a person is deprived of life, liberty, or property could define the substance of those rights strains credulity for even the most casual user of words\").  And, in any event, petitioners appear to disavow any substantive due process right to a return of the funds they paid.  See Reply Brief 1-2; Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19.  In the absence of any property right under state law (apart from the right provided by the Exoneration Act, which petitioners decline to invoke), Colorado's refusal to return the money is not a \"depriv[ation]\" of \"property\" within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Colorado is therefore not required to provide any process at all for the return of that money.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0No one disputes that if petitioners had never been convicted, Colorado could not have required them to pay the money at issue.  And no one disputes that Colorado cannot require petitioners to pay any additional costs, fees, or restitution now that their convictions have been invalidated.  It does not follow, however, that petitioners have a property right in the money they paid pursuant to their then-valid convictions, which now belongs to the State and the victims under Colorado law.  The Court today announces that petitioners have a right to an automatic refund because the State has \"no legal right\" to that money.  Ante, at 8, n.\u00a011. But, intuitive and rhetorical appeal aside, it does not seriously attempt to ground that conclusion in state or federal law.  If petitioners' supposed right to an automatic refund arises under Colorado law, then the Colorado Supreme Court remains free on remand to clarify whether that right in fact exists.  If it arises under substantive due process, then the Court's procedural due process analysis misses the point.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Together with Madden v. Colorado, also on certiorari to the same court (see this Court's Rule 12.4).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Of the $287.50 for costs and fees, $125 went to the victim compensation fund and $162.50 to the victims and witnesses assistance and law enforcement fund (VAST fund).  See 362 P.\u00a03d 1070, 1071, n.\u00a01 (Colo. 2015).\nFootnote 2\u00a0Of the $1,220 for costs and fees, $125 went to the victim compensation fund and $1,095 to the VAST fund ($1,000 of which was for the special advocate surcharge).  See App. 79; 364 P.\u00a03d 866, 869 (Colo. 2015).\nFootnote 3\u00a0See Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a724-4.1-119(1)(a) (2005) (levying victim-compensation-fund fees for \"each criminal action resulting in a conviction or in a deferred judgment and sentence\"); \u00a724-4.2-104(1)(a)(1)(I) (2005) (same, for VAST fund fees); \u00a724-4.2-104(1)(a)(1)(II) (same, for special advocate surcharge); \u00a718-1.3-603(1) (2005) (with one exception, \"[e]very order of conviction .\u00a0.\u00a0. shall include consideration of restitution\").  See also 362 P.\u00a03d, at 1073 (\"[T]he State pays the cost of criminal cases when a defendant is acquitted.\" (citing Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a716-18-101(1) (2015))).  Under Colorado law, a restitution order tied to a criminal conviction is rendered as a separate civil judgment.  See \u00a718-1.3-603(4)(a) (2005).  If the conviction is reversed, any restitution order dependent on that conviction is simultaneously vacated.  See People v. Scearce, 87 P.\u00a03d 228, 234-235 (Colo. App. 2003).\nFootnote 4\u00a0While these cases were pending in this Court, Colorado passed new legislation to provide \"[r]eimbursement of amounts paid following a vacated conviction.\"  See Colo. House Bill 17-1071 (quoting language for Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a718-1.3-703, the new provision).  That legislation takes effect September 1, 2017, and has no effect on the cases before us.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Prior to the Exoneration Act, the Colorado Supreme Court recognized the competence of courts, upon reversal of a conviction, to order the refund of monetary exactions imposed on a defendant solely by reason of the conviction.  Toland v. Strohl, 147 Colo. 577, 586, 364 P.\u00a02d 588, 593 (1961).\nFootnote 6\u00a0Compensation under the Exoneration Act includes $70,000 per year of incarceration for the wrongful conviction; additional sums per year served while the defendant is under a sentence of death, or placed on parole or probation or on a sex offender registry; compensation for child support payments due during incarceration; tuition waivers at state institutions of higher education for the exonerated person and for any children conceived or legally adopted before the incarceration; and reasonable attorney's fees for bringing an Exoneration Act claim.  \u00a713-65-103(2), (3) (2016).\nFootnote 7\u00a0See Cooper v. Oklahoma, 517 U.\u00a0S. 348, 356-362 (1996) (standard of proof to establish incompetence to stand trial); Dowling v. United States, 493 U.\u00a0S. 342, 343-344, 352 (1990) (admissibility of testimony about a prior crime of which the defendant was acquitted); Patterson v. New York, 432 U.\u00a0S. 197, 198, 201-202 (1977) (burden of proving affirmative defense); Medina v. California, 505 U.\u00a0S. 437, 443-446, 457 (1992) (burden of proving incompetence to stand trial).\nFootnote 8\u00a0Citing Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.\u00a0S. 520 (1979), Colorado asserts that \"[t]he presumption of innocence applies only at criminal trials\" and thus has no application here.  Brief for Respondent 40, n.\u00a019.  Colorado misapprehends Wolfish.  Our opinion in that case recognized that \"under the Due Process Clause,\" a detainee who \"has not been adjudged guilty of any crime\" may not be punished.  441 U.\u00a0S., at 535-536; see id., at 535-540.  Wolfish held only that the presumption does not prevent the government from \"detain[ing a defendant] to ensure his presence at trial .\u00a0.\u00a0. so long as [the] conditions and restrictions [of his detention] do not amount to punishment, or otherwise violate the Constitution.\"  Id., at 536-537.\nFootnote 9\u00a0Were Medina applicable, Colorado's Exoneration Act scheme would similarly fail due process measurement.  Under Medina, a criminal procedure violates due process if \"it offends some principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.\"  505 U.\u00a0S., at 445 (quoting Patterson, 432 U.\u00a0S., at 202).  The presumption of innocence unquestionably fits that bill.\nFootnote 10\u00a0Colorado invites a distinction between convictions merely \"voidable,\" rather than \"void,\" and urges that the invalidated convictions here fall in the voidable category.  See Brief for Respondent 32-33, and n.\u00a011.  As Justice Hood noted in dissent, however, \"reversal is reversal,\" regardless of the reason, \"[a]nd an invalid conviction is no conviction at all.\"  362 P.\u00a03d, at 1080.\nFootnote 11\u00a0The dissent echoes Colorado's argument.  If Nelson and Madden prevailed at trial, the dissent agrees, no costs, fees, or restitution could be exacted.  See post, at 6.  But if they prevailed on appellate inspection, the State gets to keep their money.  See ibid.  Under Colorado law, as the dissent reads the Colorado Supreme Court's opinion, \"moneys lawfully exacted pursuant to a valid conviction become public funds (or[, in the case of restitution,] the victims' money).\"  Post, at 3-4.  Shut from the dissent's sights, however, the convictions pursuant to which the State took petitioners' money were invalid, hence the State had no legal right to retain their money.  Given the invalidity of the convictions, does the Exoneration Act afford sufficient process to enable the State to retain the money?  Surely, it does not.\nFootnote 12\u00a0A successful petitioner under the Exoneration Act can recover reasonable attorney's fees, \u00a713-65-103(2)(e)(IV), but neither a defendant nor counsel is likely to assume the risk of loss when amounts to be gained are not worth the candle.\nFootnote 13\u00a0Colorado additionally argues that defendants can request a stay of sentence pending appeal, thereby reducing the risk of erroneous deprivation.  See Brief for Respondent 32; \u00a7\u00a716-12-103, 18-1.3-702(1)(a) (2016).  But the State acknowledged at oral argument that few defendants can meet the requirements a stay pending appeal entails.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-34.  And even when a stay is available, a trial court \"may require the defendant to deposit the whole or any part of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. costs.\"  Colo. App. Rule 8.1(a)(3) (2016).\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In a footnote, the Court briefly opines on how a Medina analysis would come out in these cases.  The Court's discussion of the issue, which is dictum, is substantially incomplete.  The Court suggests that Medina would support its judgment because the presumption of innocence is deeply rooted and fundamental.  Ante, at 7, n.\u00a09.  It is true, of course, that this presumption is restored when a conviction is reversed.  But that says very little about the question at hand: namely, what must happen once that presumption is restored.  Notably, the Court cites not a single case applying the presumption of innocence in the refund context.  At the same time, the Court ignores cases that bear directly on the question in these cases and thus must be part of a proper Medina inquiry.  See infra, at this page and 4-5.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The Court's position is also at odds with other principles of our procedural due process jurisprudence.  It is well settled, for example, that a plaintiff who is deprived of property with inadequate process is not entitled to be compensated if the defendant can prove the deprivation \"would have occurred even if [the plaintiff] had been given due process.\"  Thompson v. District of Columbia, 832 F.\u00a03d 339, 346 (CADC 2016); see Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.\u00a0S. 247, 260, 263 (1978).  This principle is in obvious tension with the Court's holding.\nFootnote 3\u00a0The Court cites one intermediate appellate case for the proposition that when a conviction is reversed, any restitution order dependent on that conviction is simultaneously vacated.  Ante, at 2-3, n.\u00a03 (citing People v. Scearce, 87 P.\u00a03d 228 (Colo. App. 2003)).  Scearce did not discuss whether any payments had been made to victims or--if so--whether they would be recoverable from the State.  More important, Scearce is hardly the last word on the question whether due process invariably requires the refund of restitution.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0As I have previously observed, the Due Process Clause may have originally been understood to require only \"that our Government .\u00a0.\u00a0. proceed according to the 'law of the land'--that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions\"--before depriving someone of life, liberty, or property.  Johnson v. United States, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 17) (quoting Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.\u00a0S. 507, 589 (2004) (Thomas, J., dissenting)).  Because Colorado does not advance that argument, and because it is unnecessary to resolve the issue in these cases.  I assume that the Due Process Clause requires some baseline procedures regardless of the provisions of Colorado law.\nFootnote 2\u00a0More specifically, the Exoneration Act entitles an exonerated defendant to compensation if he was convicted of a felony, was incarcerated, and, among other requirements, can prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is \"actually innocent,\" meaning that his \"conviction was the result of a miscarriage of justice\" or that he is factually innocent.  Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7\u00a713-65-101(1)(a), 13-65-102(1)(a) (2016); see Nelson, 362 P.\u00a03d, at 1075.  \"Insufficiency of the evidence or a legal error unrelated to the person's actual innocence cannot support either exoneration or subsequent compensation under the Act.\"  Ibid.\n\n\n","59":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nNORTH CAROLINA, ET AL.  v.

In May 2015, several registered North Carolina voters (here called plaintiffs) brought this action in the U. S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, alleging that 28 majority-black districts in the new plan were unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.  The District Court ruled for the plaintiffs in August 2016, holding that race was the predominant factor in the design of each challenged district, and that in none was that use of race \"supported by a strong basis in evidence and narrowly tailored to comply with [the Voting Rights Act].\"  316 F.\u00a0R.\u00a0D. 117, 176 (MDNC 2016).*  The court declined to require changes in time for the then-impending November 2016 election, but ordered the General Assembly to redraw the map before North Carolina holds any future elections for that body.  See App. to Juris. Statement 148-149.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks after the November 2016 election, the District Court ordered additional relief.  In addition to setting a March 2017 deadline for the General Assembly's drawing of new districts, the court ordered that \"[t]he term of any legislator elected in 2016\" from a district later modified by that remedial plan \"shall be shortened to one year\" (rather than the regular two).  Id., at 203.  Those legislators would then be replaced by new ones, to be chosen in court-ordered special elections in the fall of 2017.  The legislators elected in those special elections, too, were then to \"serve a one year term.\"  Id., at 204.  Finally, in order to make this regime workable, the court also suspended provisions of the North Carolina Constitution requiring prospective legislators to reside within a district for one year before they may be elected to represent it.  See id., at 203 (citing N. C. Const., Art. II, \u00a7\u00a76-7).

Although this Court has never addressed whether or when a special election may be a proper remedy for a racial gerrymander, obvious considerations include the severity and nature of the particular constitutional violation, the extent of the likely disruption to the ordinary processes of governance if early elections are imposed, and the need to act with proper judicial restraint when intruding on state sovereignty.  We do not suggest anything about the relative weight of these factors (or others), but they are among the matters a court would generally be expected to consider in its \"balancing of the individual and collective interests\" at stake.

Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a714-202.5(a), (e).  According to sources cited to the Court, the State has prosecuted over 1,000 people for violating this law, including petitioner, who was indicted after posting a statement on his personal Facebook profile about a positive experience in traffic court.  The trial court denied petitioner's motion to dismiss the indictment on the ground that the law violated the First Amendment.  He was convicted and given a suspended prison sentence.  On appeal, the State Court of Appeals struck down \u00a714-202.5 on First Amendment grounds, but the State Supreme Court reversed.  \nHeld:\u00a0The North Carolina statute impermissibly restricts lawful speech in violation of the First Amendment.  Pp.\u00a04-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a) A fundamental First Amendment principle is that all persons have access to places where they can speak and listen, and then, after reflection, speak and listen once more.  Today, one of the most important places to exchange views is cyberspace, particularly social media, which offers \"relatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds,\" Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.\u00a0S. 844, 870, to users engaged in a wide array of protected First Amendment activity on any number of diverse topics.  The Internet's forces and directions are so new, so protean, and so far reaching that courts must be conscious that what they say today may be obsolete tomorrow.  Here, in one of the first cases the Court has taken to address the relationship between the First Amendment and the modern Internet, the Court must exercise extreme caution before suggesting that the First Amendment provides scant protection for access to vast networks in that medium.  Pp.\u00a04-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0This background informs the analysis of the statute at issue.  Even assuming that the statute is content neutral and thus subject to intermediate scrutiny, the provision is not \"\u00a0'\u00a0\"narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.\"\u00a0'\u00a0\"  McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  Like other inventions heralded as advances in human progress, the Internet and social media will be exploited by the criminal mind.  It is also clear that \"sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people,\" Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.\u00a0S. 234, 244, and that a legislature \"may pass valid laws to protect children\" and other sexual assault victims, id., at 245.  However, the assertion of a valid governmental interest \"cannot, in every context, be insulated from all constitutional protections.\"  Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.\u00a0S. 557, 563.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two assumptions are made in resolving this case.  First, while the Court need not decide the statute's precise scope, it is enough to assume that the law applies to commonplace social networking sites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  Second, the Court assumes that the First Amendment permits a State to enact specific, narrowly-tailored laws that prohibit a sex offender from engaging in conduct that often presages a sexual crime, like contacting a minor or using a website to gather information about a minor.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even with these assumptions, the statute here enacts a prohibition unprecedented in the scope of First Amendment speech it burdens.  Social media allows users to gain access to information and communicate with one another on any subject that might come to mind.  With one broad stroke, North Carolina bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.  Foreclosing access to social media altogether thus prevents users from engaging in the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights.  Even convicted criminals--and in some instances especially convicted criminals--might receive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas, particularly if they seek to reform and to pursue lawful and rewarding lives.  Pp.\u00a06-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The State has not met its burden to show that this sweeping law is necessary or legitimate to serve its purpose of keeping convicted sex offenders away from vulnerable victims.  No case or holding of this Court has approved of a statute as broad in its reach.  The State relies on Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.\u00a0S. 191, but that case considered a more limited restriction--prohibiting campaigning within 100 feet of a polling place--in order to protect the fundamental right to vote.  The Court noted, moreover, that a larger buffer zone could \"become an impermissible burden\" under the First Amendment.  Id., at 210.  The better analogy is Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.\u00a0S. 569.  If an ordinance prohibiting any \"First Amendment activities\" at a single Los Angeles airport could be struck down because it covered all manner of protected, nondisruptive behavior, including \"talking and reading, or the wearing of campaign buttons or symbolic clothing,\" id., at 571, 575, it follows with even greater force that the State may not enact this complete bar to the exercise of First Amendment rights on websites integral to the fabric of modern society and culture.

NORTH CAROLINA\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of  north carolina\n[June 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2008, North Carolina enacted a statute making it a felony for a registered sex offender to gain access to a number of websites, including commonplace social media websites like Facebook and Twitter.  The question presented is whether that law is permissible under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause, applicable to the States under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0North Carolina law makes it a felony for a registered sex offender \"to access a commercial social networking Web site where the sex offender knows that the site permits minor children to become members or to create or maintain personal Web pages.\"  N.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a714-202.5(a), (e) (2015).  A \"commercial social networking Web site\" is defined as a website that meets four criteria.  First, it \"[i]s operated by a person who derives revenue from membership fees, advertising, or other sources related to the operation of the Web site.\"  \u00a714-202.5(b).  Second, it \"[f]acilitates the social introduction between two or more persons for the purposes of friendship, meeting other persons, or information exchanges.\"  Ibid.  Third, it \"[a]llows users to create Web pages or personal profiles that contain information such as the name or nickname of the user, photographs placed on the personal Web page by the user, other personal information about the user, and links to other personal Web pages on the commercial social networking Web site of friends or associates of the user that may be accessed by other users or visitors to the Web site.\"  Ibid.  And fourth, it \"[p]rovides users or visitors .\u00a0.\u00a0. mechanisms to communicate with other users, such as a message board, chat room, electronic mail, or instant messenger.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute includes two express exemptions.  The statutory bar does not extend to websites that \"[p]rovid[e] only one of the following discrete services: photo-sharing, electronic mail, instant messenger, or chat room or message board platform.\"  \u00a714-202.5(c)(1).  The law also does not encompass websites that have as their \"primary purpose the facilitation of commercial transactions involving goods or services between [their] members or visitors.\"  \u00a714-202.5(c)(2).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to sources cited to the Court, \u00a714-202.5 applies to about 20,000 people in North Carolina and the State has prosecuted over 1,000 people for violating it.  Brief for Petitioner 6-8.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2002, petitioner Lester Gerard Packingham--then a 21-year-old college student--had sex with a 13-year-old girl.  He pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a child.  Because this crime qualifies as \"an offense against a minor,\" petitioner was required to register as a sex offender--a status that can endure for 30 years or more.  See \u00a714-208.6A; see \u00a714-208.7(a).  As a registered sex offender, petitioner was barred under \u00a714-202.5 from gaining access to commercial social networking sites.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2010, a state court dismissed a traffic ticket against petitioner.  In response, he logged on to Facebook.com and posted the following statement on his personal profile:\n\"Man God is Good!  How about I got so much favor they dismissed the ticket before court even started?  No fine, no court cost, no nothing spent. . . . . .Praise be to GOD, WOW!  Thanks JESUS!\"  App. 136.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the time, a member of the Durham Police Department was investigating registered sex offenders who were thought to be violating \u00a714-202.5.  The officer noticed that a \"\u00a0'J.\u00a0R. Gerrard'\u00a0\" had posted the statement quoted above.  368 N.\u00a0C. 380, 381, 777 S.\u00a0E. 2d 738, 742 (2015).  By checking court records, the officer discovered that a traffic citation for petitioner had been dismissed around the time of the post.  Evidence obtained by search warrant confirmed the officer's suspicions that petitioner was J.\u00a0R. Gerrard.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner was indicted by a grand jury for violating \u00a714-202.5.  The trial court denied his motion to dismiss the indictment on the grounds that the charge against him violated the First Amendment.  Petitioner was ultimately convicted and given a suspended prison sentence.  At no point during trial or sentencing did the State allege that petitioner contacted a minor--or committed any other illicit act--on the Internet.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals of North Carolina.  That court struck down \u00a714-202.5 on First Amendment grounds, explaining that the law is not narrowly tailored to serve the State's legitimate interest in protecting minors from sexual abuse.  229 N.\u00a0C. App. 293, 304, 748 S.\u00a0E. 2d 146, 154 (2013).  Rather, the law \"arbitrarily burdens all registered sex offenders by preventing a wide range of communication and expressive activity unrelated to achieving its purported goal.\"  Ibid.  The North Carolina Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the law is \"constitutional in all respects.\"  368 N.\u00a0C., at 381, 777 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 741.  Among other things, the court explained that the law is \"carefully tailored .\u00a0.\u00a0. to prohibit registered sex offenders from accessing only those Web sites that allow them the opportunity to gather information about minors.\"  Id., at 389, 777 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 747.  The court also held that the law leaves open adequate alternative means of communication because it permits petitioner to gain access to websites that the court believed perform the \"same or similar\" functions as social media, such as the Paula Deen Network and the website for the local NBC affiliate.  Id., at 390, 777 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 747.  Two justices dissented.  They stated that the law impermissibly \"creates a criminal prohibition of alarming breadth and extends well beyond the evils the State seeks to combat.\"  Id., at 401, 777 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 754 (opinion of Hudson, J.) (alteration, citation, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court granted certiorari, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now reverses.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A fundamental principle of the First Amendment is that all persons have access to places where they can speak and listen, and then, after reflection, speak and listen once more.  The Court has sought to protect the right to speak in this spatial context.  A basic rule, for example, is that a street or a park is a quintessential forum for the exercise of First Amendment rights.  See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.\u00a0S. 781, 796 (1989). Even in the modern era, these places are still essential venues for public gatherings to celebrate some views, to protest others, or simply to learn and inquire.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While in the past there may have been difficulty in identifying the most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views, today the answer is clear.  It is cyberspace--the \"vast democratic forums of the Internet\" in general, Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union, 521 U.\u00a0S. 844, 868 (1997), and social media in particular.  Seven in ten American adults use at least one Internet social networking service.  Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 5-6.  One of the most popular of these sites is Facebook, the site used by petitioner leading to his conviction in this case.  According to sources cited to the Court in this case, Facebook has 1.79 billion active users.  Id., at 6.  This is about three times the population of North America.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Social media offers \"relatively unlimited, low-cost capacity for communication of all kinds.\"  Reno, supra, at 870.  On Facebook, for example, users can debate religion and politics with their friends and neighbors or share vacation photos.  On LinkedIn, users can look for work, advertise for employees, or review tips on entrepreneurship.  And on Twitter, users can petition their elected representatives and otherwise engage with them in a direct manner.  Indeed, Governors in all 50 States and almost every Member of Congress have set up accounts for this purpose.  See Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation 15-16.  In short, social media users employ these websites to engage in a wide array of protected First Amendment activity on topics \"as diverse as human thought.\"  Reno, supra, at 870 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The nature of a revolution in thought can be that, in its early stages, even its participants may be unaware of it.  And when awareness comes, they still may be unable to know or foresee where its changes lead.  Cf. D. Hawke, Benjamin Rush: Revolutionary Gadfly 341 (1971) (quoting Rush as observing: \"\u00a0'The American war is over; but this is far from being the case with the American revolution.  On the contrary, nothing but the first act of the great drama is closed'\u00a0\").  So too here.  While we now may be coming to the realization that the Cyber Age is a revolution of historic proportions, we cannot appreciate yet its full dimensions and vast potential to alter how we think, express ourselves, and define who we want to be.  The forces and directions of the Internet are so new, so protean, and so far reaching that courts must be conscious that what they say today might be obsolete tomorrow.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case is one of the first this Court has taken to address the relationship between the First Amendment and the modern Internet.  As a result, the Court must exercise extreme caution before suggesting that the First Amendment provides scant protection for access to vast networks in that medium.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This background informs the analysis of the North Carolina statute at issue.  Even making the assumption that the statute is content neutral and thus subject to intermediate scrutiny, the provision cannot stand.  In order to survive intermediate scrutiny, a law must be \"narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.\"  McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 18) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In other words, the law must not \"burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For centuries now, inventions heralded as advances in human progress have been exploited by the criminal mind.  New technologies, all too soon, can become instruments used to commit serious crimes.  The railroad is one example, see M. Crichton, The Great Train Robbery, p. xv (1975), and the telephone another, see 18 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71343.  So it will be with the Internet and social media.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is also no doubt that, as this Court has recognized, \"[t]he sexual abuse of a child is a most serious crime and an act repugnant to the moral instincts of a decent people.\"  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.\u00a0S. 234, 244 (2002).  And it is clear that a legislature \"may pass valid laws to protect children\" and other victims of sexual assault \"from abuse.\"  See id., at 245; accord, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.\u00a0S. 747, 757 (1982). The government, of course, need not simply stand by and allow these evils to occur.  But the assertion of a valid governmental interest \"cannot, in every context, be insulated from all constitutional protections.\"  Stanley v. Georgia, 394 U.\u00a0S. 557, 563 (1969).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is necessary to make two assumptions to resolve this case.  First, given the broad wording of the North Carolina statute at issue, it might well bar access not only to commonplace social media websites but also to websites as varied as Amazon.com, Washingtonpost.com, and Webmd.com.  See post, at 6-9; see also Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation 24-27; Brief for Cato Institute et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 10-12, and n.\u00a06.  The Court need not decide the precise scope of the statute.  It is enough to assume that the law applies (as the State concedes it does) to social networking sites \"as commonly understood\"--that is, websites like Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter.  See Brief for Respondent 54; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, this opinion should not be interpreted as barring a State from enacting more specific laws than the one at issue.  Specific criminal acts are not protected speech even if speech is the means for their commission.  See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.\u00a0S. 444, 447-449 (1969) (\u00a0per curiam).  Though the issue is not before the Court, it can be assumed that the First Amendment permits a State to enact specific, narrowly tailored laws that prohibit a sex offender from engaging in conduct that often presages a sexual crime, like contacting a minor or using a website to gather information about a minor.  Cf. Brief for Respondent 42-43.  Specific laws of that type must be the State's first resort to ward off the serious harm that sexual crimes inflict.  (Of importance, the troubling fact that the law imposes severe restrictions on persons who already have served their sentence and are no longer subject to the supervision of the criminal justice system is also not an issue before the Court.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even with these assumptions about the scope of the law and the State's interest, the statute here enacts a prohibition unprecedented in the scope of First Amendment speech it burdens.  Social media allows users to gain access to information and communicate with one another about it on any subject that might come to mind.  Supra, at 5.  By prohibiting sex offenders from using those websites, North Carolina with one broad stroke bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing current events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.  These websites can provide perhaps the most powerful mechanisms available to a private citizen to make his or her voice heard.  They allow a person with an Internet connection to \"become a town crier with a voice that resonates farther than it could from any soapbox.\"  Reno, 521 U.\u00a0S., at 870.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, to foreclose access to social media altogether is to prevent the user from engaging in the legitimate exercise of First Amendment rights.  It is unsettling to suggest that only a limited set of websites can be used even by persons who have completed their sentences.  Even convicted criminals--and in some instances especially convicted criminals--might receive legitimate benefits from these means for access to the world of ideas, in particular if they seek to reform and to pursue lawful and rewarding lives.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The primary response from the State is that the law must be this broad to serve its preventative purpose of keeping convicted sex offenders away from vulnerable victims.  The State has not, however, met its burden to show that this sweeping law is necessary or legitimate to serve that purpose.  See McCullen, 573 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 28).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is instructive that no case or holding of this Court has approved of a statute as broad in its reach.  The closest analogy that the State has cited is Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.\u00a0S. 191 (1992).  There, the Court upheld a prohibition on campaigning within 100 feet of a polling place.  That case gives little or no support to the State.  The law in Burson was a limited restriction that, in a context consistent with constitutional tradition, was enacted to protect another fundamental right--the right to vote.  The restrictions there were far less onerous than those the State seeks to impose here.  The law in Burson meant only that the last few seconds before voters entered a polling place were \"their own, as free from interference as possible.\"  Id., at 210.  And the Court noted that, were the buffer zone larger than 100 feet, it \"could effectively become an impermissible burden\" under the First Amendment.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The better analogy to this case is Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus, Inc., 482 U.\u00a0S. 569 (1987), where the Court struck down an ordinance prohibiting any \"First Amendment activities\" at Los Angeles International Airport because the ordinance covered all manner of protected, nondisruptive behavior including \"talking and reading, or the wearing of campaign buttons or symbolic clothing,\"  id., at 571, 575.  If a law prohibiting \"all protected expression\" at a single airport is not constitutional, id., at 574 (emphasis deleted), it follows with even greater force that the State may not enact this complete bar to the exercise of First Amendment rights on websites integral to the fabric of our modern society and culture.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is well established that, as a general rule, the Government \"may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech.\"  Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.\u00a0S., at 255.  That is what North Carolina has done here.  Its law must be held invalid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the North Carolina Supreme Court is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nAlito, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNOTICE:\u2002This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports.\u2003Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.\u00a0C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.\nNo. 15-1194\nLESTER GERARD PACKINGHAM, PETITIONER v. NORTH CAROLINA\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of  north carolina\n[June 19, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The North Carolina statute at issue in this case was enacted to serve an interest of \"surpassing importance.\"  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.\u00a0S. 747, 757 (1982)--but it has a staggering reach.  It makes it a felony for a registered sex offender simply to visit a vast array of websites, including many that appear to provide no realistic opportunity for communications that could facilitate the abuse of children.  Because of the law's extraordinary breadth, I agree with the Court that it violates the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I cannot join the opinion of the Court, however, because of its undisciplined dicta.  The Court is unable to resist musings that seem to equate the entirety of the internet with public streets and parks.  Ante, at 4-5.  And this language is bound to be interpreted by some to mean that the States are largely powerless to restrict even the most dangerous sexual predators from visiting any internet sites, including, for example, teenage dating sites and sites designed to permit minors to discuss personal problems with their peers.  I am troubled by the implications of the Court's unnecessary rhetoric.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The North Carolina law at issue makes it a felony for a registered sex offender \"to access a commercial social networking Web site where the sex offender knows that the site permits minor children to become members or to create or maintain personal Web pages.\"  N.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a7\u00a714-202.5(a), (e) (2015).  And as I will explain, the statutory definition of a \"commercial social networking Web site\" is very broad.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Packingham and the State debate the analytical framework that governs this case.  The State argues that the law in question is content neutral and merely regulates a \"place\" (i.e., the internet) where convicted sex offenders may wish to engage in speech.  See Brief for Respondent 20-25.  Therefore, according to the State, the standard applicable to \"time, place, or manner\" restrictions should apply.  See Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.\u00a0S. 781, 791 (1989).  Packingham responds that the challenged statute is \"unlike any law this Court has considered as a time, place, or manner restriction,\" Brief for Petitioner 37, and he advocates a more demanding standard of review, id., at 37-39.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like the Court, I find it unnecessary to resolve this dispute because the law in question cannot satisfy the standard applicable to a content-neutral regulation of the place where speech may occur.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A content-neutral \"time, place, or manner\" restriction must serve a \"legitimate\" government interest, Ward, supra, at 798, and the North Carolina law easily satisfies this requirement.  As we have frequently noted, \"[t]he prevention of sexual exploitation and abuse of children constitutes a government objective of surpassing importance.\"  Ferber, supra, at 757.  \"Sex offenders are a serious threat,\" and \"the victims of sexual assault are most often juveniles.\"  McKune v. Lile, 536 U.\u00a0S. 24, 32 (2002) (plurality opinion); see Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety v. Doe, 538 U.\u00a0S. 1, 4 (2003).  \"[T]he .\u00a0.\u00a0. interest [of] safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor .\u00a0.\u00a0. is a compelling one,\"  Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, County of Norfolk, 457 U.\u00a0S. 596, 607 (1982), and \"we have sustained legislation aimed at protecting the physical and emotional well-being of youth even when the laws have operated in the sensitive area of constitutionally protected rights,\" Ferber, supra, at 757.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Repeat sex offenders pose an especially grave risk to children.  \"When convicted sex offenders reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.\"  McKune, supra, at 33 (plurality opinion); see United States v. Kebodeaux, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2013) (slip op., at 8-9).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State's interest in protecting children from recidivist sex offenders plainly applies to internet use.  Several factors make the internet a powerful tool for the would-be child abuser.  First, children often use the internet in a way that gives offenders easy access to their personal information--by, for example, communicating with strangers and allowing sites to disclose their location.1  Second, the internet provides previously unavailable ways of communicating with, stalking, and ultimately abusing children.  An abuser can create a false profile that misrepresents the abuser's age and gender.  The abuser can lure the minor into engaging in sexual conversations, sending explicit photos, or even meeting in person.  And an abuser can use a child's location posts on the internet to determine the pattern of the child's day-to-day activities--and even the child's location at a given moment.  Such uses of the internet are already well documented, both in research2 and in reported decisions.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because protecting children from abuse is a compelling state interest and sex offenders can (and do) use the internet to engage in such abuse, it is legitimate and entirely reasonable for States to try to stop abuse from occurring before it happens.\nC\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not enough, however, that the law before us is designed to serve a compelling state interest; it also must not \"burden substantially more speech than is necessary to further the government's legitimate interests.\"  Ward, 491 U.\u00a0S., at 798-799; see also McCullen v. Coakley, 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2014) (slip op., at 18-19).  The North Carolina law fails this requirement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A straightforward reading of the text of N.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a714-202.5 compels the conclusion that it prohibits sex offenders from accessing an enormous number of websites.  The law defines a \"commercial social networking Web site\" as one with four characteristics.  First, the website must be \"operated by a person who derives revenue from membership fees, advertising, or other sources related to the operation of the Web site.\"  \u00a714-202.5(b)(1).  Due to the prevalence of advertising on websites of all types, this requirement does little to limit the statute's reach.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the website must \"[f]acilitat[e] the social introduction between two or more persons for the purposes of friendship, meeting other persons, or information exchanges.\"  \u00a714-202.5(b)(2).  The term \"social introduction\" easily encompasses any casual exchange, and the term \"information exchanges\" seems to apply to any site that provides an opportunity for a visitor to post a statement or comment that may be read by other visitors.  Today, a great many websites include this feature.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, a website must \"[a]llo[w] users to create Web pages or personal profiles that contain information such as the name or nickname of the user, photographs placed on the personal Web page by the user, other personal information about the user, and links to other personal Web pages on the commercial social networking Web site of friends or associates of the user that may be accessed by other users or visitors to the Web site.\"  \u00a714-202.5(b)(3) (emphasis added).  This definition covers websites that allow users to create anything that can be called a \"personal profile,\" i.e., a short description of the user.4  Con-trary to the argument of the State, Brief for Respondent 26-27, everything that follows the phrase \"such as\" is an illustration of features that a covered website or personal profile may (but need not) include.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, in order to fit within the statute, a website must \"[p]rovid[e] users or visitors .\u00a0.\u00a0. mechanisms to communicate with other users, such as a message board, chat room, electronic mail, or instant messenger.\"  \u00a714-202.5(b)(4) (emphasis added).  This requirement seems to demand no more than that a website allow back-and-forth comments between users.  And since a comment function is undoubtedly a \"mechanis[m] to communicate with other users,\" ibid., it appears to follow that any website with such a function satisfies this requirement.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fatal problem for \u00a714-202.5 is that its wide sweep precludes access to a large number of websites that are most unlikely to facilitate the commission of a sex crime against a child.  A handful of examples illustrates this point.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take, for example, the popular retail website Amazon.com, which allows minors to use its services5 and meets all four requirements of \u00a714-202.5's definition of a commercial social networking website.  First, as a seller of products, Amazon unquestionably derives revenue from the operation of its website.  Second, the Amazon site facilitates the social introduction of people for the purpose of information exchanges.  When someone purchases a product on Amazon, the purchaser can review the product and upload photographs, and other buyers can then respond to the review.6  This information exchange about products that Amazon sells undoubtedly fits within the definition in \u00a714-202.5.  It is the equivalent of passengers on a bus comparing notes about products they have purchased.  Third, Amazon allows a user to create a personal profile, which is then associated with the product reviews that the user uploads.  Such a profile can contain an assortment of information, including the user's name, e-mail address, and picture.7  And fourth, given its back-and-forth comment function, Amazon satisfies the final statutory requirement.8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many news websites are also covered by this definition.  For example, the Washington Post's website gives minors access9 and satisfies the four elements that define a commercial social networking website.  The website (1) derives revenue from ads and (2) facilitates social introductions for the purpose of information exchanges.  Users of the site can comment on articles, reply to other users' comments, and recommend another user's comment.10  Users can also (3) create personal profiles that include a name or nickname and a photograph.  The photograph and name will then appear next to every comment the user leaves on an article.  Finally (4), the back-and-forth comment section is a mechanism for users to communicate among themselves.  The site thus falls within \u00a714-202.5 and is accordingly off limits for registered sex offenders in North Carolina.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Or consider WebMD--a website that contains health-related resources, from tools that help users find a doctor to information on preventative care and the symptoms associated with particular medical problems.  WebMD, too, allows children on the site.11  And it exhibits the four hallmarks of a \"commercial social networking\" website.  It obtains revenue from advertisements.12  It facilitates information exchanges--via message boards that allow users to engage in public discussion of an assortment of health issues.13  It allows users to create basic profile pages: Users can upload a picture and some basic information about themselves, and other users can see their aggregated comments and \"likes.\"14  WebMD also provides message boards, which are specifically mentioned in the statute as a \"mechanis[m] to communicate with other users.\"  N.\u00a0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \u00a714-202.5(b)(4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As these examples illustrate, the North Carolina law has a very broad reach and covers websites that are ill suited for use in stalking or abusing children.  The focus of the discussion on these sites--shopping, news, health--does not provide a convenient jumping off point for conversations that may lead to abuse.  In addition, the social exchanges facilitated by these websites occur in the open, and this reduces the possibility of a child being secretly lured into an abusive situation.  These websites also give sex offenders little opportunity to gather personal details about a child; the information that can be listed in a profile is limited, and the profiles are brief.  What is more, none of these websites make it easy to determine a child's precise location at a given moment.  For example, they do not permit photo streams (at most, a child could upload a single profile photograph), and they do not include up-to-the minute location services.  Such websites would provide essentially no aid to a would-be child abuser.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Placing this set of websites categorically off limits from registered sex offenders prohibits them from receiving or engaging in speech that the First Amendment protects and does not appreciably advance the State's goal of protecting children from recidivist sex offenders.  I am therefore compelled to conclude that, while the law before us addresses a critical problem, it sweeps far too broadly to satisfy the demands of the Free Speech Clause.15\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While I thus agree with the Court that the particular law at issue in this case violates the First Amendment, I am troubled by the Court's loose rhetoric.  After noting that \"a street or a park is a quintessential forum for the exercise of First Amendment rights,\" the Court states that \"cyberspace\" and \"social media in particular\" are now \"the most important places (in a spatial sense) for the exchange of views.\"  Ante, at 4-5.  The Court declines to explain  what this means with respect to free speech law, and the Court holds no more than that the North Carolina law fails the test for content-neutral  \"time, place, and manner\" restrictions.  But if the entirety of the internet or even just \"social media\" sites16 are the 21st century equivalent of public streets and parks, then States may have little ability to restrict the sites that may be visited by even the most dangerous sex offenders.  May a State preclude an adult previously convicted of molesting children from visiting a dating site for teenagers?  Or a site where minors communicate with each other about personal problems?  The Court should be more attentive to the implications of its rhetoric for, contrary to the Court's suggestion, there are important differences between cyberspace and the physical world.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I will mention a few that are relevant to internet use by sex offenders.  First, it is easier for parents to monitor the physical locations that their children visit and the individuals with whom they speak in person than it is to monitor their internet use.  Second, if a sex offender is seen approaching children or loitering in a place frequented by children, this conduct may be observed by parents, teachers, or others.  Third, the internet offers an unprecedented degree of anonymity and easily permits a would-be molester to assume a false identity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court is correct that we should be cautious in applying our free speech precedents to the internet.  Ante, at 6.  Cyberspace is different from the physical world, and if it is true, as the Court believes, that \"we cannot appreciate yet\" the \"full dimensions and vast potential\" of \"the Cyber Age,\" ibid., we should proceed circumspectly, taking one step at a time.  It is regrettable that the Court has not heeded its own admonition of caution.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See Pew Research Center, Teens, Social Media, and Privacy 5 (May 21, 2013), http:\/\/www.pewinternet.org\/files\/2013\/05\/PIP_ TeensSocialMediaandPrivacy_PDF.pdf (all internet materials as last visited June 16, 2017); J.

COLORADO(2017)\nNo. 15-606\nArgued: October 11, 2016Decided: March 6, 2017\n\n\nA Colorado jury convicted petitioner Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez of harassment and unlawful sexual contact.  Following the discharge of the jury, two jurors told defense counsel that, during deliberations, Juror H. C. had expressed anti-Hispanic bias toward petitioner and petitioner's alibi witness.  Counsel, with the trial court's supervision, obtained affidavits from the two jurors describing a number of biased statements by H. C.  The court acknowledged H. C.'s apparent bias but denied petitioner's motion for a new trial on the ground that Colorado Rule of Evidence 606(b) generally prohibits a juror from testifying as to statements made during deliberations in a proceeding inquiring into the validity of the verdict.  The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed, agreeing that H. C.'s alleged statements did not fall within an exception to Rule 606(b).  The Colorado Supreme Court also affirmed, relying on Tanner v. United States, 483 U.\u00a0S. 107, and Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, both of which rejected constitutional challenges to the federal no-impeachment rule as applied to evidence of juror misconduct or bias. \nHeld:\u00a0Where a juror makes a clear statement indicating that he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that the no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of the juror's statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.  Pp.\u00a06-21.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0At common law jurors were forbidden to impeach their verdict, either by affidavit or live testimony.  Some American jurisdictions adopted a more flexible version of the no-impeachment bar, known as the \"Iowa rule,\" which prevented jurors from testifying only about their own subjective beliefs, thoughts, or motives during deliberations.  An alternative approach, later referred to as the federal approach, permitted an exception only for events extraneous to the deliberative process.  This Court's early decisions did not establish a clear preference for a particular version of the no-impeachment rule, appearing open to the Iowa rule in United States v. Reid, 12 How. 361, and Mattox v. United States, 146 U. S. 140, but rejecting that approach in McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.\u00a0S. 264.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The common-law development of the rule reached a milestone in 1975 when Congress adopted Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b), which sets out a broad no-impeachment rule, with only limited exceptions.  This version of the no-impeachment rule has substantial merit, promoting full and vigorous discussion by jurors and providing considerable assurance that after being discharged they will not be summoned to recount their deliberations or otherwise harassed.  The rule gives stability and finality to verdicts.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Some version of the no-impeachment rule is followed in every State and the District of Columbia, most of which follow the Federal Rule.  At least 16 jurisdictions have recognized an exception for juror testimony about racial bias in deliberations.  Three Federal Courts of Appeals have also held or suggested there is a constitutional exception for evidence of racial bias.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addressing the common-law no-impeachment rule, this Court noted the possibility of an exception in the \"gravest and most important cases.\"  United States v. Reid, supra, at 366; McDonald v. Pless, supra, at 269.  The Court has addressed the question whether the Constitution mandates an exception to Rule 606(b) just twice, rejecting an exception each time.  In Tanner, where the evidence showed that some jurors were under the influence of drugs and alcohol during the trial, the Court identified \"long-recognized and very substantial concerns\" supporting the no-impeachment rule.  483 U.\u00a0S., at 127.  The Court also outlined existing, significant safeguards for the defendant's right to an impartial and competent jury beyond post-trial juror testimony: members of the venire can be examined for impartiality during voir\u00a0dire; juror misconduct may be observed the court, counsel, and court personnel during the trial; and jurors themselves can report misconduct to the court before a verdict is rendered.  In Warger, a civil case where the evidence indicated that the jury forewoman failed to disclose a prodefendant bias during voir\u00a0dire, the Court again put substantial reliance on existing safeguards for a fair trial.  But the Court also warned, as in Reid and McDonald, that the no-impeachment rule may admit of exceptions for \"juror bias so extreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been abridged.\"  574 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___, n.\u00a03.  Reid, McDonald, and Warger left open the question here: whether the Constitution requires an exception to the no-impeachment rule when a juror's statements indicate that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in his or her finding of guilt.  Pp.\u00a09-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The imperative to purge racial prejudice from the administration of justice was given new force and direction by the ratification of the Civil War Amendments.  \"[T]he central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from official sources in the States.\"  McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.\u00a0S. 184, 192.  Time and again, this Court has enforced the Constitution's guarantee against state-sponsored racial discrimination in the jury system.  The Court has interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to prohibit the exclusion of jurors based on race, Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.\u00a0S. 303, 305-309; struck down laws and practices that systematically exclude racial minorities from juries, see, e.g., Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.\u00a0S. 370; ruled that no litigant may exclude a prospective juror based on race, see, e.g., Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.\u00a0S. 79; and held that defendants may at times be entitled to ask about racial bias during voir\u00a0dire, see, e.g., Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.\u00a0S. 524.  The unmistakable principle of these precedents is that discrimination on the basis of race, \"odious in all aspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of justice,\" Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.\u00a0S. 545, 555, damaging \"both the fact and the perception\" of the jury's role as \"a vital check against the wrongful exercise of power by the State,\" Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.\u00a0S. 400, 411.  Pp.\u00a013-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0This case lies at the intersection of the Court's decisions endorsing the no-impeachment rule and those seeking to eliminate racial bias in the jury system.  Those lines of precedent need not conflict.  Racial bias, unlike the behavior in McDonald, Tanner, or Warger, implicates unique historical, constitutional, and institutional concerns and, if left unaddressed, would risk systemic injury to the administration of justice.  It is also distinct in a pragmatic sense, for the Tanner safeguards may be less effective in rooting out racial bias.  But while all forms of improper bias pose challenges to the trial process, there is a sound basis to treat racial bias with added precaution.  A constitutional rule that racial bias in the justice system must be addressed--including, in some instances, after a verdict has been entered--is necessary to prevent a systemic loss of confidence in jury verdicts, a confidence that is a central premise of the Sixth Amendment trial right.  Pp.\u00a015-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0Before the no-impeachment bar can be set aside to allow further judicial inquiry, there must be a threshold showing that one or more jurors made statements exhibiting overt racial bias that cast serious doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the jury's deliberations and resulting verdict.  To qualify, the statement must tend to show that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in the juror's vote to convict.  Whether the threshold showing has been satisfied is committed to the substantial discretion of the trial court in light of all the circumstances, including the content and timing of the alleged statements and the reliability of the proffered evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The practical mechanics of acquiring and presenting such evidence will no doubt be shaped and guided by state rules of professional ethics and local court rules, both of which often limit counsel's post-trial contact with jurors.  The experience of those jurisdictions that have already recognized a racial-bias exception to the no-impeachment rule, and the experience of courts going forward, will inform the proper exercise of trial judge discretion.  The Court need not address what procedures a trial court must follow when confronted with a motion for a new trial based on juror testimony of racial bias or the appropriate standard for determining when such evidence is sufficient to require that the verdict be set aside and a new trial be granted.  Standard and existing safeguards may also help prevent racial bias in jury deliberations, including careful voir\u00a0dire and a trial court's instructions to jurors about their duty to review the evidence, deliberate together, and reach a verdict in a fair and impartial way, free from bias of any kind.

Whatever its imperfections in a particular case, the jury is a necessary check on governmental power.  The jury, over the centuries, has been an inspired, trusted, and effective instrument for resolving factual disputes and determining ultimate questions of guilt or innocence in criminal cases.  Over the long course its judgments find acceptance in the community, an acceptance essential to respect for the rule of law.  The jury is a tangible implementation of the principle that the law comes from the people.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the era of our Nation's founding, the right to a jury trial already had existed and evolved for centuries, through and alongside the common law.  The jury was considered a fundamental safeguard of individual liberty.  See The Federalist No. 83, p. 451 (B. Warner ed. 1818) (A. Hamilton).  The right to a jury trial in criminal cases was part of the Constitution as first drawn, and it was restated in the Sixth Amendment.  Art.\u00a0III, \u00a72, cl.\u00a03; Amdt. 6.  By operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, it is applicable to the States.  Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.\u00a0S. 145, 149-150 (1968).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like all human institutions, the jury system has its flaws, yet experience shows that fair and impartial verdicts can be reached if the jury follows the court's instructions and undertakes deliberations that are honest, candid, robust, and based on common sense.  A general rule has evolved to give substantial protection to verdict finality and to assure jurors that, once their verdict has been entered, it will not later be called into question based on the comments or conclusions they expressed during deliberations.  This principle, itself centuries old, is often referred to as the no-impeachment rule.  The instant case presents the question whether there is an exception to the no-impeachment rule when, after the jury is discharged, a juror comes forward with compelling evidence that another juror made clear and explicit statements indicating that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in his or her vote to convict.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0State prosecutors in Colorado brought criminal charges against petitioner, Miguel Angel Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez, based on the following allegations.  In 2007, in the bathroom of a Colorado horse-racing facility, a man sexually assaulted two teenage sisters.  The girls told their father and identified the man as an employee of the racetrack.  The police located and arrested petitioner.  Each girl separately identified petitioner as the man who had assaulted her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State charged petitioner with harassment, unlawful sexual contact, and attempted sexual assault on a child.  Before the jury was empaneled, members of the venire were repeatedly asked whether they believed that they could be fair and impartial in the case.  A written questionnaire asked if there was \"anything about you that you feel would make it difficult for you to be a fair juror.\"  App. 14.  The court repeated the question to the panel of prospective jurors and encouraged jurors to speak in private with the court if they had any concerns about their impartiality.  Defense counsel likewise asked whether anyone felt that \"this is simply not a good case\" for them to be a fair juror.  Id., at 34.  None of the empaneled jurors expressed any reservations based on racial or any other bias.  And none asked to speak with the trial judge.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After a 3-day trial, the jury found petitioner guilty of unlawful sexual contact and harassment, but it failed to reach a verdict on the attempted sexual assault charge.  When the jury was discharged, the court gave them this instruction, as mandated by Colorado law:\n\"The question may arise whether you may now discuss this case with the lawyers, defendant, or other persons.  For your guidance the court instructs you that whether you talk to anyone is entirely your own decision. .\u00a0.\u00a0. If any person persists in discussing the case over your objection, or becomes critical of your service either before or after any discussion has begun, please report it to me.\"  Id., at 85-86.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the discharge of the jury, petitioner's counsel entered the jury room to discuss the trial with the jurors.  As the room was emptying, two jurors remained to speak with counsel in private.  They stated that, during deliberations, another juror had expressed anti-Hispanic bias toward petitioner and petitioner's alibi witness.  Petitioner's counsel reported this to the court and, with the court's supervision, obtained sworn affidavits from the two jurors.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The affidavits by the two jurors described a number of biased statements made by another juror, identified as Juror H.\u00a0C.  According to the two jurors, H.\u00a0C. told the other jurors that he \"believed the defendant was guilty because, in [H.\u00a0C.'s] experience as an ex-law enforcement officer, Mexican men had a bravado that caused them to believe they could do whatever they wanted with women.\"  Id., at 110.  The jurors reported that H.\u00a0C. stated his belief that Mexican men are physically controlling of women because of their sense of entitlement, and further stated, \"\u00a0'I think he did it because he's Mexican and Mexican men take whatever they want.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 109.  According to the jurors, H.\u00a0C. further explained that, in his experience, \"nine times out of ten Mexican men were guilty of being aggressive toward women and young girls.\"  Id., at 110.  Finally, the jurors recounted that Juror H.\u00a0C. said that he did not find petitioner's alibi witness credible because, among other things, the witness was \"\u00a0'an illegal.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  (In fact, the witness testified during trial that he was a legal resident of the United States.)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After reviewing the affidavits, the trial court acknowledged H.\u00a0C.'s apparent bias.  But the court denied petitioner's motion for a new trial, noting that \"[t]he actual deliberations that occur among the jurors are protected from inquiry under [Colorado Rule of Evidence] 606(b).\"  Id., at 90.  Like its federal counterpart, Colorado's Rule 606(b) generally prohibits a juror from testifying as to any statement made during deliberations in a proceeding inquiring into the validity of the verdict.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 606(b).  The Colorado Rule reads as follows:\n\"(b) Inquiry into validity of verdict or indictment.   Upon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations or to the effect of anything upon his or any other juror's mind or emotions as influencing him to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning his mental processes in connection therewith.  But a juror may testify about (1) whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jurors' attention, (2) whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror, or (3) whether there was a mistake in entering the verdict onto the verdict form.  A juror's affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror may not be received on a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying.\"  Colo. Rule Evid. 606(b) (2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The verdict deemed final, petitioner was sentenced to two years' probation and was required to register as a sex offender.  A divided panel of the Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed petitioner's conviction, agreeing that H.\u00a0C.'s alleged statements did not fall within an exception to Rule 606(b) and so were inadmissible to undermine the validity of the verdict.  ___ P.\u00a03d ___, 2012 WL 5457362.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Colorado Supreme Court affirmed by a vote of 4 to 3.  350 P.\u00a03d 287 (2015).  The prevailing opinion relied on two decisions of this Court rejecting constitutional challenges to the federal no-impeachment rule as applied to evidence of juror misconduct or bias.  See Tanner v. United States, 483 U.\u00a0S. 107 (1987); Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).  After reviewing those precedents, the court could find no \"dividing line between different types of juror bias or misconduct,\" and thus no basis for permitting impeachment of the verdicts in petitioner's trial, notwithstanding H.\u00a0C.'s apparent racial bias.  350 P.\u00a03d, at 293.  This Court granted certiorari to decide whether there is a constitutional exception to the no-impeachment rule for instances of racial bias.  578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Juror H.\u00a0C.'s bias was based on petitioner's Hispanic identity, which the Court in prior cases has referred to as ethnicity, and that may be an instructive term here.  See, e.g., Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.\u00a0S. 352, 355 (1991) (plurality opinion).  Yet we have also used the language of race when discussing the relevant constitutional principles in cases involving Hispanic persons.  See, e.g., ibid.; Fisher v. University of Tex. at Austin, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013); Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.\u00a0S. 182, 189-190 (1981) (plurality opinion).  Petitioner and respondent both refer to race, or to race and ethnicity, in this more expansive sense in their briefs to the Court.  This opinion refers to the nature of the bias as racial in keeping with the primary terminology employed by the parties and used in our precedents.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At common law jurors were forbidden to impeach their verdict, either by affidavit or live testimony.  This rule originated in Vaise v. Delaval, 1 T. R. 11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B. 1785).  There, Lord Mansfield excluded juror testimony that the jury had decided the case through a game of chance.  The Mansfield rule, as it came to be known, prohibited jurors, after the verdict was entered, from testifying either about their subjective mental processes or about objective events that occurred during deliberations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0American courts adopted the Mansfield rule as a matter of common law, though not in every detail.  Some jurisdictions adopted a different, more flexible version of the no-impeachment bar known as the \"Iowa rule.\"  Under that rule, jurors were prevented only from testifying about their own subjective beliefs, thoughts, or motives during deliberations.  See Wright v. Illinois & Miss. Tel. Co., 20 Iowa 195 (1866).  Jurors could, however, testify about objective facts and events occurring during deliberations, in part because other jurors could corroborate that  testimony.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An alternative approach, later referred to as the federal approach, stayed closer to the original Mansfield rule.  See Warger, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5).  Under this version of the rule, the no-impeachment bar permitted an exception only for testimony about events extraneous to the deliberative process, such as reliance on outside evidence--newspapers, dictionaries, and the like--or personal investigation of the facts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's early decisions did not establish a clear preference for a particular version of the no-impeachment rule.  In United States v. Reid, 12 How. 361 (1852), the Court appeared open to the admission of juror testimony that the jurors had consulted newspapers during deliberations, but in the end it barred the evidence because the newspapers \"had not the slightest influence\" on the verdict.  Id., at 366.  The Reid Court warned that juror testimony \"ought always to be received with great caution.\"  Ibid.  Yet it added an important admonition: \"cases might arise in which it would be impossible to refuse\" juror testimony \"without violating the plainest principles of justice.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a following case the Court required the admission of juror affidavits stating that the jury consulted information that was not in evidence, including a prejudicial newspaper article.  Mattox v. United States, 146 U.\u00a0S. 140, 151 (1892).  The Court suggested, furthermore, that the admission of juror testimony might be governed by a more flexible rule, one permitting jury testimony even where it did not involve consultation of prejudicial extraneous information.  Id., at 148-149; see also Hyde v. United States, 225 U.\u00a0S. 347, 382-384 (1912) (stating that the more flexible Iowa rule \"should apply,\" but excluding evidence that the jury reached the verdict by trading certain defendants' acquittals for others' convictions).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later, however, the Court rejected the more lenient Iowa rule.  In McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.\u00a0S. 264 (1915), the Court affirmed the exclusion of juror testimony about objective events in the jury room.  There, the jury allegedly had calculated a damages award by averaging the numerical submissions of each member.  Id., at 265-266.  As the Court explained, admitting that evidence would have \"dangerous consequences\": \"no verdict would be safe\" and the practice would \"open the door to the most pernicious arts and tampering with jurors.\"  Id., at 268 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Yet the Court reiterated its admonition from Reid, again cautioning that the no-impeachment rule might recognize exceptions \"in the gravest and most important cases\" where exclusion of juror affidavits might well violate \"the plainest principles of justice.\"  238 U.\u00a0S., at 269 (quoting Reid, supra, at 366; internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The common-law development of the no-impeachment rule reached a milestone in 1975, when Congress adopted the Federal Rules of Evidence, including Rule 606(b).  Congress, like the McDonald Court, rejected the Iowa rule.  Instead it endorsed a broad no-impeachment rule, with only limited exceptions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The version of the rule that Congress adopted was \"no accident.\"  Warger, 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  The Advisory Committee at first drafted a rule reflecting the Iowa approach, prohibiting admission of juror testimony only as it related to jurors' mental processes in reaching a verdict.  The Department of Justice, however, expressed concern over the preliminary rule.  The Advisory Committee then drafted the more stringent version now in effect, prohibiting all juror testimony, with exceptions only where the jury had considered prejudicial extraneous evidence or was subject to other outside influence.  Rules of Evidence for United States Courts and Magistrates, 56 F.\u00a0R.\u00a0D. 183, 265 (1972).  The Court adopted this second version and transmitted it to Congress.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The House favored the Iowa approach, but the Senate expressed concern that it did not sufficiently address the public policy interest in the finality of verdicts.  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 93-1277, pp.\u00a013-14 (1974).  Siding with the Senate, the Conference Committee adopted, Congress enacted, and the President signed the Court's proposed rule.  The substance of the Rule has not changed since 1975, except for a 2006 modification permitting evidence of a clerical mistake on the verdict form.  See 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The current version of Rule 606(b) states as follows:\n\"(1) Prohibited Testimony or Other Evidence. During an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify about any statement made or incident that occurred during the jury's deliberations; the effect of anything on that juror's or another juror's vote; or any juror's mental processes concerning the verdict or indictment.  The court may not receive a juror's affidavit or evidence of a juror's statement on these matters.\n\"(2) Exceptions.  A juror may testify about whether:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(A) extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the jury's attention;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(B) an outside influence was improperly brought to bear on any juror; or\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(C) a mistake was made in entering the verdict on the verdict form.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This version of the no-impeachment rule has substantial merit.  It promotes full and vigorous discussion by providing jurors with considerable assurance that after being discharged they will not be summoned to recount their deliberations, and they will not otherwise be harassed or annoyed by litigants seeking to challenge the verdict.  The rule gives stability and finality to verdicts.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some version of the no-impeachment rule is followed in every State and the District of Columbia.  Variations make classification imprecise, but, as a general matter, it appears that 42 jurisdictions follow the Federal Rule, while 9 follow the Iowa Rule.  Within both classifications there is a diversity of approaches.  Nine jurisdictions that follow the Federal Rule have codified exceptions other than those listed in Federal Rule 606(b).  See Appendix, infra.  At least 16 jurisdictions, 11 of which follow the Federal Rule, have recognized an exception to the no-impeachment bar under the circumstances the Court faces here: juror testimony that racial bias played a part in deliberations.  Ibid.  According to the parties and amici, only one State other than Colorado has addressed this issue and declined to recognize an exception for racial bias.  See Commonwealth v. Steele, 599 Pa. 341, 377-379, 961 A.\u00a02d 786, 807-808 (2012).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The federal courts, for their part, are governed by Federal Rule 606(b), but their interpretations deserve further comment.  Various Courts of Appeals have had occasion to consider a racial bias exception and have reached different conclusions.  Three have held or suggested there is a constitutional exception for evidence of racial bias.  See United States v. Villar, 586 F.\u00a03d 76, 87-88 (CA1 2009) (holding the Constitution demands a racial-bias exception); United States v. Henley, 238 F.\u00a03d 1111, 1119-1121 (CA9 2001) (finding persuasive arguments in favor of an exception but not deciding the issue); Shillcutt v. Gagnon, 827 F.\u00a02d 1155, 1158-1160 (CA7 1987) (observing that in some cases fundamental fairness could require an exception).  One Court of Appeals has declined to find an exception, reasoning that other safeguards inherent in the trial process suffice to protect defendants' constitutional interests.  See United States v. Benally, 546 F.\u00a03d 1230, 1240-1241 (CA10 2008).  Another has suggested as much, holding in the habeas context that an exception for racial bias was not clearly established but indicating in dicta that no such exception exists.  See Williams v. Price, 343 F.\u00a03d 223, 237-239 (CA3 2003) (Alito, J.).  And one Court of Appeals has held that evidence of racial bias is excluded by Rule 606(b), without addressing whether the Constitution may at times demand an exception.  See Martinez v. Food City, Inc., 658 F.\u00a02d 369, 373-374 (CA5 1981).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addressing the scope of the common-law no-impeachment rule before Rule 606(b)'s adoption, the Reid and McDonald Courts noted the possibility of an exception to the rule in the \"gravest and most important cases.\"  Reid, 12 How., at 366; McDonald, 238 U.\u00a0S., at 269.  Yet since the enactment of Rule 606(b), the Court has addressed the precise question whether the Constitution mandates an exception to it in just two instances.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its first case, Tanner, 483 U.\u00a0S. 107, the Court rejected a Sixth Amendment exception for evidence that some jurors were under the influence of drugs and alcohol during the trial.  Id., at 125.  Central to the Court's reasoning were the \"long-recognized and very substantial concerns\" supporting \"the protection of jury deliberations from intrusive inquiry.\"  Id., at 127.  The Tanner Court echoed McDonald's concern that, if attorneys could use juror testimony to attack verdicts, jurors would be \"harassed and beset by the defeated party,\" thus destroying \"all frankness and freedom of discussion and conference.\"  483 U. S., at 120 (quoting McDonald, supra, at 267-268).  The Court was concerned, moreover, that attempts to impeach a verdict would \"disrupt the finality of the process\" and undermine both \"jurors' willingness to return an unpopular verdict\" and \"the community's trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople.\"  483 U.\u00a0S., at 120-121.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tanner Court outlined existing, significant safeguards for the defendant's right to an impartial and competent jury beyond post-trial juror testimony.  At the outset of the trial process, voir\u00a0dire provides an opportunity for the court and counsel to examine members of the venire for impartiality.  As a trial proceeds, the court, counsel, and court personnel have some opportunity to learn of any juror misconduct.  And, before the verdict, jurors themselves can report misconduct to the court.  These procedures do not undermine the stability of a verdict once rendered.  Even after the trial, evidence of misconduct other than juror testimony can be used to attempt to impeach the verdict.  Id., at 127.  Balancing these interests and safeguards against the defendant's Sixth Amendment interest in that case, the Court affirmed the exclusion of affidavits pertaining to the jury's inebriated state.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second case to consider the general issue presented here was Warger, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___.  The Court again rejected the argument that, in the circumstances there, the jury trial right required an exception to the no-impeachment rule.  Warger involved a civil case where, after the verdict was entered, the losing party sought to proffer evidence that the jury forewoman had failed to disclose prodefendant bias during voir\u00a0dire.  As in Tanner, the Court put substantial reliance on existing safeguards for a fair trial.  The Court stated: \"Even if jurors lie in voir\u00a0dire in a way that conceals bias, juror impartiality is adequately assured by the parties' ability to bring to the court's attention any evidence of bias before the verdict is rendered, and to employ nonjuror evidence even after the verdict is rendered.\"  574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Warger, however, the Court did reiterate that the no-impeachment rule may admit exceptions.  As in Reid and McDonald, the Court warned of \"juror bias so extreme that, almost by definition, the jury trial right has been abridged.\"  574 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___, n.\u00a03 (slip op., at 10-11, n.\u00a03).  \"If and when such a case arises,\" the Court indicated it would \"consider whether the usual safeguards are or are not sufficient to protect the integrity of the process.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The recognition in Warger that there may be extreme cases where the jury trial right requires an exception to the no-impeachment rule must be interpreted in context as a guarded, cautious statement.  This caution is warranted to avoid formulating an exception that might undermine the jury dynamics and finality interests the no-impeachment rule seeks to protect.  Today, however, the Court faces the question that Reid, McDonald, and Warger left open.  The Court must decide whether the Constitution requires an exception to the no-impeachment rule when a juror's statements indicate that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in his or her finding of guilt.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It must become the heritage of our Nation to rise above racial classifications that are so inconsistent with our commitment to the equal dignity of all persons.  This imperative to purge racial prejudice from the administration of justice was given new force and direction by the ratification of the Civil War Amendments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"[T]he central purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment was to eliminate racial discrimination emanating from official sources in the States.\"  McLaughlin v. Florida, 379 U.\u00a0S. 184, 192 (1964).  In the years before and after the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, it became clear that racial discrimination in the jury system posed a particular threat both to the promise of the Amendment and to the integrity of the jury trial.  \"Almost immediately after the Civil War, the South began a practice that would continue for many decades: All-white juries punished black defendants particularly harshly, while simultaneously refusing to punish violence by whites, including Ku Klux Klan members, against blacks and Republicans.\"  Forman, Juries and Race in the Nineteenth Century, 113 Yale L.\u00a0J. 895, 909-910 (2004).  To take one example, just in the years 1865 and 1866, all-white juries in Texas decided a total of 500 prosecutions of white defendants charged with killing African-Americans.  All 500 were acquitted.  Id., at 916.  The stark and unapologetic nature of race-motivated outcomes challenged the American belief that \"the jury was a bulwark of liberty,\" id., at 909, and prompted Congress to pass legislation to integrate the jury system and to bar persons from eligibility for jury service if they had conspired to deny the civil rights of African-Americans, id., at 920-930.  Members of Congress stressed that the legislation was necessary to preserve the right to a fair trial and to guarantee the equal protection of the laws.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The duty to confront racial animus in the justice system is not the legislature's alone.  Time and again, this Court has been called upon to enforce the Constitution's guarantee against state-sponsored racial discrimination in the jury system.  Beginning in 1880, the Court interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment to prohibit the exclusion of jurors on the basis of race.  Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.\u00a0S. 303, 305-309 (1880).  The Court has repeatedly struck down laws and practices that systematically exclude racial minorities from juries.  See, e.g., Neal v. Delaware, 103 U.\u00a0S. 370 (1881); Hollins v. Oklahoma, 295 U.\u00a0S. 394 (1935) (per curiam); Avery v. Georgia, 345 U.\u00a0S. 559 (1953); Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.\u00a0S. 475 (1954); Castaneda v. Partida, 430 U.\u00a0S. 482 (1977).  To guard against discrimination in jury selection, the Court has ruled that no litigant may exclude a prospective juror on the basis of race.  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.\u00a0S. 79 (1986); Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., 500 U.\u00a0S. 614 (1991); Georgia v. McCollum, 505 U.\u00a0S. 42 (1992).  In an effort to ensure that individuals who sit on juries are free of racial bias, the Court has held that the Constitution at times demands that defendants be permitted to ask questions about racial bias during voir\u00a0dire.  Ham v. South Carolina, 409 U.\u00a0S. 524 (1973); Rosales-Lopez, 451 U.\u00a0S. 182; Turner v. Murray, 476 U.\u00a0S. 28 (1986).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The unmistakable principle underlying these precedents is that discrimination on the basis of race, \"odious in all aspects, is especially pernicious in the administration of justice.\"  Rose v. Mitchell, 443 U.\u00a0S. 545, 555 (1979).  The jury is to be \"a criminal defendant's fundamental 'protection of life and liberty against race or color prejudice.'\u00a0\"  McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.\u00a0S. 279, 310 (1987) (quoting Strauder, supra, at 309).  Permitting racial prejudice in the jury system damages \"both the fact and the perception\" of the jury's role as \"a vital check against the wrongful exercise of power by the State.\"  Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.\u00a0S. 400, 411 (1991); cf. Aldridge v. United States, 283 U.\u00a0S. 308, 315 (1931); Buck v. Davis, ante, at 22.\nIV\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case lies at the intersection of the Court's decisions endorsing the no-impeachment rule and its decisions seeking to eliminate racial bias in the jury system.  The two lines of precedent, however, need not conflict.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Racial bias of the kind alleged in this case differs in critical ways from the compromise verdict in McDonald, the drug and alcohol abuse in Tanner, or the pro-defendant bias in Warger.  The behavior in those cases is troubling and unacceptable, but each involved anomalous behavior from a single jury--or juror--gone off course.  Jurors are presumed to follow their oath, cf. Penry v. Johnson, 532 U.\u00a0S. 782, 799 (2001), and neither history nor common experience show that the jury system is rife with mischief of these or similar kinds.  To attempt to rid the jury of every irregularity of this sort would be to expose it to unrelenting scrutiny.  \"It is not at all clear\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. that the jury system could survive such efforts to perfect it.\"  Tanner, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 120.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same cannot be said about racial bias, a familiar and recurring evil that, if left unaddressed, would risk systemic injury to the administration of justice.  This Court's decisions demonstrate that racial bias implicates unique historical, constitutional, and institutional concerns.  An effort to address the most grave and serious statements of racial bias is not an effort to perfect the jury but to ensure that our legal system remains capable of coming ever closer to the promise of equal treatment under the law that is so central to a functioning democracy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Racial bias is distinct in a pragmatic sense as well.  In past cases this Court has relied on other safeguards to protect the right to an impartial jury.  Some of those safeguards, to be sure, can disclose racial bias.  Voir\u00a0dire at the outset of trial, observation of juror demeanor and conduct during trial,  juror reports before the verdict, and nonjuror evidence after trial are important mechanisms for discovering bias.  Yet their operation may be compromised, or they may prove insufficient.  For instance, this Court has noted the dilemma faced by trial court judges and counsel in deciding whether to explore potential racial bias at voir\u00a0dire.  See Rosales-Lopez, supra; Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.\u00a0S. 589 (1976).  Generic questions about juror impartiality may not expose specific attitudes or biases that can poison jury deliberations.  Yet more pointed questions \"could well exacerbate whatever prejudice might exist without substantially aiding in exposing it.\"  Rosales-Lopez, supra, at 195 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in result).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The stigma that attends racial bias may make it difficult for a juror to report inappropriate statements during the course of juror deliberations.  It is one thing to accuse a fellow juror of having a personal experience that improperly influences her consideration of the case, as would have been required in Warger.  It is quite another to call her a bigot.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The recognition that certain of the Tanner safeguards may be less effective in rooting out racial bias than other kinds of bias is not dispositive.  All forms of improper bias pose challenges to the trial process.  But there is a sound basis to treat racial bias with added precaution.  A constitutional rule that racial bias in the justice system must be addressed--including, in some instances, after the verdict has been entered--is necessary to prevent a systemic loss of confidence in jury verdicts, a confidence that is a central premise of the Sixth Amendment trial right.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons explained above, the Court now holds that where a juror makes a clear statement that indicates he or she relied on racial stereotypes or animus to convict a criminal defendant, the Sixth Amendment requires that the no-impeachment rule give way in order to permit the trial court to consider the evidence of the juror's statement and any resulting denial of the jury trial guarantee.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not every offhand comment indicating racial bias or hostility will justify setting aside the no-impeachment bar to allow further judicial inquiry.  For the inquiry to proceed, there must be a showing that one or more jurors made statements exhibiting overt racial bias that cast serious doubt on the fairness and impartiality of the jury's deliberations and resulting verdict.  To qualify, the statement must tend to show that racial animus was a significant motivating factor in the juror's vote to convict.  Whether that threshold showing has been satisfied is a matter committed to the substantial discretion of the trial court in light of all the circumstances, including the content and timing of the alleged statements and the reliability of the proffered evidence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The practical mechanics of acquiring and presenting such evidence will no doubt be shaped and guided by state rules of professional ethics and local court rules, both of which often limit counsel's post-trial contact with jurors.  See 27 C. Wright & V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a76076, pp. 580-583 (2d ed. 2007) (Wright); see also Variations of ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 3.5 (Sept. 15, 2016) (overview of state ethics rules); 2 Jurywork Systematic Techniques \u00a713:18 (2016-2017) (overview of Federal District Court rules).  These limits seek to provide jurors some protection when they return to their daily affairs after the verdict has been entered.  But while a juror can always tell counsel they do not wish to discuss the case, jurors in some instances may come forward of their own accord.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is what happened here.  In this case the alleged statements by a juror were egregious and unmistakable in their reliance on racial bias.  Not only did juror H.\u00a0C. deploy a dangerous racial stereotype to conclude petitioner was guilty and his alibi witness should not be believed, but he also encouraged other jurors to join him in convicting on that basis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner's counsel did not seek out the two jurors' allegations of racial bias.  Pursuant to Colorado's mandatory jury instruction, the trial court had set limits on juror contact and encouraged jurors to inform the court if anyone harassed them about their role in the case.  Similar limits on juror contact can be found in other jurisdictions that recognize a racial-bias exception.  See, e.g., Fla. Standard Jury Instrs. in Crim. Cases No. 4.2 (West 2016) (\"Although you are at liberty to speak with anyone about your deliberations, you are also at liberty to refuse to speak to anyone\"); Mass. Office of Jury Comm'r, Trial Juror's Handbook (Dec. 2015) (\"You are not required to speak with anyone once the trial is over.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. If anyone tries to learn this confidential information from you, or if you feel harassed or embarrassed in any way, you should report it to the court . . . immediately\"); N.\u00a0J. Crim. Model Jury Charges, Non 2C Charges, Dismissal of Jury (2014) (\"It will be up to each of you to decide whether to speak about your service as a juror\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With the understanding that they were under no obligation to speak out, the jurors approached petitioner's counsel, within a short time after the verdict, to relay their concerns about H.\u00a0C.'s statements.  App. 77.  A similar pattern is common in cases involving juror allegations of racial bias.  See, e.g., Villar, 586 F.\u00a03d, at 78 (juror e-mailed defense counsel within hours of the verdict); Kittle v. United States, 65 A. 3d 1144, 1147 (D.\u00a0C. 2013) (juror wrote a letter to the judge the same day the court discharged the jury); Benally, 546 F.\u00a03d, at 1231 (juror approached defense counsel the day after the jury announced its verdict).  Pursuant to local court rules, petitioner's counsel then sought and received permission from the court to contact the two jurors and obtain affidavits limited to recounting the exact statements made by H.\u00a0C. that exhibited racial bias.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the trial court concluded that Colorado's Rule 606(b) did not permit it even to consider the resulting affidavits, the Court's holding today removes that bar.  When jurors disclose an instance of racial bias as serious as the one involved in this case, the law must not wholly disregard its occurrence.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the preceding discussion makes clear, the Court relies on the experiences of the 17 jurisdictions that have recognized a racial-bias exception to the no-impeachment rule--some for over half a century--with no signs of an increase in juror harassment or a loss of juror willingness to engage in searching and candid deliberations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The experience of these jurisdictions, and the experience of the courts going forward, will inform the proper exercise of trial judge discretion in these and related matters.  This case does not ask, and the Court need not address, what procedures a trial court must follow when confronted with a motion for a new trial based on juror testimony of racial bias.  See 27 Wright 575-578 (noting a divergence of authority over the necessity and scope of an evidentiary hearing on alleged juror misconduct).  The Court also does not decide the appropriate standard for determining when evidence of racial bias is sufficient to require that the verdict be set aside and a new trial be granted.  Compare, e.g., Shillcutt, 827 F.\u00a02d, at 1159 (inquiring whether racial bias \"pervaded the jury room\"), with, e.g., Henley, 238 F.\u00a03d, at 1120 (\"One racist juror would be enough\").\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is proper to observe as well that there are standard and existing processes designed to prevent racial bias in jury deliberations.  The advantages of careful voir\u00a0dire have already been noted.  And other safeguards deserve mention.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trial courts, often at the outset of the case and again in their final jury instructions, explain the jurors' duty to review the evidence and reach a verdict in a fair and impartial way, free from bias of any kind.  Some instructions are framed by trial judges based on their own learning and experience.  Model jury instructions likely take into account these continuing developments and are common across jurisdictions.  See, e.g., 1A K. O'Malley, J. Grenig, & W. Lee, Federal Jury Practice and Instructions, Criminal \u00a710:01, p. 22 (6th ed. 2008) (\"Perform these duties fairly.  Do not let any bias, sympathy or prejudice that you may feel toward one side or the other influence your decision in any way\").  Instructions may emphasize the group dynamic of deliberations by urging jurors to share their questions and conclusions with their colleagues.  See, e.g., id., \u00a720:01, at 841 (\"It is your duty as jurors to consult with one another and to deliberate with one another with a view towards reaching an agreement if you can do so without violence to individual judgment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Probing and thoughtful deliberation improves the likelihood that other jurors can confront the flawed nature of reasoning that is prompted or influenced by improper biases, whether racial or otherwise.  These dynamics can help ensure that the exception is limited to rare cases.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Nation must continue to make strides to overcome race-based discrimination.  The progress that has already been made underlies the Court's insistence that blatant racial prejudice is antithetical to the functioning of the jury system and must be confronted in egregious cases like this one despite the general bar of the no-impeachment rule.  It is the mark of a maturing legal system that it seeks to understand and to implement the lessons of history.  The Court now seeks to strengthen the broader principle that society can and must move forward by achieving the thoughtful, rational dialogue at the foundation of both the jury system and the free society that sustains our Constitution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Supreme Court of Colorado is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\nAPPENDIX \nCodified Exceptions in Addition to Those Enumerated in Fed.

COLORADO\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of colorado\n[March 6, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today holds that the Sixth Amendment requires the States to provide a criminal defendant the opportunity to impeach a jury's guilty verdict with juror testimony about a juror's alleged racial bias, notwithstanding a state procedural rule forbidding such testimony.  I agree with Justice Alito that the Court's decision is incompatible with the text of the Amendment it purports to interpret and with our precedents.  I write separately to explain that the Court's holding also cannot be squared with the original understanding of the Sixth or Fourteenth Amendments.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Amendment's protection of the right, \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\" to a \"trial, by an impartial jury,\" is limited to the protections that existed at common law when the Amendment was ratified.  See, e.g., Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.\u00a0S. 466, 500, and n.\u00a01 (2000) (Thomas, J., concurring); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a71773, pp. 652-653 (1833) (Story) (explaining that \"the trial by jury in criminal cases\" protected by the Constitution is the same \"great privilege\" that was \"a part of that admirable common law\" of England); cf. 5 St. G. Tucker, Blackstone's Commentaries 349, n.\u00a02 (1803).  It is therefore \"entirely proper to look to the common law\" to ascertain whether the Sixth Amendment requires the result the Court today reaches.  Apprendi, supra, at 500, n.\u00a01.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Amendment's specific guarantee of impartiality incorporates the common-law understanding of that term.  See, e.g., 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 365 (1769) (Blackstone) (describing English trials as \"impartially just\" because of their \"caution against all partiality and bias\" in the jury).  The common law required a juror to have \"freedome of mind\" and to be \"indifferent as hee stands unsworne.\"  1 E. Coke, First Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England \u00a7234, p. 155a (16th ed. 1809); accord, 3 M. Bacon, A New Abridgment of the Law 258 (3d ed. 1768); cf. T. Cooley, A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations Which Rest Upon the Legislative Power of the States of the American Union 319 (1868) (\"The jury must be indifferent between the prisoner and the commonwealth\").  Impartial jurors could \"have no interest of their own affected, and no personal bias, or pre-possession, in favor [of] or against either party.\"  Pettis v. Warren, 1 Kirby 426, 427 (Conn. Super. 1788).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The common-law right to a jury trial did not, however, guarantee a defendant the right to impeach a jury verdict with juror testimony about juror misconduct, including \"a principal species of [juror] misbehaviour\"--\"notorious partiality.\"  3 Blackstone 388.  Although partiality was a ground for setting aside a jury verdict, ibid., the English common-law rule at the time the Sixth Amendment was ratified did not allow jurors to supply evidence of that misconduct.  In 1770, Lord Mansfield refused to receive a juror's affidavit to impeach a verdict, declaring that such an affidavit \"can't be read.\"  Rex v. Almon, 5 Burr. 2687, 98 Eng. Rep. 411 (K. B.).  And in 1785, Lord Mansfield solidified the doctrine, holding that \"[t]he Court [could not] receive such an affidavit from any of the jurymen\" to prove that the jury had cast lots to reach a verdict.  Vaise v. Delaval, 1 T. R. 11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B.).1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the time of the founding, the States took mixed approaches to this issue.  See Cluggage v. Swan, 4 Binn. 150, 156 (Pa. 1811) (opinion of Yeates, J.) (\"The opinions of American judges .\u00a0.\u00a0. have greatly differed on the point in question\"); Bishop v. Georgia, 9 Ga. 121, 126 (1850) (describing the common law in 1776 on this question as \"in a transition state\").  Many States followed Lord Mansfield's no-impeachment rule and refused to receive juror affidavits.  See, e.g., Brewster v. Thompson, 1 N.\u00a0J.\u00a0L. 32 (1790) (per curiam); Robbins v. Windover, 2 Tyl. 11, 14 (Vt. 1802); Taylor v. Giger, 3 Ky. 586, 597-598 (1808); Price v. McIlvain, 2 Tread. 503, 504 (S.\u00a0C. 1815); Tyler v. Stevens, 4 N.\u00a0H. 116, 117 (1827); 1 Z. Swift, A Digest of the Laws of the State of Connecticut 775 (1822) (\"In England, and in the courts of the United States, jurors are not permitted to be witnesses respecting the misconduct of the jury .\u00a0.\u00a0. and this is, most unquestionably, the correct principle\").  Some States, however, permitted juror affidavits about juror misconduct.  See, e.g., Crawford v. State, 10 Tenn. 60, 68 (1821); Cochran v. Street, 1 Va. 79, 81 (1792).  And others initially permitted such evidence but quickly reversed course.  Compare, e.g., Smith v. Cheetham, 3 Cai. R. 57, 59-60 (N.\u00a0Y. 1805) (opinion of Livingston, J.) (permitting juror testimony), with Dana v. Tucker, 4 Johns. 487, 488-489 (N.\u00a0Y. 1809) (per curiam) (overturning Cheetham); compare also Bradley's Lessee v. Bradley, 4 Dall. 112 (Pa. 1792) (permitting juror affidavits), with, e.g., Cluggage, supra, at 156-158 (opinion of Yeates, J.) (explaining that Bradley was incorrectly reported and rejecting affidavits); compare also Talmadge v. Northrop, 1 Root 522 (Conn. 1793) (admitting juror testimony), with State v. Freeman, 5 Conn. 348, 350-352 (1824) (\"The opinion of almost the whole legal world is adverse to the reception of the testimony in question; and, in my opinion, on invincible foundations\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By the time the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, Lord Mansfield's no-impeachment rule had become firmly entrenched in American law.  See Lettow, New Trial for Verdict Against Law: Judge-Jury Relations in Early-Nineteenth Century America, 71 Notre Dame L.\u00a0Rev. 505, 536 (1996) (\"[O]pponents of juror affidavits had largely won out by the middle of the century\"); 8 J. Wigmore, Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a72352, p. 697 (J. McNaughton rev. 1961) (Wigmore) (Lord Mansfield's rule \"came to receive in the United States an adherence almost unquestioned\"); J. Proffatt, A Treatise on Trial by Jury \u00a7408, p. 467 (1877) (\"It is a well established rule of law that no affidavit shall be received from a juror to impeach his verdict\").  The vast majority of States adopted the no-impeachment rule as a matter of common law.  See, e.g., Bull v. Commonwealth, 55 Va. 613, 627-628 (1857) (\"[T]he practice appears to be now generally settled, to reject the testimony of jurors when offered to impeach their verdict. The cases on the subject are too numerous to be cited\"); Tucker v. Town Council of South Kingstown, 5 R.\u00a0I. 558, 560 (1859) (collecting cases); State v. Coupenhaver, 39 Mo. 430 (1867) (\"The law is well settled that a traverse juror cannot be a witness to prove misbehavior in the jury in regard to their verdict\"); Peck v. Brewer, 48 Ill. 54, 63 (1868) (\"So far back as .\u00a0.\u00a0. 1823, the doctrine was held that the affidavits of jurors cannot be heard to impeach their verdict\"); Heffron v. Gallupe, 55 Me. 563, 566 (1868) (ruling inadmissible \"depositions of .\u00a0.\u00a0. jurors as to what transpired in the jury room\"); Withers v. Fiscus, 40 Ind. 131, 131-132 (1872) (\"In the United States it seems to be settled, notwithstanding a few adjudications to the contrary .\u00a0.\u00a0. , that such affidavits cannot be received\").2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today acknowledges that the States \"adopted the Mansfield rule as a matter of common law,\" ante, at 6, but ascribes no significance to that fact.  I would hold that it is dispositive.  Our common-law history does not establish that--in either 1791 (when the Sixth Amendment was ratified) or 1868 (when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified)--a defendant had the right to impeach a verdict with juror testimony of juror misconduct.  In fact, it strongly suggests that such evidence was prohibited.  In the absence of a definitive common-law tradition permitting impeachment by juror testimony, we have no basis to invoke a constitutional provision that merely \"follow[s] out the established course of the common law in all trials for crimes,\" 3 Story \u00a71785, at 662, to overturn Colorado's decision to preserve the no-impeachment rule, cf. Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.\u00a0S. 723, 832-833 (2008) (Scalia, J., dissenting).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps good reasons exist to curtail or abandon the no-impeachment rule.  Some States have done so, see Appendix to majority opinion, ante, and others have not.  Ultimately, that question is not for us to decide.  It should be left to the political process described by Justice Alito.  See post, at 5-7 (dissenting opinion).  In its attempt to stimulate a \"thoughtful, rational dialogue\" on race relations, ante, at 21, the Court today ends the political process and imposes a uniform, national rule.  The Constitution does not require such a rule.  Neither should we.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent.\n\nAlito, J., dissenting\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-606\nMIGUEL ANGEL PENA-RODRIGUEZ, PETITIONER v. COLORADO\non writ of certiorari to the supreme court of colorado\n[March 6, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Thomas join, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our legal system has many rules that restrict the admission of evidence of statements made under circumstances in which confidentiality is thought to be essential.  Statements made to an attorney in obtaining legal advice, statements to a treating physician, and statements made to a spouse or member of the clergy are familiar examples.  See Trammel v. United States, 445 U.\u00a0S. 40, 51 (1980).  Even if a criminal defendant whose constitutional rights are at stake has a critical need to obtain and introduce evidence of such statements, long-established rules stand in the way.  The goal of avoiding interference with confidential communications of great value has long been thought to justify the loss of important evidence and the effect on our justice system that this loss entails.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The present case concerns a rule like those just mentioned, namely, the age-old rule against attempting to overturn or \"impeach\" a jury's verdict by offering statements made by jurors during the course of deliberations.  For centuries, it has been the judgment of experienced judges, trial attorneys, scholars, and lawmakers that allowing jurors to testify after a trial about what took place in the jury room would undermine the system of trial by jury that is integral to our legal system.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Juries occupy a unique place in our justice system.  The other participants in a trial--the presiding judge, the attorneys, the witnesses--function in an arena governed by strict rules of law.  Their every word is recorded and may be closely scrutinized for missteps.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When jurors retire to deliberate, however, they enter a space that is not regulated in the same way.  Jurors are ordinary people.  They are expected to speak, debate, argue, and make decisions the way ordinary people do in their daily lives.  Our Constitution places great value on this way of thinking, speaking, and deciding.  The jury trial right protects parties in court cases from being judged by a special class of trained professionals who do not speak the language of ordinary people and may not understand or appreciate the way ordinary people live their lives.  To protect that right, the door to the jury room has been locked, and the confidentiality of jury deliberations has been closely guarded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, with the admirable intention of providing justice for one criminal defendant, the Court not only pries open the door; it rules that respecting the privacy of the jury room, as our legal system has done for centuries, violates the Constitution.  This is a startling development, and although the Court tries to limit the degree of intrusion, it is doubtful that there are principled grounds for preventing the expansion of today's holding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court justifies its decision on the ground that the nature of the confidential communication at issue in this particular case--a clear expression of what the Court terms racial bias1--is uniquely harmful to our criminal justice system.  And the Court is surely correct that even a tincture of racial bias can inflict great damage on that system, which is dependent on the public's trust.  But until today, the argument that the Court now finds convincing has not been thought to be sufficient to overcome confidentiality rules like the one at issue here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Suppose that a prosecution witness gives devastating but false testimony against a defendant, and suppose that the witness's motivation is racial bias.  Suppose that the witness admits this to his attorney, his spouse, and a member of the clergy.  Suppose that the defendant, threatened with conviction for a serious crime and a lengthy term of imprisonment, seeks to compel the attorney, the spouse, or the member of the clergy to testify about the witness's admissions.  Even though the constitutional rights of the defendant hang in the balance, the defendant's efforts to obtain the testimony would fail.  The Court provides no good reason why the result in this case should not be the same.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rules barring the admission of juror testimony to impeach a verdict (so-called \"no-impeachment rules\") have a long history.  Indeed, they pre-date the ratification of the Constitution.  They are typically traced back to Vaise v. Delaval, 1 T. R. 11, 99 Eng. Rep. 944 (K. B. 1785), in which Lord Mansfield declined to consider an affidavit from two jurors who claimed that the jury had reached its verdict by lot.  See Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4).  Lord Mansfield's approach \"soon took root in the United States,\" ibid., and \"[b]y the beginning of [the 20th] century, if not earlier, the near-universal and firmly established common-law rule in the United States flatly prohibited the admission of juror testimony to impeach a jury verdict,\" Tanner v. United States, 483 U.\u00a0S. 107, 117 (1987); see 27 C. Wright & V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \u00a76071, p. 431 (2d ed. 2007) (Wright & Gold) (noting that the Mansfield approach \"came to be accepted in almost all states\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.\u00a0S. 264 (1915), this Court adopted a strict no-impeachment rule for cases in federal court. McDonald involved allegations that the jury had entered a quotient verdict--that is, that it had calculated a damages award by taking the average of the jurors' suggestions.  Id., at 265-266.  The Court held that evidence of this misconduct could not be used.  Id., at 269.  It applied what it said was \"unquestionably the general rule, that the losing party cannot, in order to secure a new trial, use the testimony of jurors to impeach their verdict.\"  Ibid.  The Court recognized that the defendant had a powerful interest in demonstrating that the jury had \"adopted an arbitrary and unjust method in arriving at their verdict.\"  Id., at 267.  \"But,\" the Court warned, \"let it once be established that verdicts .\u00a0.\u00a0. can be attacked and set aside on the testimony of those who took part in their publication and all verdicts could be, and many would be, followed by an inquiry in the hope of discovering something which might invalidate the finding.\"  Ibid.  This would lead to \"harass[ment]\" of jurors and \"the destruction of all frankness and freedom of discussion and conference.\"  Id., at 267-268.  Ultimately, even though the no-impeachment rule \"may often exclude the only possible evidence of misconduct,\" relaxing the rule \"would open the door to the most pernicious arts and tampering with jurors.\"  Id., at 268 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The firm no-impeachment approach taken in McDonald came to be known as \"the federal rule.\"  This approach categorically bars testimony about jury deliberations, except where it is offered to demonstrate that the jury was subjected to an extraneous influence (for example, an attempt to bribe a juror).  Warger, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5); Tanner, supra, at 117;2 see 27 Wright & Gold \u00a76071, at 432-433.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some jurisdictions, notably Iowa, adopted a more permissive rule.  Under the Iowa rule, jurors were generally permitted to testify about any subject except their \"subjective intentions and thought processes in reaching a verdict.\"  Warger, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 4).  Accordingly, the Iowa rule allowed jurors to \"testify as to events or conditions which might have improperly influenced the verdict, even if these took place during deliberations within the jury room.\"  27 Wright & Gold \u00a76071, at 432.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Debate between proponents of the federal rule and the Iowa rule emerged during the framing and adoption of Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b).  Both sides had their supporters.  The contending arguments were heard and considered, and in the end the strict federal approach was retained.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An early draft of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence included a version of the Iowa rule, 51 F.\u00a0R.\u00a0D. 315, 387-388 (1971).  That draft was forcefully criticized, however,3 and the Committee ultimately produced a revised draft that retained the well-established federal approach.  Tanner, supra, at 122; see Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure of the Judicial Conference of the United States, Revised Draft of Proposed Rules of Evidence for the United States Courts and Magistrates 73 (Oct. 1971).  Expressly repudiating the Iowa rule, the new draft provided that jurors generally could not testify \"as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the jury's deliberations.\"  Ibid.  This new version was approved by the Judicial Conference and sent to this Court, which adopted the rule and referred it to Congress.  56 F.\u00a0R.\u00a0D. 183, 265-266 (1972).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Initially, the House rejected this Court's version of Rule 606(b) and instead reverted to the earlier (and narrower) Advisory Committee draft.  Tanner, supra, at 123; see H.\u00a0R. Rep. No. 93-650, pp.\u00a09-10 (1973) (criticizing the Supreme Court draft for preventing jurors from testifying about \"quotient verdict[s]\" and other \"irregularities which occurred in the jury room\").  In the Senate, however, the Judiciary Committee favored this Court's rule.  The Committee Report observed that the House draft broke with \"long-accepted Federal law\" by allowing verdicts to be \"challenge[d] on the basis of what happened during the jury's internal deliberations.\"  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 93-1277, p. 13 (1974) (S.\u00a0Rep.).  In the view of the Senate Committee, the House rule would have \"permit[ted] the harassment of former jurors\" as well as \"the possible exploitation of disgruntled or otherwise badly-motivated ex-jurors.\"  Id., at 14. This result would have undermined the finality of verdicts, violated \"common fairness,\" and prevented jurors from \"function[ing] effectively.\"  Ibid.  The Senate rejected the House version of the rule and returned to the Court's rule.  A Conference Committee adopted the Senate version, see H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1597, p. 8 (1974), and this version was passed by both Houses and was signed into law by the President.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As this summary shows, the process that culminated in the adoption of Federal Rule of Evidence 606(b) was the epitome of reasoned democratic rulemaking.  The \"distinguished, Supreme Court-appointed\" members of the Advisory Committee went through a 7-year drafting process, \"produced two well-circulated drafts,\" and \"considered numerous comments from persons involved in nearly every area of court-related law.\"  Rothstein, The Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Evidence, 62 Geo. L.\u00a0J. 125 (1973).  The work of the Committee was considered and approved by the experienced appellate and trial judges serving on the Judicial Conference and by our predecessors on this Court.  After that, the matter went to Congress, which \"specifically understood, considered, and rejected a version of [the rule] that would have allowed jurors to testify on juror conduct during deliberations.\"  Tanner, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 125.  The judgment of all these participants in the process, which was informed by their assessment of an empirical issue, i.e., the effect that the competing Iowa rule would have had on the jury system, is entitled to great respect.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Colorado considered this same question, made the same judgment as the participants in the federal process, and adopted a very similar rule.  In doing so, it joined the overwhelming majority of States.  Ante, at 9.  In the great majority of jurisdictions, strong no-impeachment rules continue to be \"viewed as both promoting the finality of verdicts and insulating the jury from outside influences.\"  Warger, 574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recognizing the importance of Rule 606(b), this Court has twice rebuffed efforts to create a Sixth Amendment exception--first in Tanner and then, just two Terms ago, in Warger.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tanner petitioners were convicted of committing mail fraud and conspiring to defraud the United States.  483 U.\u00a0S., at 109-110, 112-113.  After the trial, two jurors came forward with disturbing stories of juror misconduct.  One claimed that several jurors \"consumed alcohol during lunch breaks .\u00a0.\u00a0. causing them to sleep through the afternoons.\"  Id., at 113.  The second added that jurors also smoked marijuana and ingested cocaine during the trial.  Id., at 115-116.  This Court held that evidence of this bacchanalia could properly be excluded under Rule 606(b).  Id., at 127.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court noted that \"[s]ubstantial policy considerations support the common-law rule against the admission of jury testimony to impeach a verdict.\"  Id., at 119.  While there is \"little doubt that postverdict investigation into juror misconduct would in some instances lead to the invalidation of verdicts reached after irresponsible or improper juror behavior,\" the Court observed, it is \"not at all clear .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the jury system could survive such efforts to perfect it.\"  Id., at 120.  Allowing such post-verdict inquiries would \"seriously disrupt the finality of the process.\"  Ibid.  It would also undermine \"full and frank discussion in the jury room, jurors' willingness to return an unpopular verdict, and the community's trust in a system that relies on the decisions of laypeople.\"  Id., at 120-121.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Tanner petitioners, of course, had a Sixth Amendment right \"to 'a tribunal both impartial and mentally competent to afford a hearing.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 126 (quoting Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U.\u00a0S. 167, 176 (1912)).  The question, however, was whether they also had a right to an evidentiary hearing featuring \"one particular kind of evidence inadmissible under the Federal Rules.\"  483 U.\u00a0S., at 126-127.  Turning to that question, the Court noted again that \"long-recognized and very substantial concerns support the protection of jury deliberations from intrusive inquiry.\"  Id., at 127.  By contrast, \"[p]etitioners' Sixth Amendment interests in an unimpaired jury .\u00a0.\u00a0. [were] protected by several aspects of the trial process.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court identified four mechanisms that protect defendants' Sixth Amendment rights.  First, jurors can be \"examined during voir dire.\"  Ibid.  Second, \"during the trial the jury is observable by the court, by counsel, and by court personnel.\"  Ibid.  Third, \"jurors are observable by each other, and may report inappropriate juror behavior to the court before they render a verdict.\"  Ibid.  And fourth, \"after the trial a party may seek to impeach the verdict by nonjuror evidence of misconduct.\"  Ibid.  These \"other sources of protection of petitioners' right to a competent jury\" convinced the Court that the juror testimony was properly excluded.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Warger involved a negligence suit arising from a motorcycle crash.  574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  During voir dire, the individual who eventually became the jury's foreperson said that she could decide the case fairly and impartially.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 2).  After the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendant, one of the jurors came forward with evidence that called into question the truthfulness of the foreperson's responses during voir dire.  According to this juror, the foreperson revealed during the deliberations that her daughter had once caused a deadly car crash, and the foreperson expressed the belief that a lawsuit would have ruined her daughter's life.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In seeking to use this testimony to overturn the jury's verdict, the plaintiff's primary contention was that Rule 606(b) does not apply to evidence concerning a juror's alleged misrepresentations during voir dire.  If otherwise interpreted, the plaintiff maintained, the rule would threaten his right to trial by an impartial jury.4  The Court disagreed, in part because \"any claim that Rule 606(b) is unconstitutional in circumstances such as these is foreclosed by our decision in Tanner.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  The Court explained that \"[e]ven if jurors lie in voir dire in a way that conceals bias, juror impartiality is adequately assured by\" two of the other Tanner safeguards: pre-verdict reports by the jurors and non-juror evidence.  574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tanner and Warger fit neatly into this Court's broader jurisprudence concerning the constitutionality of evidence rules.  As the Court has explained, \"state and federal rulemakers have broad latitude under the Constitution to establish rules excluding evidence from criminal trials.\"  Holmes v. South Carolina, 547 U.\u00a0S. 319, 324 (2006) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  Thus, evidence rules of this sort have been invalidated only if they \"serve no legitimate purpose or .\u00a0.\u00a0. are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote.\"  Id., at 326.  Tanner and Warger recognized that Rule 606(b) serves vital purposes and does not impose a disproportionate burden on the jury trial right.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, for the first time, the Court creates a constitutional exception to no-impeachment rules.  Specifically, the Court holds that no-impeachment rules violate the Sixth Amendment to the extent that they preclude courts from considering evidence of a juror's racially biased comments.  Ante, at 17.  The Court attempts to distinguish Tanner and Warger, but its efforts fail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tanner and Warger rested on two basic propositions.  First, no-impeachment rules advance crucial interests.  Second, the right to trial by an impartial jury is adequately protected by mechanisms other than the use of juror  testimony regarding jury deliberations.  The first of these propositions applies regardless of the nature of the juror misconduct, and the Court does not argue otherwise.  Instead, it contends that, in cases involving racially biased jurors, the Tanner safeguards are less effective and the defendant's Sixth Amendment interests are more profound.  Neither argument is persuasive.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, Tanner identified four \"aspects of the trial process\" that protect a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights: (1) voir dire; (2) observation by the court, counsel, and court personnel; (3) pre-verdict reports by the jurors; and (4) non-juror evidence.  483 U.\u00a0S., at 127.5  Although the Court insists that that these mechanisms \"may be compromised\" in cases involving allegations of racial bias, it addresses only two of them and fails to make a sustained argument about either.  Ante, at 16.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court contends that the effectiveness of voir dire is questionable in cases involving racial bias because pointed questioning about racial attitudes may highlight racial issues and thereby exacerbate prejudice.  Ibid.  It is far from clear, however, that careful voir dire cannot surmount this problem.  Lawyers may use questionnaires or individual questioning of prospective jurors6 in order to elicit frank answers that a juror might be reluctant to voice in the presence of other prospective jurors.7  Moreover, practice guides are replete with advice on conducting effective voir dire on the subject of race.  They outline a variety of subtle and nuanced approaches that avoid pointed questions.8  And of course, if an attorney is concerned that a juror is concealing bias, a peremptory strike may be used.9\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suggestion that voir dire is ineffective in unearthing bias runs counter to decisions of this Court holding that voir dire on the subject of race is constitutionally required in some cases, mandated as a matter of federal supervisory authority in others, and typically advisable in any case if a defendant requests it.  See Turner v. Murray, 476 U.\u00a0S. 28, 36-37 (1986); Rosales-Lopez v. United States, 451 U.\u00a0S. 182, 192 (1981) (plurality opinion); Ristaino v. Ross, 424 U.\u00a0S. 589, 597, n.\u00a09 (1976).  If voir dire were not useful in identifying racial prejudice, those decisions would be pointless.  Cf. Turner, supra, at 36 (plurality opinion) (noting \"the ease with which [the] risk [of racial bias] could have been minimized\" through voir dire).  Even the majority recognizes the \"advantages of careful voir dire\" as a \"proces[s] designed to prevent racial bias in jury deliberations.\"  Ante, at 20.  And reported decisions substantiate that voir dire can be effective in this regard.  E.g., Brewer v. Marshall, 119 F. 3d 993, 995-996 (CA1 1997); United States v. Hasting, 739 F.\u00a02d 1269, 1271 (CA7 1984); People v. Harlan, 8 P.\u00a03d 448, 500 (Colo. 2000); see Brief for Respondent 23-24, n.\u00a07 (listing additional cases).  Thus, while voir dire is not a magic cure, there are good reasons to think that it is a valuable tool.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, the critical point for present purposes is that the effectiveness of voir dire is a debatable empirical proposition.  Its assessment should be addressed in the process of developing federal and state evidence rules.  Federal and state rulemakers can try a variety of approaches, and they can make changes in response to the insights provided by experience and research.  The approach taken by today's majority--imposing a federal constitutional rule on the entire country--prevents experimentation and makes change exceedingly hard.10\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also argues--even more cursorily--that \"racial bias may make it difficult for a juror to report inappropriate statements during the course of juror deliberations.\"  Ante, at 16.  This is so, we are told, because it is difficult to \"call [another juror] a bigot.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Since the Court's decision mandates the admission of the testimony of one juror about a statement made by another juror during deliberations, what the Court must mean in making this argument is that jurors are less willing to report biased comments by fellow jurors prior to the beginning of deliberations (while they are still sitting with the biased juror) than they are after the verdict is announced and the jurors have gone home.  But this is also a questionable empirical assessment, and the Court's seat-of-the-pants judgment is no better than that of those with the responsibility of drafting and adopting federal and state evidence rules.  There is no question that jurors do report biased comments made by fellow jurors prior to the beginning of deliberations.  See, e.g., United States v. McClinton, 135 F.\u00a03d 1178, 1184-1185 (CA7 1998); United States v. Heller, 785 F.\u00a02d 1524, 1525-1529 (CA11 1986); Tavares v. Holbrook, 779 F.\u00a02d 1, 1-3 (CA1 1985) (Breyer, J.); see Brief for Respondent 31-32, n.\u00a010; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 31.  And the Court marshals no evidence that such pre-deliberation reporting is rarer than the post-verdict variety.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if there is something to the distinction that the Court makes between pre- and post-verdict reporting, it is debatable whether the difference is significant enough to merit different treatment.  This is especially so because post-verdict reporting is both more disruptive and may be the result of extraneous influences.  A juror who is initially in the minority but is ultimately persuaded by other jurors may have second thoughts after the verdict is announced and may be angry with others on the panel who pressed for unanimity.  In addition, if a verdict is unpopular with a particular juror's family, friends, employer, co-workers, or neighbors, the juror may regret his or her vote and may feel pressured to rectify what the jury has done.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the Court provides no good reason to depart from the calculus made in Tanner and Warger.  Indeed, the majority itself uses hedged language and appears to recognize that this \"pragmatic\" argument is something of a makeweight.  Ante, at 16-17 (noting that the argument is \"not dispositive\"); ante, at 16 (stating that the operation of the safeguards \"may be compromised, or they may prove insufficient\").\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The real thrust of the majority opinion is that the Constitution is less tolerant of racial bias than other forms of juror misconduct, but it is hard to square this argument with the nature of the Sixth Amendment right on which petitioner's argument and the Court's holding are based.  What the Sixth Amendment protects is the right to an \"impartial jury.\"  Nothing in the text or history of the Amendment or in the inherent nature of the jury trial right suggests that the extent of the protection provided by the Amendment depends on the nature of a jury's partiality or bias.  As the Colorado Supreme Court aptly put it, it is hard to \"discern a dividing line between different types of juror bias or misconduct, whereby one form of partiality would implicate a party's Sixth Amendment right while another would not.\"  350 P.\u00a03d 287, 293 (2015).11\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor has the Court found any decision of this Court suggesting that the Sixth Amendment recognizes some sort of hierarchy of partiality or bias.  The Court points to a line of cases holding that, in some narrow circumstances, the Constitution requires trial courts to conduct voir dire on the subject of race.  Those decisions, however, were not based on a ranking of types of partiality but on the Court's conclusion that in certain cases racial bias was especially likely.  See Turner, 476 U.\u00a0S., at 38, n.\u00a012 (plurality opinion) (requiring voir dire on the subject of race where there is \"a particularly compelling need to inquire into racial prejudice\" because of a qualitatively higher \"risk of racial bias\"); Ristaino, 424 U.\u00a0S., at 596 (explaining that the requirement applies only if there is a \"constitutionally significant likelihood that, absent questioning about  racial prejudice, the jurors would not be [impartial]\").12  Thus, this line of cases does not advance the majority's argument.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is undoubtedly true that \"racial bias implicates unique historical, constitutional, and institutional concerns.\"  Ante, at 16.  But it is hard to see what that has to do with the scope of an individual criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to be judged impartially.  The Court's efforts to reconcile its decision with McDonald, Tanner, and Warger illustrate the problem.  The Court writes that the misconduct in those cases, while \"troubling and unacceptable,\" was \"anomalous.\"  Ante, at 15.  By contrast, racial bias, the Court says, is a \"familiar and recurring evil\" that causes \"systemic injury to the administration of justice.\"  Ante, at 15-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Imagine two cellmates serving lengthy prison terms.  Both were convicted for homicides committed in unrelated barroom fights.  At the trial of the first prisoner, a juror, during deliberations, expressed animosity toward the defendant because of his race.  At the trial of the second prisoner, a juror, during deliberations, expressed animosity toward the defendant because he was wearing the jersey of a hated football team.  In both cases, jurors come forward after the trial and reveal what the biased juror said in the jury room.  The Court would say to the first prisoner: \"You are entitled to introduce the jurors' testimony, because racial bias is damaging to our society.\"  To the second, the Court would say: \"Even if you did not have an impartial jury, you must stay in prison because sports rivalries are not a major societal issue.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This disparate treatment is unsupportable under the Sixth Amendment.  If the Sixth Amendment requires the admission of juror testimony about statements or conduct during deliberations that show one type of juror partiality, then statements or conduct showing any type of partiality should be treated the same way.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Recasting this as an equal protection case would not provide a ground for limiting the holding to cases involving racial bias.  At a minimum, cases involving bias based on any suspect classification--such as national origin13 or religion14--would merit equal treatment.  So, I think, would bias based on sex, United States v. Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S. 515, 531 (1996), or the exercise of the First Amendment right to freedom of expression or association.  See Regan v. Taxation With Representation of Washington, 461 U.\u00a0S. 540, 545 (1983).  Indeed, convicting a defendant on the basis of any irrational classification would violate the Equal Protection Clause.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Attempting to limit the damage worked by its decision, the Court says that only \"clear\" expressions of bias must be admitted, ante, at 17, but judging whether a statement is sufficiently \"clear\" will often not be easy.  Suppose that the allegedly biased juror in this case never made reference to Pe\u00f1a-Rodriguez's race or national origin but said that he had a lot of experience with \"this macho type\" and knew that men of this kind felt that they could get their way with women.  Suppose that other jurors testified that they were certain that \"this macho type\" was meant to refer to Mexican or Hispanic men.  Many other similarly suggestive statements can easily be imagined, and under today's decision it will be difficult for judges to discern the dividing line between those that are \"clear[ly]\" based on racial or ethnic bias and those that are at least somewhat ambiguous.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's decision--especially if it is expanded in the ways that seem likely--will invite the harms that no-impeachment rules were designed to prevent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, as the Court explained in Tanner, \"postverdict scrutiny of juror conduct\" will inhibit \"full and frank discussion in the jury room.\"  483 U.\u00a0S., at 120-121; see also McDonald, 238 U.\u00a0S., at 267-268 (warning that the use of juror testimony about misconduct during deliberations would \"make what was intended to be a private deliberation, the constant subject of public investigation--to the destruction of all frankness and freedom of discussion and conference\").  Or, as the Senate Report put it: \"[C]ommon fairness requires that absolute privacy be preserved for jurors to engage in the full and free debate necessary to the attainment of just verdicts.  Jurors will not be able to function effectively if their deliberations are to be scrutinized in post-trial litigation.\"  S.\u00a0Rep., at 14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's ruling will also prompt losing parties and their friends, supporters, and attorneys to contact and seek to question jurors, and this pestering may erode citizens' willingness to serve on juries.  Many jurisdictions now have rules that prohibit or restrict post-verdict contact with jurors, but whether those rules will survive today's decision is an open question--as is the effect of this decision on privilege rules such as those noted at the outset of this opinion.15\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Where post-verdict approaches are permitted or occur, there is almost certain to be an increase in harassment, arm-twisting, and outright coercion.  See McDonald, supra, at 267; S.\u00a0Rep., at 14 (explaining that a laxer rule \"would permit the harassment of former jurors by losing parties as well as the possible exploitation of disgruntled or otherwise badly-motivated ex-jurors\"); 350 P.\u00a03d, at 293.  As one treatise explains, \"[a] juror who reluctantly joined a verdict is likely to be sympathetic to overtures by the loser, and persuadable to the view that his own consent rested on false or impermissible considerations, and the truth will be hard to know.\"  3 C. Mueller & L. Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence \u00a76:16, p. 75 (4th ed. 2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's approach will also undermine the finality of verdicts.  \"Public policy requires a finality to litigation.\"  S.\u00a0Rep., at 14.  And accusations of juror bias--which may be \"raised for the first time days, weeks, or months after the verdict\"--can \"seriously disrupt the finality of the process.\"  Tanner, supra, at 120.  This threatens to \"degrad[e] the prominence of the trial itself\" and to send the message that juror misconduct need not be dealt with promptly.  Engle v. Isaac, 456 U.\u00a0S. 107, 127 (1982).  See H.\u00a0R. Conf. Rep. No. 93-1597, at 8 (\"The Conferees believe that jurors should be encouraged to be conscientious in promptly reporting to the court misconduct that occurs during jury deliberations\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court itself acknowledges that strict no-impeachment rules \"promot[e] full and vigorous discussion,\" protect jurors from \"be[ing] harassed or annoyed by litigants seeking to challenge the verdict,\" and \"giv[e] stability and finality to verdicts.\"  Ante, at 9.  By the majority's own logic, then, imposing exceptions on no-impeachment rules will tend to defeat full and vigorous discussion, expose jurors to harassment, and deprive verdicts of stability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's only response is that some jurisdictions already make an exception for racial bias, and the Court detects no signs of \"a loss of juror willingness to engage in searching and candid deliberations.\"  Ante, at 19.  One wonders what sort of outward signs the Court would expect to see if jurors in these jurisdictions do not speak as freely in the jury room as their counterparts in jurisdictions with strict no-impeachment rules.  Gathering and assessing evidence regarding the quality of jury deliberations in different jurisdictions would be a daunting enterprise, and the Court offers no indication that anybody has undertaken that task.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the majority barely bothers to engage with the policy issues implicated by no-impeachment rules.  But even if it had carefully grappled with those issues, it still would have no basis for exalting its own judgment over that of the many expert policymakers who have endorsed broad no-impeachment rules.\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's decision is well-intentioned.  It seeks to remedy a flaw in the jury trial system, but as this Court said some years ago, it is questionable whether our system of trial by jury can endure this attempt to perfect it.  Tanner, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 120.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I respectfully dissent. \n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Prior to 1770, it appears that juror affidavits were sometimes received to impeach a verdict on the ground of juror misbehavior, although only \"with great caution.\"  McDonald v. Pless, 238 U.\u00a0S. 264, 268 (1915); see, e.g., Dent v. The Hundred of Hertford, 2 Salk. 645, 91 Eng. Rep. 546 (K. B. 1696); Philips v. Fowler, Barnes. 441, 94 Eng. Rep. 994 (K. B. 1735).  But \"previous to our Revolution, and at least as early as 1770, the doctrine in England was distinctly ruled the other way, and has so stood ever since.\"  3 T. Waterman, A Treatise on the Principles of Law and Equity Which Govern Courts in the Granting of New Trials in Cases Civil and Criminal 1429 (1855).\nFootnote 2\u00a0Although two States declined to follow the rule in the mid-19th century, see Wright v. Illinois & Miss. Tel. Co., 20 Iowa 195, 210 (1866); Perry v. Bailey, 12 Kan. 539, 544-545 (1874), \"most of the state courts\" had already \"committed themselves upon the subject,\" 8 Wigmore \u00a72354, at 702.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The bias at issue in this case was a \"bias against Mexican men.\"  App. 160.  This might be described as bias based on national origin or ethnicity.  Cf. Hernandez v. New York, 500 U.\u00a0S. 352, 355 (1991) (plurality opinion); Hernandez v. Texas, 347 U.\u00a0S. 475, 479 (1954).  However, no party has suggested that these distinctions make a substantive difference in this case.\nFootnote 2\u00a0As this Court has explained, the extraneous influence exception \"do[es] not detract from, but rather harmonize[s] with, the weighty government interest in insulating the jury's deliberative process.\" Tanner, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 120.  The extraneous influence exception, like the no-impeachment rule itself, is directed at protecting jury deliberations against unwarranted interference.  Ibid.\nFootnote 3\u00a0In particular, the Justice Department observed that \"[s]trong policy considerations continue to support\" the federal approach and that \"[r]ecent experience has shown that the danger of harassment of jurors by unsuccessful litigants warrants a rule which imposes strict limitations on the instances in which jurors may be questioned about their verdict.\"  Letter from R. Kliendienst, Deputy Attorney General, to Judge A. Maris (Aug. 9, 1971), 117 Cong. Rec. 33648, 33655 (1971).  And Senator McClellan, an influential member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, insisted that the \"mischief in this Rule ought to be plain for all to see\" and that it would be impossible \"to conduct trials, particularly criminal prosecutions, as we know them today, if every verdict were followed by a post-trial hearing into the conduct of the juror's deliberations.\"  Letter from Sen. J. McClellan to Judge A. Maris (Aug. 12, 1971), id., at 33642, 33645.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Although Warger was a civil case, we wrote that \"[t]he Constitution guarantees both criminal and civil litigants a right to an impartial jury.\"  574 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\nFootnote 5\u00a0The majority opinion in this case identifies a fifth mechanism: jury instructions.  It observes that, by explaining the jurors' responsibilities, appropriate jury instructions can promote \"[p]robing and thoughtful deliberation,\" which in turn \"improves the likelihood that other jurors can confront the flawed nature of reasoning that is prompted or influenced by improper biases.\"  Ante, at 20-21.  This mechanism, like those listed in Tanner, can help to prevent bias from infecting a verdict.\nFootnote 6\u00a0Both of those techniques were used in this case for other purposes.

See, e.g., Lee, A New Approach to Voir Dire on Racial Bias, 5 U. C. Irvine L. Rev. 843, 861 (2015) (\"A wealth of fairly recent empirical research has shown that when race is made salient either through pretrial publicity, voir dire questioning of prospective jurors, opening and closing arguments, or witness testimony, White jurors are more likely to treat similarly situated Black and White defendants the same way\").

Applied Soc. Psychology 1953, 1964-1965 (2009).\nFootnote 10\u00a0It is worth noting that, even if voir\u00a0dire were entirely ineffective at detecting racial bias (a proposition no one defends), that still would not suffice to distinguish this case from Warger v. Shauers, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014).  After all, the allegation in Warger was that the foreperson had entirely circumvented voir\u00a0dire by lying in order to shield her bias.  The Court, nevertheless, concluded that even where \"jurors lie in voir\u00a0dire in a way that conceals bias, juror impartiality is adequately assured\" through other means.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\nFootnote 11\u00a0The majority's reliance on footnote 3 of Warger, ante, at 12-13, is unavailing.  In that footnote, the Court noted that some \"cases of juror bias\" might be \"so extreme\" as to prompt the Court to \"consider whether the usual safeguards are or are not sufficient to protect the integrity  of the process.\"  574 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___, n.\u00a03 (slip op., at 10-11, n.\u00a03) (emphasis added).  Considering this question is very different from adopting a constitutionally based exception to long-established no-impeachment rules.\nFootnote 12\u00a0In addition, those cases did not involve a challenge to a long-established evidence rule.  As such, they offer little guidance in performing the analysis required by this case.\nFootnote 13\u00a0See Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.\u00a0S. 432, 440 (1985).\nFootnote 14\u00a0See, e.g., United States v. Armstrong, 517 U.\u00a0S. 456, 464 (1996); Burlington Northern R. Co. v. Ford, 504 U.\u00a0S. 648, 651 (1992); New Orleans v. Dukes, 427 U.\u00a0S. 297, 303 (1976) (per curiam).\nFootnote 15\u00a0The majority's emphasis on the unique harms of racial bias will not succeed at cabining the novel exception to no-impeachment rules, but it may succeed at putting other kinds of rules under threat.  For example, the majority approvingly refers to the widespread rules limiting attorneys' contact with jurors.  Ante, at 17-18.  But under the reasoning of the majority opinion, it is not clear why such rules should be enforced when they come into conflict with a defendant's attempt to introduce evidence of racial bias.  For instance, what will happen when a lawyer obtains clear evidence of racist statements by contacting jurors in violation of a local rule?  (Something similar happened in Tanner.  483 U.\u00a0S., at 126.)  It remains to be seen whether rules of this type--or other rules which exclude probative evidence, such as evidentiary privileges--will be allowed to stand in the way of the \"imperative to purge racial prejudice from the administration of justice.\"  Ante, at 13.\n\n\n","63":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nPERRY v. MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD(2017)\nNo. 16-399\nArgued: April 17, 2017Decided: June 23, 2017\n\n\nUnder the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CSRA), the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) has the power to review certain serious personnel actions against federal employees.  If an employee asserts rights under the CSRA only, MSPB decisions are subject to judicial review exclusively in the Federal Circuit.  5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77703(b)(1).  If the employee invokes only federal antidiscrimination law, the proper forum for judicial review is federal district court.  See Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.\u00a0S. 41, 46.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An employee who complains of a serious adverse employment action and attributes the action, in whole or in part, to bias based on race, gender, age, or disability brings a \"mixed case.\"  When the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on the merits or on procedural grounds, review authority lies in district court, not the Federal Circuit.  Id., at 50, 56.  This case concerns the proper forum for judicial review when the MSPB dismisses such a case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anthony Perry received notice that he would be terminated from his employment at the U.\u00a0S. Census Bureau for spotty attendance.  Perry and the Bureau reached a settlement in which Perry agreed to a 30-day suspension and early retirement.  The settlement also required Perry to dismiss discrimination claims he had filed separately with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).  After retiring, Perry appealed his suspension and retirement to the MSPB, alleging discrimination based on race, age, and disability, as well as retaliation by the Bureau for his prior discrimination complaints.  The settlement, he maintained, did not stand in the way, because the Bureau had coerced him into signing it.  But an MSPB administrative law judge (ALJ) determined that Perry had failed to prove that the settlement was coerced.  Presuming Perry's retirement to be voluntary, the ALJ dismissed his case.  Because voluntary actions are not appealable to the MSPB, the ALJ observed, the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain Perry's claims.  The MSPB affirmed, deeming Perry's separation voluntary and therefore not subject to the Board's jurisdiction.  If dissatisfied with the MSPB's ruling, the Board stated, Perry could seek judicial review in the Federal Circuit.  Perry instead sought review in the D.\u00a0C. Circuit, which, the parties later agreed, lacked jurisdiction.  The D.\u00a0C. Circuit held that the proper forum was the Federal Circuit and transferred the case there.  Kloeckner did not control, the court concluded, because it addressed dismissals on procedural grounds, not jurisdictional grounds. \nHeld:\u00a0The proper review forum when the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on jurisdictional grounds is district court.  Pp.\u00a09-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Government argues that employees must split their mixed claims, appealing MSPB nonappealability rulings to the Federal Circuit while repairing to the district court to adjudicate their discrimination claims.  Perry counters that the district court alone can resolve his entire complaint.  Perry advances the more sensible reading of the statutory prescriptions.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kloeckner announced a clear rule: \"[M]ixed cases shall be filed in district court.\"  568 U.\u00a0S., at 50; see id., at 56.  The key to district court review is the employee's \"clai[m] that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in \u00a77702(a)(1).\"  Id., at 56 (emphasis added).  Such a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction suffices to establish district court jurisdiction.  EEOC regulations are in accord, and several Courts of Appeals have similarly described mixed-case appeals as those alleging an adverse action subject to MSPB jurisdiction taken, in whole or in part, because of unlawful discrimination.  Perry, who \"complain[ed] of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB\" and \"allege[d] that the [personnel] action was based on discrimination,\" brought a mixed case, and district court jurisdiction was therefore proper.  Pp.\u00a09-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) The Government's proposed distinction--between MSPB merits and procedural decisions, on the one hand, and the Board's jurisdictional rulings, on the other--has multiple infirmities.  Had Congress wanted to bifurcate judicial review, sending merits and procedural decisions to district court and jurisdictional dismissals to the Federal Circuit, it could have said so.  See Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 52.  The Government's newly devised attempt to distinguish jurisdictional dismissals from procedural dismissals is a departure from its position in Kloeckner. Such a distinction, as both parties recognized in Kloeckner, would be perplexing and elusive.  The distinction between jurisdiction and the merits is also not inevitably sharp, for the two inquiries may overlap.  And because the MSPB may issue rulings on alternate or multiple grounds, some \"jurisdictional,\" others procedural or substantive, allocating judicial review authority based on a separate rule for jurisdictional rulings may prove unworkable in practice.  Perry's comprehension of the complex statutory text, in contrast, serves \"[t]he CSRA's objective of creating an integrated scheme of review[, which] would be seriously undermined\" by \"parallel litigation regarding the same agency action.\"  Elgin v.

PERRY, PETITIONER v.

We refer to complaints of that order, descriptively, as \"mixed cases.\"  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the CSRA, Congress created the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB or Board) to review certain serious personnel actions against federal employees.  If an employee asserts rights under the CSRA only, MSPB decisions, all agree, are subject to judicial review exclusively in the Federal Circuit.  \u00a77703(b)(1).  If the employee asserts no civil-service rights, invoking only federal antidiscrimination law, the proper forum for judicial review, again all agree, is a federal district court, see Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.\u00a0S. 41, 46 (2012); the Federal Circuit, while empowered to review MSPB decisions on civil-service claims, \u00a77703(b)(1)(A), lacks authority over claims arising under antidiscrimination laws, see \u00a77703(c).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a complaint presents a mixed case, and the MSPB dismisses it, must the employee resort to the Federal Circuit for review of any civil-service issue, reserving claims under federal antidiscrimination law for discrete district court adjudication?  If the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on the merits, the parties agree, review authority lies in district court, not in the Federal Circuit.  In Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 50, 56, we held, the proper review forum is also the district court when the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds, in Kloeckner itself, failure to meet a deadline for Board review set by the MSPB.  We hold today that the review route remains the same when the MSPB types its dismissal of a mixed case as \"jurisdictional.\"  As in Kloeckner, we are mindful that review rights should be read not to protract proceedings, increase costs, and stymie employees,1 but to secure expeditious resolution of the claims employees present.  See Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 567 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (2012) (emphasizing need for \"clear guidance about the proper forum for [an] employee's [CSRA] claims\").  Cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. l.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The CSRA \"establishes a framework for evaluating personnel actions taken against federal employees.\"  Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.\u00a0S. 41, 44 (2012).  For \"particularly serious\" actions, \"for example, a removal from employment or a reduction in grade or pay,\" \"the affected employee has a right to appeal the agency's decision to the MSPB.\"  Ibid. (citing \u00a7\u00a71204, 7512, 7701).  Such an appeal may present a civil-service claim only.  Typically, the employee may allege that \"the agency had insufficient cause for taking the action under the CSRA.\"  Id., at 44.  An appeal to the MSPB, however, may also complain of adverse action taken, in whole or in part, because of discrimination prohibited by another federal statute, for example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e et\u00a0seq., or the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7621 et\u00a0seq.  See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77702(a)(1); Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 44.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Kloeckner, we explained, \"[w]hen an employee complains of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB and alleges that the action was based on discrimination, she is said (by pertinent regulation) to have brought a 'mixed case.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting 29 CFR \u00a71614.302 (2012)).  See also \u00a71614.302(a)(2) (2016) (defining \"mixed case appeal\" as one in which an employee \"alleges that an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination\").  For mixed cases, \"[t]he CSRA and regulations of the MSPB and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) set out special procedures .\u00a0.\u00a0. different from those used when the employee either challenges a serious personnel action under the CSRA alone or attacks a less serious action as discriminatory.\"  Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 44-45.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As Kloeckner detailed, the CSRA provides diverse procedural routes for an employee's pursuit of a mixed case.  The employee \"may first file a discrimination complaint with the agency itself,\" in the agency's equal employment opportunity (EEO) office, \"much as an employee challenging a personnel practice not appealable to the MSPB could do.\"  Id., at 45 (citing 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(a) (2012); 29 CFR \u00a71614.302(b) (2012)); see \u00a77702(a)(2).  \"If the agency [EEO office] decides against her, the employee may then either take the matter to the MSPB or bypass further administrative review by suing the agency in district court.\"  Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 45 (citing 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(b); 29 CFR \u00a71614.302(d)(1)(i)); see \u00a77702(a)(2).  \"Alternatively, the employee may initiate the process by bringing her case directly to the MSPB, forgoing the agency's own system for evaluating discrimination charges.\"  Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 45 (citing 5 CFR \u00a71201.154(a); 29 CFR \u00a71614.302(b)); see \u00a77702(a)(1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 7702 prescribes appellate proceedings in actions involving discrimination.  Defining the MSPB's jurisdiction in mixed-case appeals that bypass an agency's EEO office, \u00a77702(a)(1) states in relevant part:\n\"[I]n the case of any employee .\u00a0.\u00a0. who--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(A) has been affected by an action which the employee .\u00a0.\u00a0. may appeal to the [MSPB], and\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(B) alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination prohibited by [specified antidiscrimination statutes], .\u00a0.\u00a0.\n\"the Board shall, within 120 days of the filing of the appeal, decide both the issue of discrimination and the appealable action in accordance with the Board's appellate procedures .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"2\nSection 7702(a)(2) similarly authorizes a mixed-case appeal to the MSPB from an agency EEO office's decision.  Then, \"[i]f the MSPB upholds the personnel action (whether in the first instance or after the agency has done so), the employee again has a choice: She may request additional administrative process, this time with the EEOC, or else she may seek judicial review.\"  Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 45 (citing \u00a77702(a)(3), (b); 5 CFR \u00a71201.161; 29 CFR \u00a71614.303).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 7703(b) designates the proper forum for judicial review of MSPB decisions.  Section 7703(b)(1)(A) provides the general rule: \"[A] petition to review a .\u00a0.\u00a0. final decision of the Board shall be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\"  Section 7703(b)(2) states the exception here relevant, governing \"[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of [\u00a7]7702.\"  See Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 46 (\"The 'cases of discrimination' in \u00a77703(b)(2)'s exception .\u00a0.\u00a0. are mixed cases, in which an employee challenges as discriminatory a personnel action appealable to the MSPB.\").  Such cases \"shall be filed under [the enforcement sections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7201 et\u00a0seq.], as applicable.\"  \u00a77703(b)(2).  Those enforcement provisions \"all authorize suit in federal district court.\"  Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 46 (citing, inter alia, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a72000e-16(c), 2000e-5(f); 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a(c); \u00a7216(b)).  Thus, if the MSPB decides against the employee on the merits of a mixed case, the statute instructs her to seek review in federal district court under the enforcement provision of the relevant antidiscrimination laws.  \u00a77703(b)(2); see Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 56, n.\u00a04.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal district court is also the proper forum for judicial review, we held in Kloeckner, when the MSPB dismisses a mixed case on procedural grounds.  Id., at 50, 56.  We rested that conclusion on this syllogism: \"Under \u00a77703(b)(2), 'cases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]' shall be filed in district court.\"  Id., at 50 (alteration in original).  Further, \"[u]nder \u00a77702(a)(1), [mixed cases qualify as] 'cases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702].'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (third alteration in original).  Thus, \"mixed cases shall be filed in district court.\"  Ibid.  That syllogism, we held, holds true whether the dismissal rests on procedural grounds or on the merits, for \"nowhere in the [CSRA's] provisions on judicial review\" is a distinction drawn between MSPB merits decisions and procedural rulings.  Id., at 51.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The instant case presents this question: Where does an employee seek judicial review when the MSPB dismisses her civil-service case alleging discrimination neither on the merits nor on a procedural ground, but for lack of jurisdiction?\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anthony Perry worked at the U.\u00a0S. Census Bureau until 2012.  829 F.\u00a03d 760, 762 (CADC 2016).  In 2011, Perry received notice that he would be terminated because of spotty attendance.  Ibid.  Later that year, Perry and the Bureau reached a settlement in which Perry agreed to a 30-day suspension and early retirement.  Ibid.  The agreement required Perry to dismiss discrimination claims he had separately filed with the EEOC.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After retiring, Perry appealed his suspension and retirement to the MSPB.  Ibid.  He alleged discrimination on grounds of race, age, and disability, as well as retaliation by the Bureau for his prior discrimination complaints.  Ibid.  The settlement, he maintained, did not stand in the way, because the Bureau coerced him into signing it.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An MSPB administrative law judge (ALJ) eventually determined that Perry had failed to prove that the settlement was coerced.  Perry v. Department of Commerce, No. DC-0752-12-0486-B-1 etc. (Dec. 23, 2013) (initial decision), App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a, 47a.  Presuming Perry's retirement to be voluntary, the ALJ dismissed his case.  Id., at 33a, 47a.  Voluntary actions are not appealable to the MSPB, the ALJ observed, hence, the ALJ concluded, the Board lacked jurisdiction to entertain Perry's claims.  Id., at 51a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The MSPB affirmed the ALJ's decision.  See Perry v. Department of Commerce, 2014 WL 5358308, *1 (Aug. 6, 2014) (final order).  The settlement agreement, the Board recounted, provided that Perry would waive his Board appeal rights with respect to his suspension and retirement.  Ibid.  Because Perry did not prove that the agreement was involuntary, the Board determined (in accord with the ALJ) that his separation should be deemed voluntary, hence not an adverse action subject to the Board's jurisdiction under \u00a77702(a)(1).  Id., at *3-*4.  If dissatisfied with the MSPB's ruling, the Board stated in its decision, Perry could seek judicial review in the Federal Circuit.  Id., at *4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perry instead filed a pro\u00a0se petition for review in the D.\u00a0C. Circuit.  829 F.\u00a03d, at 763.  The court ordered jurisdictional briefing and appointed counsel to argue for Perry.  Ibid.  By the time the court heard argument, the parties had agreed that the D.\u00a0C. Circuit lacked jurisdiction, but disagreed on whether the proper forum for judicial review was the Federal Circuit, as the Government contended, or federal district court, as Perry maintained.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The D.\u00a0C. Circuit held that the Federal Circuit had jurisdiction over Perry's petition and transferred his case to that court under 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71631.  829 F.\u00a03d, at 763.  The court's disposition was precedent-bound: In a prior decision, Powell v. Department of Defense, 158 F.\u00a03d 597, 598 (1998), the D.\u00a0C. Circuit had held that the Federal Circuit is the proper forum for judicial review of MSPB decisions dismissing mixed cases \"on procedural or threshold grounds.\"  See 829 F.\u00a03d, at 764, 767-768.  Notably, Powell ranked as a \"procedural or threshold matter\" \"the Board's view of its jurisdiction.\"  158 F.\u00a03d, at 599 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The D.\u00a0C. Circuit rejected Perry's argument that Powell was undermined by this Court's intervening decision in Kloeckner, which held MSPB procedural dispositions of mixed cases reviewable in district court.  829 F.\u00a03d, at 764-768.  Kloeckner, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit observed, repeatedly tied its decision to dismissals on \"procedural grounds,\" 568 U.\u00a0S., at 44, 46, 49, 52, 54, 55.  See 829 F.\u00a03d, at 765.  Jurisdictional dismissals differ from procedural dismissals, the D.\u00a0C. Circuit concluded, given the CSRA's reference to mixed cases as those \"which the employee\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. may appeal to the [MSPB].\"  Id., at 766-767 (quoting \u00a77702(a)(1)(A); emphasis added).  A jurisdictional dismissal, the court said, rests on the Board's determination that the employee may not appeal his case to the MSPB.  Id., at 766-767.  In contrast, a dismissal on procedural grounds, e.g., untimely resort to the MSPB, leaves the employee still \"affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the MSPB.\"  Ibid. (quoting \u00a77702(a)(1)(A); alteration in original).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to review the D.\u00a0C. Circuit's decision, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017), which accords with the Federal Circuit's decision in Conforto v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., 713 F.\u00a03d 1111 (2013).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Federal employees, the Government acknowledges, have a right to pursue claims of discrimination in violation of federal law in federal district court.  Nor is there any doubt that the Federal Circuit lacks authority to adjudicate such claims.  See \u00a77703(c) (preserving \"right to have the facts subject to trial de\u00a0novo by the reviewing court\" in any \"case of discrimination\" brought under \u00a77703(b)(2)).  The sole question here disputed: What procedural route may an employee in Perry's situation take to gain judicial review of the MSPB's jurisdictional disposition of a complaint that alleges adverse action taken under the CSRA in whole or in part due to discrimination proscribed by federal law?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government argues, and the dissent agrees, that employees, situated as Perry is, must split their claims, appealing MSPB nonappealability rulings to the Federal Circuit while repairing to the district court for adjudication of their discrimination claims.  As Perry sees it, one stop is all he need make.  Exclusively competent to adjudicate \"[c]ases of discrimination,\" \u00a77703(b)(2), the district court alone can resolve his entire complaint, Perry urges; the CSRA, he maintains, forces no bifurcation of his case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 7702(a)(1), the Government contends, marks a case as mixed only if the employee \"has been affected by an action which the employee .\u00a0.\u00a0. may appeal to the [MSPB].\"  Brief for Respondent 15, 17-19, 21.  An MSPB finding of nonappealability removes a case from that category, the Government asserts, and hence, from the purview of \"[c]ases of discrimination\" described in \u00a77703(b)(2).  Id., at 21.  Only this reading of the CSRA's provisions on judicial review--one ordering Federal Circuit review of any and all MSPB appealability determinations--the Government maintains, can ensure nationwide uniformity in answering questions arising under the CSRA.  Id., at 26-32.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perry emphasizes in response that \u00a77702(a)(1)(A)'s language, delineating cases in which an employee \"has been affected by an action which the employee . . . may appeal to the [MSPB],\" is not confined to cases an employee may successfully appeal to the Board.  Brief for Peti-tioner 19.  The MSPB's adverse ruling on the merits of his claim that the settlement was coerced, Perry argues, \"did not retroactively divest the MSPB of jurisdiction to render that decision.\"  Id., at 21.  The key consideration, according to Perry, is not what the MSPB determined about appealability; it is instead the nature of an employee's claim that he had been \"affected by an action [appealable] to the [MSPB]\" (here, suspension for more than 14 days and involuntary removal, see \u00a77512(1), (2)).  See id., at 11, 23-24.  Perry draws support for this argument from our recognition that \"a party [may] establish jurisdiction at the outset of a case by means of a nonfrivolous assertion of jurisdictional elements,\" Jerome B. Grubart, Inc. v. Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co., 513 U.\u00a0S. 527, 537 (1995).  See Brief for Petitioner 21-22.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perry, we hold, advances the more sensible reading of the statutory prescriptions.  The Government's procedure-jurisdiction distinction, we conclude, is no more tenable than \"the merits-procedure distinction\" we rejected in Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 51.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As just noted, a nonfrivolous allegation of jurisdiction generally suffices to establish jurisdiction upon initiation of a case.  See Jerome B. Grubart, Inc., 513 U.\u00a0S., at 537.  See also Bell v. Hood, 327 U.\u00a0S. 678, 682-683 (1946) (To invoke federal-question jurisdiction, allegations in a complaint must simply be more than \"insubstantial or frivolous,\" and \"[i]f the court does later exercise its jurisdiction to determine that the allegations in the complaint do not state a ground for relief, then dismissal of the case would be on the merits, not for want of jurisdiction.\").  So too here: whether an employee \"has been affected by an action which [she] may appeal to the [MSPB],\" \u00a77702(a) (1)(A), turns on her well-pleaded allegations.  Kloeckner, EEOC regulations, and Courts of Appeals' decisions are corroborative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We announced a clear rule in Kloeckner: \"[M]ixed cases shall be filed in district court.\"  568 U.\u00a0S., at 50.  An employee brings a mixed case, we explained, when she \"complains of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB,\" e.g., suspension for more than 14 days, \u00a77512(2), \"and alleges that the action was based on discrimination.\"  Id., at 44 (emphasis deleted).  The key to district court review, we said, was the employee's \"clai[m] that an agency action appealable to the MSPB violates an antidiscrimination statute listed in \u00a77702(a)(1).\"  Id., at 56 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EEOC regulations, see supra, at 3, are in accord: The defining feature of a \"mixed case appeal,\" those regulations instruct, is the employee's \"alleg[ation] that an appealable agency action was effected, in whole or in part, because of discrimination.\"  29 CFR \u00a71614.302(a)(2) (2016) (emphasis added).  Several Courts of Appeals have similarly described mixed-case appeals as those alleging an adverse action subject to MSPB jurisdiction taken, in whole or in part, because of unlawful discrimination.  See, e.g., Downey v. Runyon, 160 F.\u00a03d 139, 143 (CA2 1998) (\"Mixed appeals to the MSPB are those appeals alleging an appealable action affected in whole or in part by prohibited discrimination.\" (emphasis added)); Powell, 158 F.\u00a03d, at 597 (defining mixed-case appeal as \"an appeal alleging both a Board-jurisdictional agency action and a claim of unlawful discrimination\" (emphasis added)). See also Conforto, 713 F.\u00a03d, at 1126-1127, n.\u00a05 (Dyk, J., dissenting).4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because Perry \"complain[ed] of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to the MSPB\" (in his case, a 30-day suspension and involuntary removal, see supra, at 6; \u00a77512(1), (2)) and \"allege[d] that the [personnel] action was based on discrimination,\" he brought a mixed case.  Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 44.5  Judicial review of such a case lies in district court.  Id., at 50, 56.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government rests heavily on a distinction between MSPB merits and procedural decisions, on the one hand, and the Board's jurisdictional rulings, on the other.6  The distinction has multiple infirmities.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"If Congress had wanted to [bifurcate judicial review,] send[ing] merits decisions to district court and procedural dismissals to the Federal Circuit,\" we observed in Kloeckner, \"it could just have said so.\"  Id., at 52.  The same observation could be made about bifurcating judicial review here, sending the MSPB's merits and procedural decisions to district court, but its jurisdictional dismissals to the Federal Circuit.7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government's attempt to separate jurisdictional dismissals from procedural dismissals is newly devised.  In Kloeckner, the Government agreed with the employee that there was \"no basis\" for a procedure-jurisdiction distinction.  Brief for Respondent, O.\u00a0T. 2012, No. 11-184, p.\u00a025, n.\u00a03; see Reply to Brief in Opposition, O.\u00a0T. 2012, No. 11-184, pp.\u00a01-2 (stating employee's agreement with the Government that procedural and jurisdictional dismissals should travel together).  Issues of both kinds, the Government there urged, should go to the Federal Circuit.  Drawing such a distinction, the Government observed, would be \"difficult and unpredictable.\"  Brief in Opposition in Kloeckner, O.\u00a0T. 2012, No. 11-184, p.\u00a015 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Now, in light of our holding in Kloeckner that procedural dismissals should go to district court, the Government has changed course, contending that MSPB procedural and jurisdictional dismissals should travel different paths.8\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A procedure-jurisdiction distinction for purposes of determining the court in which judicial review lies, as both parties recognized in Kloeckner, would be perplexing and elusive.  If a 30-day suspension followed by termination becomes nonappealable to the MSPB when the Board credits a release signed by the employee, one may ask why a determination that the employee complained of such adverse actions (suspension and termination) too late, i.e., after a Board-set deadline, does not similarly render the complaint nonappealable.  In both situations, the Board disassociates itself from the case upon making a threshold determination.  This Court, like others, we note, has sometimes wrestled over the proper characterization of timeliness questions.  Compare Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.\u00a0S. 205, 209-211, 215 (2007) (timely filing of notice of appeal in civil cases is \"jurisdictional\"), with id., at 217-219 (Souter, J., dissenting) (timeliness of notice of appeal is a procedural issue).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just as the proper characterization of a question as jurisdictional rather than procedural can be slippery, the distinction between jurisdictional and merits issues is not inevitably sharp, for the two inquiries may overlap.  See Shoaf v. Department of Agriculture, 260 F.\u00a03d 1336, 1341 (CA Fed. 2001) (\"recogniz[ing] that the MSPB's jurisdiction and the merits of an alleged involuntary separation are inextricably intertwined\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  This case fits that bill.  The MSPB determined that it lacked jurisdiction over Perry's civil-service claims on the ground that he voluntarily released those claims by entering into a valid settlement with his employing agency, the Census Bureau.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 27a.9  But the validity of the settlement is at the heart of the dispute on the merits of Perry's complaint.  In essence, the MSPB ruled that it lacked jurisdiction because Perry's claims fail on the merits.  See Shoaf, 260 F.\u00a03d, at 1341 (If it is established that an employee's \"resignation or retirement was involuntary and thus tantamount to forced removal,\" then \"not only [does the Board] ha[ve] jurisdiction, but also the employee wins on the merits and is entitled to reinstatement.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  See also Conforto, 713 F.\u00a03d, at 1126 (Dyk, J., dissenting) (\"[I]t cannot be that [the Federal Circuit] lack[s] jurisdiction to review the 'merits' of mixed cases but nevertheless may review 'jurisdictional' issues that are identical to the merits .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\").10\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Distinguishing between MSPB jurisdictional rulings and the Board's procedural or substantive rulings for purposes of allocating judicial review authority between district court and the Federal Circuit is problematic for a further reason: In practice, the distinction may be unworkable.  The MSPB sometimes rules on alternate grounds, one typed \"jurisdictional,\" another either procedural or substantive.  See, e.g., Davenport v. Postal Service, 97 MSPR\u00a0417 (2004) (dismissing \"for lack of jurisdiction and as untimely filed\" (emphasis added)).  To which court does appeal lie?  Or, suppose that the Board addresses a complaint that encompasses multiple claims, dismissing some for want of jurisdiction, others on procedural or substantive grounds.  See, e.g., Donahue v. Postal Service, 2006 WL 859448, *1, *3 (ED Pa., Mar. 31, 2006).  Tellingly, the Government is silent on the proper channeling of appeals in such cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Desirable as national uniformity may be,11 it should not override the expense, delay, and inconvenience of requiring employees to sever inextricably related claims, resorting to two discrete appellate forums, in order to safeguard their rights.  Perry's comprehension of the complex statutory text, we are persuaded, best serves \"[t]he CSRA's objective of creating an integrated scheme of review[, which] would be seriously undermined\" by \"parallel litigation regarding the same agency action.\"  Elgin, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 14.  See also United States v. Fausto, 484 U.\u00a0S. 439, 444-445 (1988).12  Perry asks us not to \"tweak\" the statute, see post, at 1, but to read it sensibly, i.e., to refrain from reading into it the appeal-splitting bifurcation sought by the Government.  Accordingly, we hold: (1) the Federal Circuit is the proper review forum when the MSPB disposes of complaints arising solely under the CSRA; and (2) in mixed cases, such as Perry's, in which the employee (or former employee) complains of serious adverse action prompted, in whole or in part, by the employing agency's violation of federal antidiscrimination laws, the district court is the proper forum for judicial review.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the reasons stated, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGorsuch, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-399\nANTHONY W. PERRY, PETITIONER v. MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit\n[June 23, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Anthony Perry asks us to tweak a congressional statute--just a little--so that it might (he says) work a bit more efficiently.  No doubt his invitation is well meaning.  But it's one we should decline all the same.  Not only is the business of enacting statutory fixes one that belongs to Congress and not this Court, but taking up Mr. Perry's invitation also seems sure to spell trouble.  Look no further than the lower court decisions that have already ventured where Mr. Perry says we should follow.  For every statutory \"fix\" they have offered, more problems have emerged, problems that have only led to more \"fixes\" still.  New challenges come up just as fast as the old ones can be gaveled down.  Respectfully, I would decline Mr. Perry's invitation and would instead just follow the words of the statute as written.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our case concerns the right of federal employees to pursue their employment grievances under the Civil Service Reform Act.  Really, it concerns but a small aspect of that right.  Everyone agrees that employees may contest certain adverse employment actions--generally serious ones like dismissals--before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a77701-7702, 7512-7513.  Everyone agrees, too, that employees are generally entitled to seek judicial review of the Board's decisions.  See \u00a77703.  The only question we face today is where.  And on that question, the Act provides clear directions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the rule.  The Act says that an employee's appeal usually \"shall be filed in .\u00a0.\u00a0. the Federal Circuit,\" \u00a77703(b)(1)(A), which then applies a deferential, APA-style standard of review familiar to administrative law, \u00a77703(c).  No doubt this makes sense, too, for Congress established the Federal Circuit in no small part to ensure a uniform case law governs Executive Branch personnel actions and guarantees the equal treatment of civil servants without regard to geography.  See United States v. Fausto, 484 U.\u00a0S. 439, 449 (1988).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the exception.  Congress recognized that sometimes agencies taking adverse employment actions against employees violate not just federal civil service laws, but also federal antidiscrimination laws.  Usually, of course, employees who wish to pursue discrimination claims in federal district court must first exhaust those claims in proceedings before their employing agency.  See, e.g., 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000e-16(c).  But the Act provides another option.  Employees affected by adverse employment actions that trigger the Act's jurisdiction may (but need not) elect to exhaust their discrimination claims before the Board.  See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77702(a).  They also may ask the Board to review discrimination claims already exhausted before their employing agencies, and in this way obtain an additional layer of administrative review.  See ibid.  In \u00a77702 of the Act, Congress proceeded to set forth the rules the Board must apply in reviewing these cases of discrimination.  And it then said that \"[c]ases of discrimination subject to the provisions of section 7702\" are exempt from the default rule of Federal Circuit review and instead \"shall be filed\" in district court \"under\" specified antidiscrimination statutes like Title VII or the ADEA.  \u00a77703(b)(2).  At that point, district courts are instructed to engage in de novo factfinding, \u00a77703(c), not APA-style judicial review, just as they would in any other discrimination lawsuit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Putting these directions together, the statutory scheme is plain.  Disputes arising under the civil service laws head to the Federal Circuit for deferential review; discrimination cases go to district court for de\u00a0novo review.  Congress allowed employees an elective option to bring their discrimination claims to the Board, but didn't allow this option to destroy the framework it established for the resolution of civil service questions.  These rules provide straightforward direction to courts and guidance to federal employees who often proceed pro se.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These rules also tell us all we need to know to resolve our case.  Construing his pro\u00a0se filings liberally, Mr. Perry pursued civil service and discrimination claims before the Board without first exhausting his discrimination claim before his own agency.  The Board held that it couldn't hear Mr. Perry's claims because he hadn't suffered an adverse employment action sufficient to trigger its jurisdiction under the Act.  Mr. Perry now seeks to contest the Board's assessment of its jurisdiction and win a review there that so far he's been denied.  See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 24.  No doubt, too, he wants the chance to proceed on the merits before the Board for good reason: A victory there is largely unappealable by the government.  See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a77701, 7703(d); see also Brief for Respondent 34.  And because the scope of the Board's jurisdiction is a question of civil service law, Mr. Perry must go to the Federal Circuit for his answer.  If that court agrees with Mr. Perry about the scope of the Board's authority, he can return to the Board and argue the merits of his two claims.  If instead the court agrees with the Board's assessment of its powers, then Mr. Perry still hasn't lost his chance to pursue his remaining discrimination claim, for he may seek to exhaust that claim in the normal agency channels and proceed to district court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Perry, though, invites us to adopt a very different regime, one that would have the district court review the Board's ruling on the scope of its jurisdiction.  Having to contest Board rulings on civil service and discrimination issues in different courts, he says, is a hassle.  So, he submits, we should fix the problem by allowing civil service law questions to proceed to district court whenever an employee pursues a case of discrimination before the Board.  In support of his proposal, he points us to a line of lower court cases associated with Williams v. Department of Army.  And there, indeed, the Federal Circuit adopted a fix much like what Mr. Perry now proposes: allowing civil service claims to tag along to district court with discrimination claims because, in its judgment, \"[f]rom the standpoint of judicial economy, consideration of all issues by a single tribunal is clearly preferable.\"  715 F.\u00a02d 1485, 1490 (1983) (en banc).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Perry's is an invitation I would run from fast.  If a statute needs repair, there's a constitutionally prescribed way to do it.  It's called legislation.  To be sure, the demands of bicameralism and presentment are real and the process can be protracted.  But the difficulty of making new laws isn't some bug in the constitutional design: it's the point of the design, the better to preserve liberty.  Besides, the law of unintended consequences being what it is, judicial tinkering with legislation is sure only to invite trouble.  Just consider the line of lower court authority Mr. Perry asks us to begin replicating now in the U.\u00a0S. Reports.  Having said that district courts should sometimes adjudicate civil service disputes, these courts have quickly and necessarily faced questions about how and when they should do so.  And without any guidance from Congress on these subjects, the lower courts' solutions have only wound up departing further and further from statutory text--and invited yet more and more questions still.  A sort of rolling, case-by-case process of legislative amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take this one.  Recall that the statute says that de novo standard of review applies to cases filed in district court.  See 5 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a77703(c).  But everyone agrees that standard is poorly adapted to the review of administrative civil service decisions.  So what's to be done with civil service disputes that tag along to district court?  Rather than see the problem as a clue things have gone awry, lower courts following Williams have suggested that maybe civil service claims should be assessed under deferential standards of review the Act prescribes only for (yes) Federal Circuit cases.  And today Mr. Perry encourages us to follow suit too.  See Brief for Petitioner 17, n.; Sher v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 488 F.\u00a03d 489, 499 (CA1 2007), cert. denied, 552 U.\u00a0S. 1309 (2008).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that's just the beginning.  The statute allows only cases \"filed under\" certain specified federal antidiscrimination statutes to proceed to district court.  Those laws (of course) prescribe remedies to vindicate harms associated with discrimination, including equitable relief and damages.  See, e.g., 29 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7633a(c).  But what remedies can or should a district court afford a plaintiff in a run-of-the-mill civil service dispute that lands there?  Might a plaintiff be forced to litigate in the district court only to be told at the end that no remedial authority exists?  May a district court fashion some remedy in the absence of a statutory mandate to do so?  Should it only adopt APA-style remedies prescribed by the Act for (again) the Federal Circuit?  Who knows.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Answer all those questions and still more arise.  What happens if the Board fully remedies an employee's discrimination claim, but rejects his simultaneously litigated civil service dispute?  Should the employee go to district court with a stand-alone civil service complaint, to be nominally \"filed\" and adjudicated \"under\" a federal antidiscrimination statute?  Or has by this point the case somehow transformed into one that should be sent to the Federal Circuit?  Williams itself anticipated these particular problems but (notably) declined to take any stab at answering them.  See 715 F.\u00a02d, at 1491.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still more and even curiouser questions follow.  In some cases a district court will find the employee's discrimination claim meritless.  When that happens, what should the district court do with a tag along civil service claim?  Some lower courts after Williams have suggested that cases like these should be transferred back to the Federal Circuit in the \"interests of judicial economy.\"  Nater v. Riley, 114 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d 17, 29 (PR 2000).  But isn't it more than a little strange that an employee (often proceeding pro\u00a0se, no less) should be sent to district court only to be bounced back to the Federal Circuit--with each trip undertaken in the name of \"judicial economy\"?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And speaking of judicial economy, you might wonder what happened to the (no doubt efficient) policy Congress itself articulated when it declared that civil service issues should be decided by the Federal Circuit so they might be subject to a uniform body of appellate case law.  See Fausto, 484 U.\u00a0S., at 449; see also Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 567 U.\u00a0S. 1, 13-14 (2012).  In an effort to achieve a simulacrum of that statutory command, one Federal Circuit judge has suggested that the regional circuits hearing tag along civil service issues should defer to Federal Circuit interpretations of civil service laws, much as federal courts defer to state courts on matters of state law when sitting in diversity.  See Williams, supra, at 1492-1493 (Nichols, J., concurring).  Call it a sort of Erie doctrine for the Federal Circuit--if, of course, one lacking any basis in federalism, not to mention the statutory text.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By this point, you might wonder too if accepting Mr. Perry's invitation will even wind up saving him (or those like him) any hassle at all.  Not only because of all the complications that arise from accepting his invitation.  But also because, regardless which court hears his case, Mr. Perry should wind up in the same place anyway.  If the reviewing court (whichever court that may be) finds that the Board was wrong and it actually possessed jurisdiction over his civil service and discrimination claims, presumably the court will seek to send Mr. Perry back to the Board to adjudicate those claims.  See Reply Brief 18 (agreeing with this point).  Meanwhile, if the reviewing court concludes that the Board was right and it lacked jurisdiction over Mr. Perry's claims, presumably the court will require him to exhaust his remaining discrimination claim in normal agency channels before litigating it in court.  So even if we take up Mr. Perry's ambitious invitation to overhaul the statute, is it even clear that we would save him and those like him any hassle at all?  Or might future courts respond to this development with a yet further statutory rewrite, suggesting next that claimants should be allowed to proceed in district court on the merits of both their civil service and discrimination claims?  Even where (as here) the discrimination claim remains unexhausted before any agency and the civil service claim isn't one even the Board could hear?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Perry's proposal for us may be seriously atextual and practically unattractive, but perhaps it has one thing going for it, he says.  While we of course owe no fealty to Williams or other lower court opinions, and are free to learn from, rather than repeat, their misadventures, Mr. Perry suggests our decision in Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.\u00a0S. 41 (2012), requires us to rule for him.  Whatever we think about the statute's plain terms, he says, we are bound by precedent to send him to district court all the same.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I just don't see in Kloeckner what Mr. Perry would have us find there.  This Court was not asked to decide--and did not decide--whether issues arising under the civil service laws go to district court.  Rather, we were asked to answer the much more prosaic question where an employee seeking to pursue only a discrimination claim should proceed.  See Pet. for Cert. in Kloeckner v. Solis, O.\u00a0T. 2012, No. 11-184, p. i (\"If the [Board] decides a mixed case without determining the merits of the discrimination claim, is the court with jurisdiction over that claim the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit or a district court?\" (emphasis added)).  And this Court simply (and quite rightly) responded to that question by holding that \"[a] federal employee who claims that an agency action appealable to the [Board] violates an antidiscrimination statute .\u00a0.\u00a0. should seek judicial review in district court, not in the Federal Circuit .\u00a0.\u00a0. whether the [Board] decided her case on procedural grounds or instead on the merits.\"  Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 56 (emphasis added).  Nothing about the question presented or holding suggests that a claimant wishing to challenge a Board ruling under the civil service laws may also proceed in district court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Mr. Perry replies that Kloeckner endorsed the idea that something called \"mixed cases\" should go to district court.  But that term does not mean what he thinks it means.  The phrase \"mixed case\" appears nowhere in the statute.  Instead, it is but \"lingo [from] the applicable regulations.\"  Id., at 50.  And even those regulations don't say that civil service questions may go to district court.  Instead, the regulations use the term \"mixed cases\" to describe administrative challenges where the employee both \"complains of a personnel action serious enough to appeal to [the Board] and alleges that the action was based on discrimination.\"  Id., at 44 (second emphasis added); see also 29 CFR \u00a71614.302(a)(2) (2016).  The regulations thus simply acknowledge that some administrative matters are both sufficient to trigger the Board's authority and raise questions addressed by federal antidiscrimination statutes.  They say nothing about what goes to district court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither did Kloeckner redefine the term \"mixed case\" in some novel way.  After discussing the regulatory definition of \"mixed cases,\" the decision proceeds to say just this: \n\"Under \u00a77703(b)(2), 'cases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]' shall be filed in district court.  Under \u00a77702(a)(1), the 'cases of discrimination subject to [\u00a77702]' are mixed cases--those appealable to the [Board] and alleging discrimination.  Ergo, mixed cases shall be filed in district court.\" 568 U.\u00a0S., at 50 (some brackets in original; emphasis added).\nIn context, it seems clear that this passage only seeks to restate the statute, using the term \"mixed cases\" as shorthand for cases that go to district court under \u00a77703(b)(2).  And from that statute we know that only \"cases of discrimination .\u00a0.\u00a0. filed under\" certain specified federal antidiscrimination statutes go to district court--no more, no less.  Nothing in this passage suggests the Court meant to rewrite a regulatory term as a tool to undo a statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now, admittedly, a footnote in Kloeckner did seem to go a step farther and assume Williams' view that civil service claims may tag along with discrimination claims to district court.  Kloeckner, 568 U.\u00a0S., at 55-56, n.\u00a04.  But even by its terms such an assumption wouldn't help Mr. Perry, for he isn't seeking to pursue a discrimination claim in district court.  By his own telling, he is seeking to overturn the Board's holding that it lacked jurisdiction to hear his administrative appeal so he might seek relief there in the first instance.  And that, of course, raises only a question of civil service law.  What's more, the footnote's discussion about Williams is no more than dicta.  The footnote addressed only a policy argument from the government and said that argument failed both under Williams and for other reasons \"[i]n any event.\"  568 U.\u00a0S., at 56, n.\u00a04.  As near as I can tell, then, Mr. Perry would have us upend a carefully crafted statutory scheme on the strength of a comment in one sentence of one footnote offered in reply to a policy argument that failed for other reasons anyway.  Full respect for stare decisis does not demand so much from us.  To the contrary, this Court has long made clear that where, as here, we have not \"squarely addressed [an] issue, and have at most assumed [one side of it to be correct], we are free to address the issue on the merits.\" Brecht v. Abrahamson, 507 U.\u00a0S. 619, 631 (1993); see also Legal Services Corporation v. Valazquez, 531 U.\u00a0S. 533, 537 (2001) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"Judicial decisions do not stand as binding 'precedent' for points that were not raised, not argued, and hence not analyzed\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notably, even the Court today doesn't read Kloeckner as holding that all civil service claims and issues must proceed to district court after a discrimination claim is presented to the Board.  Instead, the Court says that result is justified in large measure because it will \"best serv[e]\" the statute's \"\u00a0'objective of creating an integrated scheme of review[, which] would be seriously undermined' by 'parallel litigation.'\u00a0\"  Ante at 16 (quoting Elgin, 567 U.\u00a0S., at 14).  Yet, the very case the Court quotes for its account about the statute's purpose (Elgin which, in turn, quotes Fausto) speaks of Congress' desire to provide an \"\u00a0'integrated scheme of administrative and judicial review'\u00a0\" for civil service disputes that \"would be seriously undermined\" if \"employees [had] the right to challenge employing agency actions in district court across the country,\" and regional district and circuit courts could pass on such matters.  Elgin, supra, at 13-14 (quoting Fausto, 484 U.\u00a0S., at 445).  And, respectfully, the result Elgin and Fausto warned against is exactly the result the Court's opinion seems sure to guarantee.  Rather than pursue the congressional policy discussed in those cases, the Court seems more nearly headed in the opposite direction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beyond its claim about the statute's purpose, the Court offers little in the way of a traditional statutory interpretation.  It does not explain how the result it reaches squares with the statute's text and structure, or grapple with the arguments presented here on those counts.  The Court does not explain, for example, how exactly a civil service dispute might be said to be \"filed under\" a federal antidiscrimination statute, what the standard of review might apply in such a matter (nowhere discussed in the statute), or what the remedial powers of the district court could be in these circumstances.  And it remains far from obvious whether the Court's eventual answers to questions like these will wind up yielding a regime better for employees, or instead one just different or even a good deal worse.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the only answer the Court supplies to any of the questions raised above lies in a footnote and seems telling.  There, the Court instructs that Mr. Perry will not be able to pursue his discrimination claim if the district court agrees with the Board that it lacked jurisdiction over his claim.  Ante, at 15, n.\u00a010.  But this will surely come as a surprise to Mr. Perry, who tells us he wants to pursue a federal discrimination claim even if it isn't one the Board has jurisdiction to hear.  And it comes as a surprise to me too, for as I've described and the government concedes, nothing in the statute would prevent Mr. Perry from trying to bring a discrimination claim in district court after seeking to exhaust it before his employing agency.  See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 11, 16-17, 28; Brief for Respondent 25; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the end of a long day, I just cannot find anything preventing us from applying the statute as written--or heard any good reason for deviating from its terms.  Indeed, it's not even clear how overhauling the statute as Mr. Perry wishes would advance the efficiency rationale he touts.  The only thing that seems sure to follow from accepting his invitation is all the time and money litigants will spend, and all the ink courts will spill, as they work their way to a wholly remodeled statutory regime.  Respectfully, Congress already wrote a perfectly good law.  I would follow it.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Many CSRA claimants proceed pro\u00a0se.  See MSPB, Congressional Budget Justification FY 2017, p.\u00a014 (2016) (\"Generally, at least half or more of the appeals filed with the [MSPB] are from pro\u00a0se appellants .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0If the MSPB fails to render a \"judicially reviewable action\" within 120 days, an employee may, \"at any time after .\u00a0.\u00a0. the 120th day,\" \"file a civil action [in district court] to the same extent and in the same manner as provided in\" the federal antidiscrimination laws invoked by the employee.  \u00a77702(e)(1).\nFootnote 3\u00a0Our decision in Kloeckner v. Solis, 568 U.\u00a0S. 41 (2012), did not merely assume that the civil-service component of mixed cases travels to district court.  See id., at 56, n.\u00a04 (\"If the MSPB rejects on the merits a complaint alleging that an agency violated the CSRA as well as an antidiscrimination law, the suit will come to district court for a decision on both questions.\" (emphasis added)).  But see post, at 9-10.  Characteristic of \"mixed cases,\" the employee in Kloeckner complained of adverse action taken, at least in part, because of discrimination.  See 568 U.\u00a0S., at 47.  The Board dismissed that case, not for any flaw under antidiscrimination law, but because the employee missed a deadline set by the MSPB.  See id., at 47-48.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Our interpretation is also consistent with another CSRA provision, \u00a77513(d), which provides that \"[a]n employee against whom an action is taken under this section is entitled to appeal to the .\u00a0.\u00a0. Board.\"  Because the \"entitle[ment] to appeal\" conferred in \u00a77513(d) must be determined before an appeal is filed, such a right cannot depend on the outcome of the appeal.\nFootnote 5\u00a0If, as the dissent and the Government argue, see post, at 8-10; Brief for Respondent 19-26, 33-35, Perry's case is not \"mixed,\" one can only wonder what kind of case it is, surely not one asserting rights under the CSRA only, or one invoking only antidiscrimination law.  See supra, at 1-2.  This is, of course, a paradigm mixed case: Perry alleges serious personnel actions (suspension and forced retirement) caused in whole or in part by prohibited discrimination.  So did the employee in Kloeckner.  She alleged that her firing (a serious personnel action) was based on discrimination.  See 568 U.\u00a0S., at 47.  Thus Perry, like Kloeckner, well understood what the term \"mixed case\" means.\nFootnote 6\u00a0Notably, the dissent ventures no support for the principal argument made by the Government, i.e., that MSPB jurisdictional dispositions belong in the Federal Circuit, procedural and merits dispositions, in district court.\nFootnote 7\u00a0As Judge Dyk, dissenting in Conforto v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., 713 F.\u00a03d 1111 (CA Fed. 2013), pointed out: \"[W]here Congress intended to distinguish between different types of Board decisions, it did so expressly.\"  Id., at 1124, n.\u00a01 (citing \u00a73330b(b) (\"An election under this section may not be made .\u00a0.\u00a0. after the [MSPB] has issued a judicially reviewable decision on the merits of the appeal.\" (emphasis added)); \u00a77703(a)(2) (\"The Board shall be named respondent in any proceeding brought pursuant to this subsection, unless the employee .\u00a0.\u00a0. seeks review of a final order or decision on the merits .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\" (emphasis added))).\nFootnote 8\u00a0This is not the first time the Government has changed its position.  Before the Federal Circuit in Ballentine v. Merit Systems Protection Bd., 738 F.\u00a02d 1244 (1984), the Government moved to transfer to district court an appeal challenging a jurisdictional dismissal by the MSPB.  See id., at 1245.  The Government argued that \"even a question of the Board's jurisdiction to hear an attempted mixed case appeal must be addressed by a district court.\"  Id., at 1247 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Rejecting the Government's position, the Federal Circuit concluded that it could review MSPB decisions on \"procedural or threshold matters, not related to the merits of a discrimination claim.\"  Ibid.  In Kloeckner, we disapproved the Federal Circuit's holding with respect to MSPB procedural dismissals.  568 U.\u00a0S., at 50, 56.  Today we disapprove Ballentine's holding with respect to jurisdictional dismissals, thereby adopting precisely the position advanced by the Government in that case. \nFootnote 9\u00a0In civil litigation, a release is an affirmative defense to a plaintiff's claim for relief, not something the plaintiff must anticipate and negate in her pleading.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c)(1) (listing among affirmative defenses \"release\" and \"waiver\"); Newton v. Rumery, 480 U.\u00a0S. 386, 391 (1987).  In that light, the MSPB's jurisdiction should be determined by the adverse actions Perry asserts, suspension and forced retirement; the settlement releasing Perry's claims would figure as a defense to his complaint, it would not enter into the determination whether the Board has jurisdiction over his claims.\nFootnote 10\u00a0If a reviewing court \"agree[d] with the Board's assessment,\" then Perry would indeed have \"lost his chance to pursue his .\u00a0.\u00a0. discrimination claim[s],\" post, at 3,  for those claims would have been defeated had he voluntarily submitted to the agency's action.\nFootnote 11\u00a0In Kloeckner, we rejected the Government's national uniformity argument.  See 568 U.\u00a0S., at 55-56, n.\u00a04.  \"When Congress passed the CSRA, the Federal Circuit did not exist,\" we observed, so uniformity did not then figure in Congress' calculus.  Id., at 56, n.\u00a04.  Moreover, even under the Government's reading, \"many cases involving federal employment issues [would be resolved] in district court.  If the MSPB rejects on the merits a complaint alleging that an agency violated the CSRA as well as an antidiscrimination law, the suit will come to district court for a decision on both questions.\"  Ibid.\nFootnote 12\u00a0In both Elgin v. Department of Treasury, 567 U.\u00a0S. 1 (2012), and United States v. Fausto, 484 U.\u00a0S. 439 (1988), we rejected employees' attempts to divide particular issues or claims among review forums.  In Elgin, a federal employee opted not to seek review of an MSPB ALJ's decision, either before the full Board or in the Federal Circuit; he instead brought in District Court, in the first instance, a constitutional challenge to an agency personnel action.  567 U.\u00a0S., at 7-8.  We concluded that an employee with civil-service claims must follow the CSRA's procedures and may not bring a standalone constitutional challenge in district court.  Id., at 8.  In Fausto, a federal employee with CSRA claims filed an action in the United States Claims Court under the Back Pay Act of 1966.  484 U.\u00a0S., at 443.  We determined that the employee could not bring his action under the Back Pay Act because the CSRA provided \"the comprehensive and integrated review scheme.\"  See id., at 454.  Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see post, at 10, neither case indicated that the Federal Circuit, as opposed to district court, is the preferred forum for judicial review of all CSRA claims.  Rather, both decisions emphasized the benefits of an integrated review scheme and the problems associated with bifurcating consideration of a single matter in different forums.  See 567 U.\u00a0S., at 13-14; 484 U.\u00a0S., at 444-445.  It is the dissent's insistence on bifurcated review, therefore, that \"Elgin and Fausto warned against,\" post, at 10.\n\n\n","64":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nRAY WHITE, ET AL.  v.  DANIEL T. PAULY, AS PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ESTATE OF SAMUEL PAULY, DECEASED ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-67\nArgued: Decided: January 9, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case addresses the situation of an officer who--having arrived late at an ongoing police action and having  witnessed shots being fired by one of several individuals in a house surrounded by other officers--shoots and kills an armed occupant of the house without first giving a warning.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0According to the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to respondents, shows the following.  Respondent Daniel Pauly was involved in a road-rage incident on a highway near Santa\u00a0Fe, New Mexico.  814 F.\u00a03d 1060, 1064-1065 (CA10 2016).  It was in the evening, and it was raining.  The two women involved called 911 to report Daniel as a \"\u00a0'drunk driver'\u00a0\" who was \"\u00a0'swerving all crazy.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 1065.  The women then followed Daniel down the highway, close behind him and with their bright lights on.  Daniel, feeling threatened, pulled his truck over at an off-ramp to confront them.  After a brief, nonviolent encounter, Daniel drove a short distance to a secluded house where he lived with his brother, Samuel Pauly.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometime between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., Officer Kevin Truesdale was dispatched to respond to the women's 911 call.  Truesdale, arriving after Daniel had already left the scene, interviewed the two women at the off-ramp.  The women told Truesdale that Daniel had been driving recklessly and gave his license plate number to Truesdale.  The state police dispatcher identified the plate as being registered to the Pauly brothers' address.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the women left, Officer Truesdale was joined at the off-ramp by Officers Ray White and Michael Mariscal.  The three agreed there was insufficient probable cause to arrest Daniel.  Still, the officers decided to speak with Daniel to (1) get his side of the story, (2) \"\u00a0'make sure nothing else happened,'\u00a0\" and (3) find out if he was intoxicated.  Id., at 1065.  The officers split up.  White stayed at the off-ramp in case Daniel returned.  Truesdale and Mariscal drove in separate patrol cars to the Pauly brothers' address, less than a half mile away.  Record 215.  Neither officer turned on his flashing lights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Officers Mariscal and Truesdale arrived at the address they had received from the dispatcher, they found two different houses, the first with no lights on inside and a second one behind it on a hill.  Id., at 217, 246.  Lights were on in the second one.  The officers parked their cars near the first house.  They examined a vehicle parked near that house but did not find Daniel's truck.  Id., at 310.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Officers Mariscal and Truesdale noticed the lights on in the second house and approached it in a covert manner to maintain officer safety.  Both used their flashlights in an intermittent manner.  Truesdale alone turned on his flashlight once they got close to the house's front door.  Upon reaching the house, the officers found Daniel's pickup truck and spotted two men moving around inside the residence.  Truesdale and Mariscal radioed White, who left the off-ramp to join them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At approximately 11 p.m., the Pauly brothers became aware of the officers' presence and yelled out \"\u00a0'Who are you?'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'What do you want?'\u00a0\"  814 F.\u00a03d, at 1066.  In response, Officers Mariscal and Truesdale laughed and responded: \"\u00a0'Hey, (expletive), we got you surrounded.  Come out or we're coming in.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Truesdale shouted once: \"\u00a0'Open the door, State Police, open the door.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Mariscal also yelled: \"\u00a0'Open the door, open the door.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Pauly brothers heard someone yelling, \"\u00a0'We're coming in.  We're coming in.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Neither Samuel nor Daniel heard the officers identify themselves as state police.  Record 81-82.  The brothers armed themselves, Samuel with a handgun and Daniel with a shotgun.  One of the brothers yelled at the police officers that \"\u00a0'We have guns.'\u00a0\" 814 F.\u00a03d, at 1066.  The officers saw someone run to the back of the house, so Officer Truesdale positioned himself behind the house and shouted \"\u00a0'Open the door, come outside.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Officer White had parked at the first house and was walking up to its front door when he heard shouting from the second house.  He half-jogged, half-walked to the Paulys' house, arriving \"just as one of the brothers said: 'We have guns.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.; see also Civ. No. 12-1311 (D NM, Feb. 5, 2014), App. to Pet. for Cert. 75-78.  When White heard that statement, he drew his gun and took cover behind a stone wall 50 feet from the front of the house.  Officer Mariscal took cover behind a pickup truck.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just \"a few seconds\" after the \"We have guns\" statement, Daniel stepped part way out of the back door and fired two shotgun blasts while screaming loudly.  814 F.\u00a03d, at 1066-1067.  A few seconds after those shots, Samuel opened the front window and pointed a handgun in Officer White's direction.  Officer Mariscal fired immediately at Samuel but missed.  \"\u00a0'Four to five seconds'\u00a0\" later, White shot and killed Samuel.  Id., at 1067.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court denied the officers' motions for summary judgment, and the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the Paulys.  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 2, n.).  Because this case concerns the defense of qualified immunity, however, the Court considers only the facts that were knowable to the defendant officers.  Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 9).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Samuel's estate and Daniel filed suit against, inter alia, Officers Mariscal, Truesdale, and White.  One of the claims was that the officers were liable under Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, for violating Samuel's Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force.  All three officers moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.  White in particular argued that the Pauly brothers could not show that White's use of force violated the Fourth Amendment and, regardless, that Samuel's Fourth Amendment right to be free from deadly force under the circumstances of this case was not clearly established.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court denied qualified immunity.  A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  As to Officers Mariscal and Truesdale, the court held that \"[a]ccepting as true plaintiffs' version of the facts, a reasonable person in the officers' position should have understood their conduct would cause Samuel and Daniel Pauly to defend their home and could result in the commission of deadly force against Samuel Pauly by Officer White.\"  814 F. 3d, at 1076.  The panel majority analyzed Officer White's claim separately from the other officers because \"Officer White did not participate in the events leading up to the armed confrontation, nor was he there to hear the other officers ordering the brothers to 'Come out or we're coming in.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Despite the fact that \"Officer White .\u00a0.\u00a0. arrived late on the scene and heard only 'We have guns' .\u00a0.\u00a0. before taking cover behind a stone wall,\" the majority held that a jury could have concluded that White's use of deadly force was not reasonable.  Id., at 1077, 1082.  The majority also decided that this rule--that a reasonable officer in White's position would believe that a warning was required despite the threat of serious harm--was clearly established at the time of Samuel's death.  The Court of Appeals' ruling relied on general statements from this Court's case law that (1) \"the reasonableness of an officer's use of force depends, in part, on whether the officer was in danger at the precise moment that he used force\" and (2) \"if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon[,] deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if[,] where feasible, some warning has been given.\"  Id., at 1083 (citing, inter alia, Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1985), and Graham v. Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386 (1989); emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  The court concluded that a reasonable officer in White's position would have known that, since the Paulys could not have shot him unless he moved from his position behind a stone wall, he could not have used deadly force without first warning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Moritz dissented, contending that the \"majority impermissibly second-guesses\" Officer White's quick choice to use deadly force.  814 F.\u00a03d, at 1084.  Judge Moritz explained that the majority also erred by defining the clearly established law at too high a level of generality, in contravention of this Court's precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The officers petitioned for rehearing en banc, which 6 of the 12 judges on the Court of Appeals voted to grant.  In a dissent from denial of rehearing, Judge Hartz noted that he was \"unaware of any clearly established law that suggests .\u00a0.\u00a0. that an officer .\u00a0.\u00a0. who faces an occupant pointing a firearm in his direction must refrain from firing his weapon but, rather, must identify himself and shout a warning while pinned down, kneeling behind a rock wall.\"  817 F.\u00a03d 715, 718 (CA10 2016).  Judge Hartz expressed his hope that \"the Supreme Court can clarify the governing law.\"  Id., at 719.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The officers petitioned for certiorari.  The petition is now granted, and the judgment is vacated: Officer White did not violate clearly established law on the record described by the Court of Appeals panel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Qualified immunity attaches when an official's conduct \"\u00a0'does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\u00a0\"  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 4-5).  While this Court's case law \"\u00a0'do[es] not require a case directly on point'\u00a0\" for a right to be clearly established, \"\u00a0'existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.'\u00a0\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  In other words, immunity protects \"\u00a0'all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the last five years, this Court has issued a number of opinions reversing federal courts in qualified immunity cases.  See, e.g., City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2015) (slip op., at 10, n.3) (collecting cases).  The Court has found this necessary both because qualified immunity is important to \"\u00a0'society as a whole,'\u00a0\" ibid., and because as \"\u00a0'an immunity from suit,'\u00a0\" qualified immunity \"\u00a0'is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial,'\u00a0\" Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.\u00a0S. 223, 231 (2009).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, it is again necessary to reiterate the longstanding principle that \"clearly established law\" should not be defined \"at a high level of generality.\"  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. 731, 742 (2011).  As this Court explained decades ago, the clearly established law must be \"particularized\" to the facts of the case.  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.\u00a0S. 635, 640 (1987).  Otherwise, \"[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity .\u00a0.\u00a0. into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\"  Id., at 639.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The panel majority misunderstood the \"clearly established\" analysis: It failed to identify a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances as Officer White was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment.  Instead, the majority relied on Graham, Garner, and their Court of Appeals progeny, which--as noted above--lay out excessive-force principles at only a general level.  Of course, \"general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning\" to officers, United States v. Lanier, 520 U.\u00a0S. 259, 271 (1997), but \"in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent,\" Anderson v. Creighton, supra, at 640. For that reason, we have held that Garner and Graham do not by themselves create clearly established law outside \"an obvious case.\"  Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.\u00a0S. 194, 199 (2004) (per curiam); see also Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 13) (emphasizing that Garner and Graham \"are 'cast at a high level of generality'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not a case where it is obvious that there was a violation of clearly established law under Garner and Graham.  Of note, the majority did not conclude that White's conduct--such as his failure to shout a warning--constituted a run-of-the-mill Fourth Amendment violation.  Indeed, it recognized that \"this case presents a unique set of facts and circumstances\" in light of White's late arrival on the scene.  814 F.\u00a03d, at 1077.  This alone should have been an important indication to the majority that White's conduct did not violate a \"clearly established\" right.  Clearly established federal law does not prohibit a reasonable officer who arrives late to an ongoing police action in circumstances like this from assuming that proper procedures, such as officer identification, have already been followed.  No settled Fourth Amendment principle requires that officer to second-guess the earlier steps already taken by his or her fellow officers in instances like the one White confronted here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the record described by the Court of Appeals, Officer White did not violate clearly established law.  The Court notes, however, that respondents contend Officer White arrived on the scene only two minutes after Officers Truesdale and Mariscal and more than three minutes before Daniel's shots were fired.  On the assumption that the conduct of Officers Truesdale and Mariscal did not adequately alert the Paulys that they were police officers, respondents suggest that a reasonable jury could infer that White witnessed the other officers' deficient performance and should have realized that corrective action was necessary before using deadly force.  Brief in Opposition 11, 22, n.\u00a05.  This Court expresses no position on this potential alternative ground for affirmance, as it appears that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals panel addressed it.  The Court also expresses no opinion on the question whether this ground was properly preserved or whether--in light of this Court's holding today--Officers Truesdale and Mariscal are entitled to qualified immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated; and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nRAY WHITE, et\u00a0al. v.

See 814 F. 3d 1060, 1068, 1073, 1074 (CA10 2016) (Court of Appeals emphasized, repeatedly, that fact disputes exist on question whether Truesdale and Mariscal \"adequately identified themselves\" as police officers before shouting \"Come out or we're coming in\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Further, as to Officer White, the Court, as I comprehend its opinion, leaves open the propriety of denying summary judgment based on fact disputes over when Officer White arrived at the scene, what he may have witnessed, and whether he had adequate time to identify himself and order Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon before Officer White shot Pauly.

The panel majority analyzed Officer White's claim separately from the other officers because \"Officer White did not participate in the events leading up to the armed confrontation, nor was he there to hear the other officers ordering the brothers to 'Come out or we're coming in.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  Despite the fact that \"Officer White .\u00a0.\u00a0. arrived late on the scene and heard only 'We have guns' .\u00a0.\u00a0. before taking cover behind a stone wall,\" the majority held that a jury could have concluded that White's use of deadly force was not reasonable.  Id., at 1077, 1082.  The majority also decided that this rule--that a reasonable officer in White's position would believe that a warning was required despite the threat of serious harm--was clearly established at the time of Samuel's death.  The Court of Appeals' ruling relied on general statements from this Court's case law that (1) \"the reasonableness of an officer's use of force depends, in part, on whether the officer was in danger at the precise moment that he used force\" and (2) \"if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon[,] deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if[,] where feasible, some warning has been given.\"  Id., at 1083 (citing, inter alia, Tennessee v. Garner, 471 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1985), and Graham v. Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386 (1989); emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  The court concluded that a reasonable officer in White's position would have known that, since the Paulys could not have shot him unless he moved from his position behind a stone wall, he could not have used deadly force without first warning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Moritz dissented, contending that the \"majority impermissibly second-guesses\" Officer White's quick choice to use deadly force.  814 F.\u00a03d, at 1084.  Judge Moritz explained that the majority also erred by defining the clearly established law at too high a level of generality, in contravention of this Court's precedent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The officers petitioned for rehearing en banc, which 6 of the 12 judges on the Court of Appeals voted to grant.  In a dissent from denial of rehearing, Judge Hartz noted that he was \"unaware of any clearly established law that suggests .\u00a0.\u00a0. that an officer .\u00a0.\u00a0. who faces an occupant pointing a firearm in his direction must refrain from firing his weapon but, rather, must identify himself and shout a warning while pinned down, kneeling behind a rock wall.\"  817 F.\u00a03d 715, 718 (CA10 2016).  Judge Hartz expressed his hope that \"the Supreme Court can clarify the governing law.\"  Id., at 719.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The officers petitioned for certiorari.  The petition is now granted, and the judgment is vacated: Officer White did not violate clearly established law on the record described by the Court of Appeals panel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Qualified immunity attaches when an official's conduct \"\u00a0'does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.'\u00a0\"  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 4-5).  While this Court's case law \"\u00a0'do[es] not require a case directly on point'\u00a0\" for a right to be clearly established, \"\u00a0'existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.'\u00a0\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  In other words, immunity protects \"\u00a0'all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the last five years, this Court has issued a number of opinions reversing federal courts in qualified immunity cases.  See, e.g., City and County of San Francisco v. Sheehan, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2015) (slip op., at 10, n.3) (collecting cases).  The Court has found this necessary both because qualified immunity is important to \"\u00a0'society as a whole,'\u00a0\" ibid., and because as \"\u00a0'an immunity from suit,'\u00a0\" qualified immunity \"\u00a0'is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial,'\u00a0\" Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.\u00a0S. 223, 231 (2009).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today, it is again necessary to reiterate the longstanding principle that \"clearly established law\" should not be defined \"at a high level of generality.\"  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. 731, 742 (2011).  As this Court explained decades ago, the clearly established law must be \"particularized\" to the facts of the case.  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.\u00a0S. 635, 640 (1987).  Otherwise, \"[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity .\u00a0.\u00a0. into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\"  Id., at 639.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The panel majority misunderstood the \"clearly established\" analysis: It failed to identify a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances as Officer White was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment.  Instead, the majority relied on Graham, Garner, and their Court of Appeals progeny, which--as noted above--lay out excessive-force principles at only a general level.  Of course, \"general statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning\" to officers, United States v. Lanier, 520 U.\u00a0S. 259, 271 (1997), but \"in the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent,\" Anderson v. Creighton, supra, at 640. For that reason, we have held that Garner and Graham do not by themselves create clearly established law outside \"an obvious case.\"  Brosseau v. Haugen, 543 U.\u00a0S. 194, 199 (2004) (per curiam); see also Plumhoff v. Rickard, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 13) (emphasizing that Garner and Graham \"are 'cast at a high level of generality'\u00a0\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not a case where it is obvious that there was a violation of clearly established law under Garner and Graham.  Of note, the majority did not conclude that White's conduct--such as his failure to shout a warning--constituted a run-of-the-mill Fourth Amendment violation.  Indeed, it recognized that \"this case presents a unique set of facts and circumstances\" in light of White's late arrival on the scene.  814 F.\u00a03d, at 1077.  This alone should have been an important indication to the majority that White's conduct did not violate a \"clearly established\" right.  Clearly established federal law does not prohibit a reasonable officer who arrives late to an ongoing police action in circumstances like this from assuming that proper procedures, such as officer identification, have already been followed.  No settled Fourth Amendment principle requires that officer to second-guess the earlier steps already taken by his or her fellow officers in instances like the one White confronted here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the record described by the Court of Appeals, Officer White did not violate clearly established law.  The Court notes, however, that respondents contend Officer White arrived on the scene only two minutes after Officers Truesdale and Mariscal and more than three minutes before Daniel's shots were fired.  On the assumption that the conduct of Officers Truesdale and Mariscal did not adequately alert the Paulys that they were police officers, respondents suggest that a reasonable jury could infer that White witnessed the other officers' deficient performance and should have realized that corrective action was necessary before using deadly force.  Brief in Opposition 11, 22, n.\u00a05.  This Court expresses no position on this potential alternative ground for affirmance, as it appears that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals panel addressed it.  The Court also expresses no opinion on the question whether this ground was properly preserved or whether--in light of this Court's holding today--Officers Truesdale and Mariscal are entitled to qualified immunity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated; and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nRAY WHITE, et\u00a0al. v.

See 814 F. 3d 1060, 1068, 1073, 1074 (CA10 2016) (Court of Appeals emphasized, repeatedly, that fact disputes exist on question whether Truesdale and Mariscal \"adequately identified themselves\" as police officers before shouting \"Come out or we're coming in\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Further, as to Officer White, the Court, as I comprehend its opinion, leaves open the propriety of denying summary judgment based on fact disputes over when Officer White arrived at the scene, what he may have witnessed, and whether he had adequate time to identify himself and order Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon before Officer White shot Pauly.  Compare id., at 1080, with ante, at 8.  See also Civ.

CITY OF HOUSTON, TEXAS, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-515\nArgued: Decided: April 24, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every year the courts of appeals decide hundreds of cases in which they must determine whether thin evidence provided by a plaintiff is just enough to survive a motion for summary judgment or not quite enough.  This is one such case.  Officer Thompson stated in a deposition that he shot Salazar-Limon because he saw him turn toward him and reach for his waist in a movement consistent with reaching for a gun.  Record, Doc. 39-2, pp. 29-30, 33.  Remarkably, Salazar-Limon did not state in his deposition or in an affidavit that he did not reach for his waist, and on that ground the Court of Appeals held that respondents were entitled to summary judgment.  826 F.\u00a03d 272, 278-279 (CA5 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent disagrees with that judgment.  The dissent acknowledges that summary judgment would be proper if the record compelled the conclusion that Salazar-Limon reached for his waist, but the dissent believes that, if the case had gone to trial, a jury could have reasonably inferred that Salazar-Limon did not reach for his waist--even if Salazar-Limon never testified to that fact.  The dissent's conclusion is surely debatable.  But in any event, this Court does not typically grant a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a factual question of this sort, see this Court's Rule 10, and I therefore concur in the denial of review here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write to put our disposition of this petition in perspective.  First, whether or not one agrees with the grant of summary judgment in favor of Officer Thompson, it is clear that the lower courts acted responsibly and attempted faithfully to apply the correct legal rule to what is at best a marginal set of facts.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, this Court applies uniform standards in determining whether to grant review in cases involving allegations that a law enforcement officer engaged in unconstitutional conduct.  We may grant review if the lower court conspicuously failed to apply a governing legal rule.  See this Court's Rule 10.  The dissent cites five such cases in which we granted relief for law enforcement officers, and in all but one of those cases there was no published dissent.  White v. Pauly, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017) (per curiam); Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015) (per curiam); Taylor v. Barkes, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015) (per curiam); Carroll v. Carman, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014) (per curiam); Stanton v. Sims, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013) (per curiam).  The dissent has not identified a single case in which we failed to grant a similar petition filed by an alleged victim of unconstitutional police conduct.    \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted, regardless of whether the petitioner is an officer or an alleged victim of police misconduct, we rarely grant review where the thrust of the claim is that a lower court simply erred in applying a settled rule of law to the facts of a particular case.  See this Court's Rule 10.  The case before us falls squarely in that category.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is undeniably a tragic case, but as the dissent notes, post, at 8 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), we have no way of determining what actually happened in Houston on the night when Salazar-Limon was shot.  All that the lower courts and this Court can do is to apply the governing rules in a neutral fashion.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nRICARDO SALAZAR-LIMON v. CITY OFHOUSTON, TEXAS, et\u00a0al.\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit\nNo. 16-515.\u2003Decided April 24, 2017\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just after midnight on October 29, 2010, a Houston police officer shot petitioner Ricardo Salazar-Limon in the back.  Salazar-Limon claims the officer shot him as he tried to walk away from a confrontation with the officer on an overpass.  The officer, by contrast, claims that Salazar-Limon turned toward him and reached for his waistband--as if for a gun--before the officer fired a shot.  The question whether the officer used excessive force in shooting Salazar-Limon thus turns in large part on which man is telling the truth.  Our legal system entrusts this decision to a jury sitting as finder of fact, not a judge reviewing a paper record.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts below thought otherwise.  The District Court credited the officer's version of events and granted summary judgment to respondents--the officer and the city.  97 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 898 (SD Tex. 2015).  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  826 F.\u00a03d 272 (2016).  But summary judgment is appropriate only where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).  The courts below failed to heed that mandate.  Three Terms ago, we summarily reversed the Fifth Circuit in a case \"reflect[ing] a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards.\"  Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (\u00a0per curiam) (slip op., at 10).  This case reflects the same fundamental error.  I respectfully dissent from the Court's failure to grant certiorari and reverse.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The encounter at issue here occurred around midnight on October 29, 2010, on the outskirts of Houston, Texas.  Salazar-Limon, who had been drinking, was driving with three other men down Houston's Southwest Freeway.  Houston Police Department Officer Chris Thompson was manning a speed gun on the freeway that night and spotted Salazar-Limon's truck weaving between lanes.  He turned on his lights and sirens, and Salazar-Limon pulled over and stopped on the shoulder of an overpass.  Thompson walked over to the window of Salazar-Limon's truck and asked for his driver's license and proof of insurance, which Salazar-Limon provided.  Thompson checked  Salazar-Limon's license and found no outstanding warrants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Thompson returned to the truck, the incident quickly escalated.  Thompson asked Salazar-Limon to step out of the truck--apparently intending to conduct a blood alcohol test--and the two men began to walk together toward Thompson's patrol car.  Although the men dispute the details of what happened next, they agree that Thompson tried to put Salazar-Limon in handcuffs; that Salazar-Limon resisted; and that a brief struggle ensued.  At the end of the struggle, Salazar-Limon turned away and began to walk back to his truck, his back to Thompson.  Thompson drew his firearm and told Salazar-Limon to stop walking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What matters is what happened next, and here the men tell different stories.  According to Salazar-Limon, Thompson shot him \"immediately\"--at most, within \"seconds\" of the oral command.  Record, Doc. 39-1, p. 8.  Salazar-Limon testified that when the bullet hit his back, he began to turn toward Thompson and then fell to the ground.  Ibid.  Thompson's version of the story differs.  According to Thompson, when he told Salazar-Limon to stop walking, Salazar-Limon raised his hands toward his waistband--as if for a weapon--and turned toward him.  Id., Doc. 39-2, at 29.  Thompson testified that he shot Salazar-Limon only \"[o]nce he made the motion towards his waistband.\"  Ibid.  Salazar-Limon, in other words, claims that Thompson shot him in the back while he was walking away.  Thompson claims that Salazar-Limon provoked the shot by turning toward him and reaching for what he thought was a gun.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Salazar-Limon survived the encounter but sustained crippling injuries.  In 2011, he sued Thompson, the city of Houston, and various police officials, alleging violations of his constitutional rights.  Respondents removed the case to federal court and moved for summary judgment, arguing that Thompson was protected by qualified immunity.1  Respondents emphasized that, in their view, even viewed in the light most favorable to Salazar-Limon, the facts did not support an excessive-force claim:\n\"Thompson was dealing with a suspect who physically resisted arres[t] while the two stood on a dimly lit overpass of a busy expressway; he was alone with Salazar-Limon and [three] other suspects, all of whom he had not searched; Salazar-Limon disobeyed Thompson's orders to stop and proceeded to walk in the direction of his truck[,] which had not been searched either.\"  Id., Doc. 31, at 20.\nRespondents did not cite Thompson's allegation that Salazar-Limon had turned and reached for his waistband, at  least not in any part of their motion that relied only on undisputed facts; rather, they relied on the facts preceding the alleged turn and reach to argue that Thompson acted reasonably under the circumstances.  See id., at 13-14 (statement of undisputed facts).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents, but on a different understanding of the alleged facts.  In the District Court's view, \"Thompson testified that Salazar[-Limon] stopped walking and start[ed] turning back toward Thompson, reaching toward his waistband,\" and Salazar-Limon \"offered no controverting evidence.\"  97 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at 906.  As a result, the District Court found, \"uncontroverted record evidence\" showed that Salazar-Limon \"disregarded repeated orders, walked away, then turned back toward Thom[p]son and reached for his waistband before Thompson fired.\"  Ibid.; see also ibid. (\"The undisputed summary judgment evidence showe[d] that .\u00a0.\u00a0. as [Salazar-Limon] walked away from Officer Thompson toward his own truck, he reached toward his waistband and began to turn back toward the officer\"); id., at 907 (\"[T]he record shows that when Thompson saw Salazar[-Limon] turn toward him, he was reaching toward his waistband\"); id., at 909 (\"Salazar[-Limon] has pointed to no summary judgment evidence contradicting Thompson's testimony that he shot because .\u00a0.\u00a0. Salazar[-Limon] reached for his waistband and turned toward him\").  On this view of the facts, the District Court held, Thompson was entitled to qualified immunity.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  826 F.\u00a03d 272.  It acknowledged Salazar-Limon's argument that the District Court erred in relying on disputed facts, including its findings that Salazar-Limon had turned and reached for his waistband before he was shot.  Id., at 278.  But it explained that \"only one [of these findings] need be addressed--whether Salazar[-Limon] reached for his waistband before being shot.\"  Ibid.  \"[R]ecord evidence,\" the panel stated, \"shows that Officer Thompson testified that .\u00a0.\u00a0. he saw Salazar[-Limon] reach for his waistband.\"  Ibid.  By contrast, it explained, Salazar-Limon \"did not deny reaching for his waistband; nor has he submitted any other controverting evidence in this regard.\"  Id., at 278-279 (footnote omitted).  To support its assertion, the panel cited only the District Court's finding that \"\u00a0'uncontroverted record evidence shows that Salazar[-Limon] .\u00a0.\u00a0. reached for his waistband before Thompson fired.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 278, n.\u00a05 (quoting 97 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at 906).  Thus adopting the same view of the facts as the District Court had, the panel held that Thompson was shielded by qualified immunity.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not a case that should have been resolved on summary judgment.  Summary judgment is appropriate only where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).  A \"judge's function\" in evaluating a motion for summary judgment is not \"to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.\u00a0S. 242, 249 (1986); see also First Nat. Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.\u00a0S. 253, 289 (1968) (the question at summary judgment is whether a jury should \"resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial\").  In doing so, the court must \"view the facts and draw reasonable inferences 'in the light most favorable to the party opposing the .\u00a0.\u00a0. motion.'\u00a0\"  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.\u00a0S. 372, 378 (2007) (quoting United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.\u00a0S. 654, 655 (1962) (\u00a0per curiam)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying that rule to this case is easy work.  The question before the lower courts was whether the facts, taken in the light most favorable to Salazar-Limon, entitled Thompson to judgment on Salazar-Limon's excessive-force claim.  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.\u00a0S. 194, 201 (2001); Graham v. Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386, 394 (1989).  Although such cases generally require courts to wade through the \"factbound morass of 'reasonableness,'\u00a0\" Scott, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 383, here the question whether Thompson's use of force was reasonable turns in large part on exactly what Salazar-Limon did in the moments before Thompson shot him.  Indeed, the courts below needed to ask only one question: Did Salazar-Limon turn and reach for his waistband, or not?  If he did, Thompson's use of force was reasonable.  If he did not, a jury could justifiably decide that the use of force was excessive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that this case turns in large part on what Salazar-Limon did just before he was shot, it should be obvious that the parties' competing accounts of the event preclude the entry of summary judgment for Thompson.  Thompson attested in a deposition that he fired his gun only after he saw Salazar-Limon turn and \"ma[k]e [a] motion towards his waistband area.\"  Record, Doc. 39-2, at 29.  Salazar-Limon, by contrast, attested that Thompson fired either \"immediately\" or \"seconds\" after telling Salazar-Limon to stop--and in any case before Salazar-Limon turned toward him.  Id., Doc. 39-1, at 7-8.  These accounts flatly contradict each other.  On the one, Salazar-Limon provoked the use of force by turning and raising his hands toward his waistband.  On the other, Thompson shot without being provoked.  It is not for a judge to resolve these \"differing versions of the truth\" on summary judgment, First Nat. Bank, 391 U.\u00a0S., at 289; that question is for a jury to decide at trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts below reached the opposite conclusion only by disregarding basic principles of summary judgment.  The District Court reasoned that Salazar-Limon \"offered no controverting evidence\" against Thompson's testimony that he turned and reached for his waistband before he was shot, 97 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at 906, and the Fifth Circuit similarly reasoned that Salazar-Limon had not \"submitted any other controverting evidence\" regarding that fact, 826 F.\u00a03d, at 279.  This is plainly wrong.  Salazar-Limon's own testimony \"controverted\" Thompson's claim that Salazar-Limon had turned and reached for his waistband.  The sworn testimony of an eyewitness is competent summary judgment evidence.  And Salazar-Limon's testimony \"controverted\" Thompson's; indeed, the two contradict one another in every material way.  Salazar-Limon needed no other evidence to defeat summary judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents defend the judgment below on the ground that Salazar-Limon \"had the opportunity to directly contradict Officer Thompson's testimony,\" but did not do so.  Brief in Opposition 16.  Justice Alito advances the same argument.  Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion).  They argue that Salazar-Limon never explicitly stated, \"I did not reach for my waistband,\" and that his failure to do so permitted the courts below to grant summary judgment to Thompson.  But this inference is questionable at best: Salazar-Limon had no need to introduce such an explicit statement, given respondents' concession that the events immediately preceding the gunshot (including the alleged waistband reach) were subject to dispute.

CITY OF HOUSTON, TEXAS, et\u00a0al.\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit\nNo. 16-515.\u2003Decided April 24, 2017\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Every year the courts of appeals decide hundreds of cases in which they must determine whether thin evidence provided by a plaintiff is just enough to survive a motion for summary judgment or not quite enough.  This is one such case.  Officer Thompson stated in a deposition that he shot Salazar-Limon because he saw him turn toward him and reach for his waist in a movement consistent with reaching for a gun.  Record, Doc. 39-2, pp. 29-30, 33.  Remarkably, Salazar-Limon did not state in his deposition or in an affidavit that he did not reach for his waist, and on that ground the Court of Appeals held that respondents were entitled to summary judgment.  826 F.\u00a03d 272, 278-279 (CA5 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent disagrees with that judgment.  The dissent acknowledges that summary judgment would be proper if the record compelled the conclusion that Salazar-Limon reached for his waist, but the dissent believes that, if the case had gone to trial, a jury could have reasonably inferred that Salazar-Limon did not reach for his waist--even if Salazar-Limon never testified to that fact.  The dissent's conclusion is surely debatable.  But in any event, this Court does not typically grant a petition for a writ of certiorari to review a factual question of this sort, see this Court's Rule 10, and I therefore concur in the denial of review here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write to put our disposition of this petition in perspective.  First, whether or not one agrees with the grant of summary judgment in favor of Officer Thompson, it is clear that the lower courts acted responsibly and attempted faithfully to apply the correct legal rule to what is at best a marginal set of facts.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, this Court applies uniform standards in determining whether to grant review in cases involving allegations that a law enforcement officer engaged in unconstitutional conduct.  We may grant review if the lower court conspicuously failed to apply a governing legal rule.  See this Court's Rule 10.  The dissent cites five such cases in which we granted relief for law enforcement officers, and in all but one of those cases there was no published dissent.  White v. Pauly, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017) (per curiam); Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015) (per curiam); Taylor v. Barkes, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015) (per curiam); Carroll v. Carman, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014) (per curiam); Stanton v. Sims, 571 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2013) (per curiam).  The dissent has not identified a single case in which we failed to grant a similar petition filed by an alleged victim of unconstitutional police conduct.    \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted, regardless of whether the petitioner is an officer or an alleged victim of police misconduct, we rarely grant review where the thrust of the claim is that a lower court simply erred in applying a settled rule of law to the facts of a particular case.  See this Court's Rule 10.  The case before us falls squarely in that category.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is undeniably a tragic case, but as the dissent notes, post, at 8 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), we have no way of determining what actually happened in Houston on the night when Salazar-Limon was shot.  All that the lower courts and this Court can do is to apply the governing rules in a neutral fashion.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nRICARDO SALAZAR-LIMON v. CITY OF HOUSTON, TEXAS, et\u00a0al.\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit\nNo. 16-515.\u2003Decided April 24, 2017\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Just after midnight on October 29, 2010, a Houston police officer shot petitioner Ricardo Salazar-Limon in the back.  Salazar-Limon claims the officer shot him as he tried to walk away from a confrontation with the officer on an overpass.  The officer, by contrast, claims that Salazar-Limon turned toward him and reached for his waistband--as if for a gun--before the officer fired a shot.  The question whether the officer used excessive force in shooting Salazar-Limon thus turns in large part on which man is telling the truth.  Our legal system entrusts this decision to a jury sitting as finder of fact, not a judge reviewing a paper record.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts below thought otherwise.  The District Court credited the officer's version of events and granted summary judgment to respondents--the officer and the city.  97 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d 898 (SD Tex. 2015).  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  826 F.\u00a03d 272 (2016).  But summary judgment is appropriate only where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).  The courts below failed to heed that mandate.  Three Terms ago, we summarily reversed the Fifth Circuit in a case \"reflect[ing] a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards.\"  Tolan v. Cotton, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (\u00a0per curiam) (slip op., at 10).  This case reflects the same fundamental error.  I respectfully dissent from the Court's failure to grant certiorari and reverse.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The encounter at issue here occurred around midnight on October 29, 2010, on the outskirts of Houston, Texas.  Salazar-Limon, who had been drinking, was driving with three other men down Houston's Southwest Freeway.  Houston Police Department Officer Chris Thompson was manning a speed gun on the freeway that night and spotted Salazar-Limon's truck weaving between lanes.  He turned on his lights and sirens, and Salazar-Limon pulled over and stopped on the shoulder of an overpass.  Thompson walked over to the window of Salazar-Limon's truck and asked for his driver's license and proof of insurance, which Salazar-Limon provided.  Thompson checked  Salazar-Limon's license and found no outstanding warrants.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Thompson returned to the truck, the incident quickly escalated.  Thompson asked Salazar-Limon to step out of the truck--apparently intending to conduct a blood alcohol test--and the two men began to walk together toward Thompson's patrol car.  Although the men dispute the details of what happened next, they agree that Thompson tried to put Salazar-Limon in handcuffs; that Salazar-Limon resisted; and that a brief struggle ensued.  At the end of the struggle, Salazar-Limon turned away and began to walk back to his truck, his back to Thompson.  Thompson drew his firearm and told Salazar-Limon to stop walking.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0What matters is what happened next, and here the men tell different stories.  According to Salazar-Limon, Thompson shot him \"immediately\"--at most, within \"seconds\" of the oral command.  Record, Doc. 39-1, p. 8.  Salazar-Limon testified that when the bullet hit his back, he began to turn toward Thompson and then fell to the ground.  Ibid.  Thompson's version of the story differs.  According to Thompson, when he told Salazar-Limon to stop walking, Salazar-Limon raised his hands toward his waistband--as if for a weapon--and turned toward him.  Id., Doc. 39-2, at 29.  Thompson testified that he shot Salazar-Limon only \"[o]nce he made the motion towards his waistband.\"  Ibid.  Salazar-Limon, in other words, claims that Thompson shot him in the back while he was walking away.  Thompson claims that Salazar-Limon provoked the shot by turning toward him and reaching for what he thought was a gun.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Salazar-Limon survived the encounter but sustained crippling injuries.  In 2011, he sued Thompson, the city of Houston, and various police officials, alleging violations of his constitutional rights.  Respondents removed the case to federal court and moved for summary judgment, arguing that Thompson was protected by qualified immunity.1  Respondents emphasized that, in their view, even viewed in the light most favorable to Salazar-Limon, the facts did not support an excessive-force claim:\n\"Thompson was dealing with a suspect who physically resisted arres[t] while the two stood on a dimly lit overpass of a busy expressway; he was alone with Salazar-Limon and [three] other suspects, all of whom he had not searched; Salazar-Limon disobeyed Thompson's orders to stop and proceeded to walk in the direction of his truck[,] which had not been searched either.\"  Id., Doc. 31, at 20.\nRespondents did not cite Thompson's allegation that Salazar-Limon had turned and reached for his waistband, at  least not in any part of their motion that relied only on undisputed facts; rather, they relied on the facts preceding the alleged turn and reach to argue that Thompson acted reasonably under the circumstances.  See id., at 13-14 (statement of undisputed facts).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted summary judgment to respondents, but on a different understanding of the alleged facts.  In the District Court's view, \"Thompson testified that Salazar[-Limon] stopped walking and start[ed] turning back toward Thompson, reaching toward his waistband,\" and Salazar-Limon \"offered no controverting evidence.\"  97 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at 906.  As a result, the District Court found, \"uncontroverted record evidence\" showed that Salazar-Limon \"disregarded repeated orders, walked away, then turned back toward Thom[p]son and reached for his waistband before Thompson fired.\"  Ibid.; see also ibid. (\"The undisputed summary judgment evidence showe[d] that .\u00a0.\u00a0. as [Salazar-Limon] walked away from Officer Thompson toward his own truck, he reached toward his waistband and began to turn back toward the officer\"); id., at 907 (\"[T]he record shows that when Thompson saw Salazar[-Limon] turn toward him, he was reaching toward his waistband\"); id., at 909 (\"Salazar[-Limon] has pointed to no summary judgment evidence contradicting Thompson's testimony that he shot because .\u00a0.\u00a0. Salazar[-Limon] reached for his waistband and turned toward him\").  On this view of the facts, the District Court held, Thompson was entitled to qualified immunity.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  826 F.\u00a03d 272.  It acknowledged Salazar-Limon's argument that the District Court erred in relying on disputed facts, including its findings that Salazar-Limon had turned and reached for his waistband before he was shot.  Id., at 278.  But it explained that \"only one [of these findings] need be addressed--whether Salazar[-Limon] reached for his waistband before being shot.\"  Ibid.  \"[R]ecord evidence,\" the panel stated, \"shows that Officer Thompson testified that .\u00a0.\u00a0. he saw Salazar[-Limon] reach for his waistband.\"  Ibid.  By contrast, it explained, Salazar-Limon \"did not deny reaching for his waistband; nor has he submitted any other controverting evidence in this regard.\"  Id., at 278-279 (footnote omitted).  To support its assertion, the panel cited only the District Court's finding that \"\u00a0'uncontroverted record evidence shows that Salazar[-Limon] .\u00a0.\u00a0. reached for his waistband before Thompson fired.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 278, n.\u00a05 (quoting 97 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at 906).  Thus adopting the same view of the facts as the District Court had, the panel held that Thompson was shielded by qualified immunity.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not a case that should have been resolved on summary judgment.  Summary judgment is appropriate only where \"there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 56(a).  A \"judge's function\" in evaluating a motion for summary judgment is not \"to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.\"  Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.\u00a0S. 242, 249 (1986); see also First Nat. Bank of Ariz. v. Cities Service Co., 391 U.\u00a0S. 253, 289 (1968) (the question at summary judgment is whether a jury should \"resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth at trial\").  In doing so, the court must \"view the facts and draw reasonable inferences 'in the light most favorable to the party opposing the .\u00a0.\u00a0. motion.'\u00a0\"  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.\u00a0S. 372, 378 (2007) (quoting United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.\u00a0S. 654, 655 (1962) (\u00a0per curiam)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying that rule to this case is easy work.  The question before the lower courts was whether the facts, taken in the light most favorable to Salazar-Limon, entitled Thompson to judgment on Salazar-Limon's excessive-force claim.  Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.\u00a0S. 194, 201 (2001); Graham v. Connor, 490 U.\u00a0S. 386, 394 (1989).  Although such cases generally require courts to wade through the \"factbound morass of 'reasonableness,'\u00a0\" Scott, 550 U.\u00a0S., at 383, here the question whether Thompson's use of force was reasonable turns in large part on exactly what Salazar-Limon did in the moments before Thompson shot him.  Indeed, the courts below needed to ask only one question: Did Salazar-Limon turn and reach for his waistband, or not?  If he did, Thompson's use of force was reasonable.  If he did not, a jury could justifiably decide that the use of force was excessive.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given that this case turns in large part on what Salazar-Limon did just before he was shot, it should be obvious that the parties' competing accounts of the event preclude the entry of summary judgment for Thompson.  Thompson attested in a deposition that he fired his gun only after he saw Salazar-Limon turn and \"ma[k]e [a] motion towards his waistband area.\"  Record, Doc. 39-2, at 29.  Salazar-Limon, by contrast, attested that Thompson fired either \"immediately\" or \"seconds\" after telling Salazar-Limon to stop--and in any case before Salazar-Limon turned toward him.  Id., Doc. 39-1, at 7-8.  These accounts flatly contradict each other.  On the one, Salazar-Limon provoked the use of force by turning and raising his hands toward his waistband.  On the other, Thompson shot without being provoked.  It is not for a judge to resolve these \"differing versions of the truth\" on summary judgment, First Nat. Bank, 391 U.\u00a0S., at 289; that question is for a jury to decide at trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts below reached the opposite conclusion only by disregarding basic principles of summary judgment.  The District Court reasoned that Salazar-Limon \"offered no controverting evidence\" against Thompson's testimony that he turned and reached for his waistband before he was shot, 97 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a03d, at 906, and the Fifth Circuit similarly reasoned that Salazar-Limon had not \"submitted any other controverting evidence\" regarding that fact, 826 F.\u00a03d, at 279.  This is plainly wrong.  Salazar-Limon's own testimony \"controverted\" Thompson's claim that Salazar-Limon had turned and reached for his waistband.  The sworn testimony of an eyewitness is competent summary judgment evidence.  And Salazar-Limon's testimony \"controverted\" Thompson's; indeed, the two contradict one another in every material way.  Salazar-Limon needed no other evidence to defeat summary judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents defend the judgment below on the ground that Salazar-Limon \"had the opportunity to directly contradict Officer Thompson's testimony,\" but did not do so.  Brief in Opposition 16.  Justice Alito advances the same argument.  Ante, at 1 (concurring opinion).  They argue that Salazar-Limon never explicitly stated, \"I did not reach for my waistband,\" and that his failure to do so permitted the courts below to grant summary judgment to Thompson.  But this inference is questionable at best: Salazar-Limon had no need to introduce such an explicit statement, given respondents' concession that the events immediately preceding the gunshot (including the alleged waistband reach) were subject to dispute.  See Record, Doc. 31, at 13-14.  And even if the inference respondents suggest was a reasonable one, it would be improper at the summary judgment stage.  At that stage, all \"reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party\"--here, Salazar-Limon.  Tolan, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  The most natural inference to be drawn from Salazar-Limon's testimony was that he neither turned nor reached for his waistband before he was shot--especially as no gun was ever recovered.  See Cruz v. Anaheim, 765 F.\u00a03d 1076, 1079 (CA9 2014) (\"In this case, there's circumstantial evidence that could give a reasonable jury pause.  Most obvious is the fact that [the victim] didn't have a gun on him, so why would he have reached for his waistband?\").2  Respondents' argument to the contrary \"reflects a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards.\"  Tolan, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not a difficult case.  When a police officer claims that the victim of the use of force took some act that would have justified that force, and the victim claims he did not, summary judgment is improper.  The Fifth Circuit's decision should be reversed.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Only Thompson and Salazar-Limon know what happened on that overpass on October 29, 2010.  It is possible that Salazar-Limon did something that Thompson reasonably found threatening; it is also possible that Thompson shot an unarmed man in the back without justification.  What is clear is that our legal system does not entrust the resolution of this dispute to a judge faced with competing affidavits.

The employee apparently believed he was referencing an incendiary \"Molotov cocktail\" and asked if it would \"burn anything up.\"  Ibid.  Perez claims he responded that he did not have \"that type\" of cocktail, and that the whole group laughed at the apparent joke.  Ibid.  Imprudently, however, the inebriated Perez continued the banter, telling another employee that he had only \"one Molotov cocktail\" and could \"blow the whole place up.\"  App. C to Brief in Opposition 82.  Perez later returned to the store and allegedly said, \"\u00a0'I'm going to blow up this whole [expletive] world.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 121.  Store employees reported the incident to police the next day.  Sentencing Tr. 15, 34.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State prosecuted Perez for violating a Florida statute that makes it a felony \"to threaten to throw, project, place, or discharge any destructive device with intent to do bodily harm to any person or with intent to do damage to any property of any person.\"  Fla. Stat. \u00a7790.162 (2007).  The trial court instructed the jury that they could return a guilty verdict if the State proved two elements.  First, the State had to prove the actus reus; that is, the threat itself.  The instruction defined a threat as \"a communicated intent to inflict harm or loss on another when viewed and\/or heard by an ordinary reasonable person.\"  App. F to Brief in Opposition 350.  Second, the State had to prove that Perez possessed the necessary mens rea; that is, that he intended to make the threat.  Circularly, the instruction defined intent as \"the stated intent to do bodily harm to any person or damage to the property of any person.\"  Ibid.  This instruction permitted the jury to convict Perez based on what he \"stated\" alone--irrespective of whether his words represented a joke, the ramblings of an intoxicated individual, or a credible threat.  The jury found Perez guilty, and because he qualified as a habitual offender, the trial court sentenced him to 15 years and 1 day in prison.  Sentencing Tr. 44.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the courts below and in his petition for certiorari, Perez challenged the instruction primarily on the ground that it contravenes the traditional rule that criminal statutes be interpreted to require proof of mens rea, see Elonis v. United States, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 9-13).  In my view, however, the jury instruction--and Perez's conviction--raise serious First Amendment concerns worthy of this Court's review.  But because the lower courts did not reach the First Amendment question, I reluctantly concur in the Court's denial of certiorari in this case.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Amendment's protection of speech and expression does not extend to threats of physical violence.  See R.\u00a0A.\u00a0V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.\u00a0S. 377, 388 (1992).  Statutes criminalizing threatening speech, however, \"must be interpreted with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind\" in order to distinguish true threats from constitutionally protected speech.  Watts v. United States, 394 U.\u00a0S. 705, 707 (1969) (per curiam).  Under our cases, this distinction turns in part on the speaker's intent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We suggested as much in Watts.  There, we faced a constitutional challenge to a criminal threat statute and expressed \"grave doubts\" that the First Amendment permitted a criminal conviction if the speaker merely \"uttered the charged words with an apparent determination to carry them into execution.\"  Id., at 708, 707 (emphasis and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Virginia v.

The plurality reached this conclusion because \"a burning cross is not always intended to intimidate.\"  Id., at 365.  Two separate opinions endorsed this view.

And these two cases strongly suggest that it is not enough that a reasonable person might have understood the words as a threat--a jury must find that the speaker actually intended to convey a threat.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury instruction in this case relieved the State of its burden of proving anything other than Perez's \"stated\" or \"communicated\" intent.

And like the prima facie provision in Black, the trial court's jury instruction \"ignore[d] all of the contextual factors that are necessary to decide whether a particular [expression] is intended to intimidate.\"  538 U.\u00a0S., at 367 (plurality opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Context in this case might have made a difference.

Instead of being instructed to weigh this evidence to determine whether Perez actually intended to convey a threat--or even whether a reasonable person would have construed Perez's words as a threat--the jury was directed to convict solely on the basis of what Perez \"stated.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In an appropriate case, the Court should affirm that \"[t]he First Amendment does not permit such a shortcut.\"  Black, 538 U.\u00a0S., at 367 (plurality opinion).

AMGEN INC. ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-1039\nArgued: April 26, 2017Decided: June 12, 2017\n\n\nThe Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA or Act) provides an abbreviated pathway for obtaining Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of a drug that is biosimilar to an already licensed biological product (reference product).  42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7262(k).  It also provides procedures for resolving patent disputes between biosimilar manufacturers (applicants) and manufacturers of reference products (sponsors).  \u00a7262(l).  The Act treats the mere submission of a biosimilar application as an \"artificial\" act of infringement, enabling parties to bring patent infringement actions at certain points in the application process even if the applicant has not committed a traditional act of patent infringement.  See 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), an applicant seeking FDA approval of a biosimilar must provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant that it has accepted the application for review.  This triggers an exchange of information between the applicant and sponsor designed to create lists of relevant patents and flesh out potential legal arguments.  \u00a7262(l)(3).  The BPCIA then channels the parties into two phases of patent litigation.  In the first, the parties collaborate to identify patents on the lists for immediate litigation.  The second phase--triggered when the applicant, pursuant to \u00a7262(l)(8)(A), gives the sponsor notice at least 180 days before commercially marketing the biosimilar--involves any listed patents not litigated in the first phase.  The applicant has substantial control over the timing and scope of both phases of litigation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Failure to comply with these procedural requirements may lead to two consequences relevant here.  Under \u00a7262(l)(9)(C), if an applicant fails to provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), then the sponsor, but not the applicant, may immediately bring an action \"for a declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product.\"  And under \u00a7262(l)(9)(B), if an applicant provides the application and manufacturing information but fails to complete a subsequent step in the process, the sponsor, but not the applicant, may bring a declaratory-judgment action with respect to any patent included on the sponsor's list of relevant patents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neupogen is a filgrastim product marketed by Amgen, which claims to hold patents on methods of manufacturing and using filgrastim.  Sandoz sought FDA approval to market a biosimilar filgrastim product under the brand name Zarxio, with Neupogen as the reference product.  A day after the FDA informed Sandoz that its application had been accepted for review, Sandoz notified Amgen that it had submitted an application and that it intended to market Zarxio immediately upon receiving FDA approval.  It later informed Amgen that it did not intend to provide the application and manufacturing information required by \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) and that Amgen could sue immediately for infringement under \u00a7262(l)(9)(C).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amgen sued Sandoz for patent infringement and also asserted that Sandoz engaged in \"unlawful\" conduct in violation of California's unfair competition law.  This latter claim was predicated on two alleged violations of the BPCIA: Sandoz's failure to provide its application and manufacturing information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), and its provision of notice of commercial marketing under \u00a7262(l)(8)(A) prior to obtaining licensure from the FDA.  Amgen sought injunctions to enforce both BPCIA requirements.  Sandoz counterclaimed for declaratory judgments that the asserted patent was invalid and not infringed and that it had not violated the BPCIA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the case was pending, the FDA licensed Zarxio, and Sandoz provided Amgen a further notice of commercial marketing.  The District Court subsequently granted partial judgment on the pleadings to Sandoz on its BPCIA counterclaims and dismissed Amgen's unfair competition claims with prejudice.  The Federal Circuit affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.  The court affirmed the dismissal of Amgen's state-law claim based on Sandoz's alleged violation of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), holding that Sandoz did not violate the BPCIA in failing to disclose its application and manufacturing information and that the BPCIA provides the exclusive remedies for failure to comply with this requirement.  The court also held that under \u00a7262(l)(8)(A) an applicant must provide notice of commercial marketing after obtaining licensure, and that this requirement is mandatory.  It thus enjoined Sandoz from marketing Zarxio until 180 days after the date it provided its second notice.\nHeld:\u00a0Section 262(l)(2)(A) is not enforceable by injunction under federal law, but the Federal Circuit on remand should determine whether a state-law injunction is available.  An applicant may provide notice under \u00a7262(l)(8)(A) prior to obtaining licensure.  Pp.\u00a010-18.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Section 262(l)(2)(A)'s requirement that an applicant provide the sponsor with its application and manufacturing information is not enforceable by an injunction under federal law.  The Federal Circuit reached the proper result on this point, but its reasoning was flawed.  It cited \u00a7271(e)(4), which expressly provides the \"only remedies\" for an act of artificial infringement.  In light of this language, the court reasoned that no remedy other than those specified in the text--such as an injunction to compel the applicant to provide its application and manufacturing information--was available.  The problem with this reasoning is that Sandoz's failure to disclose was not an act of artificial infringement remediable under \u00a7271(e)(4).  Submitting an application constitutes an act of artificial infringement; failing to disclose the application and manufacturing information required by \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) does not.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Another provision, \u00a7262(l)(9)(C), provides a remedy for an applicant's failure to turn over its application and manufacturing information.  It authorizes the sponsor, but not the applicant, to bring an immediate declaratory-judgment action for artificial infringement, thus vesting in the sponsor the control that the applicant would otherwise have exercised over the scope and timing of the patent litigation and depriving the applicant of the certainty it could have obtained by bringing a declaratory-judgment action prior to marketing its product.  The presence of this remedy, coupled with the absence of any other textually specified remedies, indicates that Congress did not intend sponsors to have access to injunctive relief, at least as a matter of federal law, to enforce the disclosure requirement.  See Great-West Life & Annuity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.\u00a0S. 204, 209.  Statutory context further confirms that Congress did not authorize courts to enforce \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) by injunction.  Pp.\u00a010-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Federal Circuit should determine on remand whether an injunction is available under state law to enforce \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).  Whether Sandoz's conduct was \"unlawful\" under California's unfair competition statute is a question of state law, and the Federal Circuit thus erred in attempting to answer that question by referring only to the BPCIA.  There is no dispute about how the federal scheme actually works on the facts of this case: Sandoz failed to disclose the requisite information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), and was accordingly subject to the consequence specified in \u00a7262(l)(9)(C).  As a result, there is nothing to decide on this point as a matter of federal law.  The court on remand should determine whether California law would treat noncompliance with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) as \"unlawful,\" and whether the BPCIA pre-empts any additional state-law remedy for failure to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).  Pp.\u00a013-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0An applicant may provide notice of commercial marketing before obtaining a license.  Section 262(l)(8)(A) states that the applicant \"shall provide notice to the reference product sponsor not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsection (k).\"  Because the phrase \"of the biological product licensed under subsection (k)\" modifies \"commercial marketing\" rather than \"notice,\" \"commercial marketing\" is the point in time by which the biosimilar must be \"licensed.\"  Accordingly, the applicant may provide notice either before or after receiving FDA approval.  Statutory context confirms that \u00a7262(l)(8)(A) contains a single timing requirement (180 days before marketing), rather than the two requirements posited by the Federal Circuit (after licensing, and 180 days before marketing).  \"Had Congress intended to\" impose two timing requirements in \u00a7262(l)(8)(A), \"it presumably would have done so expressly as it did in the\" adjacent provision, \u00a7262(l)(8)(B).  Russello v. United States, 464 U. S. 16, 23.  Amgen's contrary arguments are unpersuasive, and its various policy arguments cannot overcome the statute's plain language.

The BPCIA governs a type of drug called a biosimilar, which is a biologic product that is highly similar to a biologic product that has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  Under \u00a7262(l), an applicant that seeks FDA approval of a biosimilar must provide its application materials and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the corresponding biologic within 20 days of the date the FDA notifies the applicant that it has accepted the application for review.  The applicant then must give notice to the manufacturer at least 180 days before marketing the biosimilar commercially.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question presented by these cases is whether the requirement that an applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the manufacturer of the biologic is enforceable by injunction.  We conclude that an injunction is not available under federal law, but we remand for the court below to decide whether an injunction is available under state law.  The second question is whether the applicant must give notice to the manufacturer after, rather than before, obtaining a license from the FDA for its biosimilar.  We conclude that an applicant may provide notice before obtaining a license.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complex statutory scheme at issue in these cases establishes processes both for obtaining FDA approval of biosimilars and for resolving patent disputes between manufacturers of licensed biologics and manufacturers of biosimilars.  Before turning to the questions presented, we first explain the statutory background.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A biologic is a type of drug derived from natural, biological sources such as animals or microorganisms.  Biologics thus differ from traditional drugs, which are typically synthesized from chemicals.1  A manufacturer of a biologic may market the drug only if the FDA has licensed it pursuant to either of two review processes set forth in \u00a7262.  The default pathway for approval, used for new biologics, is set forth in \u00a7262(a).  Under that subsection, the FDA may license a new biologic if, among other things, the manufacturer demonstrates that it is \"safe, pure, and potent.\"  \u00a7262(a)(2)(C)(i)(I).  In addition to this default route, the statute also prescribes an alternative, abbreviated route for FDA approval of biosimilars, which is set forth in \u00a7262(k).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To obtain approval through the BPCIA's abbreviated process, the manufacturer of a biosimilar (applicant) does not need to show that the product is \"safe, pure, and potent.\"  Instead, the applicant may piggyback on the showing made by the manufacturer (sponsor) of a previously licensed biologic (reference product).  See \u00a7262(k)(2)(A)(iii).  An applicant must show that its product is \"highly similar\" to the reference product and that there are no \"clinically meaningful differences\" between the two in terms of \"safety, purity, and potency.\"  \u00a7\u00a7262(i)(2)(A), (B); see also \u00a7262(k)(2)(A)(i)(I).  An applicant may not submit an application until 4 years after the reference product is first licensed, and the FDA may not license a biosimilar until 12 years after the reference product is first licensed.  \u00a7\u00a7262(k)(7)(A), (B).  As a result, the manufacturer of a new biologic enjoys a 12-year period when its biologic may be marketed without competition from biosimilars.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A sponsor may hold multiple patents covering the biologic, its therapeutic uses, and the processes used to manufacture it.  Those patents may constrain an applicant's ability to market its biosimilar even after the expiration of the 12-year exclusivity period contained in \u00a7262(k)(7)(A).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BPCIA facilitates litigation during the period preceding FDA approval so that the parties do not have to wait until commercial marketing to resolve their patent disputes.  It enables the parties to bring infringement actions at certain points in the application process, even if the applicant has not yet committed an act that would traditionally constitute patent infringement.  See 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(a) (traditionally infringing acts include making, using, offering to sell, or selling any patented invention within the United States without authority to do so).  Specifically, it provides that the mere submission of a biosimilar application constitutes an act of infringement.  \u00a7\u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii).  We will refer to this kind of preapproval infringement as \"artificial\" infringement.  Section 271(e)(4) provides remedies for artificial infringement, including injunctive relief and damages.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The BPCIA sets forth a carefully calibrated scheme for preparing to adjudicate, and then adjudicating, claims of infringement.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7262(l).  When the FDA accepts an application for review, it notifies the applicant, who within 20 days \"shall provide\" to the sponsor a copy of the application and information about how the biosimilar is manufactured.  \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).  The applicant also \"may provide\" the sponsor with any additional information that it requests.  \u00a7262(l)(2)(B).  These disclosures enable the sponsor to evaluate the biosimilar for possible infringement of patents it holds on the reference product (i.e., the corresponding biologic).  \u00a7262(l)(1)(D).  The information the applicant provides is subject to strict confidentiality rules, enforceable by injunction.  See \u00a7262(l)(1)(H).  The first question presented by these cases is whether \u00a7262(l)(2)(A)'s requirement--that the applicant provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor--is itself enforceable by injunction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the applicant makes the requisite disclosures, the parties exchange information to identify relevant patents and to flesh out the legal arguments that they might raise in future litigation.  Within 60 days of receiving the application and manufacturing information, the sponsor \"shall provide\" to the applicant \"a list of patents\" for which it believes it could assert an infringement claim if a person without a license made, used, offered to sell, sold, or imported \"the biological product that is the subject of the [biosimilar] application.\"  \u00a7262(l)(3)(A)(i).  The sponsor must also identify any patents on the list that it would be willing to license.  \u00a7262(l)(3)(A)(ii).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Next, within 60 days of receiving the sponsor's list, the applicant may provide to the sponsor a list of patents that the applicant believes are relevant but that the sponsor omitted from its own list, \u00a7262(l)(3)(B)(i), and \"shall provide\" to the sponsor reasons why it could not be held liable for infringing the relevant patents, \u00a7262(l)(3)(B)(ii).  The applicant may argue that the relevant patents are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed, or the applicant may agree not to market the biosimilar until a particular patent has expired.  Ibid.  The applicant must also respond  to the sponsor's offers to license particular patents.  \u00a7262(l)(3)(B)(iii).  Then, within 60 days of receiving the applicant's responses, the sponsor \"shall provide\" to the applicant its own arguments concerning infringement, enforceability, and validity as to each relevant patent.  \u00a7262(l)(3)(C).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following this exchange, the BPCIA channels the parties into two phases of patent litigation.  In the first phase, the parties collaborate to identify patents that they would like to litigate immediately.  The second phase is triggered by the applicant's notice of commercial marketing and involves any patents that were included on the parties' \u00a7262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the outset of the first phase, the applicant and the sponsor must negotiate to determine which patents included on the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists will be litigated immediately.  See \u00a7\u00a7262(l)(4)(A), (l)(6).  If they cannot agree, then they must engage in another list exchange.  \u00a7262(l)(4)(B).  The applicant \"shall notify\" the sponsor of the number of patents it intends to list for litigation, \u00a7262(l)(5)(A), and, within five days, the parties \"shall simultaneously exchange\" lists of the patents they would like to litigate immediately.  \u00a7262(l)(5)(B)(i).  This process gives the applicant substantial control over the scope of the first phase of litigation: The number of patents on the sponsor's list is limited to the number contained in the applicant's list, though the sponsor always has the right to list at least one patent.  \u00a7262(l)(5)(B)(ii).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties then proceed to litigate infringement with respect to the patents they agreed to litigate or, if they failed to agree, the patents contained on the lists they simultaneously exchanged under \u00a7262(l)(5).  \u00a7\u00a7262(l)(6)(A), (B).  Section 271(e)(2)(C)(i) facilitates this first phase of litigation by making it an act of artificial infringement, with respect to any patent included on the parties' \u00a7262(l)(3) lists, to submit an application for a license from the FDA.  The sponsor \"shall bring an action\" in court within 30 days of the date of agreement or the simultaneous list exchange.  \u00a7\u00a7262(l)(6)(A), (B).  If the sponsor brings a timely action and prevails, it may obtain a remedy provided by \u00a7271(e)(4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second phase of litigation involves patents that were included on the original \u00a7262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase (and any patents that the sponsor acquired after the \u00a7262(l)(3) exchange occurred and added to the lists, see \u00a7262(l)(7)).  The second phase is commenced by the applicant's notice of commercial marketing, which the applicant \"shall provide\" to the sponsor \"not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsection (k).\"  \u00a7262(l)(8)(A).  The BPCIA bars any declaratory judgment action prior to this notice.  \u00a7262(l)(9)(A) (prohibiting, in situations where the parties have complied with each step of the BPCIA process, either the sponsor or the applicant from seeking a \"declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent\" that was included on the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase \"prior to the date notice is received under paragraph (8)(A)\").  Because the applicant (subject to certain constraints) chooses when to begin commercial marketing and when to give notice, it wields substantial control over the timing of the second phase of litigation.  The second question presented is whether notice is effective if an applicant provides it prior to the FDA's decision to license the biosimilar.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this second phase of litigation, either party may sue for declaratory relief.  See \u00a7262(l)(9)(A).  In addition, prior to the date of first commercial marketing, the sponsor may \"seek a preliminary injunction prohibiting the [biosimilar] applicant from engaging in the commercial manufacture or sale of [the biosimilar] until the court decides the issue of patent validity, enforcement, and infringement with respect to any patent that\" was included on the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists but not litigated in the first phase.  \u00a7262(l)(8)(B).\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the parties comply with each step outlined in the BPCIA, they will have the opportunity to litigate the relevant patents before the biosimilar is marketed.  To encourage parties to comply with its procedural requirements, the BPCIA includes various consequences for failing to do so.  Two of the BPCIA's remedial provisions are at issue here.  Under \u00a7262(l)(9)(C), if an applicant fails to provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor--thus effectively pretermitting the entire two-phase litigation process--then the sponsor, but not the applicant, may immediately bring an action \"for a declaration of infringement, validity, or enforceability of any patent that claims the biological product or a use of the biological product.\"  Section 271(e)(2)(C)(ii) facilitates this action by making it an artificial act of infringement, with respect to any patent that could have been included on the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists, to submit a biosimilar application.  Similarly, when an applicant provides the application and manufacturing information but fails to complete a subsequent step, \u00a7262(l)(9)(B) provides that the sponsor, but not the applicant, may bring a declaratory-judgment action with respect to any patent included on the sponsor's \u00a7262(l)(3)(A) list of patents (as well as those it acquired later and added to the list).  As noted, it is an act of artificial infringement, with respect to any patent on the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists, to submit an application to the FDA.  See \u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(i).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These cases concern filgrastim, a biologic used to stimulate the production of white blood cells.  Amgen, the respondent in No. 15-1039 and the petitioner in No. 15-1195, has marketed a filgrastim product called Neupogen since 1991 and claims to hold patents on methods of manufacturing and using filgrastim.  In May 2014, Sandoz, the petitioner in No. 15-1039 and the respondent in No.\u00a015-1195, filed an application with the FDA seeking approval to market a filgrastim biosimilar under the brand name Zarxio, with Neupogen as the reference product.  The FDA informed Sandoz on July 7, 2014, that it had accepted the application for review.  One day later, Sandoz notified Amgen both that it had submitted an application and that it intended to begin marketing Zarxio immediately upon receiving FDA approval, which it expected in the first half of 2015.  Sandoz later confirmed that it did not intend to provide the requisite application and manufacturing information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) and informed Amgen that Amgen could sue for infringement immediately under \u00a7262(l)(9)(C).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In October 2014, Amgen sued Sandoz for patent infringement.  Amgen also asserted two claims under California's unfair competition law, which prohibits \"any unlawful .\u00a0.\u00a0. business act or practice.\"  Cal. Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. \u00a717200 (West 2008).  A \"business act or practice\" is \"unlawful\" under the unfair competition law if it violates a rule contained in some other state or federal statute.  Rose v. Bank of America, N.\u00a0A., 57 Cal. 4th 390, 396, 304 P.\u00a03d 181, 185 (2013).  Amgen alleged that Sandoz engaged in \"unlawful\" conduct when it failed to provide its application and manufacturing information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), and when it provided notice of commercial marketing under \u00a7262(l)(8)(A) before, rather than after, the FDA licensed its biosimilar.  Amgen sought injunctions to enforce both requirements.  Sandoz counterclaimed for declaratory judgments that the asserted patent was invalid and not infringed and that it had not violated the BPCIA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the case was pending in the District Court, the FDA licensed Zarxio, and Sandoz provided Amgen a further notice of commercial marketing.  The District Court subsequently granted partial judgment on the pleadings to Sandoz on its BPCIA counterclaims and dismissed Amgen's unfair competition claims with prejudice.  2015 WL 1264756, *7-*9 (ND Cal., Mar. 19, 2015).  After the District Court entered final judgment as to these claims, Amgen appealed to the Federal Circuit, which granted an injunction pending appeal against the commercial marketing of Zarxio.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A divided Federal Circuit affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded.  First, the court affirmed the dismissal of Amgen's state-law claim based on Sandoz's alleged violation of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).  It held that Sandoz did not violate the BPCIA in failing to disclose its application and manufacturing information.  It further held that the remedies contained in the BPCIA are the exclusive remedies for an applicant's failure to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).  794 F.\u00a03d 1347, 1357, 1360 (2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the court held that an applicant may provide effective notice of commercial marketing only after the FDA has licensed the biosimilar.  Id., at 1358.  Accordingly, the 180-day clock began after Sandoz's second, postlicensure notice.  The Federal Circuit further concluded that the notice requirement is mandatory and extended its injunction pending appeal to bar Sandoz from marketing Zarxio until 180 days after the date it provided its second notice.  Id., at 1360-1361.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted Sandoz's petition for certiorari, No. 15-1039, and Amgen's conditional cross-petition for certiorari, No.\u00a015-1195, and consolidated the cases.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question we must answer is whether \u00a7262(l)(2)(A)'s requirement that an applicant provide the sponsor with its application and manufacturing information is enforceable by an injunction under either federal or state law.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We agree with the Federal Circuit that an injunction under federal law is not available to enforce \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), though for slightly different reasons than those provided by the court below.  The Federal Circuit held that \"42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7262(l)(9)(C) and 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7271(e) expressly provide the only remedies\" for a violation of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), 794 F.\u00a03d, at 1357, and neither of those provisions authorizes a court to compel compliance with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).  In concluding that the remedies specified in the BPCIA are exclusive, the Federal Circuit relied primarily on \u00a7271(e)(4), which states that it provides \"\u00a0'the only remedies which may be granted by a court for an act of [artificial] infringement.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 1356 (emphasis deleted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The flaw in the Federal Circuit's reasoning is that Sandoz's failure to disclose its application and manufacturing information was not an act of artificial infringement, and thus was not remediable under \u00a7271(e)(4).  Submitting an application constitutes an act of artificial infringement.  See \u00a7\u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(i), (ii) (\"It shall be an act of infringement to submit .\u00a0.\u00a0. an application seeking approval of a biological product\").  Failing to disclose the application and manufacturing information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) does not.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Federal Circuit relied on \u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(ii), which states that \"[i]t shall be an act of infringement to submit[,] if the applicant for the application fails to provide the application and information required under [\u00a7262(l)(2)(A)], an application seeking approval of a biological product for a patent that could be identified pursuant to [\u00a7262(l)(3)(A)(i)].\"  (Emphasis added.)  The court appeared to conclude, based on the italicized language, that an applicant's noncompliance with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) is an element of the act of artificial infringement (along with the submission of the application).  794 F.\u00a03d, at 1356.  We disagree.  The italicized language merely assists in identifying which patents will be the subject of the artificial infringement suit.  It does not define the act of artificial infringement itself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This conclusion follows from the structure of \u00a7271(e)(2)(C).  Clause (i) of \u00a7271(e)(2)(C) defines artificial infringement in the situation where the parties proceed through the list exchange process and the patents subject to suit are those contained in the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists, as supplemented under \u00a7262(l)(7).  That clause provides that it is an act of artificial infringement to submit, \"with respect to a patent that is identified in the list of patents described in [\u00a7262(l)(3)] (including as provided under [\u00a7262(l)(7)]), an application seeking approval of a biological product.\"  (Emphasis added.)  Clause (ii) of \u00a7271(e)(2)(C), in contrast, defines artificial infringement in the situation where an applicant fails to disclose its application and manufacturing information altogether and the parties never prepare the \u00a7262(l)(3) lists.  That clause provides that the submission of the application represents an act of artificial infringement with respect to any patent that could have been included on the lists.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this way, the two clauses of \u00a7271(e)(2)(C) work in tandem.  They both treat submission of the application as the act of artificial infringement for which \u00a7271(e)(4) provides the remedies.  And they both identify the patents subject to suit, although by different means depending on whether the applicant disclosed its application and manufacturing information under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).  If the applicant made the disclosures, clause (i) applies; if it did not, clause (ii) applies.  In neither instance is the applicant's failure to provide its application and manufacturing information an element of the act of artificial infringement, and in neither instance does \u00a7271(e)(4) provide a remedy for that failure.  See Brief for Amgen Inc. et\u00a0al. 66-67 (conceding both points).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A separate provision of \u00a7262, however, does provide a remedy for an applicant's failure to turn over its application and manufacturing information.  When an applicant fails to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), \u00a7262(l)(9)(C) authorizes the sponsor, but not the applicant, to bring an immediate declaratory-judgment action for artificial infringement as defined in \u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(ii).  Section 262(l)(9)(C) thus vests in the sponsor the control that the applicant would otherwise have exercised over the scope and timing of the  patent litigation.  It also deprives the applicant of the certainty that it could have obtained by bringing  a declaratory-judgment action prior to marketing its  product.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The remedy provided by \u00a7262(l)(9)(C) excludes all other federal remedies, including injunctive relief.  Where, as here, \"a statute expressly provides a remedy, courts must be especially reluctant to provide additional remedies.\"  Karahalios v. Federal Employees, 489 U.\u00a0S. 527, 533 (1989).  The BPCIA's \"carefully crafted and detailed enforcement scheme provides strong evidence that Congress did not intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.\"  Great-West Life & Annu- ity Ins. Co. v. Knudson, 534 U.\u00a0S. 204, 209 (2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The presence of \u00a7262(l)(9)(C), coupled with the absence of any other textually specified remedies, indicates that Congress did not intend sponsors to have access to injunctive relief, at least as a matter of federal law, to enforce the disclosure requirement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statutory context further confirms that Congress did not authorize courts to enforce \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) by injunction.  Section 262(l)(1)(H) provides that \"the court shall consider immediate injunctive relief to be an appropriate and necessary remedy for any violation or threatened violation\" of the rules governing the confidentiality of information disclosed under \u00a7262(l).  We assume that Congress acted intentionally when it provided an injunctive remedy for breach of the confidentiality requirements but not for breach of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A)'s disclosure requirement.  Cf. Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.\u00a0S. 560, 572 (1979) (\"[W]hen Congress wished to provide a private damage remedy, it knew how to do so and did so expressly\").2  Accordingly, the Federal Circuit properly declined to grant an injunction under federal law.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit rejected Amgen's request for an injunction under state law for two reasons.  First, it interpreted California's unfair competition law not to provide a remedy when the underlying statute specifies an \"expressly  .\u00a0.\u00a0. exclusive\" remedy.  794 F.\u00a03d, at 1360 (citing Cal.  Bus. & Prof. Code Ann. \u00a717205; Loeffler v. Target Corp., 58 Cal. 4th 1081, 1125-1126, 324 P.\u00a03d 50, 76 (2014)).  It further held that \u00a7271(e)(4), by its text, \"provides 'the only remedies'\u00a0\" for an applicant's failure to disclose its application and manufacturing information.  794 F.\u00a03d, at 1360 (quoting \u00a7271(e)(4)).  The court thus concluded that no state remedy was available for Sandoz's alleged violation of \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) under the terms of California's unfair competition law.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This state-law holding rests on an incorrect interpretation of federal law.  As we have explained, failure to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) is not an act of artificial infringement.  Because \u00a7271(e)(4) provides remedies only for artificial infringement, it provides no remedy at all, much less an \"expressly .\u00a0.\u00a0. exclusive\" one, for Sandoz's failure to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Federal Circuit held in the alternative that Sandoz's failure to disclose its application and manufacturing information was not \"unlawful\" under California's unfair competition law.  In the court's view, when an applicant declines to provide its application and manufacturing information to the sponsor, it takes a path \"expressly contemplated by\" \u00a7262(l)(9)(C) and \u00a7271(e)(2)(C)(ii) and thus does not violate the BPCIA.  794 F.\u00a03d, at 1357, 1360.  In their briefs before this Court, the parties frame this issue as whether the \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) requirement is mandatory in all circumstances, see Brief for Amgen Inc. et\u00a0al. 58, or merely a condition precedent to the information exchange process, see Reply Brief for Sandoz Inc. 33.  If it is only a condition precedent, then an applicant effectively has the option to withhold its application and manufacturing information and does not commit an \"unlawful\" act in doing so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We decline to resolve this particular dispute definitively because it does not present a question of federal law.  The BPCIA, standing alone, does not require a court to decide whether \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) is mandatory or conditional; the court need only determine whether the applicant supplied the sponsor with the information required under \u00a7262(l)(2)(A).  If the applicant failed to provide that information, then the sponsor, but not the applicant, could bring an immediate declaratory-judgment action pursuant to \u00a7262(l)(9)(C).  The parties in these cases agree--as did the Federal Circuit--that Sandoz failed to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A), thus subjecting itself to that consequence.  There is no dispute about how the federal scheme actually works, and thus nothing for us to decide as a matter of federal law.  The mandatory or conditional nature of the BPCIA's requirements matters only for purposes of California's unfair competition law, which penalizes \"unlawful\" conduct.  Whether Sandoz's conduct was \"unlawful\" under the unfair competition law is a state-law question, and the court below erred in attempting to answer that question by referring to the BPCIA alone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, the Federal Circuit should determine whether California law would treat noncompliance with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) as \"unlawful.\"  If the answer is yes, then the court should proceed to determine whether the BPCIA pre-empts any additional remedy available under state law for an applicant's failure to comply with \u00a7262(l)(2)(A) (and whether Sandoz has forfeited any pre-emption defense, see 794 F.\u00a03d, at 1360, n.\u00a05).  The court is also of course free to address the pre-emption question first by assuming that a remedy under state law exists.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The second question at issue in these cases is whether an applicant must provide notice after the FDA licenses its biosimilar, or if it may also provide effective notice before licensure.  Section 262(l)(8)(A) states that the applicant \"shall provide notice to the reference product sponsor not later than 180 days before the date of the first commercial marketing of the biological product licensed under subsection (k).\"  The Federal Circuit held that an applicant's biosimilar must already be \"licensed\" at the time the applicant gives notice.  794 F.\u00a03d, at 1358.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We disagree.  The applicant must give \"notice\" at least 180 days \"before the date of the first commercial marketing.\"  \"[C]ommercial marketing,\" in turn, must be \"of  the biological product licensed under subsection (k).\"  \u00a7262(l)(8)(A).  Because this latter phrase modifies \"commercial marketing\" rather than \"notice,\" \"commercial marketing\" is the point in time by which the biosimilar must be \"licensed.\"  The statute's use of the word \"licensed\" merely reflects the fact that, on the \"date of the first commercial marketing,\" the product must be \"licensed.\"  See \u00a7262(a)(1)(A).  Accordingly, the applicant may provide notice either before or after receiving FDA approval.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statutory context confirms this interpretation.  Section 262(l)(8)(A) contains a single timing requirement: The applicant must provide notice at least 180 days prior to marketing its biosimilar.  The Federal Circuit, however, interpreted the provision to impose two timing requirements: The applicant must provide notice after the FDA licenses the biosimilar and at least 180 days before the applicant markets the biosimilar.  An adjacent provision expressly sets forth just that type of dual timing requirement.  See \u00a7262(l)(8)(B) (\"After receiving notice under subparagraph (A) and before such date of the first commercial marketing of such biological product, the reference product sponsor may seek a preliminary injunction\" (emphasis added)).  But Congress did not use that structure in \u00a7262(l)(8)(A).  \"Had Congress intended to\" impose two timing requirements in \u00a7262(l)(8)(A), \"it presumably would have done so expressly as it did in the immediately following\" subparagraph.  Russello v. United States, 464 U.\u00a0S. 16, 23 (1983).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We are not persuaded by Amgen's arguments to the contrary.  Amgen points out that other provisions refer to \"\u00a0'the biological product that is the subject of'\u00a0\" the application, rather than the \"\u00a0'biological product licensed under subsection (k).'\u00a0\"  Brief for Amgen Inc. et\u00a0al. 28 (emphasis added).  In its view, this variation \"is a strong textual indication that \u00a7262(l)(8)(A), unlike the other provisions, refers to a product that has already been 'licensed' by the FDA.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amgen's interpretation is not necessary to harmonize Congress' use of the two different phrases.  The provision upon which Amgen primarily relies (and that is generally illustrative of the other provisions it cites) requires the applicant to explain why the sponsor's patents are \"\u00a0'invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the commercial marketing of the biological product that is the subject of the subsection (k) application.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 29-30 (quoting \u00a7262(l)(3)(B)(ii)(I); emphasis deleted).  This provision uses the phrase \"subject of the subsection (k) application\" rather than \"product licensed under subsection (k)\" because the applicant can evaluate validity, enforceability, and infringement with respect to the biosimilar only as it exists when the applicant is conducting the evaluation, which it does before licensure.  The applicant cannot make the same evaluation with respect to the biosimilar as it will exist after licensure, because the biosimilar's specifications may change during the application process.  See, e.g., 794 F.\u00a03d, at 1358.  In contrast, nothing in \u00a7262(l)(8)(A) turns on the precise status or characteristics of the biosimilar application.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Amgen also advances a host of policy arguments that prelicensure notice is undesirable.  See Brief for Amgen Inc. et\u00a0al. 35-42.  Sandoz and the Government, in turn, respond with their own bevy of arguments that Amgen's concerns are misplaced and that prelicensure notice affirmatively furthers Congress' intent.  See Brief for Sandoz Inc. 39-42, 56; Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 28-29.  The plausibility of the contentions on both sides illustrates why such disputes are appropriately addressed to Congress, not the courts.  Even if we were persuaded that Amgen had the better of the policy arguments, those arguments could not overcome the statute's plain language, which is our \"primary guide\" to Congress' preferred policy.  McFarland v. Scott, 512 U.\u00a0S. 849, 865 (1994) (Thomas, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, because Sandoz fully complied with \u00a7262(l)(8)(A) when it first gave notice (before licensure) in July 2014, the Federal Circuit erred in issuing a federal injunction prohibiting Sandoz from marketing Zarxio until 180 days after licensure.  Furthermore, because Amgen's request for state-law relief is predicated on its argument that the BPCIA forbids prelicensure notice, its claim under California's unfair competition law also fails.  We accordingly reverse the Federal Circuit's judgment as to the notice provision.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated in part and reversed in part, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nBreyer, J., concurring\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNos. 15-1039 and 15-1195\nSANDOZ INC., PETITIONER 15-1039\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0v.

FIRST QUALITY BABY PRODUCTS, LLC, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-927\nArgued: November 1, 2016Decided: March 21, 2017\n\n\nIn 2003, petitioners (collectively, SCA) notified respondents (collectively, First Quality) that their adult incontinence products infringed an SCA patent.  First Quality responded that its own patent antedated SCA's patent and made it invalid.  In 2004, SCA sought reexamination of its patent in light of First Quality's patent, and in 2007, the Patent and Trademark Office confirmed the SCA patent's validity.  SCA sued First Quality for patent infringement in 2010.  The District Court granted summary judgment to First Quality on the grounds of equitable estoppel and laches.  While SCA's appeal was pending, this Court held that laches could not preclude a claim for damages incurred within the Copyright Act's 3-year limitations period.  Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  A Federal Circuit panel nevertheless affirmed the District Court's laches holding based on Circuit precedent, which permitted laches to be asserted against a claim for damages incurred within the Patent Act's 6-year limitations period, 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7286.  The en banc court reheard the case in light of Petrella and reaffirmed the original panel's laches holding. \nHeld:\u00a0Laches cannot be invoked as a defense against a claim for damages brought within \u00a7286's 6-year limitations period.  Pp.\u00a03-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Petrella's holding rested on both separation-of-powers principles and the traditional role of laches in equity.  A statute of limitations reflects a congressional decision that timeliness is better judged by a hard and fast rule instead of a case-specific judicial determination.  Applying laches within a limitations period specified by Congress would give judges a \"legislation-overriding\" role that exceeds the Judiciary's power.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  Moreover, applying laches within a limitations period would clash with the gap-filling purpose for which the defense developed in the equity courts.  Pp.\u00a03-5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Petrella's reasoning easily fits \u00a7286.  There, the Court found in the Copyright Act's language a congressional judgment that a claim filed within three years of accrual cannot be dismissed on timeliness grounds.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___.  By that same logic, \u00a7286 of the Patent Act represents Congress's judgment that a patentee may recover damages for any infringement committed within six years of the filing of the claim.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality contends that this case differs from Petrella because a true statute of limitations runs forward from the date a cause of action accrues, whereas \u00a7286's limitations period runs backward from the filing of the complaint.  However, Petrella repeatedly characterized the Copyright Act's limitations period as running backward from the date the suit was filed.  First Quality also contends that a true statute of limitations begins to run when the plaintiff discovers a cause of action, which is not the case with \u00a7286's limitations period, but ordinarily, a statute of limitations begins to run on the date that the claim accrues, not when the cause of action is discovered.  Pp.\u00a05-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The Federal Circuit based its decision on the idea that \u00a7282 of the Patent Act, which provides for \"defenses in any action involving the validity or infringement of a patent,\" creates an exception to \u00a7286 by codifying laches as such a defense, and First Quality argues that laches is a defense within \u00a7282(b)(1) based on \"unenforceability.\"  Even assuming that \u00a7282(b)(1) incorporates a laches defense of some dimension, it does not necessarily follow that the defense may be invoked to bar a claim for damages incurred within the period set out in \u00a7286.  Indeed, it would be exceedingly unusual, if not unprecedented, if Congress chose to include in the Patent Act both a statute of limitations for damages and a laches provision applicable to a damages claim.  Neither the Federal Circuit, nor any party, has identified a single federal statute that provides such dual protection against untimely claims.  Pp.\u00a08-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The Federal Circuit and First Quality rely on lower court patent cases decided before the 1952 Patent Act to argue that \u00a7282 codified a pre-1952 practice of permitting laches to be asserted against damages claims.  But the most prominent feature of the relevant legal landscape at that time was the well-established rule that laches cannot be invoked to bar a claim for damages incurred within a limitations period specified by Congress.  In light of this rule, which Petrella confirmed and restated, 572 U. S., at ___, nothing less than a broad and unambiguous consensus of lower court decisions could support the inference that \u00a7282(b)(1) codifies a very different patent-law-specific rule.  Pp.\u00a09-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(e)\u00a0The Federal Circuit and First Quality rely on three types of cases: (1) pre-1938 equity cases; (2) pre-1938 claims at law; and (3) cases decided after the merger of law and equity in 1938.  None of these establishes a broad, unambiguous consensus in favor of applying laches to damages claims in the patent context.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Many of the pre-1938 equity cases do not even reveal whether the plaintiff asked for damages, and of the cases in which damages were sought, many merely suggest in dicta that laches might limit damages.  The handful of cases that apply laches against a damages claim are too few to establish a settled, national consensus.  In any event, the most that can possibly be gathered from a pre-1938 equity case is that laches could defeat a damages claim in an equity court, not that the defense could entirely prevent a patentee from recovering damages.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Similarly, even if all three pre-1938 cases at law cited by First Quality squarely held that laches could be applied to a damages claim within the limitations period, that number would be insufficient to overcome the presumption that Congress legislates against the background of general common-law principles.  First Quality argues that the small number of cases at law should not count against its position because there were few patent cases brought at law after 1870, but it is First Quality's burden to show that Congress departed from the traditional common-law rule. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the post-1938 patent case law, there is scant evidence supporting First Quality's claim that courts continued to apply laches to damages claims after the merger of law and equity.  Only two Courts of Appeals held that laches could bar a damages claim, and that does not constitute a settled, uniform practice of applying laches to damages claims.  Pp.\u00a011-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(f)\u00a0First Quality's additional arguments are unconvincing and do not require extended discussion.  It points to post-1952 Court of Appeals decisions holding that laches can be invoked as a defense against a damages claim, but nothing that Congress has done since 1952 has altered \u00a7282's meaning.  As for the various policy arguments presented here, this Court cannot overrule Congress's judgment based on its own policy views.

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2014): the relationship between the equitable defense of laches and claims for damages that are brought within the time allowed by a statute of limitations.  In Petrella, we held that laches cannot  preclude a claim for damages incurred within the Copyright Act's 3-year limitations period.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).  \"[L]aches,\" we explained, \"cannot be invoked to bar legal relief\" \"[i]n the face of a statute of limitations enacted by Congress.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  The question in this case is whether Petrella's reasoning applies to a similar provision of the Patent Act, 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7286.  We hold that it does.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners SCA Hygiene Products Aktiebolag and SCA Personal Care, Inc. (collectively, SCA), manufacture and sell adult incontinence products.  In October 2003, SCA sent a letter to respondents (collectively, First Quality), alleging that First Quality was making and selling products that infringed SCA's rights under U.\u00a0S. Patent No. 6,375,646 B1 ('646 patent).  App. 54a.  First Quality responded that one of its patents--U.\u00a0S. Patent No. 5,415,649 (Watanabe patent)--antedated the '646 patent and revealed \"the same diaper construction.\"  Id., at 53a.  As a result, First Quality maintained, the '646 patent was invalid and could not support an infringement claim.  Ibid.  SCA sent First Quality no further correspondence regarding the '646 patent, and First Quality proceeded to develop and market its products.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In July 2004, without notifying First Quality, SCA asked the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to initiate a reexamination proceeding to determine whether the '646 patent was valid in light of the Watanabe patent.  Id., at 49a-51a.  Three years later, in March 2007, the PTO issued a certificate confirming the validity of the '646 patent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In August 2010, SCA filed this patent infringement action against First Quality.  First Quality moved for summary judgment based on laches and equitable estoppel, and the District Court granted that motion on both grounds.  2013 WL 3776173, *12 (WD Ky., July 16, 2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCA appealed to the Federal Circuit, but before the Federal Circuit panel issued its decision, this Court decided Petrella.  The panel nevertheless held, based on a Federal Circuit precedent, A.\u00a0C. Aukerman Co. v. R.\u00a0L. Chaides Constr. Co., 960 F.\u00a02d 1020 (1992) (en banc), that SCA's claims were barred by laches.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit then reheard the case en banc in order to reconsider Aukerman in light of Petrella.  But in a 6-to-5 decision, the en banc court reaffirmed Aukerman's holding that laches can be asserted to defeat a claim for damages incurred within the 6-year period set out in the Patent Act.  As it had in Aukerman, the en banc court concluded that Congress, in enacting the Patent Act, had \"codified a laches defense\" that \"barred recovery of legal remedies.\"  807 F.\u00a03d 1311, 1323-1329 (2015).  Judge Hughes, joined by four other judges, dissented.2 Id., at 1337-1342 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  We granted certiorari.  578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laches is \"a defense developed by courts of equity\" to protect defendants against \"unreasonable, prejudicial delay in commencing suit.\"  Petrella, supra, at ___, ___ (slip op., at 1, 12).  See also 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \u00a72.3(5), p. 89 (2d ed. 1993) (Dobbs) (\"The equitable doctrine of laches bars the plaintiff whose unreasonable delay in prosecuting a claim or protecting a right has worked a prejudice to the defendant\").  Before the separate systems of law and equity were merged in 1938, the ordinary rule was that laches was available only in equity courts.3  See County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.\u00a0Y., 470 U.\u00a0S. 226, 244, n.\u00a016 (1985).  This case turns on the application of the defense to a claim for damages, a quintessential legal remedy.  We discussed this subject at length in Petrella.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petrella arose out of a copyright dispute relating to the film Raging Bull.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  The Copyright Act's statute of limitations requires a copyright holder claiming infringement to file suit \"within three years after the claim accrued.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7507(b).  In Petrella, the plaintiff sought relief for alleged acts of infringement that accrued within that 3-year period, but the lower courts nevertheless held that laches barred her claims.  See 695 F.\u00a03d 946 (CA9 2012).  We reversed, holding that laches cannot defeat a damages claim brought within the period prescribed by the Copyright Act's statute of limitations.  Petrella, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 11-14).  And in so holding, we spoke in broad terms.  See id., at ___ (slip op., at 13) (\"[I]n the face of a statute of limitations enacted by Congress, laches cannot be invoked to bar legal relief\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petrella's holding rested on both separation-of-powers principles and the traditional role of laches in equity.  Laches provides a shield against untimely claims, id., at ___ (slip op., at 19), and statutes of limitations serve a similar function.  When Congress enacts a statute of limitations, it speaks directly to the issue of timeliness and provides a rule for determining whether a claim is timely enough to permit relief.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  The enactment of a statute of limitations necessarily reflects a congressional decision that the timeliness of covered claims is better judged on the basis of a generally hard and fast rule rather than the sort of case-specific judicial determination that occurs when a laches defense is asserted.  Therefore, applying laches within a limitations period specified by Congress would give judges a \"legislation-overriding\" role that is beyond the Judiciary's power.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  As we stressed in Petrella, \"courts are not at liberty to jettison Congress' judgment on the timeliness of suit.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying laches within the limitations period would also clash with the purpose for which the defense developed in the equity courts.  As Petrella recounted, the \"principal application\" of laches \"was, and remains, to claims of an equitable cast for which the Legislature has provided no fixed time limitation.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12); see also R. Weaver, E. Shoben, & M. Kelly, Principles of Remedies Law 21 (2d ed. 2011); 1 Dobbs \u00a72.4(4), at 104; 1 J. Story, Commentaries on Equity Jurisprudence \u00a755(a), p. 73 (2d ed. 1839).  Laches is a gap-filling doctrine, and where there is a statute of limitations, there is no gap to fill.4 Petrella, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 14); see also 1 Dobbs \u00a72.4(4), at 108 (\"[I]f the plaintiff has done only what she is permitted to do by statute, and has not misled the defendant [so as to trigger equitable estoppel], the basis for barring the plaintiff seems to have disappeared\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With Petrella's principles in mind, we turn to the present dispute.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the relevant statutory provisions in Petrella and this case are worded differently, Petrella's reasoning easily fits the provision at issue here.  As noted, the statute in Petrella precludes a civil action for copyright infringement \"unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7507(b).  We saw in this language a congressional judgment that a claim filed within three years of accrual cannot be dismissed on timeliness grounds.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11); see also id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 14-15).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same reasoning applies in this case.  Section 286 of the Patent Act provides: \"Except as otherwise provided by law, no recovery shall be had for any infringement committed more than six years prior to the filing of the complaint or counterclaim for infringement in the action.\"  By the logic of Petrella, we infer that this provision represents a judgment by Congress that a patentee may recover damages for any infringement committed within six years of the filing of the claim.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality contends that this case differs from Petrella because \u00a7286 of the Patent Act is not a true statute of limitations.  A true statute of limitations, we are told, \"runs forward from the date a cause of action accrues,\" but \u00a7286 \"runs backward from the time of suit.\"  Brief for Respondents 41.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petrella cannot reasonably be distinguished on this ground.  First Quality thinks it critical that \u00a7286 \"runs backward from the time of suit,\" Brief for Respondents 41, but Petrella described the Copyright Act's statute of limitations in almost identical terms.  We said that this provision \"allows plaintiffs .\u00a0.\u00a0. to gain retrospective relief running only three years back from the date the complaint was filed.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 6-7) (emphasis added).  See also id., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (\"[A] successful plaintiff can gain retrospective relief only three years back from the time of suit\").  And we described the Copyright Act's statute of limitations as \"a three-year look-back limitations period.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 4).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality contends that the application of a true statute of limitations, like the defense of laches (but unlike \u00a7286), takes into account the fairness of permitting the adjudication of a particular plaintiff's claim.  First Quality argues as follows: \"When Congress enacts [a true statute of limitations], it can be viewed as having made a considered judgment about how much delay may occur after a plaintiff knows of a cause of action (i.e., after accrual) before the plaintiff must bring suit--thus potentially leaving no room for judges to evaluate the reasonableness of a plaintiff's delay on a case-by-case basis under laches.\"  Brief for Respondents 42.  According to First Quality, \u00a7286 of the Patent Act is different because it \"turns only on when the infringer is sued, regardless of when the patentee learned of the infringement.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument misunderstands the way in which statutes of limitations generally work.  First Quality says that the accrual of a claim, the event that triggers the running of a statute of limitations, occurs when \"a plaintiff knows of a cause of action,\" ibid., but that is not ordinarily true.  As we wrote in Petrella, \"[a] claim ordinarily accrues 'when [a] plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.'\u00a0\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4); see Graham County Soil & Water Conservation Dist. v. United States ex\u00a0rel. Wilson, 545 U.\u00a0S. 409, 418-419 (2005).  While some claims are subject to a \"discovery rule\" under which the limitations period begins when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury giving rise to the claim, that is not a universal feature of statutes of limitations.  See, e.g., ibid. (limitations period in 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73731(b)(1) begins to run when the cause of action accrues); TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.\u00a0S. 19, 28 (2001) (same with regard to 15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71681p).  And in Petrella, we specifically noted that \"we have not passed on the question\" whether the Copyright Act's statute of limitations is governed by such a rule.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___, n.\u00a04 (slip op., at 4, n.\u00a04).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, Petrella cannot be dismissed as applicable only to what First Quality regards as true statutes of limitations.  At least for present purposes, nothing depends on this debatable taxonomy.  Compare Automobile Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp., 383 U.\u00a0S. 696, 704 (1966) (describing \u00a7286 as \"enacting a uniform period of limitations\"); 1 Dobbs \u00a72.4(4), at 107, and n.\u00a033 (same), with A. Stucki Co. v. Buckeye Steel Castings Co., 963 F.\u00a02d 360, 363, n.\u00a03 (CA Fed. 1992) (Section 286 \"is not, strictly speaking, a statute of limitations\"); Standard Oil Co. v. Nippon Shokubai Kagaku Co., Ltd., 754 F.\u00a02d 345, 348 (CA Fed. 1985) (\"[Section] 286 cannot properly be called a 'statute of limitations' in the sense that it defeats the right to bring suit\").\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit based its decision on a different footing.  Section 286 of the Patent Act begins with the phrase \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law,\" and according to the Federal Circuit, \u00a7282 of the Act is a provision that provides otherwise.  In its view, \u00a7282 creates an exception to \u00a7286 by codifying laches as a defense to all patent infringement claims, including claims for damages suffered within \u00a7286's 6-year period.  807 F.\u00a03d, at 1329-1330.  Section 282(b), which does not specifically mention laches, provides in relevant part as follows:\n\"The following shall be defenses in any action involving the validity or infringement of a patent and shall be pleaded:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(1) Noninfringement, absence of liability for infringement or unenforceability.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The en banc majority below never identified which word or phrase in \u00a7282 codifies laches as a defense, but First Quality argues that laches falls within \u00a7282(b)(1) because laches is a defense based on \"unenforceability.\"  Brief for Respondents 28-33.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SCA disputes this interpretation of \u00a7282(b)(1), arguing that laches does not make a patent categorically unenforceable.  Reply Brief 6-8; see Aukerman, 960 F.\u00a02d, at 1030 (\"Recognition of laches as a defense .\u00a0.\u00a0. does not affect the general enforceability of the patent against others\").  We need not decide this question.  Even if we assume for the sake of argument that \u00a7282(b)(1) incorporates a laches defense of some dimension, it does not necessarily follow that this defense may be invoked to bar a claim for damages incurred within the period set out in \u00a7286.  Indeed, it would be exceedingly unusual, if not unprecedented, if Congress chose to include in the Patent Act both a statute of limitations for damages and a laches provision applicable to a damages claim.  Neither the Federal Circuit, nor First Quality, nor any of First Quality's amici has identified a single federal statute that provides such dual protection against untimely claims.\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In holding that Congress codified a damages-limiting laches defense, the Federal Circuit relied on patent cases decided by the lower courts prior to the enactment of the Patent Act.  After surveying these cases, the Federal Circuit concluded that by 1952 there was a well-established practice of applying laches to such damages claims and that Congress, in adopting \u00a7282, must have chosen to codify such a defense in \u00a7282(b)(1).  807 F.\u00a03d, at 1321-1329.  First Quality now presses a similar argument.  We have closely examined the cases on which the Federal Circuit and First Quality rely, and we find that they are insufficient to support the suggested interpretation of the Patent Act.  The most prominent feature of the relevant legal landscape at the time of enactment of the Patent Act was the well-established general rule, often repeated by this Court, that laches cannot be invoked to bar a claim for damages incurred within a limitations period specified by Congress.  See Holmberg v. Armbrecht, 327 U.\u00a0S. 392, 395 (1946) (\"If Congress explicitly puts a limit upon the time for enforcing a right which it created, there is an end of the matter\"); United States v. Mack, 295 U.\u00a0S. 480, 489 (1935) (\"Laches within the term of the statute of limitations is no defense at law\"); Wehrman v. Conklin, 155 U.\u00a0S. 314, 326 (1894) (\"Though a good defense in equity, laches is no defense at law.  If the plaintiff at law has brought his action within the period fixed by the statute of limitations, no court can deprive him of his right to proceed\"); Cross v. Allen, 141 U.\u00a0S. 528, 537 (1891) (\"So long as the demands secured were not barred by the statute of limitations, there could be no laches in prosecuting a suit\").  Petrella confirmed and restated this long-standing rule.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (\"[T]his Court has cautioned against invoking laches to bar legal relief\").  If Congress examined the relevant legal landscape when it adopted 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7282, it could not have missed our cases endorsing this general rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Federal Circuit and First Quality dismiss the significance of this Court's many reiterations of the general rule because they were not made in patent cases.  But as the dissenters below noted, \"[p]atent law is governed by the same common-law principles, methods of statutory interpretation, and procedural rules as other areas of civil litigation.\"  807 F.\u00a03d, at 1333 (opinion of Hughes, J.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the general rule regarding the relationship between laches and statutes of limitations, nothing less than a broad and unambiguous consensus of lower court decisions could support the inference that \u00a7282(b)(1) codifies a very different patent-law-specific rule.  No such consensus is to be found.5\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pre-1952 cases on which First Quality relies fall into three groups: (1) cases decided by equity courts before 1938; (2) cases decided by law courts before 1938; and (3) cases decided after the merger of equity and law in 1938.  We will discuss each group separately.\nA\nPre-1938 equity cases\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pre-1938 equity cases are unpersuasive for several, often overlapping reasons.  Many do not even reveal whether the plaintiff asked for damages.  Indeed, some say nothing at all about the form of relief that was sought, see, e.g., Cummings v. Wilson & Willard Mfg. Co., 4 F.\u00a02d 453 (CA9 1925), and others state only that the plaintiff wanted an accounting of profits, e.g., Westco-Chippewa Pump Co. v. Delaware Elec. & Supply Co., 64 F.\u00a02d 185, 186 (CA3 1933); Wolf Mineral Process Corp. v. Minerals Separation North Am. Corp., 18 F.\u00a02d 483, 484 (CA4 1927).  The equitable remedy of an accounting, however, was not the same as damages.  The remedy of damages seeks to compensate the victim for its loss, whereas the remedy of an accounting, which Congress abolished in the patent context in 1946,6 sought disgorgement of ill-gotten profits.  See Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.\u00a0S. 64, 68-69 (1876); 1 Dobbs \u00a74.3(5), at 611 (\"Accounting holds the defendant liable for his profits, not for damages\"); A. Walker, Patent Laws \u00a7573, p. 401 (1886) (distinguishing between the two remedies); G. Curtis, Law of Patents \u00a7341(a), p. 461 (4th ed. 1873); 2 J. Pomeroy, Treatise on Equitable Remedies \u00a7568, p. 977 (1905).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality argues that courts sometimes used the term \"accounting\" imprecisely to refer to both an accounting of profits and a calculation of damages, Brief for Respondents 19-20, but even if that is true, this loose usage shows only that a reference to \"accounting\" might refer to damages.  For that reason, the Federal Circuit did not rely on cases seeking only an accounting, 807 F.\u00a03d, at 1326, n.\u00a07, and we likewise exclude such cases from our analysis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Turning to the cases that actually refer to damages,  we note that many of the cases merely suggest in dicta that laches might limit recovery of damages.  See, e.g., Hartford-Empire Co. v. Swindell Bros., 96 F.\u00a02d 227, 233, modified on reh'g, 99 F.\u00a02d 61 (CA4 1938).  Such dicta \"settles nothing.\"  Jama v. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, 543 U.\u00a0S. 335, 351, n.\u00a012 (2005).  See also Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.\u00a0A., 530 U.\u00a0S. 1, 9-10 (2000); Metropolitan Stevedore Co. v. Rambo, 515 U.\u00a0S. 291, 300 (1995).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the cases in which laches was actually held to bar a claim for damages, e.g., Wolf, Sayer & Heller v. United States Slicing Mach. Co., 261 F. 195, 197-198 (CA7 1919); A.\u00a0R. Mosler & Co. v. Lurie, 209 F. 364, 369-370 (CA2 1913), these cases are too few to establish a settled,  national consensus.  See Hartford Underwriters, supra,  at 10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the most that can possibly be gathered from a pre-1938 equity case is that laches could defeat a damages claim in an equity court, not that the defense could entirely prevent a patentee from recovering damages.  Before 1870, a patentee wishing to obtain both an injunction against future infringement and damages for past infringement was required to bring two suits, one in an equity court (where injunctive relief but not damages was available), and one in a court of law (where damages but not injunctive relief could be sought).  See Beauchamp, The First Patent Litigation Explosion, 125 Yale L.\u00a0J. 848, 913-914 (2016).  To rectify this situation, Congress enacted a law in 1870 authorizing equity courts to award damages in patent-infringement actions.  Rev. Stat. \u00a74921.  And although statutes of limitations did not generally apply in equity, Congress in 1897 enacted a statute that, like the current \u00a7286, imposed a 6-year limitations period for damages claims and made that statute applicable in both law and equity.  \u00a76, 29 Stat. 694.  Pointing to cases decided between 1897 and 1938 in which an equity court permitted a defendant in an infringement case to invoke the defense of laches, First Quality contends that Congress, aware of these cases, assumed that the 1952 Act would likewise allow a defendant in an infringement case to claim laches with respect to a claim for damages occurring within a limitations period.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument overlooks the fact that a patentee, during the period in question, could always sue for damages in law, where the equitable doctrine of laches did not apply, and could thus avoid any possible laches defense.  Thus, accepting First Quality's argument would not return patentees to the position they held from 1897 to 1938.  Instead, it would go much further and permit laches entirely to defeat claims like SCA's.7\nB\nPre-1938 claims at law\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality cites three Court of Appeals cases in which laches was raised in a proceeding at law and in which, according to First Quality, the defense was held to bar a damages claim.  See Universal Coin Lock Co. v. American Sanitary Lock Co., 104 F. 2d 781 (CA7 1939); Banker v. Ford Motor Co., 69 F. 2d 665 (CA3 1934); Ford v. Huff, 296 F. 652 (CA5 1924).  But even if all of these cases squarely held that laches could be applied to a damages claim at law within the limitations period, they would still constitute only a handful of decisions out of the corpus of pre-1952 patent cases, and that would not be enough to overcome the presumption that Congress legislates against the background of general common-law principles.  See H. McClintock, Handbook of the Principles of Equity \u00a728, p. 75 (2d ed. 1948) (\"The majority of the courts which have considered the question have refused to enjoin an action at law on the ground of the laches of the plaintiff at law\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, these cases, like the equity cases, offer minimal support for First Quality's position.  Not one of these cases even mentions the statute of limitations.  One of the three, Ford, is not even a patent infringement case; it is a breach-of-contract case arising out of a patent dispute, 296 F., at 654, and it is unclear whether the ground for decision was laches or equitable estoppel.  See 807 F.\u00a03d, at 1340 (opinion of Hughes, J.).  Another, Universal Coin, applied laches to a legal damages claim without any analysis of the propriety of doing so.  104 F.\u00a02d, at 783.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality protests that the paucity of supporting cases at law should not count against its argument since very few patent-infringement cases were brought at law after 1870.  Brief for Respondents 25-26.  But the fact remains that it is First Quality's burden to show that Congress departed from the traditional common-law rule highlighted in our cases.8\nC\nPost-merger cases\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality claims that courts continued to apply laches to damages claims after the merger of law and equity in 1938, but First Quality's evidence is scant.  During this period, two Courts of Appeals stated in dicta that laches could bar legal damages claims.  See Chicago Pneumatic Tool Co. v. Hughes Tool Co., 192 F.\u00a02d 620, 625 (CA10 1951); Shaffer v. Rector Well Equip. Co., 155 F.\u00a02d 344, 347 (CA5 1946).  And two others actually held that laches could bar a damages claim.  See, e.g., Brennan v. Hawley Prods. Co., 182 F.\u00a02d 945, 948 (CA7 1950); Lukens Steel Co. v. American Locomotive Co., 197 F.\u00a02d 939, 941 (CA2 1952) (alternative holding).  This does not constitute a settled, uniform practice of applying laches to damages claims.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After surveying the pre-1952 case law, we are not convinced that Congress, in enacting \u00a7282 of the Patent Act, departed from the general rule regarding the application of laches to damages suffered within the time for filing suit set out in a statute of limitations.\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality's additional arguments do not require extended discussion.  First Quality points to post-1952 Court of Appeals decisions holding that laches can be invoked as a defense against a damages claim.  Noting that Congress has amended \u00a7282 without altering the \"\u00a0'unenforceability'\u00a0\" language that is said to incorporate a laches defense, First Quality contends that Congress has implicitly ratified these decisions.  Brief for Respondents 35-36.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reject this argument.  Nothing that Congress has done since 1952 has altered the meaning of \u00a7282.  See Central Bank of Denver, N.\u00a0A. v. First Interstate Bank of Denver, N. A., 511 U.\u00a0S. 164, 186 (1994); West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.\u00a0S. 83, 100, 101, and n. 7 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First Quality and its supporting amici also make various policy arguments, but we cannot overrule Congress's judgment based on our own policy views.  We note, however, as we did in Petrella, that the doctrine of equitable estoppel provides protection against some of the problems that First Quality highlights, namely, unscrupulous patentees inducing potential targets of infringement suits to invest in the production of arguably infringing products.  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 19).  Indeed, the Federal Circuit held that there are genuine disputes of material fact as to whether equitable estoppel bars First Quality's claims in this very case.  See 807 F.\u00a03d, at 1333.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laches cannot be interposed as a defense against damages where the infringement occurred within the period prescribed by \u00a7286.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-927\nSCA HYGIENE PRODUCTS AKTIEBOLAG, et\u00a0al., PETITIONERS v. FIRST QUALITY BABY PRODUCTS, LLC, et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit\n[March 21, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laches is a doctrine that bars a plaintiff's claim when there has been unreasonable, prejudicial delay in commencing suit.  See 1 D. Dobbs, Law of Remedies \u00a72.3(5), p. 89 (2d ed. 1993).  The question before us is whether a court can apply this doctrine in a patent infringement action for damages brought within the statute of limitations.  The Court holds that a court cannot.  Laches, it says, is a \"gap-filling doctrine,\" generally applicable where there is no statute of limitations.  But the 1952 Patent Act contains a statute of limitations.  Hence there is \"no gap to fill.\"  Ante, at 5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, however, the majority has ignored the fact that, despite the 1952 Act's statute of limitations, there remains a \"gap\" to fill.  See infra, at 2-3.  Laches fills this gap.  And for more than a century courts with virtual unanimity have applied laches in patent damages cases. Congress, when it wrote the 1952 statute, was aware of and intended to codify that judicial practice.  I fear that the majority, in ignoring this legal history, opens a new \"gap\" in the patent law, threatening harmful and unfair legal consequences.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider the relevant statutory language.  Section 286 of the Patent Act says: \"Except as otherwise provided by law, no recovery shall be had for any infringement committed more than six years prior to the filing of the complaint or counterclaim for infringement in the action.\"  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7286 (emphasis added).  Section 282 says what the word \"otherwise\" means.  It tells us that \"unenforceability\" shall be a defense \"in any action involving the validity or infringement of a patent.\"  \u00a7282(b) (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two features of this statutory language are important.  First, the limitations provision, unlike those in many other statutes, does not set forth a period of time in which to sue, beginning when a claim accrues and then expiring some time later.  (The False Claims Act, for example, gives a plaintiff six years from the date of the violation or three years from the date of discovery to file his suit, 31 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a73731(b).)  Rather, it permits a patentee to sue at any time after an infringement takes place.  It simply limits damages to those caused within the preceding six years.  That means that a patentee, after learning of a possible infringement in year 1, might wait until year 10 or year 15 or year 20 to bring a lawsuit.  And if he wins, he can collect damages for the preceding six years of infringement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This fact creates a gap.  Why?  Because a patentee might wait for a decade or more while the infringer (who perhaps does not know or believe he is an infringer) invests heavily in the development of the infringing product (of which the patentee's invention could be only a small component), while evidence that the infringer might use to, say, show the patent is invalid disappears with time.  Then, if the product is a success, the patentee can bring his lawsuit, hoping to collect a significant recovery.  And if business-related circumstances make it difficult or impossible for the infringer to abandon its use of the patented invention (i.e., if the infringer is \"locked in\"), then the patentee can keep bringing lawsuits, say, in year 10 (collecting damages from years 4 through 10), in year 16 (collecting damages from years 10 through 16), and in year 20 (collecting any remaining damages).  The possibility of this type of outcome reveals a \"gap.\"  Laches works to fill the gap by barring recovery when the patentee unreasonably and prejudicially delays suit.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Patent Act's language strongly suggests that Congress, when writing the statutory provisions before us, intended to permit courts to continue to use laches to fill this gap.  The statute says that there are \"except[ions]\" to its 6-year damages limitation rule.  It lists \"unenforceability\" as one of those exceptions.  At common law, the word \"unenforceability\" had a meaning that encompassed laches.  See, e.g., United States v. New Orleans Pacific R. Co., 248 U.\u00a0S. 507, 511 (1919) (considering whether an agreement \"had become unenforceable by reason of inexcusable laches\").  We often read statutes as incorporating common-law meanings.  See Neder v. United States, 527 U.\u00a0S. 1, 21 (1999).  And here there are good reasons for doing so.  For one thing, the principal technical drafter of the Patent Act (in a commentary upon which this Court has previously relied, e.g., Warner-Jenkinson Co. v. Hilton Davis Chemical Co., 520 U.\u00a0S. 17, 28 (1997)) stated that \u00a7282 was meant to codify \"equitable defenses such as laches.\"  P. Federico, Commentary on the New Patent Act, 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C.\u00a0A. 1, 55 (West 1954).  For another thing, there is a long history of prior case law that shows with crystal clarity that Congress intended the statute to keep laches as a defense.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pre-1952 case law that I shall discuss is directly relevant because, as this Court has recognized, the 1952 Patent Act was primarily intended to codify existing law.  See Halo Electronics v. Pulse Electronics, Inc., 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 4); accord, H. R. Rep. No. 1923, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 3 (1952) (stating that the \"main purpose\" of the Patent Act was \"codification and enactment\" of existing law); 98 Cong. Rec. 9323 (1952) (drafter of the Act stating that it was generally intended to \"codif[y] the present patent laws\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now consider the existing law that the Patent Act's drafters intended the Act to reflect.  The decisions that find or say or hold that laches can bar monetary relief in patent infringement actions stretch in a virtually unbroken chain from the late 19th century through the Patent Act's enactment in 1952.  They number in the dozens and include every federal appeals court to have considered the matter.  (We have found only two contrary decisions, both from the same District Court: Thorpe v. Wm. Filene's Sons Co., 40 F. 2d 269 (Mass. 1930); and Concord v. Norton, 16 F. 477 (CC Mass. 1883).)\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here are the cases from the Federal Courts of Appeals alone: Lukens Steel Co. v.

Williams, 68 F. 489, 493-494 (CA6 1895).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority replies that this list proves nothing.  After all, it says, nearly all of these decisions come from courts of equity. Courts of equity ordinarily applied laches \"\u00a0'to claims of an equitable cast for which the Legislature ha[d] provided no fixed time limitation,'\u00a0\" ante, at 5 (quoting Petrella v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc., 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 12)), not to requests for damages, \"a quintessential legal remedy,\" ante, at 3.  Since \"laches is a gap-filling doctrine,\" the fact that it was applied to equitable claims without statutes of limitations says little about whether it should apply to legal damages claims when \"there is a statute of limitations,\" and therefore \"no gap to fill.\"  Ante, at 5.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good reply.  But no cigar.  Why not?  (1) Because in 1897 Congress enacted a statute of limitations--very much like the one before us now--for patent claims brought in courts of equity.  Ch. 391, \u00a76, 29 Stat. 694 (\"[I]n any suit or action .\u00a0.\u00a0. there shall be no recovery of profits or damages for any infringement committed more than six years before\" filing).  Thus, after 1897, there was no statute of limitations gap for equity courts to fill, and yet they continued to hold that laches applied.  See, e.g., France Mfg., supra, at 609 (\"[N]otwithstanding the statute of limitations, relief may be denied on the ground of laches .\u00a0.\u00a0. \"); Dwight & Lloyd, supra, at 827 (Hand, J.) (explaining how laches operates in conjunction with the statute of limitations to allow an infringer to \"garne[r] the harvest of even the earliest of the 6 years to which recovery is in any event limited, with just confidence that he will not be disturbed\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2) Because in 1870 Congress enacted a statute that gave courts of equity the power to award legal relief, namely, damages, in patent cases.  Act of July 8, 1870, \u00a755, 16 Stat. 206.  Congress did not give law courts an equivalent power to grant injunctive relief in patent suits.  As a result, from the late 19th century until the merger of law and equity in 1938, nearly all patent litigation--including suits for damages--took place in courts of equity that were applying laches in conjunction with a statute of limitations.  See Lemley, Why Do Juries Decide If Patents Are Valid? 99 Va. L. Rev. 1673, 1704 (2013) (discussing the predominance of equity litigation).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3) Because Congress recognized that damages suits for patent infringement took place almost exclusively in equity courts, not law courts.  Whenever Congress wished to modify patent damages law, it rewrote the statutory provisions governing damages in equity, not law.  See, e.g., \u00a78, 42 Stat. 392 (modifying the equity damages statute to allow equity courts to award a \"reasonable sum\" even if a patentee had difficulty proving actual damages, but making no change to the legal damages provision).  The 1952 Congress, seeking to understand whether, or how, laches applied in patent damages cases, would almost certainly have looked to equity practice.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(4) Because, in any event, in those few pre-law\/equity-merger cases in which courts of law considered whether laches could bar a patent damages action, they, like their equity counterparts, held that it could.  See Universal Coin, 104 F.\u00a02d, at 781-783; Banker, 69 F.\u00a02d, at 666; Ford, supra, at 658.  As the majority points out, these cases brought in law courts constitute \"only a handful of decisions.\"  Ante, at 13.  But that is simply because, as I just noted, almost all patent damages litigation took place in courts of equity.  Regardless, before the merger of law and equity both law courts and equity courts recognized laches as a defense.  And, after the merger of law and equity in 1938, federal courts still applied laches to patent damages claims.  E.g., Brennan, 182 F.\u00a02d, at 948 (holding that \"laches on the part of the plaintiff\" can \"bar his right to recover damages\").  This, of course, would make no sense if laches for patent damages was really an equity-only rule.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Does the majority have any other good reason to ignore the mountain of authority recognizing laches as a defense? It refers to many general statements in opinions  and treatises that say that laches is \"no defense at law.\"  United States v. Mack, 295 U.\u00a0S. 480, 489 (1935).  But these statements are not about patent damages cases.  They do not claim to encompass the problem at issue here.  And they do not prevent Congress from enacting a statute that, recognizing patent litigation's history, combines a statute of limitations with a laches defense.  And that is what Congress has done in the Patent Act.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority also tries to discredit the persuasiveness of the pre-Patent Act case law authority.  It goes through the lengthy list of decisions, finding some judicial statements too vague, others just dicta, and still others having confused an equitable claim for \"accounting\" with a legal claim for \"damages.\"  I agree that it has found weaknesses in the reasoning of some individual cases.  But those weaknesses were not sufficient to prevent a 1951 treatise writer from concluding, on the basis of the great weight of authority, that in patent cases, \"[l]aches .\u00a0.\u00a0. may be interposed in an action at law.\"  3 A. Deller, Walker on Patents 106 (Cum. Supp. 1951).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In any event, with all its efforts, the majority is unable to identify a single case--not one--from any court of appeals sitting in law or in equity before the merger, or sitting after the merger but before 1952, holding that laches could not bar a patent claim for damages.  Furthermore, the majority concedes that it is unable to distinguish, by my count, at least six Court of Appeals cases directly holding that laches could bar a patent claim for damages.  See Wolf, Sayer & Heller, 261 F. 195; Lurie, 209 F. 364; Universal Coin, supra; Banker, 69 F.\u00a02d 665; Brennan, supra; Lukens, 197 F.\u00a02d 939.  And that is the case law situation that Congress faced when it wrote a statute that, as we have said, sought primarily to codify existing patent law.  See supra, at 3-4.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority tries to minimize the overall thrust of this case law by dividing the cases into subgroups and then concluding that the number of undistinguishable precedents in each subgroup is \"too few to establish a settled, national consensus.\"  Ante, at 12.  The problem with this approach is that, once we look at the body of case law as a whole, rather than in subgroups, we find what I have said and repeated, namely, that all the cases say the same thing: Laches applies.  The majority's insistence on subdivision makes it sound a little like a Phillies fan who announces that a 9-0 loss to the Red Sox was a \"close one.\"  Why close?  Because, says the fan, the Phillies lost each inning by only one run.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For the sake of completeness I add that, since 1952, every Federal Court of Appeals to consider the question has held that laches remains available for damages claims brought under the Patent Act.  See A. C. Aukerman Co. v. R. L. Chaides Constr. Co., 960 F. 2d 1020, 1030 (CA Fed. 1992) (en banc).  Yet, Congress has repeatedly reenacted 35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7282's \"unenforceability\" language without material change.  See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a715(a), 20(g)(2)(B), 125 Stat. 328, 334.  See also Texas Dept. of Housing and Community Affairs v. Inclusive Communities Project, Inc., 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 14) (holding that congressional reenactment provides \"convincing support for the conclusion that Congress accepted and ratified the unanimous holdings of the Courts of Appeals\"); Microsoft Corp. v. i4i Ltd. Partnership, 564 U.\u00a0S. 91, 113-114 (2011) (when Congress has \"often amended \u00a7282\" while \"le[aving] the Federal Circuit's interpretation of \u00a7282 in place,\" any further \"recalibration\" should be left to the Legislature).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority's strongest argument is Petrella.  There, the Court held that laches could not bar a damages claim brought within the Copyright Act's limitations period.  The present case holds roughly the same in respect to the Patent Act, providing a degree of consistency.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are relevant differences, however, between patent law and copyright law.  For one thing, copyright law, unlike patent law, does not contain a century and a half of history during which courts held that laches and a statute of limitations could coexist.  When Congress enacted the Patent Act in 1952, patent statutes had already contained a 6-year statute of limitations for 55 years (since 1897), during which time courts had continued to apply laches to patent damages cases.  Copyright law, on the other hand, contained no federal statute of limitations until 1957.  See Petrella, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For another thing, the Copyright Act, unlike the Patent Act, has express provisions that mitigate the unfairness of a copyright holder waiting for decades to bring his lawsuit.  A copyright holder who tries to lie in wait to see if a defendant's investment will prove successful will discover that the Copyright Act allows that defendant to \"prove and offset against .\u00a0.\u00a0. profits 'deductible expenses' incurred in generating those profits.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 12) (quoting 17 U. S. C. \u00a7504(b)).  Thus, if the defendant invests say $50 million in a film, a copyright holder who waits until year 15 (when the film begins to earn a profit) to bring a lawsuit may be limited to recovering the defendant's profits less an apportioned amount of the defendant's initial $50 million investment.  But the Patent Act has no such deduction provision.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, the Court, in Petrella, pointed out that the evidentiary loss that occurs while a copyright holder waits to bring suit is \"at least as likely to affect plaintiffs as it is to disadvantage defendants.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).  But that symmetry does not exist to the same degree in patent law.  To win a copyright suit the copyright holder must show that the defendant copied his work.  The  death of witnesses and loss of documents from the time of the alleged infringement can therefore significantly impair the copyright holder's ability to prove his case.  There is no such requirement in a patent suit.  Patent infringement is a strict-liability offense: There need not be any copying, only an end product (or process) that invades the area the patentee has carved out in his patent.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, the passage of time may well harm patent defendants who wish to show a patent invalid by raising defenses of anticipation, obviousness, or insufficiency.  These kinds of defenses can depend upon contemporaneous evidence that may be lost over time, and they arise far more frequently in patent cases than any of their counterparts do in copyright cases.  See Brief for Electronic Frontier Foundation et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 23 (reporting that of all copyright cases pending as of January 2009, only 2.7% of judgment events resulted in a finding of a lack of ownership or validity of the copyright at issue); Allison, Lemley, & Schwartz, Understanding the Realities of Modern Patent Litigation, 92 Texas L.\u00a0Rev. 1769, 1778, 1784-1785 (2014) (finding that 70% of summary judgment motions in patent cases filed in 2008-2009 related to anticipation or obviousness).  The upshot is an absence here of the symmetrical effect of delay upon which the Court relied in Petrella.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, there is a \"lock-in\" problem that is likely to be more serious where patents are at issue.  Once a business chooses to rely on a particular technology, it can become expensive to switch, even if it would have been cheap to do so earlier.  See Lee & Melamed, Breaking the Vicious Cycle of Patent Damages, 101 Cornell L. Rev. 385, 409-410 (2016).  As a result, a patentee has considerable incentive to delay suit until the costs of switching--and accordingly the settlement value of a claim--are high.  The practical consequences of such delay can be significant, as the facts of this case illustrate: First Quality invested hundreds of millions of dollars in its allegedly infringing technologies during the years that SCA waited to bring its suit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 107a-108a.  And amici have provided numerous other examples that suggest this fact pattern is far from uncommon.  See Brief for Dell et\u00a0al. 11-19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recognize the Majority's suggestion that the doctrine of \"equitable estoppel\" might help alleviate some of these problems.  See ante, at 15.  I certainly hope so.  But I would be more \"cautious before adopting changes that disrupt the settled expectations of the inventing community.\"  Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., 535 U.\u00a0S. 722, 739 (2002).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I add or confess that I believe that Petrella too was wrongly decided.  Today's case helps illustrate why I think that Petrella started this Court down the wrong track.  I would stop, finding adequate grounds to distinguish Petrella.  But the majority remains \"determined to stay the course and continue on, travelling even further away,\" Mathis v. United States, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9), from Congress' efforts, in the Patent Act, to promote the \"Progress of Science and useful Arts,\" U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl.\u00a08.  Trite but true: Two wrongs don't make a right.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, I dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The panel reversed the District Court's holding on equitable estoppel, concluding that there are genuine disputes of material fact relating to that defense.  767 F.\u00a03d 1339, 1351 (2014).\nFootnote 2\u00a0The dissenting judges concurred in the portion of the majority opinion relating to the application of laches to equitable relief.  807 F.\u00a03d, at 1333, n.\u00a01 (opinion of Hughes, J.); see also id., at 1331-1333 (majority opinion).  We do not address that aspect of the Federal Circuit's judgment.  Nor do we address the Federal Circuit's reversal of the District Court's equitable estoppel holding.  Id., at 1333 (reinstating original panel holding on equitable estoppel).\nFootnote 3\u00a0\"The federal courts always had equity powers as well as law power, but they operated, until the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, by distinctly separating equity cases and even had separate equity rules.\"  1 Dobbs \u00a72.6(1), at 148, n.\u00a02; see also Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U.\u00a0S. 271, 279 (1988).  It is in this sense that we refer in this opinion to federal courts as equity or law courts.\nFootnote 4\u00a0The dissent argues that there is a \"gap\" in the statutory scheme because the Patent Act's statute of limitations might permit a patentee to wait until an infringing product has become successful before suing for infringement.  Post, at 2-3 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  We rejected a version of this argument in Petrella, 572 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 16-17), and we do so here.  The dissent's argument implies that, insofar as the lack of a laches defense could produce policy outcomes judges deem undesirable, there is a \"gap\" for laches to fill, notwithstanding the presence of a statute of limitations.  That is precisely the kind of \"legislation-overriding\" judicial role that Petrella rightly disclaimed.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14).  \nFootnote 5\u00a0Because we conclude that First Quality fails to show that there was a special laches rule in the patent context, we need not address whether it is ever reasonable to assume that Congress legislated against the background of a lower court consensus rather than the contrary decisions of this Court.  Cf. 807 F.\u00a03d, at 1338 (opinion of Hughes, J.) (\"For even if there were differing views in the lower [federal] courts, it would be nearly impossible to conclude that there was a uniform understanding of the common law that was inconsistent with Supreme Court precedent.  In our judicial system, the Supreme Court's understanding is controlling\").\nFootnote 6\u00a0See 60 Stat. 778; see also Aro Mfg. Co. v. Convertible Top Replacement Co., 377 U.\u00a0S. 476, 505 (1964).\nFootnote 7\u00a0The dissent misunderstands this point and thinks that we dismiss the relevance of the equity cases because they applied laches \"to equitable claims without statutes of limitations.\"  Post, at 5.  But we are well aware that a statute of limitations applied in equity when these cases arose.  See supra, at 13.  \nFootnote 8\u00a0For the same reason, the dissent misses the mark when it demands that we cite cases \"holding that laches could not bar a patent claim for damages.\"  Post, at 8.\n\n\n","69":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSCENIC AMERICA, INC.  v.  DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-739\nArgued: Decided: October 16, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Statement of Justice Gorsuch, with whom The Chief Justice and Justice Alito join, respecting the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Say an administrative agency contracts with an outside party.  Later, the two sides wind up disagreeing over the meaning of an ambiguous term in their agreement.  How should courts resolve the dispute?  Usually, of course, judges look to the tested and pretty ancient rules of contract construction.  For example, we often resolve contractual ambiguities against the party who wrote the agreement, in part on the theory that the drafter might have avoided the dispute by picking clearer terms.  Sometimes, too, we consider testimony from the participants or proof about industry custom to help deduce the contested term's meaning.  But in relatively recent times some courts have sought to displace familiar rules like these in favor of a new one, suggesting that an administrative agency's interpretation of an ambiguous contractual term should always prevail--at least so long as the agency's interpretation falls within a (generously defined) zone of \"reasonableness.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, courts sometimes defer to an agency's interpretations of statutory law under Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.\u00a0S. 837, 866 (1984), and its progeny.

The court in this case agreed to defer to an agency's interpretation of a disputed contractual term.  But other courts have rejected much the same sort of invitation.  See, e.g., Muratore v. Office of Personnel Management, 222 F.\u00a03d 918, 921 (CA11 2000) (recognizing split); Koch Gateway Pipeline Co. v. FERC, 136 F.\u00a03d 810, 814, n.\u00a010 (CADC 1998) (same); Mid-Louisiana Gas Co. v. FERC, 780 F.\u00a02d 1238, 1243 (CA5 1986); Meadow Green-Wildcat Corp. v.

For example, Chevron deference is often defended on the ground that statutory ambiguities reflect a kind of implicit decision by Congress to delegate lawmaking power to the agency to handle the problem on its own.  But even assuming (without granting) the accuracy and propriety of that much, what's the case for supposing that Congress implicitly delegates to agencies the power to adjudicate their own contractual disputes too?  Especially when independent judges in our legal order have traditionally performed just that job?  Some defend Chevron deference in statutory interpretation cases on the theory that agencies are technical experts in the fields they are charged with regulating.  But contracts usually represent compromises between two or more parties.  And is it reasonable to suppose that one side to a compromise always has more expert insight into its meaning?  Sometimes Chevron is promoted on the premise that agencies have the public interest at heart when interpreting statutory texts.  But does that logic extend with equal force to contract disputes where the contending parties are at least usually a little self-interested?  See generally Armstrong, Chevron Deference and Agency Self-Interest, 13 Cornell J.\u00a0L. & Pub. Pol'y 203 (2004).  And, for that matter, aren't our traditional rules of contract interpretation, at least at some level of generality, themselves all about promoting the public interest?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These are but a few of the questions posed by this case.  No doubt good arguments might be presented on both sides.  No doubt, too, the questions presented here are important ones.  At the same time, this particular case also comes with some rather less significant and considerably more factbound questions.  Questions that would, I fear, only complicate our effort to reach the heart of the matter, for these attendant questions include \"difficult and close\" jurisdictional issues that would have to be settled first.  983 F.\u00a0Supp.\u00a02d 170, 173 (DDC 2013).  In this light, I am persuaded that the proper course is to deny certiorari in this particular case even though the issues lying at its core are surely worthy of consideration in a case burdened with fewer antecedent and factbound questions.\n\n\nSCENIC AMERICA, INC. v.

Later, the two sides wind up disagreeing over the meaning of an ambiguous term in their agreement.  How should courts resolve the dispute?  Usually, of course, judges look to the tested and pretty ancient rules of contract construction.  For example, we often resolve contractual ambiguities against the party who wrote the agreement, in part on the theory that the drafter might have avoided the dispute by picking clearer terms.  Sometimes, too, we consider testimony from the participants or proof about industry custom to help deduce the contested term's meaning.  But in relatively recent times some courts have sought to displace familiar rules like these in favor of a new one, suggesting that an administrative agency's interpretation of an ambiguous contractual term should always prevail--at least so long as the agency's interpretation falls within a (generously defined) zone of \"reasonableness.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, courts sometimes defer to an agency's interpretations of statutory law under Chevron U.\u00a0S.\u00a0A.

MICHAEL DANIEL CUERO(2017)\nNo. 16-1468\nArgued: Decided: November 6, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 provides that a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner based on a claim adjudicated by a state court on the merits if the resulting decision is \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  In this case, a California court permitted the State to amend a criminal complaint to which the respondent, Michael Cuero, had pleaded guilty.  That guilty plea would have led to a maximum sentence of 14 years and 4 months.  The court acknowledged that permitting the amendment would lead to a higher sentence, and it consequently permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea.  Cuero then pleaded guilty to the amended complaint and was sentenced to a term with a minimum of 25 years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently held that the California court had made a mistake of federal law.  In its view, the law entitled Cuero to specific performance of the lower 14-year, 4-month sentence that he would have received had the complaint not been amended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question here is whether the state-court decision \"involved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  Ibid.  Did our prior decisions (1) clearly require the state court to impose the lower sentence that the parties originally expected; or (2) instead permit the State's sentence-raising amendment where the defendant was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea?  Because no decision from this Court clearly establishes that a state court must choose the first alternative, we reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October 27, 2005, the State of California charged Michael Cuero with two felonies and a misdemeanor.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a-33a.  Its complaint alleged that on October 14, 2005, Cuero drove his car into, and seriously injured, Jeffrey Feldman, who was standing outside of his parked pickup truck.  Id., at 27a-28a.  The complaint further alleged that Cuero was then on parole, that he was driving without a license, that he was driving under the influence of methamphetamine, and that he had in his possession a loaded 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cuero initially pleaded \"not guilty.\"  But on December 8, he changed his plea.  A form entitled \"PLEA OF GUILTY\/NO CONTEST--FELONY\" signed by Cuero, the prosecutor, and the trial court memorialized the terms of Cuero's guilty plea.  See id., at 77a-85a.  On that form, Cuero pleaded guilty to the two felony counts.  Ibid.; see Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a723153(a) (West 2017) (causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of a drug); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a712021(a)(1) (West 2005) (unlawful possession of a firearm).  He also admitted that he had previously served four separate prison terms, including a term for residential burglary, which qualifies as a predicate offense under California's \"three strikes\" law.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7667(a)(1) (West 2017); see Ewing v. California, 538 U.\u00a0S. 11, 15-17 (2003).  Finally, Cuero acknowledged on this guilty-plea form that he understood that he \"may receive this maximum punishment as a result of my plea: 14 years, 4 months in State Prison, $10,000 fine and 4 years parole.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following a hearing, the state trial court accepted the plea and granted California's motion to dismiss the remaining misdemeanor charge.  The court then scheduled the sentencing hearing for January 11, 2006.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the hearing took place, however, the prosecution determined that another of Cuero's four prior convictions qualified as a \"strike\" and that the signed guilty-plea form had erroneously listed only one strike.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7245(a)(1) (assault with a deadly weapon).  This second strike meant that Cuero faced not a maximum punishment of just over 14 years (172 months), but a minimum punishment of 25 years.  \u00a7\u00a7667(e)(2)(A)(ii), 1170.12(c)(2)(A)(ii).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State asked the trial court for permission to amend the criminal complaint accordingly.  It pointed to Cal. Penal Code \u00a7969.5(a), which provides:\n\"Whenever it shall be discovered that a pending complaint to which a plea of guilty has been made under Section 859a does not charge all prior felonies of which the defendant has been convicted either in this state or elsewhere, the complaint may be forthwith amended to charge the prior conviction or convictions and the amendments may and shall be made upon order of the court.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cuero argued that the State's motion was untimely and prejudicial.  But the trial court granted the motion.  At the same time, the court permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the change.  It concluded that \u00a7969.5(a) \"guide[d]\" its inquiry and was best read to reflect a legislative determination that criminal complaints should charge all prior felony convictions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 178a.  The court added that the case was distinguishable from \"a situation where the [State] might, after a guilty plea, seek to amend\" a criminal complaint by adding \"new charges\" or facts that fundamentally alter the substance of the complaint.  Id., at 179a.  But here, where only \"alleged prior convictions\" were at issue, the court could eliminate any prejudice to Cuero by allowing him to withdraw his initial guilty plea, thereby restoring both parties to the status quo prior to its entry.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soon thereafter, California amended the complaint.  The complaint as amended charged Cuero with one felony, (causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of a drug under Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a723153(a)), and it alleged two prior strikes.  Cuero then withdrew his initial guilty plea and entered a new guilty plea to the amended complaint.  On April 20, 2006, the trial court sentenced Cuero to the stipulated term of 25 years to life.  His  conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the California Supreme Court denied a state habeas petition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cuero then filed a petition for federal habeas relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.  The Federal District Court denied Cuero's petition, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  Cuero v. Cate, 827 F.\u00a03d 879 (2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit panel hearing the appeal held that the state trial court had \"acted contrary to clearly established Supreme Court law\" by \"refusing to enforce the original plea agreement\" with its 172-month maximum sentence.  Id., at 888.  It wrote that \"[i]n this context, specific performance\" of that plea agreement--i.e., sentencing Cuero to no more than the roughly 14-year sentence reflected in the 2005 guilty-plea form--was \"necessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of the criminal justice system.\"  Id., at 890, n.\u00a014.  The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the dissent of seven judges.  Cuero v. Cate, 850 F.\u00a03d 1019 (2017).  The State then filed a petition for certiorari here.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit has already issued its mandate in this case.  And the state trial court, in light of that mandate, has resentenced Cuero.  Cuero argues that this fact renders this controversy moot.  The State and Cuero, however, continue to disagree about the proper length of Cuero's sentence, a portion of which he has not yet served.  Thus, neither the losing party's failure to obtain a stay preventing the mandate of the Court of Appeals from issuing nor the trial court's action in light of that mandate makes the case moot.  Mancusi v. Stubbs, 408 U.\u00a0S. 204, 206-207, and\u00a0n. 1 (1972); Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, 329 U.\u00a0S. 304, 306-308 (1946).  Reversal would simply \"und[o] what the habeas corpus court did,\" namely, permit the state courts to determine in the first instance the lawfulness of a longer sentence not yet served.  Id.,  at 308.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit, in ordering specific performance of the 172-month sentence set forth on Cuero's original guilty-plea form, reasoned as follows.  First, the court concluded that Cuero's guilty-plea form amounts to an enforceable plea agreement.  827 F.\u00a03d, at 884-885.  Second, that plea agreement amounts to, and should be interpreted as, a contract under state contract law.  Id., at 883 (citing Ricketts v. Adamson, 483 U.\u00a0S. 1, 5, n. 3 (1987)).  Third, California contract law would consider the State's motion to amend the complaint as a breach of contract.  827 F.\u00a03d, at 887-890.  Fourth, \"the remedy for breach must 'repair the harm caused by the breach.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 890 (quoting People v. Toscano, 124 Cal. App.\u00a04th 340, 20 Cal. Rptr.\u00a03d 923, 927 (2004)).  Fifth, rescission failed to \"\u00a0'repair the harm.'\u00a0\"  827 F.\u00a03d, at 891.  Sixth, consequently Cuero was entitled to specific performance, namely, a maximum prison term of 172 months (14 years and 4 months).  Ibid.  And, seventh, the state court's contrary decision was itself \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1); see 827 F.\u00a03d, at 888.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We shall assume purely for argument's sake that the State violated the Constitution when it moved to amend the complaint.  But we still are unable to find in Supreme Court precedent that \"clearly established federal law\" demanding specific performance as a remedy.  To the contrary, no \"holdin[g] of this Court\" requires the remedy of specific performance under the circumstances present here.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 100 (2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two of our prior decisions address these issues.  The first, Santobello v. New York, 404 U.\u00a0S. 257 (1971), held that a defendant may not be bound to a plea agreement following a prosecutorial breach of an enforceable provision of such an agreement.  Id., at 262.  As relevant here, however, Chief Justice Burger wrote in the opinion for the Court that the \"ultimate relief to which petitioner is entitled\" must be left \"to the discretion of the state court, which is in a better position to decide whether the circumstances of this case require only that there be specific performance of the agreement on the plea\" or, alternatively, that \"the circumstances require granting the relief sought by petitioner, i.e., the opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty.\"  Id., at 262-263.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit cited a concurrence in Santobello by Justice Douglas, which added that \"a court ought to accord a defendant's [remedial] preference considerable, if not controlling, weight inasmuch as the fundamental rights flouted by a prosecutor's breach of a plea bargain are those of the defendant, not of the State.\" 827 F.\u00a03d, at 891, n.\u00a014 (quoting Santobello, supra, at 267).  Three other Justices agreed with Justice Douglas on this point, and because only seven Justices participated in the case, the Ninth Circuit suggested that a four-Justice majority in Santo- bello seemed to favor looking to the defendant's preferred remedy.  827 F.\u00a03d, at 891, n.\u00a014 (citing Santobello, supra, at 268, and n. (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  The Ninth Circuit also pointed in support to its own Circuit precedent, a criminal procedure treatise, a decision of the Washington Supreme Court, and a law review article.  See 827 F.\u00a03d, at 890-891, n.\u00a014 (citing Buckley v. Terhune, 441 F.\u00a03d 688, 699, n.\u00a011 (CA9 2006); 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a721.2(e) (4th ed. 2015); State v. Tourtellotte, 88 Wash.\u00a02d 579, 564 P.\u00a02d 799, 802 (1977); and Fischer, Beyond Santobello--Remedies for Reneged Plea Bargains, 2 U. San Fernando Valley L. Rev. 121, 125 (1973)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are several problems with the Ninth Circuit's reasoning below.  First, \"\u00a0'fairminded jurists could disagree'\u00a0\" with the Ninth Circuit's reading of Santobello.  Richter, supra, at 101 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.\u00a0S. 652, 664 (2004)).  Moreover, in Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U.\u00a0S. 504 (1984), the Court wrote that \"Santobello expressly declined to hold that the Constitution compels specific performance of a broken prosecutorial promise as the remedy for such a plea.\"  Id., at 510-511, n.\u00a011 (citing Santobello, 404 U.\u00a0S., at 262-263; id., at 268-269 (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  The Court added that \"permitting Santobello to replead was within the range of constitutionally appropriate remedies.\"  467 U.\u00a0S., at 510, n.\u00a011.  Where, as here, none of our prior decisions clearly entitles Cuero to the relief he seeks, the \"state court's decision could not be 'contrary to' any holding from this Court.\"  Woods v. Donald, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 6) (quoting Lopez v. Smith, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5)).  Finally, as we have repeatedly pointed out, \"circuit precedent does not constitute 'clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.'\u00a0\"  Glebe v. Frost, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3) (quoting 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1)).  Nor, of course, do state-court decisions, treatises, or law review articles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all these reasons, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit erred when it held that \"federal law\" as interpreted by this Court \"clearly\" establishes that specific performance is constitutionally required here.  We decide no other issue in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  We reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\nSCOTT KERNAN, SECRETARY, CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHA-BILITATION v. MICHAEL DANIEL CUERO\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit\nNo. 16-1468.\u2003Decided November 6, 2017\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 provides that a federal court may grant habeas relief to a state prisoner based on a claim adjudicated by a state court on the merits if the resulting decision is \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  In this case, a California court permitted the State to amend a criminal complaint to which the respondent, Michael Cuero, had pleaded guilty.  That guilty plea would have led to a maximum sentence of 14 years and 4 months.  The court acknowledged that permitting the amendment would lead to a higher sentence, and it consequently permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea.  Cuero then pleaded guilty to the amended complaint and was sentenced to a term with a minimum of 25 years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit subsequently held that the California court had made a mistake of federal law.  In its view, the law entitled Cuero to specific performance of the lower 14-year, 4-month sentence that he would have received had the complaint not been amended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question here is whether the state-court decision \"involved an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  Ibid.  Did our prior decisions (1) clearly require the state court to impose the lower sentence that the parties originally expected; or (2) instead permit the State's sentence-raising amendment where the defendant was allowed to withdraw his guilty plea?  Because no decision from this Court clearly establishes that a state court must choose the first alternative, we reverse the Ninth Circuit's decision.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On October 27, 2005, the State of California charged Michael Cuero with two felonies and a misdemeanor.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 26a-33a.  Its complaint alleged that on October 14, 2005, Cuero drove his car into, and seriously injured, Jeffrey Feldman, who was standing outside of his parked pickup truck.  Id., at 27a-28a.  The complaint further alleged that Cuero was then on parole, that he was driving without a license, that he was driving under the influence of methamphetamine, and that he had in his possession a loaded 9-millimeter semiautomatic pistol.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cuero initially pleaded \"not guilty.\"  But on December 8, he changed his plea.  A form entitled \"PLEA OF GUILTY\/NO CONTEST--FELONY\" signed by Cuero, the prosecutor, and the trial court memorialized the terms of Cuero's guilty plea.  See id., at 77a-85a.  On that form, Cuero pleaded guilty to the two felony counts.  Ibid.; see Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a723153(a) (West 2017) (causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of a drug); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a712021(a)(1) (West 2005) (unlawful possession of a firearm).  He also admitted that he had previously served four separate prison terms, including a term for residential burglary, which qualifies as a predicate offense under California's \"three strikes\" law.  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7667(a)(1) (West 2017); see Ewing v. California, 538 U.\u00a0S. 11, 15-17 (2003).  Finally, Cuero acknowledged on this guilty-plea form that he understood that he \"may receive this maximum punishment as a result of my plea: 14 years, 4 months in State Prison, $10,000 fine and 4 years parole.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following a hearing, the state trial court accepted the plea and granted California's motion to dismiss the remaining misdemeanor charge.  The court then scheduled the sentencing hearing for January 11, 2006.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before the hearing took place, however, the prosecution determined that another of Cuero's four prior convictions qualified as a \"strike\" and that the signed guilty-plea form had erroneously listed only one strike.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7245(a)(1) (assault with a deadly weapon).  This second strike meant that Cuero faced not a maximum punishment of just over 14 years (172 months), but a minimum punishment of 25 years.  \u00a7\u00a7667(e)(2)(A)(ii), 1170.12(c)(2)(A)(ii).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State asked the trial court for permission to amend the criminal complaint accordingly.  It pointed to Cal. Penal Code \u00a7969.5(a), which provides:\n\"Whenever it shall be discovered that a pending complaint to which a plea of guilty has been made under Section 859a does not charge all prior felonies of which the defendant has been convicted either in this state or elsewhere, the complaint may be forthwith amended to charge the prior conviction or convictions and the amendments may and shall be made upon order of the court.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cuero argued that the State's motion was untimely and prejudicial.  But the trial court granted the motion.  At the same time, the court permitted Cuero to withdraw his guilty plea in light of the change.  It concluded that \u00a7969.5(a) \"guide[d]\" its inquiry and was best read to reflect a legislative determination that criminal complaints should charge all prior felony convictions.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 178a.  The court added that the case was distinguishable from \"a situation where the [State] might, after a guilty plea, seek to amend\" a criminal complaint by adding \"new charges\" or facts that fundamentally alter the substance of the complaint.  Id., at 179a.  But here, where only \"alleged prior convictions\" were at issue, the court could eliminate any prejudice to Cuero by allowing him to withdraw his initial guilty plea, thereby restoring both parties to the status quo prior to its entry.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Soon thereafter, California amended the complaint.  The complaint as amended charged Cuero with one felony, (causing bodily injury while driving under the influence of a drug under Cal. Veh. Code Ann. \u00a723153(a)), and it alleged two prior strikes.  Cuero then withdrew his initial guilty plea and entered a new guilty plea to the amended complaint.  On April 20, 2006, the trial court sentenced Cuero to the stipulated term of 25 years to life.  His  conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal, and the California Supreme Court denied a state habeas petition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Cuero then filed a petition for federal habeas relief in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California.  The Federal District Court denied Cuero's petition, but the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  Cuero v. Cate, 827 F.\u00a03d 879 (2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit panel hearing the appeal held that the state trial court had \"acted contrary to clearly established Supreme Court law\" by \"refusing to enforce the original plea agreement\" with its 172-month maximum sentence.  Id., at 888.  It wrote that \"[i]n this context, specific performance\" of that plea agreement--i.e., sentencing Cuero to no more than the roughly 14-year sentence reflected in the 2005 guilty-plea form--was \"necessary to maintain the integrity and fairness of the criminal justice system.\"  Id., at 890, n.\u00a014.  The Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc over the dissent of seven judges.  Cuero v. Cate, 850 F.\u00a03d 1019 (2017).  The State then filed a petition for certiorari here.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit has already issued its mandate in this case.  And the state trial court, in light of that mandate, has resentenced Cuero.  Cuero argues that this fact renders this controversy moot.  The State and Cuero, however, continue to disagree about the proper length of Cuero's sentence, a portion of which he has not yet served.  Thus, neither the losing party's failure to obtain a stay preventing the mandate of the Court of Appeals from issuing nor the trial court's action in light of that mandate makes the case moot.  Mancusi v. Stubbs, 408 U.\u00a0S. 204, 206-207, and\u00a0n. 1 (1972); Eagles v. United States ex rel. Samuels, 329 U.\u00a0S. 304, 306-308 (1946).  Reversal would simply \"und[o] what the habeas corpus court did,\" namely, permit the state courts to determine in the first instance the lawfulness of a longer sentence not yet served.  Id.,  at 308.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit, in ordering specific performance of the 172-month sentence set forth on Cuero's original guilty-plea form, reasoned as follows.  First, the court concluded that Cuero's guilty-plea form amounts to an enforceable plea agreement.  827 F.\u00a03d, at 884-885.  Second, that plea agreement amounts to, and should be interpreted as, a contract under state contract law.  Id., at 883 (citing Ricketts v. Adamson, 483 U.\u00a0S. 1, 5, n. 3 (1987)).  Third, California contract law would consider the State's motion to amend the complaint as a breach of contract.  827 F.\u00a03d, at 887-890.  Fourth, \"the remedy for breach must 'repair the harm caused by the breach.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 890 (quoting People v. Toscano, 124 Cal. App.\u00a04th 340, 20 Cal. Rptr.\u00a03d 923, 927 (2004)).  Fifth, rescission failed to \"\u00a0'repair the harm.'\u00a0\"  827 F.\u00a03d, at 891.  Sixth, consequently Cuero was entitled to specific performance, namely, a maximum prison term of 172 months (14 years and 4 months).  Ibid.  And, seventh, the state court's contrary decision was itself \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1); see 827 F.\u00a03d, at 888.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We shall assume purely for argument's sake that the State violated the Constitution when it moved to amend the complaint.  But we still are unable to find in Supreme Court precedent that \"clearly established federal law\" demanding specific performance as a remedy.  To the contrary, no \"holdin[g] of this Court\" requires the remedy of specific performance under the circumstances present here.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 100 (2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two of our prior decisions address these issues.  The first, Santobello v. New York, 404 U.\u00a0S. 257 (1971), held that a defendant may not be bound to a plea agreement following a prosecutorial breach of an enforceable provision of such an agreement.  Id., at 262.  As relevant here, however, Chief Justice Burger wrote in the opinion for the Court that the \"ultimate relief to which petitioner is entitled\" must be left \"to the discretion of the state court, which is in a better position to decide whether the circumstances of this case require only that there be specific performance of the agreement on the plea\" or, alternatively, that \"the circumstances require granting the relief sought by petitioner, i.e., the opportunity to withdraw his plea of guilty.\"  Id., at 262-263.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Ninth Circuit cited a concurrence in Santobello by Justice Douglas, which added that \"a court ought to accord a defendant's [remedial] preference considerable, if not controlling, weight inasmuch as the fundamental rights flouted by a prosecutor's breach of a plea bargain are those of the defendant, not of the State.\" 827 F.\u00a03d, at 891, n.\u00a014 (quoting Santobello, supra, at 267).  Three other Justices agreed with Justice Douglas on this point, and because only seven Justices participated in the case, the Ninth Circuit suggested that a four-Justice majority in Santo- bello seemed to favor looking to the defendant's preferred remedy.  827 F.\u00a03d, at 891, n.\u00a014 (citing Santobello, supra, at 268, and n. (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  The Ninth Circuit also pointed in support to its own Circuit precedent, a criminal procedure treatise, a decision of the Washington Supreme Court, and a law review article.  See 827 F.\u00a03d, at 890-891, n.\u00a014 (citing Buckley v. Terhune, 441 F.\u00a03d 688, 699, n.\u00a011 (CA9 2006); 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \u00a721.2(e) (4th ed. 2015); State v. Tourtellotte, 88 Wash.\u00a02d 579, 564 P.\u00a02d 799, 802 (1977); and Fischer, Beyond Santobello--Remedies for Reneged Plea Bargains, 2 U. San Fernando Valley L. Rev. 121, 125 (1973)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are several problems with the Ninth Circuit's reasoning below.  First, \"\u00a0'fairminded jurists could disagree'\u00a0\" with the Ninth Circuit's reading of Santobello.  Richter, supra, at 101 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.\u00a0S. 652, 664 (2004)).  Moreover, in Mabry v. Johnson, 467 U.\u00a0S. 504 (1984), the Court wrote that \"Santobello expressly declined to hold that the Constitution compels specific performance of a broken prosecutorial promise as the remedy for such a plea.\"  Id., at 510-511, n.\u00a011 (citing Santobello, 404 U.\u00a0S., at 262-263; id., at 268-269 (Marshall, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).  The Court added that \"permitting Santobello to replead was within the range of constitutionally appropriate remedies.\"  467 U.\u00a0S., at 510, n.\u00a011.  Where, as here, none of our prior decisions clearly entitles Cuero to the relief he seeks, the \"state court's decision could not be 'contrary to' any holding from this Court.\"  Woods v. Donald, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 6) (quoting Lopez v. Smith, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5)).  Finally, as we have repeatedly pointed out, \"circuit precedent does not constitute 'clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.'\u00a0\"  Glebe v. Frost, 574 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3) (quoting 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1)).  Nor, of course, do state-court decisions, treatises, or law review articles.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For all these reasons, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit erred when it held that \"federal law\" as interpreted by this Court \"clearly\" establishes that specific performance is constitutionally required here.  We decide no other issue in this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  We reverse the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\n\n\n","71":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nSESSIONS, ATTORNEY GENERAL v. MORALES-SANTANA(2017)\nNo. 15-1191\nArgued: November 9, 2016Decided: June 12, 2017\n\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act provides the framework for acquisition of U.\u00a0S. citizenship from birth by a child born abroad, when one parent is a U.\u00a0S. citizen and the other a citizen of another nation.  Applicable to married couples, the main rule in effect at the time here relevant, 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), required the U.\u00a0S.-citizen parent to have ten years' physical presence in the United States prior to the child's birth, \"at least five of which were after attaining\" age 14.  The rule is made applicable to unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen fathers by \u00a71409(a), but \u00a71409(c) creates an exception for an unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother, whose citizenship can be transmitted to a child born abroad if she has lived continuously in the United States for just one year prior to the child's birth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Luis Ram\u00f3n Morales-Santana, who has lived in the United States since he was 13, asserts U.\u00a0S. citizenship at birth based on the U.\u00a0S. citizenship of his biological father, Jos\u00e9 Morales.  Jos\u00e9 moved to the Dominican Republic 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to satisfy \u00a71401(a)(7)'s requirement of five years' physical presence after age 14.  There, he lived with the Dominican woman who gave birth to Morales-Santana.  Jos\u00e9 accepted parental responsibility and included Morales-Santana in his household; he married Morales-Santana's mother and his name was then added to hers on Morales-Santana's birth certificate.  In 2000, the Government sought to remove Morales-Santana based on several criminal convictions, ranking him as alien because, at his time of birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement of five years' physical presence after age 14.  An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana's citizenship claim and ordered his removal.  Morales-Santana later moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government's refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from his U.\u00a0S.-citizen father violated the Constitution's equal protection guarantee.  The Board of Immigration Appeals denied the motion, but the Second Circuit reversed.  Relying on this Court's post-1970 construction of the equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed mothers and fathers.  To cure this infirmity, the Court of Appeals held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his mother the U.\u00a0S. citizen.  \nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The gender line Congress drew is incompatible with the Fifth Amendment's requirement that the Government accord to all persons \"the equal protection of the laws.\"  Pp.\u00a06-23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Morales-Santana satisfies the requirements for third-party standing in seeking to vindicate his father's right to equal protection.  Jos\u00e9 Morales' ability to pass citizenship to his son easily satisfies the requirement that the third party have a \"\u00a0'close' relationship with the person who possesses the right.\"  Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.\u00a0S. 125, 130.  And Jos\u00e9's death many years before the current controversy arose is \"a 'hindrance' to [Jos\u00e9's] ability to protect his own interests.\"  Ibid.  Pp.\u00a06-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Sections 1401 and 1409 date from an era when the Nation's lawbooks were rife with overbroad generalizations about the way men and women are.  Today, such laws receive the heightened scrutiny that now attends \"all gender-based classifications,\" J.\u00a0E.\u00a0B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.\u00a0S. 127, 136, including laws granting or denying benefits \"on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,\" Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S. 76, 84.  Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for fathers, \u00a71409 is of the same genre as the classifications declared unconstitutional in Westcott; Reed v. Reed, 404 U.\u00a0S. 71, 74, 76-77; Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.\u00a0S. 677, 688-691; Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.\u00a0S. 636, 648-653; and Califano v.

The classification must serve an important governmental interest today, for \"new insights and societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality .\u00a0.\u00a0. that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.\"  Obergefell v.

In the 1940 Act, Congress codified the mother-as-sole-guardian perception for unmarried parents.  According to the stereotype, a residency requirement was justified for unwed citizen fathers, who would care little about, and have scant contact with, their nonmarital children.  Unwed citizen mothers needed no such prophylactic, because the alien father, along with his foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.  Pp.\u00a09-13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0For close to a half century, this Court has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on \"overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\"  Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 533.  No \"important [governmental] interest\" is served by laws grounded, as \u00a71409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that \"unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than mothers\" to take responsibility for nonmarital children.  Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.\u00a0S. 380, 382, 394.  In light of this equal protection jurisprudence, \u00a71409(a) and (c)'s discrete duration-of-residence requirements for mothers and fathers are anachronistic.

Albright, 523 U.\u00a0S. 420; and Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.\u00a0S. 53, for support.  But Fiallo involved entry preferences for alien children; the case did not present a claim of U.\u00a0S. citizenship.  And Miller and Nguyen addressed a paternal-acknowledgment requirement well met here, not the length of a parent's prebirth residency in the United States.

Pp.\u00a016-23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0The Government asserts that Congress sought to ensure that a child born abroad has a strong connection to the United States.  The statute, the Government suggests, bracketed an unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother with a married couple in which both parents are U.\u00a0S. citizens because she is the only legally recognized parent at birth; and aligned an unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a citizen, the other, an alien, because of the competing national influence of the alien mother.  This rationale conforms to the long-held view that unwed fathers care little about their children.  And the gender-based means scarcely serve the suggested congressional interest.  Citizenship may be transmitted to children who have no tie to the United States so long as their U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother was continuously present in the United States for one year at any point in her life prior to the child's birth; but it may not be transmitted by a U.\u00a0S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting \u00a71401(a)(7)'s longer physical-presence requirements, even if he acknowledges paternity on the day the child is born and raises the child in the United States.  Pp.\u00a017-19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The Government also maintains that Congress wished to reduce the risk of statelessness for the foreign-born child of a U.\u00a0S. citizen.  But congressional hearings and reports offer no support for the assertion that a statelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence requirements.  Nor has the Government shown that the risk of statelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers.  Pp.\u00a019-23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Because this Court is not equipped to convert \u00a71409(c)'s exception for unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers into the main rule displacing \u00a7\u00a71401(a)(7) and 1409(a), it falls to Congress to select a uniform prescription that neither favors nor disadvantages any person on the basis of gender.  In the interim, \u00a71401(a)(7)'s current requirement should apply, prospectively, to children born to unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers.  The legislature's intent, as revealed by the statute at hand, governs the choice between the two remedial alternatives: extending favorable treatment to the excluded class or withdrawing favorable treatment from the favored class.  Ordinarily, the preferred rule is to extend favorable treatment.  Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 89-90.  Here, however, extension to fathers of \u00a71409(c)'s favorable treatment for mothers would displace Congress' general rule, the longer physical-presence requirements of \u00a7\u00a71401(a)(7) and 1409 applicable to unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen fathers and U.\u00a0S.-citizen parents, male as well as female, married to the child's alien parent.  Congress' \"\u00a0'commitment to th[is] residual policy'\u00a0\" and \"\u00a0'the degree of potential disruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as opposed to abrogation,'\u00a0\" Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.\u00a0S. 728, 739, n.\u00a05, indicate that Congress would likely have abrogated \u00a71409(c)'s special exception, preferring to preserve \"the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of dedicated attachment,\" Rogers v.

SESSIONS, III, ATTORNEY GENERAL, PETITIONER v. LUIS RAMON MORALES-SANTANA\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit\n[June 12, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case concerns a gender-based differential in the law governing acquisition of U.\u00a0S. citizenship by a child born abroad, when one parent is a U.\u00a0S. citizen, the other, a citizen of another nation.  The main rule appears in 8\u00a0U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71401(a)(7) (1958 ed.), now \u00a71401(g) (2012 ed.).  Applicable to married couples, \u00a71401(a)(7) requires a period of physical presence in the United States for the U.\u00a0S.-citizen parent.  The requirement, as initially prescribed, was ten years' physical presence prior to the child's birth, \u00a7601(g) (1940 ed.); currently, the requirement is five years prebirth, \u00a71401(g) (2012 ed.).  That main rule is rendered applicable to unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen fathers by \u00a71409(a).  Congress ordered an exception, however, for unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers.  Contained in \u00a71409(c), the exception allows an unwed mother to transmit her citizenship to a child born abroad if she has lived in the United States for just one year prior to the child's birth.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The respondent in this case, Luis Ram\u00f3n Morales-Santana, was born in the Dominican Republic when his father was just 20 days short of meeting \u00a71401(a)(7)'s physical-presence requirement.  Opposing removal to the Dominican Republic, Morales-Santana asserts that the equal protection principle implicit in the Fifth Amendment1 entitles him to citizenship stature.  We hold that the gender line Congress drew is incompatible with the requirement that the Government accord to all persons \"the equal protection of the laws.\"  Nevertheless, we cannot convert \u00a71409(c)'s exception for unwed mothers into the main rule displacing \u00a71401(a)(7) (covering married couples) and \u00a71409(a) (covering unwed fathers).  We must therefore leave it to Congress to select, going forward, a physical-presence requirement (ten years, one year, or some other period) uniformly applicable to all children born abroad with one U.\u00a0S.-citizen and one alien parent, wed or unwed.  In the interim, the Government must ensure that the laws in question are administered in a manner free from gender-based discrimination.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We first describe in greater detail the regime Congress constructed.  The general rules for acquiring U.\u00a0S. citizenship are found in 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71401, the first section in Chapter 1 of Title III of the Immigration and Nationality Act (1952 Act or INA), \u00a7301, 66 Stat. 235-236.  Section 1401 sets forth the INA's rules for determining who \"shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth\" by establishing a range of residency and physical-presence requirements calibrated primarily to the parents' nationality and the child's place of birth.  \u00a71401(a) (1958 ed.); \u00a71401 (2012 ed.).  The primacy of \u00a71401 in the statutory scheme is evident.  Comprehensive in coverage, \u00a71401 provides the general framework for the acquisition of citizenship at birth.  In particular, at the time relevant here,2 \u00a71401(a)(7) provided for the U.\u00a0S. citizenship of\n\"a person born outside the geographical limits of the United States and its outlying possessions of parents one of whom is an alien, and the other a citizen of the United States who, prior to the birth of such person, was physically present in the United States or its outlying possessions for a period or periods totaling not less than ten years, at least five of which were after attaining the age of fourteen years: Provided, That any periods of honorable service in the Armed Forces of the United States by such citizen parent may be included in computing the physical presence requirements of this paragraph.\"\nCongress has since reduced the duration requirement to five years, two after age 14.  \u00a71401(g) (2012 ed.).3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Section 1409 pertains specifically to children with unmarried parents.  Its first subsection, \u00a71409(a), incorporates by reference the physical-presence requirements of \u00a71401, thereby allowing an acknowledged unwed citizen parent to transmit U.\u00a0S. citizenship to a foreign-born child under the same terms as a married citizen parent.  Section 1409(c)--a provision applicable only to unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers--states an exception to the physical-presence requirements of \u00a7\u00a71401 and 1409(a).  Under \u00a71409(c)'s exception, only one year of continuous physical presence is required before unwed mothers may pass citizenship to their children born abroad.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent Luis Ram\u00f3n Morales-Santana moved to the United States at age 13, and has resided in this country most of his life.  Now facing deportation, he asserts U.\u00a0S. citizenship at birth based on the citizenship of his biological father, Jos\u00e9 Morales, who accepted parental responsibility and included Morales-Santana in his household.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Jos\u00e9 Morales was born in Gu\u00e1nica, Puerto Rico, on March 19, 1900.  Record 55-56.  Puerto Rico was then, as it is now, part of the United States, see Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (slip op., at 2-4); 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71101(a)(38) (1958 ed.) (\"The term United States .\u00a0.\u00a0. means the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the [U.\u00a0S.] Virgin Islands.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); \u00a71101(a)(38) (2012 ed.) (similar), and Jos\u00e9 became a U.\u00a0S. citizen under the Organic Act of Puerto Rico, ch. 145, \u00a75, 39 Stat. 953 (a predecessor to 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71402).  After living in Puerto Rico for nearly two decades, Jos\u00e9 left his childhood home on February 27, 1919, 20 days short of his 19th birthday, therefore failing to satisfy \u00a71401(a)(7)'s requirement of five years' physical presence after age 14.  Record 57, 66.  He did so to take up employment as a builder-mechanic for a U.\u00a0S. company in the then-U.\u00a0S.-occupied Dominican Republic.  Ibid.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By 1959, Jos\u00e9 attested in a June 21, 1971 affidavit presented to the U.\u00a0S. Embassy in the Dominican Republic, he was living with Yrma Santana Montilla, a Dominican woman he would eventually marry.  Id., at 57.  In 1962, Yrma gave birth to their child, respondent Luis Morales-Santana.  Id., at 166-167.  While the record before us reveals little about Morales-Santana's childhood, the Dominican archives disclose that Yrma and Jos\u00e9 married in 1970, and that Jos\u00e9 was then added to Morales-Santana's birth certificate as his father.  Id., at 163-164, 167.  Jos\u00e9 also related in the same affidavit that he was then saving money \"for the susten[ance] of [his] family\" in anticipation of undergoing surgery in Puerto Rico, where members of his family still resided.  Id., at 57.  In 1975, when Morales-Santana was 13, he moved to Puerto Rico, id., at 368, and by 1976, the year his father died, he was attending public school in the Bronx, a New York City borough, id., at 140, 369.5\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2000, the Government placed Morales-Santana in removal proceedings based on several convictions for offenses under New York State Penal Law, all of them rendered on May 17, 1995.  Id., at 426.  Morales-Santana ranked as an alien despite the many years he lived in the United States, because, at the time of his birth, his father did not satisfy the requirement of five years' physical presence after age 14.  See supra, at 3-4, and n.\u00a03.  An immigration judge rejected Morales-Santana's claim to citizenship derived from the U.\u00a0S. citizenship of his father, and ordered Morales-Santana's removal to the Dominican Republic.  Record 253, 366; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a-49a.  In 2010, Morales-Santana moved to reopen the proceedings, asserting that the Government's refusal to recognize that he derived citizenship from his U.\u00a0S.-citizen father violated the Constitution's equal protection guarantee.  See Record 27, 45.  The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) denied the motion.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 8a, 42a-44a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the BIA's decision.  804 F.\u00a03d 520, 524 (2015).  Relying on this Court's post-1970 construction of the equal protection principle as it bears on gender-based classifications, the court held unconstitutional the differential treatment of unwed mothers and fathers.  Id., at 527-535.  To cure the constitutional flaw, the court further held that Morales-Santana derived citizenship through his father, just as he would were his mother the U.\u00a0S. citizen.  Id., at 535-538.  In so ruling, the Second Circuit declined to follow the conflicting decision of the Ninth Circuit in United States v. Flores-Villar, 536 F.\u00a03d 990 (2008), see 804 F.\u00a03d, at 530, 535, n.\u00a017.  We granted certiorari in Flores-Villar, but ultimately affirmed by an equally divided Court.  Flores-Villar v. United States, 564 U.\u00a0S. 210 (2011) (\u00a0per curiam).  Taking up Morales-Santana's request for review, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), we consider the matter anew.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because \u00a71409 treats sons and daughters alike, Morales-Santana does not suffer discrimination on the basis of his gender.  He complains, instead, of gender-based discrimination against his father, who was unwed at the time of Morales-Santana's birth and was not accorded the right an unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother would have to transmit citizenship to her child.  Although the Government does not contend otherwise, we briefly explain why Morales-Santana may seek to vindicate his father's right to the equal protection of the laws.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ordinarily, a party \"must assert his own legal rights\" and \"cannot rest his claim to relief on the legal rights .\u00a0.\u00a0. of third parties.\"  Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.\u00a0S. 490, 499 (1975).  But we recognize an exception where, as here, \"the party asserting the right has a close relationship with the person who possesses the right [and] there is a hindrance to the possessor's ability to protect his own interests.\"  Kowalski v. Tesmer, 543 U.\u00a0S. 125, 130 (2004) (quoting Powers v. Ohio, 499 U.\u00a0S. 400, 411 (1991)).  Jos\u00e9 Morales' ability to pass citizenship to his son, respondent Morales-Santana, easily satisfies the \"close relationship\" requirement.  So, too, is the \"hindrance\" requirement well met.  Jos\u00e9 Morales' failure to assert a claim in his own right \"stems from disability,\" not \"disinterest,\" Miller v. Albright, 523 U.\u00a0S. 420, 450 (1998) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment), for Jos\u00e9 died in 1976, Record 140, many years before the current controversy arose.  See Hodel v. Irving, 481 U.\u00a0S. 704, 711-712, 723, n.\u00a07 (1987) (children and their guardians may assert Fifth Amendment rights of deceased relatives).  Morales-Santana is thus the \"obvious claimant,\" see Craig v. Boren, 429 U.\u00a0S. 190, 197 (1976), the \"best available proponent,\" Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.\u00a0S. 106, 116 (1976), of his father's right to equal protection.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sections 1401 and 1409, we note, date from an era when the lawbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generalizations about the way men and women are.  See, e.g., Hoyt v. Florida, 368 U.\u00a0S. 57, 62 (1961) (women are the \"center of home and family life,\" therefore they can be \"relieved from the civic duty of jury service\"); Goesaert v. Cleary, 335 U.\u00a0S. 464, 466 (1948) (States may draw \"a sharp line between the sexes\").  Today, laws of this kind are subject to review under the heightened scrutiny that now attends \"all gender-based classifications.\"  J.\u00a0E.\u00a0B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.\u00a0S. 127, 136 (1994); see, e.g., United States v. Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S. 515, 555-556 (1996) (state-maintained military academy may not deny admission to qualified women).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Laws granting or denying benefits \"on the basis of the sex of the qualifying parent,\" our post-1970 decisions affirm, differentiate on the basis of gender, and therefore attract heightened review under the Constitution's equal protection guarantee.  Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S. 76, 84 (1979); see id., at 88-89 (holding unconstitutional provision of unemployed-parent benefits exclusively to fathers).  Accord Califano v. Goldfarb, 430 U.\u00a0S. 199, 206-207 (1977) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional a Social Security classification that denied widowers survivors' benefits available to widows); Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.\u00a0S. 636, 648-653 (1975) (holding unconstitutional a Social Security classification that excluded fathers from receipt of child-in-care benefits available to mothers); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.\u00a0S. 677, 688-691 (1973) (plurality opinion) (holding unconstitutional exclusion of married female officers in the military from benefits automatically accorded married male officers); cf. Reed v. Reed, 404 U.\u00a0S. 71, 74, 76-77 (1971) (holding unconstitutional a probate-code preference for a father over a mother as administrator of a deceased child's estate).7\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Prescribing one rule for mothers, another for fathers, \u00a71409 is of the same genre as the classifications we declared unconstitutional in Reed, Frontiero, Wiesenfeld, Goldfarb, and Westcott.  As in those cases, heightened scrutiny is in order.  Successful defense of legislation that differentiates on the basis of gender, we have reiterated, requires an \"exceedingly persuasive justification.\"  Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted); Kirchberg v. Feenstra, 450 U.\u00a0S. 455, 461 (1981) (internal quotation marks omitted).\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The defender of legislation that differentiates on the basis of gender must show \"at least that the [challenged] classification serves important governmental objectives and that the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.\"  Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 533 (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.\u00a0S. 718, 724 (1982); alteration in original); see Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.\u00a0S. 53, 60, 70 (2001).  Moreover, the classification must substantially serve an important governmental interest today, for \"in interpreting the [e]qual [p]rotection [guarantee], [we have] recognized that new insights and societal understandings can reveal unjustified inequality .\u00a0.\u00a0. that once passed unnoticed and unchallenged.\"  Obergefell v. Hodges, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 20).  Here, the Government has supplied no \"exceedingly persuasive justification,\" Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 531 (internal quotation marks omitted), for \u00a71409(a) and (c)'s \"gender-based\" and \"gender-biased\" disparity, Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 84 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0History reveals what lurks behind \u00a71409.  Enacted in the Nationality Act of 1940 (1940 Act), see 54 Stat. 1139-1140, \u00a71409 ended a century and a half of congressional silence on the citizenship of children born abroad to unwed parents.8  During this era, two once habitual, but now untenable, assumptions pervaded our Nation's citizenship laws and underpinned judicial and administrative rulings: In marriage, husband is dominant, wife subordinate; unwed mother is the natural and sole guardian of a nonmarital child.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the once entrenched principle of male dominance in marriage, the husband controlled both wife and child.  \"[D]ominance [of] the husband,\" this Court observed in 1915, \"is an ancient principle of our jurisprudence.\"  Mackenzie v. Hare, 239 U.\u00a0S. 299, 311 (1915).9  See generally Brief for Professors of History et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 4-15.  Through the early 20th century, a male citizen automatically conferred U.\u00a0S. citizenship on his alien wife.  Act of Feb. 10, 1855, ch. 71, \u00a72, 10 Stat. 604; see Kelly v. Owen, 7 Wall. 496, 498 (1869) (the 1855 Act \"confers the privileges of citizenship upon women married to citizens of the United States\"); C. Bredbenner, A Nationality of Her Own: Women, Marriage, and the Law of Citizenship 15-16, 20-21 (1998).  A female citizen, however, was incapable of conferring citizenship on her husband; indeed, she was subject to expatriation if she married an alien.10  The family of a citizen or a lawfully admitted permanent resident enjoyed statutory exemptions from entry requirements, but only if the citizen or resident was male.  See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1903, ch. 1012, \u00a737, 32 Stat. 1221 (wives and children entering the country to join permanent-resident aliens and found to have contracted contagious diseases during transit shall not be deported if the diseases were easily curable or did not present a danger to others); S.\u00a0Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 415-417 (1950) (wives exempt from literacy and quota requirements).  And from 1790 until 1934, the foreign-born child of a married couple gained U.\u00a0S. citizenship only through the father.11\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For unwed parents, the father-controls tradition never held sway.  Instead, the mother was regarded as the child's natural and sole guardian.  At common law, the mother, and only the mother, was \"bound to maintain [a nonmarital child] as its natural guardian.\"  2 J. Kent, Commentaries on American Law *215-*216 (8th ed. 1854); see Nguyen, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 91-92 (O'Connor, J., dissenting).  In line with that understanding, in the early 20th century, the State Department sometimes permitted unwed mothers to pass citizenship to their children, despite the absence of any statutory authority for the practice.  See Hearings on H.\u00a0R. 6127 before the House Committee on Immigration and Naturalization, 76th Cong., 1st Sess., 43, 431 (1940) (hereinafter 1940 Hearings); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 397, 397-398 (1939); 39 Op. Atty. Gen. 290, 291 (1939).  See also Collins, Illegitimate Borders: Jus Sanguinis Citizenship and the Legal Construction of Family, Race, and Nation, 123 Yale L.\u00a0J. 2134, 2199-2205 (2014) (hereinafter Collins).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the 1940 Act, Congress discarded the father-controls assumption concerning married parents, but codified the mother-as-sole-guardian perception regarding unmarried parents.  The Roosevelt administration, which proposed \u00a71409, explained: \"[T]he mother [of a nonmarital child] stands in the place of the father .\u00a0.\u00a0. [,] has a right to the custody and control of such a child as against the putative father, and is bound to maintain it as its natural guardian.\"  1940 Hearings 431 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This unwed-mother-as-natural-guardian notion renders \u00a71409's gender-based residency rules understandable.  Fearing that a foreign-born child could turn out \"more alien than American in character,\" the administration believed that a citizen parent with lengthy ties to the United States would counteract the influence of the alien parent.  Id., at 426-427.  Concern about the attachment of foreign-born children to the United States explains the treatment of unwed citizen fathers, who, according to the familiar stereotype, would care little about, and have scant contact with, their nonmarital children.  For unwed citizen mothers, however, there was no need for a prolonged residency prophylactic: The alien father, who might transmit foreign ways, was presumptively out of the picture.  See id., at 431; Collins 2203 (in \"nearly uniform view\" of U.\u00a0S. officials, \"almost invariably,\" the mother alone \"concern[ed] herself with [a nonmarital] child\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For close to a half century, as earlier observed, see supra, at 7-8, this Court has viewed with suspicion laws that rely on \"overbroad generalizations about the different talents, capacities, or preferences of males and females.\"  Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 533; see Wiesenfeld, 420 U.\u00a0S., at 643, 648.  In particular, we have recognized that if a \"statutory objective is to exclude or 'protect' members of one gender\" in reliance on \"fixed notions concerning [that gender's] roles and abilities,\" the \"objective itself is illegitimate.\"  Mississippi Univ. for Women, 458 U.\u00a0S., at 725.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In accord with this eventual understanding, the Court has held that no \"important [governmental] interest\" is served by laws grounded, as \u00a71409(a) and (c) are, in the obsolescing view that \"unwed fathers [are] invariably less qualified and entitled than mothers\" to take responsibility for nonmarital children.  Caban v. Mohammed, 441 U.\u00a0S. 380, 382, 394 (1979).12  Overbroad generalizations of that order, the Court has come to comprehend, have a constraining impact, descriptive though they may be of the way many people still order their lives.13  Laws according or denying benefits in reliance on \"[s]tereotypes about women's domestic roles,\" the Court has observed, may \"creat[e] a self-fulfilling cycle of discrimination that force[s] women to continue to assume the role of primary family caregiver.\"  Nevada Dept. of Human Resources v. Hibbs, 538 U.\u00a0S. 721, 736 (2003).  Correspondingly, such laws may disserve men who exercise responsibility for raising their children.  See ibid.  In light of the equal protection jurisprudence this Court has developed since 1971, see Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 531-534, \u00a71409(a) and (c)'s discrete duration-of-residence requirements for unwed mothers and fathers who have accepted parental responsibility is stunningly anachronistic.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In urging this Court nevertheless to reject Morales-Santana's equal protection plea, the Government cites three decisions of this Court: Fiallo v. Bell, 430 U.\u00a0S. 787 (1977); Miller v. Albright, 523 U.\u00a0S. 420; and Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.\u00a0S. 53.  None controls this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The 1952 Act provision at issue in Fiallo gave special immigration preferences to alien children of citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) mothers, and to alien unwed mothers of citizen (or lawful-permanent-resident) children.  430 U.\u00a0S., at 788-789, and n.\u00a01.  Unwed fathers and their children, asserting their right to equal protection, sought the same preferences.  Id., at 791.  Applying minimal scrutiny (rational-basis review), the Court upheld the provision, relying on Congress' \"exceptionally broad power\" to admit or exclude aliens.  Id., at 792, 794.14  This case, however, involves no entry preference for aliens.  Morales-Santana claims he is, and since birth has been, a U.\u00a0S. citizen.  Examining a claim of that order, the Court has not disclaimed, as it did in Fiallo, the application of an exacting standard of review.  See Nguyen, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 60-61, 70; Miller, 523 U.\u00a0S., at 434-435, n.\u00a011 (opinion of Stevens, J.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The provision challenged in Miller and Nguyen as violative of equal protection requires unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen fathers, but not mothers, to formally acknowledge parenthood of their foreign-born children in order to transmit their U.\u00a0S. citizenship to those children.  See \u00a71409(a)(4) (2012 ed.).15  After Miller produced no opinion for the Court, see 523 U.\u00a0S., at 423, we took up the issue anew in Nguyen.  There, the Court held that imposing a paternal-acknowledgment requirement on fathers was a justifiable, easily met means of ensuring the existence of a biological parent-child relationship, which the mother establishes by giving birth.  See 533 U.\u00a0S., at 62-63.  Morales-Santana's challenge does not renew the contest over \u00a71409's paternal-acknowledgment requirement (whether the current version or that in effect in 1970), and the Government does not dispute that Morales-Santana's father, by marrying Morales-Santana's mother, satisfied that requirement.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unlike the paternal-acknowledgment requirement at issue in Nguyen and Miller, the physical-presence requirements now before us relate solely to the duration of the parent's prebirth residency in the United States, not to the parent's filial tie to the child.  As the Court of Appeals observed in this case, a man needs no more time in the United States than a woman \"in order to have assimilated citizenship-related values to transmit to [his] child.\"  804 F.\u00a03d, at 531.  And unlike Nguyen's parental-acknowledgment requirement, \u00a71409(a)'s age-calibrated physical-presence requirements cannot fairly be described as \"minimal.\"  533 U.\u00a0S., at 70.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Notwithstanding \u00a71409(a) and (c)'s provenance in traditional notions of the way women and men are, the Government maintains that the statute serves two important objectives: (1) ensuring a connection between the child to become a citizen and the United States and (2) preventing \"statelessness,\" i.e., a child's possession of no citizenship at all.  Even indulging the assumption that Congress intended \u00a71409 to serve these interests, but see supra, at 9-13, neither rationale survives heightened scrutiny.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We take up first the Government's assertion that \u00a71409(a) and (c)'s gender-based differential ensures that a child born abroad has a connection to the United States of sufficient strength to warrant conferral of citizenship at birth.  The Government does not contend, nor could it, that unmarried men take more time to absorb U.\u00a0S. values than unmarried women do.  See supra, at 16.  Instead, it presents a novel argument, one it did not advance in Flores-Villar.16\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An unwed mother, the Government urges, is the child's only \"legally recognized\" parent at the time of childbirth.  Brief for Petitioner 9-10, 28-32.17  An unwed citizen father enters the scene later, as a second parent.  A longer physical connection to the United States is warranted for the unwed father, the Government maintains, because of the \"competing national influence\" of the alien mother.  Id., at 9-10.  Congress, the Government suggests, designed the statute to bracket an unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother with a married couple in which both parents are U.\u00a0S. citizens,18 and to align an unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen father with a married couple, one spouse a citizen, the other, an alien.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Underlying this apparent design is the assumption that the alien father of a nonmarital child born abroad to a U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother will not accept parental responsibility.  For an actual affiliation between alien father and nonmarital child would create the \"competing national influence\" that, according to the Government, justifies imposing on unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen fathers, but not unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers, lengthy physical-presence requirements.  Hardly gender neutral, see id., at 9, that assumption conforms to the long-held view that unwed fathers care little about, indeed are strangers to, their children.  See supra, at 9-13.  Lump characterization of that kind, however, no longer passes equal protection inspection.  See supra, at 13-14, and n.\u00a013.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accepting, arguendo, that Congress intended the diverse physical-presence prescriptions to serve an interest in ensuring a connection between the foreign-born nonmarital child and the United States, the gender-based means scarcely serve the posited end.  The scheme permits the transmission of citizenship to children who have no tie to the United States so long as their mother was a U.\u00a0S. citizen continuously present in the United States for one year at any point in her life prior to the child's birth.  The transmission holds even if the mother marries the child's alien father immediately after the child's birth and never returns with the child to the United States.  At the same time, the legislation precludes citizenship transmission by a U.\u00a0S.-citizen father who falls a few days short of meeting \u00a71401(a)(7)'s longer physical-presence requirements, even if the father acknowledges paternity on the day of the child's birth and raises the child in the United States.19  One cannot see in this driven-by-gender scheme the close means-end fit required to survive heightened scrutiny.  See, e.g., Wengler v. Druggists Mut. Ins. Co., 446 U.\u00a0S. 142, 151-152 (1980) (holding unconstitutional state workers' compensation death-benefits statute presuming widows' but not widowers' dependence on their spouse's earnings); Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 88-89.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government maintains that Congress established the gender-based residency differential in \u00a71409(a) and (c) to reduce the risk that a foreign-born child of a U.\u00a0S. citizen would be born stateless.  Brief for Petitioner 33.  This risk, according to the Government, was substantially greater for the foreign-born child of an unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother than it was for the foreign-born child of an unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen father.  Ibid.  But there is little reason to believe that a statelessness concern prompted the diverse physical-presence requirements.  Nor has the Government shown that the risk of statelessness disproportionately endangered the children of unwed mothers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the Court of Appeals pointed out, with one exception,20 nothing in the congressional hearings and reports on the 1940 and 1952 Acts \"refer[s] to the problem of statelessness for children born abroad.\"  804 F.\u00a03d, at 532-533.  See Collins 2205, n.\u00a0283 (author examined \"many hundreds of pre-1940 administrative memos .\u00a0.\u00a0. defend[ing] or explain[ing] recognition of the nonmarital foreign-born children of American mothers as citizens\"; of the hundreds, \"exactly one memo by a U.\u00a0S. official .\u00a0.\u00a0. mentions the risk of statelessness for the foreign-born nonmarital children of American mothers as a concern\").  Reducing the incidence of statelessness was the express goal of other sections of the 1940 Act.  See 1940 Hearings 430 (\"stateless[ness]\" is \"object\" of section on foundlings).  The justification for \u00a71409's gender-based dichotomy, however, was not the child's plight, it was the mother's role as the \"natural guardian\" of a nonmarital child.  See supra, at 9-13; Collins 2205 (\"[T]he pronounced gender asymmetry of the Nationality Act's treatment of nonmarital foreign-born children of American mothers and fathers was shaped by contemporary maternalist norms regarding the mother's relationship with her nonmarital child--and the father's lack of such a relationship.\").  It will not do to \"hypothesiz[e] or inven[t]\" governmental purposes for gender classifications \"post hoc in response to litigation.\"  Virginia, 518 U.\u00a0S., at 533, 535-536.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Infecting the Government's risk-of-statelessness argument is an assumption without foundation.  \"[F]oreign laws that would put the child of the U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother at risk of statelessness (by not providing for the child to acquire the father's citizenship at birth),\" the Government asserts, \"would protect the child of the U.\u00a0S.-citizen father against statelessness by providing that the child would take his mother's citizenship.\"  Brief for Petitioner 35.  The Government, however, neglected to expose this supposed \"protection\" to a reality check.  Had it done so, it would have recognized the formidable impediments placed by foreign laws on an unwed mother's transmission of citizenship to her child.  See Brief for Scholars on Statelessness as Amici Curiae 13-22, A1-A15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Experts who have studied the issue report that, at the time relevant here, in \"at least thirty countries,\" citizen mothers generally could not transmit their citizenship to nonmarital children born within the mother's country.  Id., at 14; see id., at 14-17.  \"[A]s many as forty-five countries,\" they further report, \"did not permit their female citizens to assign nationality to a nonmarital child born outside the subject country with a foreign father.\"  Id., at 18; see id., at 18-21.  In still other countries, they also observed, there was no legislation in point, leaving the nationality of nonmarital children uncertain.  Id., at 21-22; see Sandifer, A Comparative Study of Laws Relating to Nationality at Birth and to Loss of Nationality, 29 Am. J. Int'l L. 248, 256, 258 (1935) (of 79 nations studied, about half made no specific provision for the nationality of nonmarital children).  Taking account of the foreign laws actually in force, these experts concluded, \"the risk of parenting stateless children abroad was, as of [1940 and 1952], and remains today, substantial for unmarried U.\u00a0S. fathers, a risk perhaps greater than that for unmarried U.\u00a0S. mothers.\"  Brief for Scholars on Statelessness as Amici Curiae 9-10; see id., at 38-39.  One can hardly characterize as gender neutral a scheme allegedly attending to the risk of statelessness for children of unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers while ignoring the same risk for children of unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen fathers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2014, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) undertook a ten-year project to eliminate statelessness by 2024.  See generally UNHCR, Ending Statelessness Within 10 Years, online at http:\/\/ www.unhcr.org\/en-us\/protection\/statelessness\/546217229\/ special-report-ending-statelessness-10-years.html (all Internet materials as last visited June 9, 2017).  Cognizant that discrimination against either mothers or fathers in citizenship and nationality laws is a major cause of statelessness, the Commissioner has made a key component of its project the elimination of gender discrimination in such laws.  UNHCR, The Campaign To End Statelessness: April 2016 Update 1 (referring to speech of UNHCR \"highlight[ing] the issue of gender discrimination in the nationality laws of 27 countries--a major cause of statelessness globally\"), online at http:\/\/www.unhcr.org\/ibelong\/ wp-content\u00a0\/\u00a0uploads\u00a0\/\u00a0Campaign-Update-April-2016.pdf; UNHCR, Background Note on Gender Equality, Nationality Laws and Statelessness 2016, p.\u00a01 (\"Ensuring gender equality in nationality laws can mitigate the risks of statelessness.\"), online at http:\/\/www.refworld.org\/docid\/ 56de83ca4.html.  In this light, we cannot countenance risk of statelessness as a reason to uphold, rather than strike out, differential treatment of unmarried women and men with regard to transmission of citizenship to their children.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the Government has advanced no \"exceedingly persuasive\" justification for \u00a71409(a) and (c)'s gender-specific residency and age criteria.  Those disparate criteria, we hold, cannot withstand inspection under a Constitution that requires the Government to respect the equal dignity and stature of its male and female citizens.21\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While the equal protection infirmity in retaining a longer physical-presence requirement for unwed fathers than for unwed mothers is clear, this Court is not equipped to grant the relief Morales-Santana seeks, i.e., extending to his father (and, derivatively, to him) the benefit of the one-year physical-presence term \u00a71409(c) reserves for unwed mothers.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are \"two remedial alternatives,\" our decisions instruct, Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 89 (quoting Welsh v. United States, 398 U.\u00a0S. 333, 361 (1970) (Harlan, J., concurring in result)), when a statute benefits one class (in this case, unwed mothers and their children), as \u00a71409(c) does, and excludes another from the benefit (here, unwed fathers and their children).  \"[A] court may either declare [the statute] a nullity and order that its benefits not extend to the class that the legislature intended to benefit, or it may extend the coverage of the statute to include those who are aggrieved by exclusion.\"  Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 89 (quoting Welsh, 398 U.\u00a0S., at 361 (opinion of Harlan, J.)).22  \"[W]hen the 'right invoked is that to equal treatment,' the appropriate remedy is a mandate of equal treatment, a result that can be accomplished by withdrawal of benefits from the favored class as well as by extension of benefits to the excluded class.\"  Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.\u00a0S. 728, 740 (1984) (quoting Iowa-Des Moines Nat. Bank v. Bennett, 284 U.\u00a0S. 239, 247 (1931); emphasis deleted).  \"How equality is accomplished .\u00a0.\u00a0. is a matter on which the Constitution is silent.\"  Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.\u00a0S. 413, 426-427 (2010).23\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The choice between these outcomes is governed by the legislature's intent, as revealed by the statute at hand.  See id., at 427 (\"On finding unlawful discrimination, .\u00a0.\u00a0. courts may attempt, within the bounds of their institutional competence, to implement what the legislature would have willed had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity.\").  See also Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng., 546 U.\u00a0S. 320, 330 (2006) (\"the touchstone for any decision about remedy is legislative intent\").24\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ordinarily, we have reiterated, \"extension, rather than nullification, is the proper course.\"  Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 89.  Illustratively, in a series of cases involving federal financial assistance benefits, the Court struck discriminatory exceptions denying benefits to discrete groups, which meant benefits previously denied were extended.  See, e.g., Goldfarb, 430 U.\u00a0S., at 202-204, 213-217 (plurality opinion) (survivors' benefits), aff'g 396 F. Supp. 308, 309 (EDNY 1975) (per curiam); Jimenez v. Weinberger, 417 U.\u00a0S. 628, 630-631, and n.\u00a02, 637-638 (1974) (disability benefits); Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, 413 U.\u00a0S. 528, 529-530, 538 (1973) (food stamps); Frontiero, 411 U.\u00a0S., at 678-679, and n.\u00a02, 691, and n.\u00a025 (plurality opinion) (military spousal benefits).  Here, however, the discriminatory exception consists of favorable treatment for a discrete group (a shorter physical-presence requirement for unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers giving birth abroad).  Following the same approach as in those benefits cases--striking the discriminatory exception--leads here to extending the general rule of longer physical-presence requirements to cover the previously favored group.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has looked to Justice Harlan's concurring opinion in Welsh v. United States, 398 U.\u00a0S., at 361-367, in considering whether the legislature would have struck an exception and applied the general rule equally to all, or instead, would have broadened the exception to cure the equal protection violation.  In making this assessment, a court should \"\u00a0'measure the intensity of commitment to the residual policy'\u00a0\"--the main rule, not the exception--\"\u00a0'and consider the degree of potential disruption of the statutory scheme that would occur by extension as opposed to abrogation.'\u00a0\"  Heckler, 465 U.\u00a0S., at 739, n.\u00a05 (quoting Welsh, 398 U.\u00a0S., at 365 (opinion of Harlan, J.)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The residual policy here, the longer physical-presence requirement stated in \u00a7\u00a71401(a)(7) and 1409, evidences Congress' recognition of \"the importance of residence in this country as the talisman of dedicated attachment.\"  Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.\u00a0S. 815, 834 (1971); see Weedin v. Chin Bow, 274 U.\u00a0S. 657, 665-666 (1927) (Congress \"attached more importance to actual residence in the United States as indicating a basis for citizenship than it did to descent.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. [T]he heritable blood of citizenship was thus associated unmistakeably with residence within the country which was thus recognized as essential to full citizenship.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And the potential for \"disruption of the statutory scheme\" is large.  For if \u00a71409(c)'s one-year dispensation were extended to unwed citizen fathers, would it not be irrational to retain the longer term when the U.\u00a0S.-citizen parent is married?  Disadvantageous treatment of marital children in comparison to nonmarital children is scarcely a purpose one can sensibly attribute to Congress.25\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although extension of benefits is customary in federal benefit cases, see supra, at 23-24, n.\u00a022, 25, all indicators in this case point in the opposite direction.26  Put to the choice, Congress, we believe, would have abrogated \u00a71409(c)'s exception, preferring preservation of the general rule.27\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The gender-based distinction infecting \u00a7\u00a71401(a)(7) and 1409(a) and (c), we hold, violates the equal protection principle, as the Court of Appeals correctly ruled.  For the reasons stated, however, we must adopt the remedial course Congress likely would have chosen \"had it been apprised of the constitutional infirmity.\"  Levin, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 427.  Although the preferred rule in the typical case is to extend favorable treatment, see Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 89-90, this is hardly the typical case.28  Extension here would render the special treatment Congress prescribed in \u00a71409(c), the one-year physical-presence requirement for U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers, the general rule, no longer an exception.  Section 1401(a)(7)'s longer physical-presence requirement, applicable to a substantial majority of children born abroad to one U.\u00a0S.-citizen parent and one foreign-citizen parent, therefore, must hold sway.29  Going forward, Congress may address the issue and settle on a uniform prescription that neither favors nor disadvantages any person on the basis of gender.  In the interim, as the Government suggests, \u00a71401(a)(7)'s now-fiveyear requirement should apply, prospectively, to children born to unwed U.\u00a0S.-citizen mothers.

Ante, at 23.  I agree with that holding.  As the majority concludes, extending 8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71409(c)'s 1-year physical presence requirement to unwed citizen fathers (as respondent requests) is not, under this Court's precedent, an appropriate remedy for any equal protection violation.  See ante, at 23.  Indeed, I am skeptical that we even have the \"power to provide relief of the sort requested in this suit--namely, conferral of citizenship on a basis other than that prescribed by Congress.\"  Tuan Anh Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.\u00a0S. 53, 73 (2001) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring) (citing Miller v. Albright, 523 U.\u00a0S. 420, 452 (1998) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring in judgment)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's remedial holding resolves this case.  Because respondent cannot obtain relief in any event, it is unnecessary for us to decide whether the 1952 version of the INA was constitutional, whether respondent has third-party standing to raise an equal protection claim on behalf of his father, or whether other immigration laws (such as the current versions of \u00a7\u00a71401(g) and 1409) are constitutional.  I therefore concur only in the judgment reversing the Second Circuit.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0As this case involves federal, not state, legislation, the applicable equality guarantee is not the Fourteenth Amendment's explicit Equal Protection Clause, it is the guarantee implicit in the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.  See Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.\u00a0S. 636, 638, n.\u00a02 (1975) (\"[W]hile the Fifth Amendment contains no equal protection clause, it does forbid discrimination that is so unjustifiable as to be violative of due process.

Notwithstanding the fact that Child A's 'legal relationship' with his U.\u00a0S.-citizen mother may have been established 'at the moment of birth,' and Child B's 'legal relationship' with his U.\u00a0S.-citizen father may have been established a few hours later, Child B is more likely than Child A to learn English and assimilate U.\u00a0S. values.  Nevertheless, under the discriminatory scheme, only Child A obtains U.\u00a0S. citizenship at birth.\"  For another telling example, see Brief for Equality Now et\u00a0al. as Amici Curiae 19-20.\nFootnote 20\u00a0A Senate Report dated January 29, 1952, is the sole exception.  That Report relates that a particular problem of statelessness accounts for the 1952 Act's elimination of a 1940 Act provision the State Department had read to condition a citizen mother's ability to transmit nationality to her child on the father's failure to legitimate the child prior to the child's 18th birthday.  See 1940 Act, \u00a7205, 54 Stat. 1140 (\"In the absence of .\u00a0.\u00a0. legitimation or adjudication [during the child's minority], .\u00a0.\u00a0. the child\" born abroad to an unmarried citizen mother \"shall be held to have acquired at birth [the mother's] nationality status.\" (emphasis added)).  The 1952 Act eliminated this provision, allowing the mother to transmit citizenship independent of the father's actions.  S.\u00a0Rep. No. 1137, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 39 (1952) (\"This provision establish[es] the child's nationality as that of the [citizen] mother regardless of legitimation or establishment of paternity .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\" (emphasis added)).  This sole reference to a statelessness problem does not touch or concern the different physical-presence requirements carried over from the 1940 Act into the 1952 Act.\nFootnote 21\u00a0Justice Thomas, joined by Justice Alito, sees our equal protection ruling as \"unnecessary,\" post, at 1, given our remedial holding.  But, \"as we have repeatedly emphasized, discrimination itself\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. perpetuat[es] 'archaic and stereotypic notions'\u00a0\" incompatible with the equal treatment guaranteed by the Constitution.  Heckler v. Mathews, 465 U.\u00a0S. 728, 739 (1984) (quoting Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.\u00a0S. 718, 725 (1982)).\nFootnote 22\u00a0After silently following the path Justice Harlan charted in Welsh v. United States, 398 U.\u00a0S. 333 (1970), in several cases involving gender-based discrimination, see, e.g., Wiesenfeld, 420 U.\u00a0S., at 642, 653 (extending benefits); Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.\u00a0S. 677, 690-691, and n.\u00a025 (1973) (\u00a0plurality opinion) (same), the Court unanimously adopted his formulation in Califano v. Westcott, 443 U.\u00a0S. 76 (1979).  See id., at 89-90 (opinion for the Court); id., at 94-95 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  The appropriate remedy, the Westcott majority held, was extension to unemployed mothers of federal family-aid unemployment benefits provided by statute only for families of unemployed fathers.  Id., at 90-93.  In the dissent's view, nullification was the proper course.  Id., at 94-96.\nFootnote 23\u00a0Because the manner in which a State eliminates discrimination \"is an issue of state law,\" Stanton v. Stanton, 421 U.\u00a0S. 7, 18 (1975), upon finding state statutes constitutionally infirm, we have generally remanded to permit state courts to choose between extension and invalidation.  See Levin v. Commerce Energy, Inc., 560 U.\u00a0S. 413, 427 (2010).  In doing so, we have been explicit in leaving open on remand the option of removal of a benefit, as opposed to extension.  See, e.g., Orr v. Orr, 440 U.\u00a0S. 268, 283-284 (1979) (leaving to state courts remedy for unconstitutional imposition of alimony obligations on husbands but not wives); Stanton, 421 U.\u00a0S., at 17-18 (how to eliminate unconstitutional age differential, for child-support purposes, between male and female children, is \"an issue of state law to be resolved by the Utah courts\").\nFootnote 24\u00a0We note, however, that a defendant convicted under a law classifying on an impermissible basis may assail his conviction without regard to the manner in which the legislature might subsequently cure the infirmity.  In Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.\u00a0S. 104 (1972), for example, the defendant participated in a civil rights demonstration in front of a school.  Convicted of violating a local \"antipicketing\" ordinance that exempted \"peaceful picketing of any school involved in a labor dispute,\" he successfully challenged his conviction on equal protection grounds.  Id., at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It was irrelevant to the Court's decision whether the legislature likely would have cured the constitutional infirmity by excising the labor-dispute exemption.  In fact, the legislature had done just that subsequent to the defendant's conviction.  Ibid., and n.\u00a02.  \"Necessarily,\" the Court observed, \"we must consider the facial constitutionality of the ordinance in effect when [the defendant] was arrested and convicted.\"  Id., at 107, n.\u00a02.  See also Welsh, 398 U.\u00a0S., at 361-364 (Harlan, J., concurring in result) (reversal required even if, going forward, Congress would cure the unequal treatment by extending rather than invalidating the criminal proscription).\nFootnote 25\u00a0Distinctions based on parents' marital status, we have said, are subject to the same heightened scrutiny as distinctions based on gender.  Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.\u00a0S. 456, 461 (1988).\nFootnote 26\u00a0In crafting the INA in 1952, Congress considered, but did not adopt, an amendment that would have applied the shorter one-year continuous physical-presence requirement now contained in \u00a71409(c) to all foreign-born children of parents with different nationalities.  See S.\u00a02842, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., \u00a7301(a)(5) (1952).\nFootnote 27\u00a0Compare with the remedial issue presented here suits under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 challenging laws prescribing terms and conditions of employment applicable to women only, e.g., minimum wage, premium pay, rest breaks, or lunch breaks.  Most courts, perhaps mindful of the mixed motives implicated in passage of such legislation (some conceiving the laws as protecting women, others, as discouraging employers from hiring women), and, taking into account the economic burdens extension would impose on employers, have invalidated the provisions.  See, e.g., Homemakers, Inc., of Los Angeles v. Division of Industrial Welfare, 509 F.\u00a02d 20, 22-23 (CA9 1974), aff'g 356 F. Supp. 1111 (1973) (ND Cal. 1973); Burns v.

VARSITY BRANDS, INC., ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-866\nArgued: October 31, 2016Decided: March 22, 2017\n\n\nThe Copyright Act of 1976 makes \"pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features\" of the \"design of a useful article\" eligible for copyright protection as artistic works if those features \"can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents have more than 200 copyright registrations for two-dimensional designs--consisting of various lines, chevrons, and colorful shapes--appearing on the surface of the cheerleading uniforms that they design, make, and sell.  They sued petitioner, who also markets cheerleading uniforms, for copyright infringement.  The District Court granted petitioner summary judgment, holding that the designs could not be conceptually or physically separated from the uniforms and were therefore ineligible for copyright protection.  In reversing, the Sixth Circuit concluded that the graphics could be \"identified separately\" and were \"capable of existing independently\" of the uniforms under \u00a7101.  \nHeld:\u00a0A feature incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection only if the feature (1) can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article, and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work--either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression--if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated.  That test is satisfied here.  Pp.\u00a03-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Separability analysis is necessary in this case.  Respondents claim that two-dimensional surface decorations are always separable, even without resorting to a \u00a7101 analysis, because they are \"on a useful article\" rather than \"designs of a useful article.\"  But this argument is inconsistent with \u00a7101's text.  \"[P]ictorial\" and \"graphic\" denote two-dimensional features such as pictures, paintings, or drawings.  Thus, by providing protection for \"pictorial, graphical, and sculptural works\" incorporated into the \"design of a useful article,\" \u00a7101 necessarily contemplates that such a design can include two-dimensional features.  This Court will not adjudicate in the first instance the Government's distinct argument against applying separability analysis, which was neither raised below nor advanced here by any party.  Pp.\u00a04-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Whether a feature incorporated into a useful article \"can be identified separately from,\" and is \"capable of existing independently of,\" the article's \"utilitarian aspects\" is a matter of \"statutory interpretation.\"  Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.\u00a0S. 201, 214.  Pp.\u00a06-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0Section 101's separate-identification requirement is met if the decisionmaker is able to look at the useful article and spot some two- or three-dimensional element that appears to have pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities.  To satisfy the independent-existence requirement, the feature must be able to exist as its own pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work once it is imagined apart from the useful article.  If the feature could not exist as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work on its own, it is simply one of the article's utilitarian aspects.  And to qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work on its own, the feature cannot be a useful article or \"[a]n article that is normally a part of a useful article,\" \u00a7101.  Neither could one claim a copyright in a useful article by creating a replica of it in another medium.  Pp.\u00a07-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0The statute as a whole confirms this interpretation.  Section 101, which protects art first fixed in the medium of a useful article, is essentially the mirror image of \u00a7113(a), which protects art first fixed in a medium other than a useful article and subsequently applied to a useful article.  Together, these provisions make clear that copyright protection extends to pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works regardless of whether they were created as freestanding art or as features of useful articles.  P.\u00a08.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3)\u00a0This interpretation is also consistent with the Copyright Act's history.  In Mazer, a case decided under the 1909 Copyright Act, the Court held that respondents owned a copyright in a statuette created for use as a lamp base.  In so holding, the Court approved a Copyright Office regulation extending protection to works of art that might also serve a useful purpose and held that it was irrelevant to the copyright inquiry whether the statuette was initially created as a freestanding sculpture or as a lamp base.  Soon after, the Copyright Office enacted a regulation implementing Mazer's holding that anticipated the language of \u00a7101, thereby introducing the modern separability test to copyright law.  Congress essentially lifted the language from those post-Mazer regulations and placed it in \u00a7101 of the 1976 Act.  Pp.\u00a08-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Applying the proper test here, the surface decorations on the cheerleading uniforms are separable and therefore eligible for copyright protection.  First, the decorations can be identified as features having pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities.  Second, if those decorations were separated from the uniforms and applied in another medium, they would qualify as two-dimensional works of art under \u00a7101.  Imaginatively removing the decorations from the uniforms and applying them in another medium also would not replicate the uniform itself.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent argues that the decorations are ineligible for copyright protection because, when imaginatively extracted, they form a picture of a cheerleading uniform.  Petitioner similarly claims that the decorations cannot be copyrighted because, even when extracted from the useful article, they retain the outline of a cheerleading uniform.  But this is not a bar to copyright.  Just as two-dimensional fine art correlates to the shape of the canvas on which it is painted, two-dimensional applied art correlates to the contours of the article on which it is applied.  The only feature of respondents' cheerleading uniform eligible for a copyright is the two-dimensional applied art on the surface of the uniforms.  Respondents may prohibit the reproduction only of the surface designs on a uniform or in any other medium of expression.  Respondents have no right to prevent anyone from manufacturing a cheerleading uniform that is identical in shape, cut, or dimensions to the uniforms at issue here.  Pp.\u00a010-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0None of the objections raised by petitioner or the Government is meritorious.  Pp.\u00a012-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0Petitioner and the Government focus on the relative utility of the plain white uniform that would remain if the designs were physically removed from the uniform.  But the separability inquiry focuses on the extracted feature and not on any aspects of the useful article remaining after the imaginary extraction.  The statute does not require the imagined remainder to be a fully functioning useful article at all.  Nor can an artistic feature that would be eligible for copyright protection on its own lose that protection simply because it was first created as a feature of the design of a useful article, even if it makes that article more useful.  This has been the rule since Mazer, and it is consistent with the statute's explicit protection of \"applied art.\"  In rejecting petitioner's view, the Court necessarily abandons the distinction between \"physical\" and \"conceptual\" separability adopted by some courts and commentators.  Pp.\u00a012-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0Petitioner also suggests incorporating two \"objective\" components into the test--one requiring consideration of evidence of the creator's design methods, purposes, and reasons, and one looking to the feature's marketability.  The Court declines to incorporate these components because neither is grounded in the statute's text.

L. C., PETITIONER v. VARSITY BRANDS, INC., et\u00a0al.\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit\n[March 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress has provided copyright protection for original works of art, but not for industrial designs.  The line between art and industrial design, however, is often difficult to draw.  This is particularly true when an industrial design incorporates artistic elements.  Congress has afforded limited protection for these artistic elements by providing that \"pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features\" of the \"design of a useful article\" are eligible for copyright protection as artistic works if those features \"can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari to resolve widespread disagreement over the proper test for implementing \u00a7101's separateidentification and independent-existence requirements.  578 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  We hold that a feature incorporated into the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection only if the feature (1) can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work--either on its own or fixed in some other tangible medium of expression--if it were imagined separately from the useful article into which it is incorporated.  Because that test is satisfied in this case, we affirm.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents Varsity Brands, Inc., Varsity Spirit Corporation, and Varsity Spirit Fashions & Supplies, Inc., design, make, and sell cheerleading uniforms.  Respondents have obtained or acquired more than 200 U.\u00a0S. copyright registrations for two-dimensional designs appearing on the surface of their uniforms and other garments.  These designs are primarily \"combinations, positionings, and arrangements of elements\" that include \"chevrons .\u00a0.\u00a0. , lines, curves, stripes, angles, diagonals, inverted [chevrons], coloring, and shapes.\"  App. 237.  At issue in this case are Designs 299A, 299B, 074, 078, and 0815.  See Appendix, infra.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Star Athletica, L. L. C., also markets and sells cheerleading uniforms.  Respondents sued petitioner for infringing their copyrights in the five designs.  The District Court entered summary judgment for petitioner on respondents' copyright claims on the ground that the designs did not qualify as protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works.  It reasoned that the designs served the useful, or \"utilitarian,\" function of identifying the garments as \"cheerleading uniforms\" and therefore could not be \"physically or conceptually\" separated under \u00a7101 \"from the utilitarian function\" of the uniform.  2014 WL 819422, *8-*9 (WD Tenn., Mar. 1, 2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed.  799 F.\u00a03d 468, 471 (2015).  In its view, the \"graphic designs\" were \"separately identifiable\" because the designs \"and a blank cheerleading uniform can appear 'side by side'--one as a graphic design, and one as a cheerleading uniform.\"  Id., at 491 (quoting Compendium of U.\u00a0S. Copyright Office Practices \u00a7924.2(B) (3d ed. 2014) (Compendium)).  And it determined that the designs were \"\u00a0'capable of existing independently'\u00a0\" because they could be incorporated onto the surface of different types of garments, or hung on the wall and framed as art.  799 F.\u00a03d, at 491, 492.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge McKeague dissented.  He would have held that, because \"identifying the wearer as a cheerleader\" is a utilitarian function of a cheerleading uniform and the surface designs were \"integral to\" achieving that function, the designs were inseparable from the uniforms.  Id., at 495-496.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first element of a copyright-infringement claim is \"ownership of a valid copyright.\"  Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.\u00a0S. 340, 361 (1991).  A valid copyright extends only to copyrightable subject matter.  See 4 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Copyright \u00a713.01[A] (2010) (Nimmer).  The Copyright Act of 1976 defines copyrightable subject matter as \"original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7102(a).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Works of authorship\" include \"pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works,\" \u00a7102(a)(5), which the statute defines to include \"two-dimensional and three-dimensional works of fine, graphic, and applied art, photographs, prints and art reproductions, maps, globes, charts, diagrams, models, and technical drawings, including architectural plans,\" \u00a7101.  And a work of authorship is \"\u00a0'fixed' in a tangible medium of expression when it[ is] embodi[ed] in a\" \"material objec[t] .\u00a0.\u00a0. from which the work can be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated.\"  Ibid. (definitions of \"fixed\" and \"copies\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Copyright Act also establishes a special rule for copyrighting a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work incorporated into a \"useful article,\" which is defined as \"an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.\"  Ibid.  The statute does not protect useful articles as such.  Rather, \"the design of a useful article\" is \"considered a pictorial, graphical, or sculptural work only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Courts, the Copyright Office, and commentators have described the analysis undertaken to determine whether a feature can be separately identified from, and exist independently of, a useful article as \"separability.\"  In this case, our task is to determine whether the arrangements of lines, chevrons, and colorful shapes appearing on the surface of respondents' cheerleading uniforms are eligible for copyright protection as separable features of the design of those cheerleading uniforms.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an initial matter, we must address whether separability analysis is necessary in this case.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents argue that \"[s]eparability is only implicated when a [pictorial, graphic, or sculptural] work is the 'design of a useful article.'\u00a0\"  Brief for Respondents 25.  They contend that the surface decorations in this case are \"two-dimensional graphic designs that appear on useful articles,\" but are not themselves designs of useful articles.  Id., at 52.  Consequently, the surface decorations are protected two-dimensional works of graphic art without regard to any separability analysis under \u00a7101.  Ibid.; see 2 W. Patry, Copyright \u00a73:151, p. 3-485 (2016) (Patry) (\"Courts looking at two-dimensional design claims should not apply the separability analysis regardless of the three-dimensional form that design is embodied in\").  Under this theory, two-dimensional artistic features on the surface of useful articles are \"inherently separable.\"  Brief for Respondents 26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument is inconsistent with the text of \u00a7101.  The statute requires separability analysis for any \"pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features\" incorporated into the \"design of a useful article.\"  \"Design\" refers here to \"the combination\" of \"details\" or \"features\" that \"go to make up\" the useful article.  3 Oxford English Dictionary 244 (def. 7, first listing) (1933) (OED).  Furthermore, the words \"pictorial\" and \"graphic\" include, in this context, two-dimensional features such as pictures, paintings, or drawings.  See 4 id., at 359 (defining \"[g]raphic\" to mean \"[o]f or pertaining to drawing or painting\"); 7 id., at 830 (defining \"[p]ictorial\" to mean \"of or pertaining to painting or drawing\").  And the statute expressly defines \"[p]ictorial, graphical, and sculptural works\" to include \"two-dimensional .\u00a0.\u00a0. works of .\u00a0.\u00a0. art.\"  \u00a7101.  The statute thus provides that the \"design of a useful article\" can include two-dimensional \"pictorial\" and \"graphic\" features, and separability analysis applies to those features just as it does to three-dimensional \"sculptural\" features.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The United States makes a related but distinct argument against applying separability analysis in this case, which respondents do not and have not advanced.  As part of their copyright registrations for the designs in this case, respondents deposited with the Copyright Office drawings and photographs depicting the designs incorporated onto cheerleading uniforms.  App. 213-219; Appendix, infra.  The Government argues that, assuming the other statutory requirements were met, respondents obtained a copyright in the deposited drawings and photographs and have simply reproduced those copyrighted works on the surface of a useful article, as they would have the exclusive right to do under the Copyright Act.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14-15, 17-22.  Accordingly, the Government urges, separability analysis is unnecessary on the record in this case.  We generally do not entertain arguments that were not raised below and that are not advanced in this Court by any party, Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014), because \"[i]t is not the Court's usual practice to adjudicate either legal or predicate factual questions in the first instance,\" CRST Van Expedited, Inc. v. EEOC, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 16).  We decline to depart from our usual practice here.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We must now decide when a feature incorporated into a useful article \"can be identified separately from\" and is \"capable of existing independently of\" \"the utilitarian aspects\" of the article.  This is not a free-ranging search for the best copyright policy, but rather \"depends solely on statutory interpretation.\"  Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.\u00a0S. 201, 214 (1954).  \"The controlling principle in this case is the basic and unexceptional rule that courts must give effect to the clear meaning of statutes as written.\"  Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., 505 U.\u00a0S. 469, 476 (1992).  We thus begin and end our inquiry with the text, giving each word its \"ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\"  Walters v. Metropolitan Ed. Enterprises, Inc., 519 U.\u00a0S. 202, 207 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We do not, however, limit this inquiry to the text of \u00a7101 in isolation.  \"[I]nterpretation of a phrase of uncertain reach is not confined to a single sentence when the text of the whole statute gives instruction as to its meaning.\"  Maracich v. Spears, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 15).  We thus \"look to the provisions of the whole law\" to determine \u00a7101's meaning.  United States v. Heirs of Boisdor\u00e9, 8 How. 113, 122 (1849).\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute provides that a \"pictorial, graphic, or sculptural featur[e]\" incorporated into the \"design of a useful article\" is eligible for copyright protection if it (1) \"can be identified separately from,\" and (2) is \"capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\"  \u00a7101.  The first requirement--separate identification--is not onerous.  The decisionmaker need only be able to look at the useful article and spot some two- or three-dimensional element that appears to have pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities.  See 2 Patry \u00a73:146, at 3-474 to 3-475.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The independent-existence requirement is ordinarily more difficult to satisfy.  The decisionmaker must determine that the separately identified feature has the capacity to exist apart from the utilitarian aspects of the article.  See 2 OED 88 (def. 5) (defining \"[c]apable\" of as \"[h]aving the needful capacity, power, or fitness for\").  In other words, the feature must be able to exist as its own pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work as defined in \u00a7101 once it is imagined apart from the useful article.  If the feature is not capable of existing as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work once separated from the useful article, then it was not a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural feature of that article, but rather one of its utilitarian aspects.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, to qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work on its own, the feature cannot itself be a useful article or \"[a]n article that is normally a part of a useful article\" (which is itself considered a useful article).  \u00a7101.  Nor could someone claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium--for example, a cardboard model of a car.  Although the replica could itself be copyrightable, it would not give rise to any rights in the useful article that inspired it.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statute as a whole confirms our interpretation.  The Copyright Act provides \"the owner of [a] copyright\" with the \"exclusive righ[t] .\u00a0.\u00a0. to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies.\"  \u00a7106(1).  The statute clarifies that this right \"includes the right to reproduce the [copyrighted] work in or on any kind of article, whether useful or otherwise.\"  \u00a7113(a).  Section 101 is, in essence, the mirror image of \u00a7113(a).  Whereas \u00a7113(a) protects a work of authorship first fixed in some tangible medium other than a useful article and subsequently applied to a useful article, \u00a7101 protects art first fixed in the medium of a useful article.  The two provisions make clear that copyright protection extends to pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works regardless of whether they were created as freestanding art or as features of useful articles.  The ultimate separability question, then, is whether the feature for which copyright protection is claimed would have been eligible for copyright protection as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work had it originally been fixed in some tangible medium other than a useful article before being applied to a useful article.\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This interpretation is also consistent with the history of the Copyright Act.  In Mazer, a case decided under the 1909 Copyright Act, the respondents copyrighted a statuette depicting a dancer.  The statuette was intended for use as a lamp base, \"with electric wiring, sockets and lamp shades attached.\"  347 U.\u00a0S., at 202.  Copies of the statuette were sold both as lamp bases and separately as statuettes.  Id., at 203.  The petitioners copied the statuette and sold lamps with the statuette as the base.  They defended against the respondents' infringement suit by arguing that the respondents did not have a copyright in a statuette intended for use as a lamp base.  Id., at 204-205.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two of Mazer's holdings are relevant here.  First, the Court held that the respondents owned a copyright in the statuette even though it was intended for use as a lamp base.  See id., at 214.  In doing so, the Court approved the Copyright Office's regulation extending copyright protection to works of art that might also serve a useful purpose.  See ibid. (approving 37 CFR \u00a7202.8(a) (1949) (protecting \"works of artistic craftsmanship, in so far as their form but not their mechanical or utilitarian aspects are concerned\")).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court held that it was irrelevant to the copyright inquiry whether the statuette was initially created as a freestanding sculpture or as a lamp base.  347 U.\u00a0S., at 218-219 (\"Nor do we think the subsequent registration of a work of art published as an element in a manufactured article, is a misuse of copyright.  This is not different from the registration of a statuette and its later embodiment in an industrial article\").  Mazer thus interpreted the 1909 Act consistently with the rule discussed above: If a design would have been copyrightable as a standalone pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, it is copyrightable if created first as part of a useful article.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Shortly thereafter, the Copyright Office enacted a regulation implementing the holdings of Mazer.  See 1 Nimmer \u00a72A.08[B][1][b] (2016).  As amended, the regulation introduced the modern separability test to copyright law:\n\"If the sole intrinsic function of an article is its utility, the fact that the article is unique and attractively shaped will not qualify it as a work of art.  However, if the shape of a utilitarian article incorporates features, such as artistic sculpture, carving, or pictorial representation, which can be identified separately and are capable of existing independently as a work of art, such features will be eligible for registration.\"  37 CFR \u00a7202.10(c) (1960) (punctuation altered).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress essentially lifted the language governing protection for the design of a useful article directly from the post-Mazer regulations and placed it into \u00a7101 of the 1976 Act.  Consistent with Mazer, the approach we outline today interprets \u00a7\u00a7101 and 113 in a way that would afford copyright protection to the statuette in Mazer regardless of whether it was first created as a standalone sculptural work or as the base of the lamp.  See 347 U.\u00a0S., at  218-219.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, a feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright if, when identified and imagined apart from the useful article, it would qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work either on its own or when fixed in some other tangible medium.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying this test to the surface decorations on the cheerleading uniforms is straightforward.  First, one can identify the decorations as features having pictorial, graphic, or sculptural qualities.  Second, if the arrangement of colors, shapes, stripes, and chevrons on the surface of the cheerleading uniforms were separated from the uniform and applied in another medium--for example, on a painter's canvas--they would qualify as \"two-dimensional .\u00a0.\u00a0. works of .\u00a0.\u00a0. art,\" \u00a7101.  And imaginatively removing the surface decorations from the uniforms and applying them in another medium would not replicate the uniform itself.  Indeed, respondents have applied the designs in this case to other media of expression--different types of clothing--without replicating the uniform.  See App. 273-279.  The decorations are therefore separable from the uniforms and eligible for copyright protection.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The dissent argues that the designs are not separable because imaginatively removing them from the uniforms and placing them in some other medium of expression--a canvas, for example--would create \"pictures of cheerleader uniforms.\"  Post, at 10 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  Petitioner similarly argues that the decorations cannot be copyrighted because, even when extracted from the useful article, they retain the outline of a cheerleading uniform.  Brief for Petitioner 48-49.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is not a bar to copyright.  Just as two-dimensional fine art corresponds to the shape of the canvas on which it is painted, two-dimensional applied art correlates to the contours of the article on which it is applied.  A fresco painted on a wall, ceiling panel, or dome would not lose copyright protection, for example, simply because it was designed to track the dimensions of the surface on which it was painted.  Or consider, for example, a design etched or painted on the surface of a guitar.  If that entire design is imaginatively removed from the guitar's surface and placed on an album cover, it would still resemble the shape of a guitar.  But the image on the cover does not \"replicate\" the guitar as a useful article.  Rather, the design is a two-dimensional work of art that corresponds to the shape of the useful article to which it was applied.  The statute protects that work of art whether it is first drawn on the album cover and then applied to the guitar's surface, or vice versa.  Failing to protect that art would create an anomaly: It would extend protection to two-dimensional designs that cover a part of a useful article but would not protect the same design if it covered the entire article.  The statute does not support that distinction, nor can it be reconciled with the dissent's recognition that \"artwork printed on a t-shirt\" could be protected.  Post, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be clear, the only feature of the cheerleading uniform eligible for a copyright in this case is the two-dimensional work of art fixed in the tangible medium of the uniform fabric.  Even if respondents ultimately succeed in establishing a valid copyright in the surface decorations at issue here, respondents have no right to prohibit any person from manufacturing a cheerleading uniform of identical shape, cut, and dimensions to the ones on which the decorations in this case appear.  They may prohibit only the reproduction of the surface designs in any tangible medium of expression--a uniform or otherwise.2\nD\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner and the Government raise several objections to the approach we announce today.  None is meritorious.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner first argues that our reading of the statute is missing an important step.  It contends that a feature may exist independently only if it can stand alone as a copyrightable work and if the useful article from which it was extracted would remain equally useful.  In other words, copyright extends only to \"solely artistic\" features of useful articles.  Brief for Petitioner 33.  According to petitioner, if a feature of a useful article \"advance[s] the utility of the article,\" id., at 38, then it is categorically beyond the scope of copyright, id., at 33.  The designs here are not protected, it argues, because they are necessary to two of the uniforms' \"inherent, essential, or natural functions\"--identifying the wearer as a cheerleader and enhancing the wearer's physical appearance.  Id., at 38, 48; Reply Brief 2, 16.  Because the uniforms would not be equally useful without the designs, petitioner contends that the designs are inseparable from the \"utilitarian aspects\" of the uniform.  Brief for Petitioner 50.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government raises a similar argument, although it reaches a different result.  It suggests that the appropriate test is whether the useful article with the artistic feature removed would \"remai[n] similarly useful.\"  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 29 (emphasis added).  In the view of the United States, however, a plain white cheerleading uniform is \"similarly useful\" to uniforms with respondents' designs.  Id., at 27-28.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The debate over the relative utility of a plain white cheerleading uniform is unnecessary.  The focus of the separability inquiry is on the extracted feature and not on any aspects of the useful article that remain after the imaginary extraction.  The statute does not require the decisionmaker to imagine a fully functioning useful article without the artistic feature.  Instead, it requires that the separated feature qualify as a nonuseful pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work on its own.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Of course, because the removed feature may not be a useful article--as it would then not qualify as a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work--there necessarily would be some aspects of the original useful article \"left behind\" if the feature were conceptually removed.  But the statute does not require the imagined remainder to be a fully functioning useful article at all, much less an equally useful one.  Indeed, such a requirement would deprive the Mazer statuette of protection had it been created first as a lamp base rather than as a statuette.  Without the base, the \"lamp\" would be just a shade, bulb, and wires.  The statute does not require that we imagine a nonartistic replacement for the removed feature to determine whether that feature is capable of an independent existence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner's argument follows from its flawed view that the statute protects only \"solely artistic\" features that have no effect whatsoever on a useful article's utilitarian function.  This view is inconsistent with the statutory text.  The statute expressly protects two- and three-dimensional \"applied art.\"  \u00a7101.  \"Applied art\" is art \"employed in the decoration, design, or execution of useful objects,\" Webster's Third New International Dictionary 105 (1976) (emphasis added), or \"those arts or crafts that have a primarily utilitarian function, or .\u00a0.\u00a0. the designs and decorations used in these arts,\" Random House Dictionary 73 (1966) (emphasis added); see also 1 OED 576 (2d ed. 1989) (defining \"applied\" as \"[p]ut to practical use\").  An artistic feature that would be eligible for copyright protection on its own cannot lose that protection simply because it was first created as a feature of the design of a useful article, even if it makes that article more useful.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, this has been the rule since Mazer.  In holding that the statuette was protected, the Court emphasized that the 1909 Act abandoned any \"distinctions between purely aesthetic articles and useful works of art.\"  347 U.\u00a0S., at 211.  Congress did not enact such a distinction in the 1976 Act.  Were we to accept petitioner's argument that the only protectable features are those that play absolutely no role in an article's function, we would effectively abrogate the rule of Mazer and read \"applied art\" out of the statute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because we reject the view that a useful article must remain after the artistic feature has been imaginatively separated from the article, we necessarily abandon the distinction between \"physical\" and \"conceptual\" separability, which some courts and commentators have adopted based on the Copyright Act's legislative history.  See H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, p. 55 (1976).  According to this view, a feature is physically separable from the underlying useful article if it can \"be physically separated from the article by ordinary means while leaving the utilitarian aspects of the article completely intact.\"  Compendium \u00a7924.2(A); see also Chosun Int'l, Inc. v. Chrisha Creations, Ltd., 413 F. 3d 324, 329 (CA2 2005).  Conceptual separability applies if the feature physically could not be removed from the useful article by ordinary means.  See Compendium \u00a7924.2(B); but see 1 P. Goldstein, Copyright \u00a72.5.3, p. 2:77 (3d ed. 2016) (explaining that the lower courts have been unable to agree on a single conceptual separability test); 2 Patry \u00a7\u00a73:140-3:144.40 (surveying the various approaches in the lower courts).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The statutory text indicates that separability is a conceptual undertaking.  Because separability does not require the underlying useful article to remain, the physical-conceptual distinction is unnecessary.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner next argues that we should incorporate two \"objective\" components, Reply Brief 9, into our test to provide guidance to the lower courts: (1) \"whether the design elements can be identified as reflecting the designer's artistic judgment exercised independently of functional influence,\" Brief for Petitioner 34 (emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted), and (2) whether \"there is [a] substantial likelihood that the pictorial, graphic, or sculptural feature would still be marketable to some significant segment of the community without its utilitarian function,\" id., at 35 (emphasis deleted and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reject this argument because neither consideration is grounded in the text of the statute.  The first would require the decisionmaker to consider evidence of the creator's design methods, purposes, and reasons.  Id., at 48.  The statute's text makes clear, however, that our inquiry is limited to how the article and feature are perceived, not how or why they were designed.  See Brandir Int'l, Inc. v. Cascade Pacific Lumber Co., 834 F.\u00a02d 1142, 1152 (CA2 1987) (Winter, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (The statute \"expressly states that the legal test is how the final article is perceived, not how it was developed through various stages\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same is true of marketability.  Nothing in the statute suggests that copyrightability depends on market surveys.  Moreover, asking whether some segment of the market would be interested in a given work threatens to prize popular art over other forms, or to substitute judicial aesthetic preferences for the policy choices embodied in the Copyright Act.  See Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Co., 188 U.\u00a0S. 239, 251 (1903) (\"It would be a dangerous undertaking for persons trained only to the law to constitute themselves final judges of the worth of pictorial illustrations, outside of the narrowest and most obvious limits\").\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, petitioner argues that allowing the surface decorations to qualify as a \"work of authorship\" is inconsistent with Congress' intent to entirely exclude industrial design from copyright.  Petitioner notes that Congress refused to pass a provision that would have provided limited copyright protection for industrial designs, including clothing, when it enacted the 1976 Act, see id., at 9-11 (citing S. 22, Tit. II, 94th Cong., 2d Sess., 122 Cong. Rec. 3856-3859 (1976)), and that it has enacted laws protecting designs for specific useful articles--semiconductor chips and boat hulls, see 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7901-914, 1301-1332--while declining to enact other industrial design statutes, Brief for Petitioner 29, 43.  From this history of failed legislation petitioner reasons that Congress intends to channel intellectual property claims for industrial design into design patents.  It therefore urges us to approach this question with a presumption against copyrightability.  Id., at 27.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We do not share petitioner's concern.  As an initial matter, \"[c]ongressional inaction lacks persuasive significance\" in most circumstances.  Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation v. LTV Corp., 496 U. S. 633, 650 (1990) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Moreover, we have long held that design patent and copyright are not mutually exclusive.  See Mazer, 347 U.\u00a0S., at 217. Congress has provided for limited copyright protection for certain features of industrial design, and approaching the statute with presumptive hostility toward protection for industrial design would undermine Congress' choice.  In any event, as explained above, our test does not render the shape, cut, and physical dimensions of the cheerleading uniforms eligible for copyright protection.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We hold that an artistic feature of the design of a useful article is eligible for copyright protection if the feature (1) can be perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article and (2) would qualify as a protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work either on its own or in some other medium if imagined separately from the useful article.  Because the designs on the surface of respondents' cheerleading uniforms in this case satisfy these requirements, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-866\nSTAR ATHLETICA, L.

Unlike the majority, I would not take up in this case the separability test appropriate under 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101.1  Consideration of that test is unwarranted because the designs at issue are not designs of useful articles.  Instead, the designs are themselves copyrightable pictorial or graphic works reproduced on useful articles.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work (PGS work) is copyrightable.  \u00a7102(a)(5).  PGS works include \"two-dimensional and three-dimensional works of fine, graphic, and applied art.\"  \u00a7101.  Key to this case, a copyright in a standalone PGS work \"includes the right to reproduce the work in or on any kind of article, whether useful or otherwise.\"  \u00a7113(a).  Because the owner of a copyright in a pre-existing PGS work may exclude a would-be infringer from reproducing that work on a useful article, there is no need to engage in any separability inquiry to resolve the instant petition.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The designs here in controversy are standalone pictorial and graphic works that respondents Varsity Brands, Inc., et\u00a0al. (Varsity) reproduce on cheerleading uniforms.  Varsity's designs first appeared as pictorial and graphic works that Varsity's design team sketched on paper.  App. 281.  Varsity then sought copyright protection for those two-dimensional designs, not for cheerleading costumes; its registration statements claimed \"2-Dimensional artwork\" and \"fabric design (artwork).\"  Appendix, infra, at 4-7, 9-10, 12-14.  Varsity next reproduced its two-dimensional graphic designs on cheerleading uniforms, also on other garments, including T-shirts and jackets.  See, e.g., App. 274, 276.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, Varsity's designs are not themselves useful articles meet for separability determination under \u00a7101; they are standalone PGS works that may gain copyright protection as such, including the exclusive right to reproduce the designs on useful articles.4\nAPPENDIX\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002580 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-866\nSTAR ATHLETICA, L. L. C., PETITIONER v.

But I do not agree that the designs that Varsity Brands, Inc., submitted to the Copyright Office are eligible for copyright protection.  Even applying the majority's test, the designs cannot \"be perceived as .\u00a0.\u00a0. two- or three-dimensional work[s] of art separate from the useful article.\"  Ante, at 1.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Look at the designs that Varsity submitted to the Copyright Office.  See Appendix to opinion of the Court, ante.  You will see only pictures of cheerleader uniforms.  And cheerleader uniforms are useful articles.  A picture of the relevant design features, whether separately \"perceived\" on paper or in the imagination, is a picture of, and thereby \"replicate[s],\" the underlying useful article of which they are a part.  Ante, at 1, 10.  Hence the design features that Varsity seeks to protect are not \"capable of existing independently o[f] the utilitarian aspects of the article.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The relevant statutory provision says that the \"design of a useful article\" is copyrightable \"only if, and only to the extent that, such design incorporates pictorial, graphic, or sculptural features that can be identified separately from, and are capable of existing independently of, the utilitarian aspects of the article.\"  Ibid.  But what, we must ask, do the words \"identified separately\" mean?  Just when is a design separate from the \"utilitarian aspect of the [useful] article?\"  The most direct, helpful aspect of the Court's opinion answers this question by stating:\n\"Nor could someone claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium--for example, a cardboard model of a car.  Although the replica could itself be copyrightable, it would not give rise to any rights in the useful article that inspired it.\"  Ante, at 7-8.\nExactly so.  These words help explain the Court's statement that a copyrightable work of art must be \"perceived as a two- or three-dimensional work of art separate from the useful article.\"  Ante, at 1, 17.  They help clarify the concept of separateness.  Cf. 1 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright \u00a72A.08[A][1] (2016) (Nimmer) (describing courts' difficulty in applying that concept).  They are consistent with Congress' own expressed intent.  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101; H. R. Rep. No. 94-1476, pp.\u00a055, 105 (1976) (H. R. Rep.).  And they reflect long held views of the  Copyright Office.  See Compendium of U. S. Copyright Office Practices \u00a7924.2(B) (3d ed. 2014), online at http:\/\/www.copyright.gov\/comp3\/docs\/compendium.pdf (as last visited Mar. 7, 2017) (Compendium).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider, for example, the explanation that the House Report for the Copyright Act of 1976 provides.  It says:\n\"Unless the shape of an automobile, airplane, ladies' dress, food processor, television set, or any other industrial product contains some element that, physically or conceptually, can be identified as separable from the utilitarian aspects of that article, the design would not be copyrighted .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.\"  H. R. Rep., at 55 (emphasis added).\nThese words suggest two exercises, one physical, one mental.  Can the design features (the picture, the graphic, the sculpture) be physically removed from the article (and considered separately), all the while leaving the fully functioning utilitarian object in place?  If not, can one nonetheless conceive of the design features separately without replicating a picture of the utilitarian object?  If the answer to either of these questions is \"yes,\" then the design is eligible for copyright protection.  Otherwise, it is not.  The abstract nature of these questions makes them sound difficult to apply.  But with the Court's words in mind, the difficulty tends to disappear.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0An example will help.  Imagine a lamp with a circular marble base, a vertical 10-inch tall brass rod (containing wires) inserted off center on the base, a light bulb fixture emerging from the top of the brass rod, and a lampshade sitting on top.  In front of the brass rod a porcelain Siamese cat sits on the base facing outward.  Obviously, the Siamese cat is physically separate from the lamp, as it could be easily removed while leaving both cat and lamp intact.  And, assuming it otherwise qualifies, the designed cat is eligible for copyright protection.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Now suppose there is no long brass rod; instead the cat sits in the middle of the base and the wires run up through the cat to the bulbs.  The cat is not physically separate from the lamp, as the reality of the lamp's construction is such that an effort to physically separate the cat and lamp will destroy both cat and lamp.  The two are integrated into a single functional object, like the similar configuration of the ballet dancer statuettes that formed the lamp bases at issue in Mazer v. Stein, 347 U.\u00a0S. 201 (1954).  But we can easily imagine the cat on its own, as did Congress when conceptualizing the ballet dancer.  See H. R. Rep., at 55 (the statuette in Mazer was \"incorporated into a product without losing its ability to exist independently as a work of art\").  In doing so, we do not create a mental picture of a lamp (or, in the Court's words, a \"replica\" of the lamp), which is a useful article.  We simply perceive the cat separately, as a small cat figurine that could be a copyrightable design work standing alone that does not replicate the lamp.  Hence the cat is conceptually separate from the utilitarian article that is the lamp.  The pair of lamps pictured at Figures 1 and 2 in the Appendix to this opinion illustrate this principle.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Case law, particularly case law that Congress and the Copyright Office have considered, reflects the same approach.  Congress cited examples of copyrightable design works, including \"a carving on the back of a chair\" and \"a floral relief design on silver flatware.\"  H. R. Rep., at 55.  Copyright Office guidance on copyrightable designs in useful articles include \"an engraving on a vase,\" \"[a]rtwork printed on a t-shirt,\" \"[a] colorful pattern decorating the surface of a shopping bag,\" \"[a] drawing on the surface of wallpaper,\" and \"[a] floral relief decorating the handle of a spoon.\"  Compendium \u00a7924.2(B).  Courts have found copyrightable matter in a plaster ballet dancer statuette encasing the lamp's electric cords and forming its base, see Mazer, supra, as well as carvings engraved onto furniture, see Universal Furniture Int'l, Inc. v. Collezione Europa USA, Inc., 618 F. 3d 417, 431-435 (CA4 2010) (\u00a0per curiam), and designs on laminated floor tiles, see Home Leg- end, LLC v. Mannington Mills, Inc., 784 F. 3d 1404, 1412-1413 (CA11 2015).  See generally Brief for Intellectual Property Professors as Amici Curiae.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0By way of contrast, Van Gogh's painting of a pair of old shoes, though beautifully executed and copyrightable as a painting, would not qualify for a shoe design copyright.  See Appendix, fig. 3, infra; 17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7113(a)-(b).  Courts have similarly denied copyright protection to objects that begin as three-dimensional designs, such as measuring spoons shaped like heart-tipped arrows, Bonazoli v. R. S. V. P. Int'l, Inc., 353 F. Supp. 2d 218, 226-227 (RI 2005); candleholders shaped like sailboats, Design Ideas, Ltd. v. Yankee Candle Co., 889 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1128 (CD Ill. 2012); and wire spokes on a wheel cover, Norris Industries, Inc. v. International Tel. & Tel. Corp., 696 F. 2d 918, 922-924 (CA11 1983).  None of these designs could qualify for copyright protection that would prevent others from selling spoons, candleholders, or wheel covers with the same design.  Why not?  Because in each case the design is not separable from the utilitarian aspects of the object to which it relates.  The designs cannot be physically separated because they themselves make up the shape of the spoon, candleholders, or wheel covers of which they are a part.  And spoons, candleholders, and wheel covers are useful objects, as are the old shoes depicted in Van Gogh's painting.  More importantly, one cannot easily imagine or otherwise conceptualize the design of the spoons or the candleholders or the shoes without that picture, or image, or replica being a picture of spoons, or candleholders, or wheel covers, or shoes.  The designs necessarily bring along the underlying utilitarian object.  Hence each design is not conceptually separable from the physical useful object.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The upshot is that one could copyright the floral design on a soupspoon but one could not copyright the shape of the spoon itself, no matter how beautiful, artistic, or esthetically pleasing that shape might be: A picture of the shape of the spoon is also a picture of a spoon; the picture of a floral design is not.  See Compendium \u00a7924.2(B).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To repeat: A separable design feature must be \"capable of existing independently\" of the useful article as a separate artistic work that is not itself the useful article.  If the claimed feature could be extracted without replicating the useful article of which it is a part, and the result would be a copyrightable artistic work standing alone, then there is a separable design.  But if extracting the claimed features would necessarily bring along the underlying useful article, the design is not separable from the useful article.  In many or most cases, to decide whether a design or artistic feature of a useful article is conceptually separate from the article itself, it is enough to imagine the feature on its own and ask, \"Have I created a picture of a (useful part of a) useful article?\"  If so, the design is not separable from the useful article.  If not, it is.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In referring to imagined pictures and the like, I am not speaking technically.  I am simply trying to explain an intuitive idea of what separation is about, as well as how I understand the majority's opinion.  So understood, the opinion puts design copyrights in their rightful place.  The law has long recognized that drawings or photographs of real world objects are copyrightable as drawings or photographs, but the copyright does not give protection against others making the underlying useful objects.  See, e.g., Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co. v. Sarony, 111 U.\u00a0S. 53 (1884).  That is why a copyright on Van Gogh's painting would prevent others from reproducing that painting, but it would not prevent others from reproducing and selling the comfortable old shoes that the painting depicts.  Indeed, the purpose of \u00a7113(b) was to ensure that \"\u00a0'copyright in a pictorial, graphic, or sculptural work, portraying a useful article as such, does not extend to the manufacture of the useful article itself.'\u00a0\"  H. R. Rep., at 105.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To ask this kind of simple question--does the design picture the useful article?--will not provide an answer in every case, for there will be cases where it is difficult to say whether a picture of the design is, or is not, also a picture of the useful article.  But the question will avoid courts focusing primarily upon what I believe is an unhelpful feature of the inquiry, namely, whether the design can be imagined as a \"two- or three-dimensional work of art.\"  Ante, at 1, 17.  That is because virtually any industrial design can be thought of separately as a \"work of art\": Just imagine a frame surrounding the design, or its being placed in a gallery.  Consider Marcel Duchamp's \"readymades\" series, the functional mass-produced objects he designated as art.  See Appendix, fig. 4, infra.  What is there in the world that, viewed through an esthetic lens, cannot be seen as a good, bad, or indifferent work of art?  What design features could not be imaginatively reproduced on a painter's canvas?  Indeed, great industrial design may well include design that is inseparable from the useful article--where, as Frank Lloyd Wright put it, \"form and function are one.\"  F. Wright, An Autobiography 146 (1943) (reprint 2005).  Where they are one, the designer may be able to obtain 15 years of protection through a design patent.  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7171, 173; see also McKenna & Strandburg, Progress and Competition in Design, 17 Stan. Tech. L. Rev. 1, 48-51 (2013).  But, if they are one, Congress did not intend a century or more of copyright protection.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The conceptual approach that I have described reflects Congress' answer to a problem that is primarily practical and economic.  Years ago Lord Macaulay drew attention to the problem when he described copyright in books as a \"tax on readers for the purpose of giving a bounty to writers.\"  56 Parl. Deb. (3d Ser.) (1841) 341, 350.  He called attention to the main benefit of copyright protection, which is to provide an incentive to produce copyrightable works and thereby \"promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts.\"  U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8.  But Macaulay also made clear that copyright protection imposes costs.  Those costs include the higher prices that can accompany the grant of a copyright monopoly.  They also can include (for those wishing to display, sell, or perform a design, film, work of art, or piece of music, for example) the costs of discovering whether there are previous copyrights, of contacting copyright holders, and of securing permission to copy.  Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.\u00a0S. 186, 248-252 (2003) (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Sometimes, as Thomas Jefferson wrote to James Madison, costs can outweigh \"the benefit even of limited monopolies.\"  Letter from Thomas Jefferson to James Madison (July 31, 1788), in 13 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 443 (J. Boyd ed. 1956) (Jefferson Letter).  And that is particularly true in light of the fact that Congress has extended the \"limited Times\" of protection, U.\u00a0S. Const., Art. I, \u00a78, cl. 8, from the \"14 years\" of Jefferson's day to potentially more than a century today.  Jefferson Letter 443; see also Eldred, supra, at 246-252 (opinion of Breyer, J.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Constitution grants Congress primary responsibility for assessing comparative costs and benefits and drawing copyright's statutory lines. Courts must respect those lines and not grant copyright protection where Congress has decided not to do so.  And it is clear that Congress has not extended broad copyright protection to the fashion design industry.  See, e.g., 1 Nimmer \u00a72A.08[H][3][c] (describing how Congress rejected proposals for fashion design protection within the 1976 Act and has rejected every proposed bill to this effect since then); Esquire, Inc. v. Ringer, 591 F.\u00a02d 796, 800, n. 12 (CADC 1978) (observing that at the time of the 1976 Copyright Act, Congress had rejected every one of the approximately 70 design protection bills that had been introduced since 1914); e.g., H. R. 5055, 109th Cong., 2d Sess.: \"To Amend title 17, United States Code, to provide protection for fashion design\" (introduced Mar. 30, 2006; unenacted).  Congress has left \"statutory .\u00a0.\u00a0. protection .\u00a0.\u00a0. largely unavailable for dress designs.\"  1 Nimmer \u00a72A.08[H][3][a]; Raustiala & Sprigman, The Piracy Paradox: Innovation and Intellectual Property in Fashion Design, 92 Va. L. Rev. 1687, 1698-1705 (2006).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Congress' decision not to grant full copyright protection to the fashion industry has not left the industry without protection.  Patent design protection is available.  35 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7\u00a7171, 173.  A maker of clothing can obtain trademark protection under the Lanham Act for signature features of the clothing.  15 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71051 et seq.  And a designer who creates an original textile design can receive copyright protection for that pattern as placed, for example, on a bolt of cloth, or anything made with that cloth.  E.g., Compendium \u00a7924.3(A)(1).  \"[T]his [type of] claim .\u00a0.\u00a0. is generally made by the fabric producer rather than the garment or costume designer,\" and is \"ordinarily made when the two-dimensional design is applied to the textile fabric and before the garment is cut from the fabric.\"  56 Fed. Reg. 56531 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The fashion industry has thrived against this backdrop, and designers have contributed immeasurably to artistic and personal self-expression through clothing.  But a decision by this Court to grant protection to the design of a garment would grant the designer protection that Congress refused to provide.  It would risk increased prices and unforeseeable disruption in the clothing industry, which in the United States alone encompasses nearly $370 billion in annual spending and 1.8 million jobs.  Brief for Council of Fashion Designers of America, Inc., as Amicus Curiae 3-4 (citing U.\u00a0S. Congress, Joint Economic Committee, The New Economy of Fashion 1 (2016)).  That is why I believe it important to emphasize those parts of the Court's opinion that limit the scope of its interpretation.  That language, as I have said, makes clear that one may not \"claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium,\" which \"would not give rise to any rights in the useful article that inspired it.\"  Ante, at 7-8.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If we ask the \"separateness\" question correctly, the answer here is not difficult to find.  The majority's opinion, in its appendix, depicts the cheerleader dress designs that Varsity submitted to the Copyright Office.  Can the design features in Varsity's pictures exist separately from the utilitarian aspects of a dress?  Can we extract those features as copyrightable design works standing alone, without bringing along, via picture or design, the dresses of which they constitute a part?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider designs 074, 078, and 0815.  They certainly look like cheerleader uniforms.  That is to say, they look like pictures of cheerleader uniforms, just like Van Gogh's old shoes look like shoes.  I do not see how one could see them otherwise.  Designs 299A and 2999B present slightly closer questions.  They omit some of the dresslike context that the other designs possess.  But the necklines, the sleeves, and the cut of the skirt suggest that they too are pictures of dresses.  Looking at all five of Varsity's pictures, I do not see how one could conceptualize the design features in a way that does not picture, not just artistic designs, but dresses as well.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Were I to accept the majority's invitation to \"imaginatively remov[e]\" the chevrons and stripes as they are arranged on the neckline, waistline, sleeves, and skirt of each uniform, and apply them on a \"painter's canvas,\" ante, at 10, that painting would be of a cheerleader's dress.  The esthetic elements on which Varsity seeks protection exist only as part of the uniform design--there is nothing to separate out but for dress-shaped lines that replicate the cut and style of the uniforms.  Hence, each design is not physically separate, nor is it conceptually separate, from the useful article it depicts, namely, a cheerleader's dress.  They cannot be copyrighted.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Varsity, of course, could have sought a design patent for its designs.  Or, it could have sought a copyright on a textile design, even one with a similar theme of chevrons and lines.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But that is not the nature of Varsity's copyright claim.  It has instead claimed ownership of the particular \"\u00a0'treatment and arrangement'\u00a0\" of the chevrons and lines of the design as they appear at the neckline, waist, skirt, sleeves, and overall cut of each uniform.  Brief for Respondents 50.  The majority imagines that Varsity submitted something different--that is, only the surface decorations of chevrons and stripes, as in a textile design.  As the majority sees it, Varsity's copyright claim would be the same had it submitted a plain rectangular space depicting chevrons and stripes, like swaths from a bolt of fabric.  But considered on their own, the simple stripes are plainly unoriginal.  Varsity, then, seeks to do indirectly what it cannot do directly: bring along the design and cut of the dresses by seeking to protect surface decorations whose \"treatment and arrangement\" are coextensive with that design and cut.  As Varsity would have it, it would prevent its competitors from making useful three-dimensional cheerleader uniforms by submitting plainly unoriginal chevrons and stripes as cut and arranged on a useful article.  But with that cut and arrangement, the resulting pictures on which Varsity seeks protection do not simply depict designs.  They depict clothing.  They depict the useful articles of which the designs are inextricable parts.  And Varsity cannot obtain copyright protection that would give them the power to prevent others from making those useful uniforms, any more than Van Gogh can copyright comfortable old shoes by painting their likeness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I fear that, in looking past the three-dimensional design inherent in Varsity's claim by treating it as if it were no more than a design for a bolt of cloth, the majority has lost sight of its own important limiting principle.  One may not \"claim a copyright in a useful article merely by creating a replica of that article in some other medium,\" such as in a picture.  Ante, at 7.  That is to say, one cannot obtain a copyright that would give its holder \"any rights in the useful article that inspired it.\"  Ante, at 8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, I dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0We do not today hold that the surface decorations are copyrightable.  We express no opinion on whether these works are sufficiently original to qualify for copyright protection, see Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U. S. 340, 358-359 (1991), or on whether any other prerequisite of a valid copyright has been satisfied.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The dissent suggests that our test would lead to the copyrighting of shovels.  Post, at 7; Appendix to opinion of Breyer, J., fig. 4, post.  But a shovel, like a cheerleading uniform, even if displayed in an art gallery, is \"an article having an intrinsic utilitarian function that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.\"  17 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7101.  It therefore cannot be copyrighted.  A drawing of a shovel could, of course, be copyrighted.  And, if the shovel included any artistic features that could be perceived as art apart from the shovel, and which would qualify as protectable pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works on their own or in another medium, they too could be copyrighted.  But a shovel as a shovel cannot.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Courts \"have struggled mightily to formulate a test\" for the separability analysis.  799 F.\u00a03d 468, 484 (CA6 2015); see 2 W.

In view of the dissent's assertion that Varsity's designs are \"plainly unoriginal,\" post, at 11, however, I note this Court's recognition that \"the requisite level of creativity [for copyrightability] is extremely low; even a slight amount will suffice,\" Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.\u00a0S. 340, 345 (1991); see Atari Games Corp. v. Oman, 979 F.\u00a02d 242 (CADC 1992).\nFootnote 3\u00a0That Varsity's designs can be placed on jackets or T-shirts without replicating a cheerleader's uniform supports their qualification as fabric designs.  The dissent acknowledges that fabric designs are copyrightable, but maintains that Varsity's designs do not count because Varsity's submissions depict clothing, not fabric designs.  Post, at 10-11.  But registrants claiming copyrightable designs may submit drawings or photos of those designs as they appear on useful articles.  See Compendium of U.\u00a0S.

And, as noted in text, Varsity's registration statements claimed \"2-Dimensional artwork\" and \"fabric design (artwork).\"  Appendix, infra, at 4-7, 9-10, 12-14.\nThe dissent also acknowledges that artwork printed on a T-shirt is copyrightable.  Post, at 4.  Varsity's colored shapes and patterns can be, and indeed are, printed on T-shirts.  See, e.g., App. 274.  Assuming Varsity's designs meet the other requirements for copyrightable subject matter, they would fit comfortably within the Copyright Office guidance featured by the dissent.  See post, at 4 (citing Compendium of U.\u00a0S.

KRAFT FOODS GROUP BRANDS LLC(2017)\nNo. 16-341\nArgued: March 27, 2017Decided: May 22, 2017\n\n\nThe patent venue statute, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71400(b), provides that \"[a]ny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\"  In Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp., 353 U.\u00a0S. 222, 226, this Court concluded that for purposes of \u00a71400(b) a domestic corporation \"resides\" only in its State of incorporation, rejecting the argument that \u00a71400(b) incorporates the broader definition of corporate \"residence\" contained in the general venue statute, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(c).  Congress has not amended \u00a71400(b) since Fourco, but it has twice amended \u00a71391, which now provides that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\" and \"[f]or all venue purposes,\" a corporation \"shall be deemed to reside, if a defendant, in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question.\"  \u00a7\u00a71391(a), (c).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent filed a patent infringement suit in the District Court for the District of Delaware against petitioner, a competitor that is organized under Indiana law and headquartered in Indiana but ships the allegedly infringing products into Delaware.  Petitioner moved to transfer venue to a District Court in Indiana, claiming that venue was improper in Delaware.  Citing Fourco, petitioner argued that it did not \"resid[e]\" in Delaware and had no \"regular and established place of business\" in Delaware under \u00a71400(b).  The District Court rejected these arguments.  The Federal Circuit denied a petition for a writ of mandamus, concluding that \u00a71391(c) supplies the definition of \"resides\" in \u00a71400(b).  The Federal Circuit reasoned that because petitioner resided in Delaware under \u00a71391(c), it also resided there under \u00a71400(b). \nHeld:\u00a0As applied to domestic corporations, \"reside[nce]\" in \u00a71400(b) refers only to the State of incorporation.  The amendments to \u00a71391 did not modify the meaning of \u00a71400(b) as interpreted by Fourco.  Pp.\u00a03-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The venue provision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 covered patent cases as well as other civil suits.  Stonite Products Co. v. Melvin Lloyd Co., 315 U.\u00a0S. 561, 563.  In 1897, Congress enacted a patent specific venue statute.  This new statute (\u00a71400(b)'s predecessor) permitted suit in the district of which the defendant was an \"inhabitant\" or in which the defendant both maintained a \"regular and established place of business\" and committed an act of infringement.  29 Stat. 695.  A corporation at that time was understood to \"inhabit\" only the State of incorporation.  This Court addressed the scope of \u00a71400(b)'s predecessor in Stonite, concluding that it constituted \"the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings\" and thus was not supplemented or modified by the general venue provisions.  315 U.\u00a0S., at 563.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1948, Congress recodified the patent venue statute as \u00a71400(b).  That provision, which remains unaltered today, uses \"resides\" instead of \"inhabit[s].\"  At the same time, Congress also enacted the general venue statute, \u00a71391, which defined \"residence\" for corporate defendants.  In Fourco, this Court reaffirmed Stonite's holding, observing that Congress enacted \u00a71400(b) as a standalone venue statute and that nothing in the 1948 recodification evidenced an intent to alter that status, even the fact that \u00a71391(c) by \"its terms\" embraced \"all actions,\" 353 U.\u00a0S., at 228.  The Court also concluded that \"resides\" in the recodified version bore the same meaning as \"inhabit[s]\" in the pre-1948 version.  See id., at 226. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This landscape remained effectively unchanged until 1988, when Congress amended the general venue statute, \u00a71391(c).  The revised provision stated that it applied \"[f]or purposes of venue under this chapter.\"  In VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., 917 F.\u00a02d 1574, 1578, the Federal Circuit held that, in light of this amendment, \u00a71391(c) established the definition for all other venue statutes under the same \"chapter,\" including \u00a71400(b).  In 2011, Congress adopted the current version of \u00a71391, which provides that its general definition applies \"[f]or all venue purposes.\"  The Federal Circuit reaffirmed VE Holding in the case below.  Pp.\u00a03-7.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0In Fourco, this Court definitively and unambiguously held that the word \"reside[nce]\" in \u00a71400(b), as applied to domestic corporations, refers only to the State of incorporation.  Because Congress has not amended \u00a71400(b) since Fourco, and neither party asks the Court to reconsider that decision, the only question here is whether Congress changed \u00a71400(b)'s meaning when it amended \u00a71391.  When Congress intends to effect a change of that kind, it ordinarily provides a relatively clear indication of its intent in the amended provision's text.  No such indication appears in the current version of \u00a71391.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent points out that the current \u00a71391(c) provides a default rule that, on its face, applies without exception \"[f]or all venue purposes.\"  But the version at issue in Fourco similarly provided a default rule that applied \"\u00a0'for venue purposes,'\u00a0\" 353 U.\u00a0S., at 223, and those phrasings are not materially different in this context.  The addition of the word \"all\" to the already comprehensive provision does not suggest that Congress intended the Court to reconsider its decision in Fourco.  Any argument based on this language is even weaker now than it was when the Court rejected it in Fourco.  Fourco held that \u00a71400(b) retained a meaning distinct from the default definition contained in \u00a71391(c), even though the latter, by its terms, included no exceptions.  The current version of \u00a71391 includes a saving clause, which expressly states that the provision does not apply when \"otherwise provided by law,\" thus making explicit the qualification that the Fourco Court found implicit in the statute.  Finally, there is no indication that Congress in 2011 ratified the Federal Circuit's decision in VE Holding.  Pp.\u00a07-10.\n821 F.\u00a03d 1338, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which all other Members joined, except Gorsuch, J., who took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\u2002581 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNOTICE:\u2002This opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the United States Reports.\u2003Readers are requested to notify the Reporter of Decisions, Supreme Court of the United States, Washington, D.\u00a0C. 20543, of any typographical or other formal errors, in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press.\nNo. 16-341\nTC HEARTLAND LLC, PETITIONER v.

The patent venue statute, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71400(b), provides that \"[a]ny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\"  In Fourco Glass Co. v. Transmirra Products Corp., 353 U.\u00a0S. 222, 226 (1957), this Court concluded that for purposes of \u00a71400(b) a domestic corporation \"resides\" only in its State of incorporation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reaching that conclusion, the Court rejected the argument that \u00a71400(b) incorporates the broader definition of corporate \"residence\" contained in the general venue statute, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71391(c).  353 U.\u00a0S., at 228.  Congress has not amended \u00a71400(b) since this Court construed it in Fourco, but it has amended \u00a71391 twice.  Section 1391 now provides that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law\" and \"[f]or all venue purposes,\" a corporation \"shall be deemed to reside, if a defendant, in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question.\"  \u00a7\u00a71391(a), (c).  The issue in this case is whether that definition supplants the definition announced in Fourco and allows a plaintiff to bring a patent infringement lawsuit against a corporation in any district in which the corporation is subject to personal jurisdiction.  We conclude that the amendments to \u00a71391 did not modify the meaning of \u00a71400(b) as interpreted by Fourco.  We therefore hold that a domestic corporation \"resides\" only in its State of incorporation for purposes of the patent venue statute.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner, which is organized under Indiana law and headquartered in Indiana, manufactures flavored drink mixes.1  Respondent, which is organized under Delaware law and has its principal place of business in Illinois, is a competitor in the same market.  As relevant here, respondent sued petitioner in the District Court for the District of Delaware, alleging that petitioner's products infringed one of respondent's patents.  Although petitioner is not registered to conduct business in Delaware and has no meaningful local presence there, it does ship the allegedly infringing products into the State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner moved to dismiss the case or transfer venue to the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana, arguing that venue was improper in Delaware.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71406.  Citing Fourco's holding that a corporation resides only in its State of incorporation for patent infringement suits, petitioner argued that it did not \"resid[e]\" in Delaware under the first clause of \u00a71400(b).  It further argued that it had no \"regular and established place of business\" in Delaware under the second clause of \u00a71400(b).  Relying on Circuit precedent, the District Court rejected these arguments, 2015 WL 5613160 (D Del., Sept. 24, 2015), and the Federal Circuit denied a petition for a writ of mandamus, In\u00a0re TC Heartland LLC, 821 F.\u00a03d 1338 (2016).  The Federal Circuit concluded that subsequent statutory amendments had effectively amended \u00a71400(b) as construed in Fourco, with the result that \u00a71391(c) now supplies the definition of \"resides\" in \u00a71400(b).  821 F.\u00a03d, at 1341-1343.  Under this logic, because the District of Delaware could exercise personal jurisdiction over petitioner, petitioner resided in Delaware under \u00a71391(c) and, therefore, under \u00a71400(b).  We granted certiorari, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The history of the relevant statutes provides important context for the issue in this case.  The Judiciary Act of 1789 permitted a plaintiff to file suit in a federal district court if the defendant was \"an inhabitant\" of that district or could be \"found\" for service of process in that district.  Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a711, 1 Stat. 79.  The Act covered patent cases as well as other civil suits.  Stonite Products Co. v. Melvin Lloyd Co., 315 U.\u00a0S. 561, 563 (1942).  In 1887, Congress amended the statute to permit suit only in the district of which the defendant was an inhabitant or, in diversity cases, of which either the plaintiff or defendant was an inhabitant.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1887, \u00a71, 24 Stat. 552; see also Stonite, supra, at 563-564.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's decision in In re Hohorst, 150 U.\u00a0S. 653, 661-662 (1893), arguably suggested that the 1887 Act did not apply to patent cases.  As a result, while some courts continued to apply the Act to patent cases, others refused to do so and instead permitted plaintiffs to bring suit (in line with the pre-1887 regime) anywhere a defendant could be found for service of process.  See Stonite, supra, at 564-565.  In 1897, Congress resolved the confusion by enacting a patent specific venue statute.  See Act of Mar. 3, 1897, ch. 395, 29 Stat. 695.  In so doing, it \"placed patent infringement cases in a class by themselves, outside the scope of general venue legislation.\"  Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.\u00a0S. 706, 713 (1972).  This new statute (\u00a71400(b)'s predecessor) permitted suit in the district of which the defendant was an \"inhabitant,\" or a district in which the defendant both maintained a \"regular and established place of business\" and committed an act of infringement.  29 Stat. 695.  At the time, a corporation was understood to \"inhabit\" only the State in which it was incorporated.  Shaw v. Quincy Mining Co., 145 U.\u00a0S. 444, 449-450 (1892).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court addressed the scope of \u00a71400(b)'s predecessor in Stonite.  In that case, the two defendants inhabited different districts within a single State.  The plaintiff sought to sue them both in the same district, invoking a then governing general venue statute that, if applicable, permitted it to do so.  315 U.\u00a0S., at 562-563.  This Court rejected the plaintiff's venue choice on the ground that the patent venue statute constituted \"the exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement proceedings\" and thus was not supplemented or modified by the general venue provisions.  Id., at 563.  In the Court's view, the patent venue statute \"was adopted to define the exact jurisdiction of the federal courts in actions to enforce patent rights,\" a purpose that would be undermined by interpreting it \"to dovetail with the general provisions relating to the venue of civil suits.\"  Id., at 565-566.  The Court thus held that the patent venue statute \"alone should control venue in patent infringement proceedings.\"  Id., at 566.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1948, Congress recodified the patent venue statute as \u00a71400(b).  See Act of June 25, 1948, 62 Stat. 936.  The recodified provision, which remains unaltered today, states that \"[a]ny civil action for patent infringement may be brought in the judicial district where the defendant resides, or where the defendant has committed acts of infringement and has a regular and established place of business.\"  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71400(b) (1952 ed.).  This version differs from the previous one in that it uses \"resides\" instead of \"inhabit[s].\"  At the same time, Congress also enacted the general venue statute, \u00a71391, which defined \"residence\" for corporate defendants.  That provision stated that \"[a] corporation may be sued in any judicial district in which it is incorporated or licensed to do business or is doing business, and such judicial district shall be regarded as the residence of such corporation for venue purposes.\"  \u00a71391(c) (1952 ed.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following the 1948 legislation, courts reached differing conclusions regarding whether \u00a71400(b)'s use of the word \"resides\" incorporated \u00a71391(c)'s definition of \"residence.\"  See Fourco, 353 U.\u00a0S., at 224, n.\u00a03 (listing cases).  In Fourco, this Court reviewed a decision of the Second Circuit holding that \u00a71391(c) defined residence for purposes of \u00a71400(b), \"just as that definition is properly .\u00a0.\u00a0. incorporated into other sections of the venue chapter.\"  Trans- mirra Prods. Corp. v. Fourco Glass Co., 233 F.\u00a02d 885, 886 (1956).  This Court squarely rejected that interpretation, reaffirming Stonite's holding that \u00a71400(b) \"is the sole and exclusive provision controlling venue in patent infringement actions, and .\u00a0.\u00a0. is not to be supplemented by .\u00a0.\u00a0. \u00a71391(c).\"  353 U.\u00a0S., at 229.  The Court observed that Congress enacted \u00a71400(b) as a standalone venue statute and that nothing in the 1948 recodification evidenced an intent to alter that status.  The fact that \u00a71391(c) by \"its terms\" embraced \"all actions\" was not enough to overcome the fundamental point that Congress designed \u00a71400(b) to be \"complete, independent and alone controlling in its sphere.\"  Id., at 228.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court also concluded that \"resides\" in the recodified version of \u00a71400(b) bore the same meaning as \"inhabit[s]\" in the pre-1948 version.  See id., at 226 (\"[T]he [w]ords 'inhabitant' and 'resident,' as respects venue, are synonymous\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The substitution of \"resides\" for \"inhabit[s]\" thus did not suggest any alteration in the venue rules for corporations in patent cases.  Accordingly, \u00a71400(b) continued to apply to domestic corporations in the same way it always had: They were subject to venue only in their States of incorporation.  See ibid. (The use of \"resides\" \"negat[es] any intention to make corporations suable, in patent infringement cases, where they are merely 'doing business,' because those synonymous words [\"inhabitant\" and \"resident\"] mean domicile and, in respect of corporations, mean the state of incorporation only\").\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This landscape remained effectively unchanged until 1988, when Congress amended the general venue statute, \u00a71391(c), to provide that \"[f]or purposes of venue under this chapter, a defendant that is a corporation shall be deemed to reside in any judicial district in which it is subject to personal jurisdiction at the time the action is commenced.\"  Judicial Improvements and Access to Justice Act, \u00a71013(a), 102 Stat. 4669.  The Federal Circuit in VE Holding Corp. v. Johnson Gas Appliance Co., 917 F.\u00a02d 1574 (1990), announced its view of the effect of this amendment on the meaning of the patent venue statute.  The court reasoned that the phrase \"[f]or purposes of venue under this chapter\" was \"exact and classic language of incorporation,\" id., at 1579, and that \u00a71391(c) accordingly established the definition for all other venue statutes under the same \"chapter.\"  Id., at 1580.  Because \u00a71400(b) fell within the relevant chapter, the Federal Circuit concluded that \u00a71391(c), \"on its face,\" \"clearly applies to \u00a71400(b), and thus redefines the meaning of the term 'resides' in that section.\"  Id., at 1578.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following VE Holding, no new developments occurred until Congress adopted the current version of \u00a71391 in 2011 (again leaving \u00a71400(b) unaltered).  See Federal Courts Jurisdiction and Venue Clarification Act of 2011, \u00a7202, 125 Stat. 763.  Section 1391(a) now provides that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by law,\" \"this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions brought in district courts of the United States.\"  And \u00a71391(c)(2), in turn, provides that, \"[f]or all venue purposes,\" certain entities, \"whether or not incorporated, shall be deemed to reside, if a defendant, in any judicial district in which such defendant is subject to the court's personal jurisdiction with respect to the civil action in question.\"  In its decision below, the Federal Circuit reaffirmed VE Holding, reasoning that the 2011 amendments provided no basis to reconsider its prior decision.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We reverse the Federal Circuit.  In Fourco, this Court definitively and unambiguously held that the word \"reside[nce]\" in \u00a71400(b) has a particular meaning as applied to domestic2 corporations: It refers only to the State of incorporation.  Congress has not amended \u00a71400(b) since Fourco, and neither party asks us to reconsider our holding in that case.  Accordingly, the only question we must answer is whether Congress changed the meaning of \u00a71400(b) when it amended \u00a71391.  When Congress intends to effect a change of that kind, it ordinarily provides a relatively clear indication of its intent in the text of the amended provision.  See United States v. Madigan, 300 U.\u00a0S. 500, 506 (1937) (\"[T]he modification by implication of the settled construction of an earlier and different section is not favored\"); A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading Law 331 (2012) (\"A clear, authoritative judicial holding on the meaning of a particular provision should not be cast in doubt and subjected to challenge whenever a related though not utterly inconsistent provision is adopted in the same statute or even in an affiliated statute\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The current version of \u00a71391 does not contain any indication that Congress intended to alter the meaning of \u00a71400(b) as interpreted in Fourco.  Although the current version of \u00a71391(c) provides a default rule that applies \"[f]or all venue purposes,\" the version at issue in Fourco similarly provided a default rule that applied \"for venue purposes.\"  353 U.\u00a0S., at 223 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this context, we do not see any material difference between the two phrasings.  See Pure Oil Co. v. Suarez, 384 U.\u00a0S. 202, 204-205 (1966) (construing \"\u00a0'for venue purposes'\u00a0\" to cover \"all venue statutes\").  Respondent argues that \"\u00a0'all venue purposes' means 'all venue purposes'--not 'all venue purposes except for patent venue.'\u00a0\"  Brief for Respondent 21.  The plaintiffs in Fourco advanced the same argument.  See 353 U.\u00a0S., at 228 (\"The main thrust of respondents' argument is that \u00a71391(c) is clear and unambiguous and that its terms include all actions--including patent infringement actions\").  This Court was not persuaded then, and the addition of the word \"all\" to the already comprehensive provision does not suggest that Congress intended for us to reconsider that conclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This particular argument is even weaker under the current version of \u00a71391 than it was under the provision in place at the time of Fourco, because the current provision includes a saving clause expressly stating that it does not apply when \"otherwise provided by law.\"  On its face, the version of \u00a71391(c) at issue in Fourco included no exceptions, yet this Court still held that \"resides\" in \u00a71400(b) retained its original meaning contrary to \u00a71391(c)'s default definition.  Fourco's holding rests on even firmer footing now that \u00a71391's saving clause expressly contemplates that certain venue statutes may retain definitions of \"resides\" that conflict with its default definition.  In short, the saving clause makes explicit the qualification that this Court previously found implicit in the statute.  See Pure Oil, supra, at 205 (interpreting earlier version of \u00a71391 to apply \"to all venue statutes using residence as a criterion, at least in the absence of contrary restrictive indications in any such statute\").  Respondent suggests that the saving clause in \u00a71391(a) does not apply to the definitional provisions in \u00a71391(c), Brief for Respondent 31-32, but that interpretation is belied by the text of \u00a71391(a), which makes clear that the saving clause applies to the entire \"section.\"  See \u00a71391(a)(1) (\"Except as otherwise provided by law-- .\u00a0.\u00a0. this section shall govern the venue of all civil actions\" (emphasis added)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, there is no indication that Congress in 2011 ratified the Federal Circuit's decision in VE Holding.  If anything, the 2011 amendments undermine that decision's rationale.  As petitioner points out, VE Holding relied heavily--indeed, almost exclusively--on Congress' decision in 1988 to replace \"for venue purposes\" with \"[f]or purposes of venue under this chapter\" (emphasis added) in \u00a71391(c).  Congress deleted \"under this chapter\" in 2011 and worded the current version of \u00a71391(c) almost identically to the original version of the statute.  Compare \u00a71391(c) (2012 ed.) (\"[f]or all venue purposes\") with \u00a71391(c) (1952 ed.) (\"for venue purposes\").  In short, nothing in the text suggests congressional approval of VE Holding.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As applied to domestic corporations, \"reside[nce]\" in \u00a71400(b) refers only to the State of incorporation.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0The complaint alleged that petitioner is a corporation, and petitioner admitted this allegation in its answer.  See App. 11a, 60a.  Similarly, the petition for certiorari sought review on the question of \"corporate\" residence.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  In their briefs before this Court, however, the parties suggest that petitioner is, in fact, an unincorporated entity.  See Brief for Respondent 9, n.\u00a04 (the complaint's allegation was \"apparently inaccurat[e]\"); Reply Brief 4.  Because this case comes to us at the pleading stage and has been litigated on the understanding that petitioner is a corporation, we confine our analysis to the proper venue for corporations.  We leave further consideration of the issue of petitioner's legal status to the courts below on remand.\nFootnote 2\u00a0The parties dispute the implications of petitioner's argument for foreign corporations.  We do not here address that question, nor do we express any opinion on this Court's holding in Brunette Machine Works, Ltd. v. Kockum Industries, Inc., 406 U.\u00a0S. 706 (1972) (determining proper venue for foreign corporation under then existing statutory regime).\n\n\n","74":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTHOMAS D. ARTHUR  v.  JEFFERSON S. DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS, ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 16-602\nArgued: Decided: February 21, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The motion of Certain Medical Professionals and Medical Ethicists for leave to file a brief as amici curiae is granted.  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nearly two years ago in Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), the Court issued a macabre challenge.  In order to successfully attack a State's method of execution as cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment, a condemned prisoner must not only prove that the State's chosen method risks severe pain, but must also propose a \"known and available\" alternative method for his own execution.  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 13, 15).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Thomas Arthur, a prisoner on Alabama's death row, has met this challenge.  He has amassed significant evidence that Alabama's current lethal-injection protocol will result in intolerable and needless agony, and he has proposed an alternative--death by firing squad.  The Court of Appeals, without considering any of the evidence regarding the risk posed by the current protocol, denied Arthur's claim because Alabama law does not expressly permit execution by firing squad, and so it cannot be a \"known and available\" alternative under Glossip.  Because this decision permits States to immunize their methods of execution--no matter how cruel or how unusual--from judicial review and thus permits state law to subvert the Federal Constitution, I would grant certiorari and reverse.  I dissent from my colleagues' decision not to do so.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Execution by lethal injection is generally accomplished through serial administration of three drugs.  First, a fast-acting sedative such as sodium thiopental induces \"a deep, comalike unconsciousness.\"  Baze v. Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35, 44 (2008) (plurality opinion).  Second, a paralytic agent--most often pancuronium bromide--\"inhibits all muscular-skeletal movements and, by paralyzing the diaphragm, stops respiration.\"  Ibid.  Third, potassium chloride induces fatal cardiac arrest.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first drug is critical; without it, the prisoner faces the unadulterated agony of the second and third drugs.  The second drug causes \"an extremely painful sensation of crushing and suffocation,\" see Denno, When Legislatures Delegate Death: The Troubling Paradox Behind State Uses of Electrocution and Lethal Injection and What It Says About Us, 63 Ohio St. L.\u00a0J. 63, 109, n.\u00a0321 (2002); but paralyzes the prisoner so as to \"mas[k] any outward sign of distress,\" thus serving States'  interest \"\u00a0'in preserving the dignity of the procedure,'\u00a0\" Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 71, 73 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  And the third drug causes an \"excruciating burning sensation\" that is \"equivalent to the sensation of a hot poker being inserted into the arm\" and traveling \"with the chemical up the prisoner's arm and .\u00a0.\u00a0. across his chest until it reaches his heart.\"  Denno, supra, at 109, n.\u00a0321.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Execution absent an adequate sedative thus produces a nightmarish death: The condemned prisoner is conscious but entirely paralyzed, unable to move or scream his agony, as he suffers \"what may well be the chemical equivalent of being burned at the stake.\"  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For many years, the barbiturate sodium thiopental seemed up to this task.1  In 2009, however, the sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental suspended domestic production and later left the market altogether.  Id., at ___-___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 4-5).  States then began to use another barbiturate, pentobarbital.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  But in 2013, it also became unavailable.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 5-6).  Only then did States turn to midazolam, the drug at the center of this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Midazolam, like Valium and Xanax, belongs to a class of medicines known as benzodiazepines and has some anesthetic effect.  Id., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5).  Generally, anesthetics can cause a level of sedation and depression of electrical brain activity sufficient to block all sensation, including pain.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 283a-290a.  But it is not clear that midazolam adequately serves this purpose.  This is because midazolam, unlike barbiturates such as pentobarbital, has no analgesic--pain-relieving--effects.  Id., at 307a; see also Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5).  Thus, \"for midazolam to maintain unconsciousness through application of a particular stimulus, it would need to depress electrical activity to a deeper level than would be required of, for example, pentobarbital.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 307a.2  Although it can be used to render individuals unconscious, midazolam is not used on its own to maintain anesthesia--complete obliviousness to physical sensation--in surgical procedures, and indeed, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved the drug for this purpose.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like the experts in Glossip, the experts in this case agree that midazolam is subject to a ceiling effect, which means that there is a point at which increasing the dose of the drug does not result in any greater effect.  Ibid.  The main dispute with respect to midazolam relates to how this ceiling effect operates--if the ceiling on midazolam's sedative effect is reached before complete unconsciousness can be achieved, it may be incapable of keeping individuals insensate to the extreme pain and discomfort associated with administration of the second and third drugs in lethal-injection protocols.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the horrific execution of Clayton Lockett, who, notwithstanding administration of midazolam, awoke during his execution and appeared to be in great pain, we agreed to hear the case of death row inmates seeking to avoid the same fate.  In Glossip, these inmates alleged that because midazolam is incapable of rendering prisoners unconscious and insensate to pain during lethal injection, Oklahoma's intended use of the drug in their executions would violate the Eighth Amendment.  The Court rejected this claim for two reasons.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court found that the District Court had not clearly erred in determining that \"midazolam is highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain during an execution.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  Second, the Court held that the petitioners had failed to satisfy the novel requirement of pleading and proving a \"known and available alternative\" method of execution.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Post-Glossip, in order to prevail in an Eighth Amendment challenge to a State's method of execution, prisoners first must prove the State's current method \"entails a substantial risk of severe pain,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 2), and second, must \"identify a known and available alternative method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case centers on whether Thomas Arthur has met these requirements with respect to Alabama's lethal-injection protocol.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alabama adopted lethal injection as its default method of execution in 2002.  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1(a) (2011); see also Ex parte Borden, 60 So.\u00a03d 940, 941 (Ala. 2007).  The State's capital punishment statute delegates the task of prescribing the drugs necessary to compound a lethal injection to the Department of Corrections.  \u00a715-18-82.1(f\u00a0).  Consistent with the practice in other States following the national shortage of sodium thiopental and pentobarbital, the department has adopted a protocol involving the same three drugs considered in Glossip.  See Brooks v. Warden, 810 F.\u00a03d 812, 823 (CA11 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps anticipating constitutional challenges, Alabama's legislature enacted a contingency plan: The statute provides that \"[i]f electrocution or lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional .\u00a0.\u00a0. all persons sentenced to death for a capital crime shall be executed by any constitutional method of execution.\"  \u00a715-18-82.1(c).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas Douglas Arthur killed his paramour's husband in 1982.  840 F. 3d 1268, 1272-1273 (CA11 2016).  Over the next decade, two juries found Arthur guilty of murder, and each time, Arthur's conviction was overturned on appeal.  Ibid.  After a third trial in 1992, Arthur was convicted and sentenced to death.  Ibid.  Since then, Arthur has been scheduled to die on six separate occasions, and each time, his execution was stayed.  Id., at 1275, n.\u00a02.  After 34 years of legal challenges, Arthur has accepted that he will die for his crimes.  He now challenges only how the State will be permitted to kill him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arthur asserted two distinct claims in the District Court.  First, Arthur asserted a facial challenge, arguing that midazolam is generally incapable of performing as intended during Alabama's three-drug lethal-injection procedure.  Second, Arthur asserted an as-applied challenge, arguing that because of his individual health attributes, midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain for him during the procedure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court considered these two claims separately.  With respect to the facial challenge, the District Court ordered bifurcated proceedings, with the first hearing limited to the availability of a feasible alternative method of execution.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a, and n.\u00a02.  Arthur's initial complaint proposed a single dose either of pentobarbital or sodium thiopental rather than a three-drug protocol, but the District Court found that those methods were unavailable given the elimination of both drugs from the domestic market.  Id., at 203a-205a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arthur then moved to amend his complaint to allege the firing squad as an alternative method of execution.  The District Court denied the motion, holding that \"execution by firing squad is not permitted by statute and, therefore, is not a method of execution that could be considered either feasible or readily implemented by Alabama at this time.\"  Id., at 241a.  Because Arthur's claim failed on this ground, the court never considered Arthur's evidence with respect to midazolam, despite later observing that it was \"impressive.\"  Id., at 166a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a separate order, the District Court considered Arthur's as-applied challenge.  Arthur alleged, based on the expert opinion of Dr. Jack Strader, that \"his cardiovascular issues, combined with his age and emotional makeup, create a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain that will result in a violation of the Eighth Amendment if he is executed under the [midazolam] protocol.\"  Id., at 151a.  Echoing its rationale with respect to Arthur's facial challenge, the District Court found that Arthur failed to prove the existence of a feasible, readily available alternative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court then turned to the question it had avoided in the facial challenge: whether Alabama's lethal-injection protocol created a risk of serious illness or needless suffering.  But because the District Court considered the question as part of Arthur's as-applied challenge, it focused on the protocol as applied to Arthur's personal physical condition.  The court rejected Dr. Strader's opinion that the dose of midazolam required by Alabama's protocol \"will likely induce a rapid and dangerous reduction in blood pressure more quickly than it results in sedation,\" and that during this time gap, Arthur--whom he believed to suffer from heart disease--would suffer a painful heart attack.  Id., at 169a.  Because Dr. Strader's experience was limited to clinical doses of midazolam, which typically range from 2 to 5 mg, the court concluded that he had no basis to extrapolate his experience to non-clinical, lethal doses, such as the 500-mg bolus required by Alabama's lethal-injection protocol.  Id., at 177a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court expressly refused to consider the expert opinions that Arthur proffered as part of his facial challenge, noting that they \"are untested in court, due to Arthur's inability to provide a[n alternative] remedy in his facial, and now as-applied, challenges.\"  Id., at 167a, n.\u00a016.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court therefore concluded that Arthur failed to meet the Glossip standard and entered judgment in favor of the State.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 238a.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  In a 111-page slip opinion issued the day before Arthur's scheduled execution, the court first found that \"Arthur never showed Alabama's current lethal injection protocol, per se or as applied to him, violates the Constitution.\"  840 F.\u00a03d, at 1315.  The court based this finding on Arthur's failure to \"satisfy the first [Glossip] prong as to midazolam\" as part of his as-applied challenge, ibid., and the fact that this Court \"upheld the midazolam-based execution protocol\" in Glossip, 840 F.\u00a03d, at 1315.  Like the District Court, the Eleventh Circuit never considered the evidence Arthur introduced in support of his facial challenge to the protocol.  Then, \"[a]s an alternative and independent ground,\" ibid., the Court of Appeals found that the firing squad is not an available alternative because that method is \"beyond [the Department of Corrections'] statutory authority,\" id., at 1320.  Finally, and as yet another independent ground for denying relief, the court held Arthur's motion regarding the firing squad barred by the doctrine of laches.  Ibid., n.\u00a035.  According to the Eleventh Circuit, the \"known and available\" alternative requirement was made clear in Baze--not Glossip--and because Arthur failed to amend his complaint in 2008 when Baze was decided, his claim was barred by laches.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the day of his scheduled execution, Arthur filed a petition for certiorari and an application to stay his execution.  The Court granted the stay, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), but now denies certiorari.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision below permits a State, by statute, to bar a death-row inmate from vindicating a right guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment.  Under this view, even if a prisoner can prove that the State plans to kill him in an intolerably cruel manner, and even if he can prove that there is a feasible alternative, all a State has to do to execute him through an unconstitutional method is to pass a statute declining to authorize any alternative method.  This cannot be right.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, it contradicts the very decisions it purports to follow--Baze and Glossip.  Glossip based its \"known and available alternative\" requirement on the plurality opinion in Baze.  Baze, in turn, states that \"[t]o qualify, the alternative procedure must be feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.\"  553 U.\u00a0S., at 52 (plurality opinion).  The Court did not mention--or even imply--that a State must authorize the alternative by statute.  To the contrary, Baze held that \"[i]f a State refuses to adopt such an alternative in the face of these documented advantages,\" its \"refusal to change its method can be viewed as 'cruel and unusual' under the Eighth Amendment.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  The decision below turns this language on its head, holding that if the State refuses to adopt the alternative legislatively, the inquiry ends.  That is an alarming misreading of Baze.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even more troubling, by conditioning federal constitutional rights on the operation of state statutes, the decision below contravenes basic constitutional principles.  The Constitution is the \"supreme law of the land\"--irrespective of contrary state laws.  Art. VI, cl. 2.  And for more than two centuries it has been axiomatic that this Court--not state courts or legislatures--is the final arbiter of the Federal Constitution.  See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  Acting within our exclusive \"province and duty\" to \"say what the law is,\" ibid., we have interpreted the Eighth Amendment to entitle prisoners to relief when they succeed in proving that a State's chosen method of execution poses a substantial risk of severe pain and that a constitutional alternative is \"known and available,\" Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 1-2).  The States have no power to override this constitutional guarantee.  While States are free to define and punish crimes, \"state laws respecting crimes, punishments, and criminal procedure are .\u00a0.\u00a0. subject to the overriding provisions of the United States Constitution.\"  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808, 824 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equally untenable are the differing interpretations of the Eighth Amendment that would result from the Eleventh Circuit's rule.  Under the Eleventh Circuit's view, whether an inmate who will die in an intolerably cruel manner can obtain relief under Glossip depends not on the Constitution but on vagaries of state law.  The outcome of this case, for instance, would turn on whether Arthur had been sentenced in Oklahoma, where state law expressly permits the firing squad, see Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, \u00a71014 (Supp. 2016), rather than in Alabama, which--according to the Eleventh Circuit3--does not, see Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1.  But since the very beginning of our Nation, we have emphasized the \"necessity of uniformity\" in constitutional interpretation \"throughout the whole United States, upon all subjects within the purview of the constitution.\"  Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat 304, 347-348 (1816) (emphasis deleted).  Nowhere is the need for uniformity more pressing than the rules governing States' imposition of death.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit's alternative holdings are unavailing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the court erroneously concluded that Arthur failed to carry his burden on the first Glossip requirement--proving that Alabama's midazolam-centered protocol poses a substantial risk of severe pain.  The court used the District Court's finding that Arthur failed to meet this prong with respect to his as-applied challenge to hold that Arthur's facial challenge likewise failed.  But it is undisputed that Arthur put forth \"impressive\" evidence to support his facial challenge that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals considered.  This evidence included the expert testimony of Dr. Alan Kaye, chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at Louisiana State University's Health Sciences Center, who found the dose of midazolam prescribed in Alabama's protocol insufficient to \"cure .\u00a0.\u00a0. the fundamental unsuitability of midazolam as the first drug in [Alabama's lethal-injection] protocol.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 302a (emphasis added).  Dr. Kaye concluded that \"the chemical properties of midazolam limit its ability to depress electrical activity in the brain. The lack of another chemical property--analgesia--renders midazolam incapable of maintaining even that limited level of depressed electrical activity under the undiminished pain of the second and third lethal injection drugs.\"  Id., at 311a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court next read Glossip as categorically \"uph[olding] the midazolam-based execution protocol.\"  840 F.\u00a03d, at 1315.  Glossip did no such thing.  The majority opinion in Glossip concluded that, based on the facts presented in that case, \"[t]he District Court did not commit clear error when it found that midazolam is highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain during an execution.\"  576 U.\u00a0S., at ____ (slip op., at 16).  The opinion made no determination whether midazolam-centered lethal injection represents a constitutional method of execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the court's laches finding faults Arthur for failing to act immediately after Baze, which, according to the panel, \"made clear in 2008 .\u00a0.\u00a0. that a petitioner-inmate had the burden to show that a proffered alternative was 'feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduced a substantial risk of pain.'\u00a0\"  840 F.\u00a03d, at 1320, n.\u00a035 (quoting Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 41).  But the District Court in this case--not to mention at least four Justices of this Court, see Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 24-27)--did not read Baze as requiring an alternative.  See Record in Arthur v. Myers, No. 2:11-cv-438 (MD Ala.), Doc. 195, p. 11 (\"[T]he court does not accept the State's argument that [a known and available alternative method of execution] is a specific pleading requirement set forth by Baze that must be properly alleged before a case can survive a motion to dismiss\").  Arthur filed a statement within 14 days of our decision in Glossip informing the District Court of his belief that our decision would impact his case, see id., Doc. 245, and moved to amend his complaint a few weeks later, see id., Doc. 256.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the Eleventh Circuit's opinion rests on quicksand foundations and flouts the Constitution, as well as the Court's decisions in Baze and Glossip.  These errors alone counsel in favor of certiorari.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision below is all the more troubling because it would put an end to an ongoing national conversation--between the legislatures and the courts--around the methods of execution the Constitution tolerates.  The meaning of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments \"is determined not by the standards that prevailed when the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791\" but instead derives from \"\u00a0'the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.'\u00a0\"  Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.\u00a0S. 407, 419 (2008) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.\u00a0S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).  Evolving standards have yielded a familiar cycle: States develop a method of execution, which is generally accepted for a time.  Science then reveals that--unknown to the previous generation--the States' chosen method of execution causes unconstitutional levels of suffering.  A new method of execution is devised, and the dialogue continues.  The Eighth Amendment requires this conversation.  States should not be permitted to silence it by statute.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the time of the founding until the early 20th century, hanging was the preferred practice.  Gardner, Executions and Indignities--An Eighth Amendment Assessment of Methods of Inflicting Capital Punishment, 39 Ohio St. L.\u00a0 J. 96, 119 (1978).  After several grotesque failures at the gallows--including slow asphyxiation and violent decapitation--revealed the \"crude and imprecise\" nature of the practice, Campbell v. Wood, 511 U.\u00a0S. 1119, 1122 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), States sought to execute condemned prisoners \"\u00a0'in a less barbarous manner'\u00a0\" and settled on electrocution.  See In re Kemmler, 136 U.\u00a0S. 436, 444 (1890).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York carried out the world's first electrocution in ghastly fashion,4 leading the New York Times to declare it \"a disgrace to civilization.\"  See Far Worse Than Hanging, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Aug. 7, 1890, p.\u00a01.  Electrocution nonetheless remained the dominant mode of execution for more than a century, until the specter of charred and grossly disfigured bodies proved too much for the public, and the courts, to bear.5  See, e.g., Dawson v. State, 274 Ga. 327, 335, 554 S.\u00a0E. 2d 137, 144 (2001) (\"[W]e hold that death by electrocution, with its specter of excruciating pain and its certainty of cooked brains and blistered bodies, violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The States then tried lethal gas.  Although the gas chamber was initially believed to produce relatively painless death, it ultimately became clear that it exacted \"exquisitely painful\" sensations of \"anxiety, panic, [and] terror,\" leading courts to declare it unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Fierro v. Gomez, 77 F. 3d 301, 308 (CA9 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, States turned to a \"more humane and palatable\" method of execution: lethal injection.  Denno, 63 Ohio St. L.\u00a0J., at 92.  Texas performed the first lethal injection in 1982 and, impressed with the apparent ease of the process, other States quickly followed suit.  S. Banner, The Death Penalty: An American History 297 (2002).  One prison chaplain marveled: \"\u00a0'It's extremely sanitary.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  The guy just goes to sleep.  That's all there is to it.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  What cruel irony that the method that appears most humane may turn out to be our most cruel experiment yet.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Science and experience are now revealing that, at least with respect to midazolam-centered protocols, prisoners executed by lethal injection are suffering horrifying deaths beneath a \"medically sterile aura of peace.\"  Denno, supra, at 66.  Even if we sweep aside the scientific evidence, we should not blind ourselves to the mounting firsthand evidence that midazolam is simply unable to render prisoners insensate to the pain of execution.  The examples abound.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After Ohio administered midazolam during the execution of Dennis McGuire in January 2014, he \"strained against the restraints around his body, and .\u00a0.\u00a0. repeatedly gasped for air, making snorting and choking sounds for about 10 minutes.\"  Johnson, Inmate's Death Called 'Horrific', Columbus Dispatch, Jan. 17, 2014, pp. A1, A10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scene was much the same during Oklahoma's  execution of Clayton Lockett in April 2014.  After executioners administered midazolam and declared him unconscious, Lockett began to writhe against his restraints, saying, \"[t]his s*** is f***ing with my mind,\" \"something is wrong,\" and \"[t]he drugs aren't working.\"  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Arizona executed Joseph Rudolph Wood in July 2014 using a midazolam-based protocol, he \"gulped like a fish on land.\"  Kiefer, Botched Execution, Arizona Dispatch, July 24, 2014, pp. A1, A9.  A witness reported more than 640 gasps as Woods convulsed on the gurney for more than an hour and a half before being declared dead.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, and just over a month after this Court stayed Thomas Arthur's execution, Alabama executed Ronald Bert Smith.  Following the dose of midazolam, Smith \"clenched his fist\" and was \"apparently struggling for breath as he heaved and coughed for about 13 minutes.\"  Berman & Barnes, Alabama Inmate was Heaving, Coughing During Lethal-Injection Execution, Washington Post, Dec. 10, 2016, p. A3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may well be that as originally designed, lethal injection can be carried out in a humane fashion that comports with the Eighth Amendment.  But our lived experience belies any suggestion that midazolam reliably renders prisoners entirely unconscious to the searing pain of the latter two drugs.  These accounts are especially terrifying considering that each of these men received doses of powerful paralytic agents, which likely masked the full extent of their pain.  Like a hangman's poorly tied noose or a malfunctioning electric chair, midazolam might render our latest method of execution too much for our conscience--and the Constitution--to bear.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an alternative to death by midazolam, Thomas Arthur has proposed death by firing squad.  Some might find this choice regressive, but the available evidence suggests \"that a competently performed shooting may cause nearly instant death.\"  Denno, Is Electrocution An Unconstitutional Method of Execution? The Engineering of Death Over the Century, 35 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 551, 688 (1994).  In addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless.  See Banner, supra, at 203.  And historically, the firing squad has yielded significantly fewer botched executions.  See A. Sarat, Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America's Death Penalty, App. A, p. 177 (2014) (calculating that while 7.12% of the 1,054 executions by lethal injection between 1900 and 2010 were \"botched,\" none of the 34 executions by firing squad had been).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Warren famously wrote that \"[t]he basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man.\"  Trop, 356 U.\u00a0S., at 100 (plurality opinion).  States have designed lethal-injection protocols with a view toward protecting their own dignity, but they should not be permitted to shield the true horror of executions from official and public view.  Condemned prisoners, like Arthur, might find more dignity in an instantaneous death rather than prolonged torture on a medical gurney.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be clear, this is not a matter of permitting inmates to choose the manner of death that best suits their desires.  It is a matter of permitting a death row inmate to make the showing Glossip requires in order to prove that the Constitution demands something less cruel and less unusual than what the State has offered.  Having met the challenge set forth in Glossip, Arthur deserves the opportunity to have his claim fairly reviewed in court.  The Eleventh Circuit denied him this opportunity, and in doing so, thwarted the Court's decision in Glossip, as well as basic constitutional principles.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twice in recent years, this Court has observed that it \"has never invalidated a State's chosen procedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.\"  Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 48 (plurality opinion); Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (same).  In Glossip, the majority opinion remarked that the Court \"did not retreat\" from this nonintervention strategy even after Louisiana strapped a 17-year-old boy to its electric chair and, having failed to kill him the first time, argued for a second try--which this Court permitted.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 3-4).  We should not be proud of this history.  Nor should we rely on it to excuse our current inaction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dissent.\n\n\nTHOMAS D. ARTHUR v. JEFFERSON S. DUNN, COMMISSIONER, ALABAMA DEPARTMENT  OF CORRECTIONS, et\u00a0al.\non petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit\nNo. 16-602.\u2003Decided February 21, 2017\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The motion of Certain Medical Professionals and Medical Ethicists for leave to file a brief as amici curiae is granted.  The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, with whom Justice Breyer joins, dissenting from the denial of certiorari.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nearly two years ago in Glossip v. Gross, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2015), the Court issued a macabre challenge.  In order to successfully attack a State's method of execution as cruel and unusual under the Eighth Amendment, a condemned prisoner must not only prove that the State's chosen method risks severe pain, but must also propose a \"known and available\" alternative method for his own execution.  Id., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 13, 15).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Thomas Arthur, a prisoner on Alabama's death row, has met this challenge.  He has amassed significant evidence that Alabama's current lethal-injection protocol will result in intolerable and needless agony, and he has proposed an alternative--death by firing squad.  The Court of Appeals, without considering any of the evidence regarding the risk posed by the current protocol, denied Arthur's claim because Alabama law does not expressly permit execution by firing squad, and so it cannot be a \"known and available\" alternative under Glossip.  Because this decision permits States to immunize their methods of execution--no matter how cruel or how unusual--from judicial review and thus permits state law to subvert the Federal Constitution, I would grant certiorari and reverse.  I dissent from my colleagues' decision not to do so.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Execution by lethal injection is generally accomplished through serial administration of three drugs.  First, a fast-acting sedative such as sodium thiopental induces \"a deep, comalike unconsciousness.\"  Baze v. Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35, 44 (2008) (plurality opinion).  Second, a paralytic agent--most often pancuronium bromide--\"inhibits all muscular-skeletal movements and, by paralyzing the diaphragm, stops respiration.\"  Ibid.  Third, potassium chloride induces fatal cardiac arrest.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first drug is critical; without it, the prisoner faces the unadulterated agony of the second and third drugs.  The second drug causes \"an extremely painful sensation of crushing and suffocation,\" see Denno, When Legislatures Delegate Death: The Troubling Paradox Behind State Uses of Electrocution and Lethal Injection and What It Says About Us, 63 Ohio St. L.\u00a0J. 63, 109, n.\u00a0321 (2002); but paralyzes the prisoner so as to \"mas[k] any outward sign of distress,\" thus serving States'  interest \"\u00a0'in preserving the dignity of the procedure,'\u00a0\" Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 71, 73 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  And the third drug causes an \"excruciating burning sensation\" that is \"equivalent to the sensation of a hot poker being inserted into the arm\" and traveling \"with the chemical up the prisoner's arm and .\u00a0.\u00a0. across his chest until it reaches his heart.\"  Denno, supra, at 109, n.\u00a0321.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Execution absent an adequate sedative thus produces a nightmarish death: The condemned prisoner is conscious but entirely paralyzed, unable to move or scream his agony, as he suffers \"what may well be the chemical equivalent of being burned at the stake.\"  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 2).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For many years, the barbiturate sodium thiopental seemed up to this task.1  In 2009, however, the sole American manufacturer of sodium thiopental suspended domestic production and later left the market altogether.  Id., at ___-___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 4-5).  States then began to use another barbiturate, pentobarbital.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  But in 2013, it also became unavailable.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 5-6).  Only then did States turn to midazolam, the drug at the center of this case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Midazolam, like Valium and Xanax, belongs to a class of medicines known as benzodiazepines and has some anesthetic effect.  Id., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5).  Generally, anesthetics can cause a level of sedation and depression of electrical brain activity sufficient to block all sensation, including pain.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 283a-290a.  But it is not clear that midazolam adequately serves this purpose.  This is because midazolam, unlike barbiturates such as pentobarbital, has no analgesic--pain-relieving--effects.  Id., at 307a; see also Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5).  Thus, \"for midazolam to maintain unconsciousness through application of a particular stimulus, it would need to depress electrical activity to a deeper level than would be required of, for example, pentobarbital.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 307a.2  Although it can be used to render individuals unconscious, midazolam is not used on its own to maintain anesthesia--complete obliviousness to physical sensation--in surgical procedures, and indeed, the Food and Drug Administration has not approved the drug for this purpose.  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like the experts in Glossip, the experts in this case agree that midazolam is subject to a ceiling effect, which means that there is a point at which increasing the dose of the drug does not result in any greater effect.  Ibid.  The main dispute with respect to midazolam relates to how this ceiling effect operates--if the ceiling on midazolam's sedative effect is reached before complete unconsciousness can be achieved, it may be incapable of keeping individuals insensate to the extreme pain and discomfort associated with administration of the second and third drugs in lethal-injection protocols.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After the horrific execution of Clayton Lockett, who, notwithstanding administration of midazolam, awoke during his execution and appeared to be in great pain, we agreed to hear the case of death row inmates seeking to avoid the same fate.  In Glossip, these inmates alleged that because midazolam is incapable of rendering prisoners unconscious and insensate to pain during lethal injection, Oklahoma's intended use of the drug in their executions would violate the Eighth Amendment.  The Court rejected this claim for two reasons.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court found that the District Court had not clearly erred in determining that \"midazolam is highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain during an execution.\"  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 16).  Second, the Court held that the petitioners had failed to satisfy the novel requirement of pleading and proving a \"known and available alternative\" method of execution.  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Post-Glossip, in order to prevail in an Eighth Amendment challenge to a State's method of execution, prisoners first must prove the State's current method \"entails a substantial risk of severe pain,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 2), and second, must \"identify a known and available alternative method of execution that entails a lesser risk of pain,\" id., at ___ (slip op., at 1).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case centers on whether Thomas Arthur has met these requirements with respect to Alabama's lethal-injection protocol.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alabama adopted lethal injection as its default method of execution in 2002.  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1(a) (2011); see also Ex parte Borden, 60 So.\u00a03d 940, 941 (Ala. 2007).  The State's capital punishment statute delegates the task of prescribing the drugs necessary to compound a lethal injection to the Department of Corrections.  \u00a715-18-82.1(f\u00a0).  Consistent with the practice in other States following the national shortage of sodium thiopental and pentobarbital, the department has adopted a protocol involving the same three drugs considered in Glossip.  See Brooks v. Warden, 810 F.\u00a03d 812, 823 (CA11 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps anticipating constitutional challenges, Alabama's legislature enacted a contingency plan: The statute provides that \"[i]f electrocution or lethal injection is held to be unconstitutional .\u00a0.\u00a0. all persons sentenced to death for a capital crime shall be executed by any constitutional method of execution.\"  \u00a715-18-82.1(c).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thomas Douglas Arthur killed his paramour's husband in 1982.  840 F. 3d 1268, 1272-1273 (CA11 2016).  Over the next decade, two juries found Arthur guilty of murder, and each time, Arthur's conviction was overturned on appeal.  Ibid.  After a third trial in 1992, Arthur was convicted and sentenced to death.  Ibid.  Since then, Arthur has been scheduled to die on six separate occasions, and each time, his execution was stayed.  Id., at 1275, n.\u00a02.  After 34 years of legal challenges, Arthur has accepted that he will die for his crimes.  He now challenges only how the State will be permitted to kill him.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arthur asserted two distinct claims in the District Court.  First, Arthur asserted a facial challenge, arguing that midazolam is generally incapable of performing as intended during Alabama's three-drug lethal-injection procedure.  Second, Arthur asserted an as-applied challenge, arguing that because of his individual health attributes, midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain for him during the procedure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court considered these two claims separately.  With respect to the facial challenge, the District Court ordered bifurcated proceedings, with the first hearing limited to the availability of a feasible alternative method of execution.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 189a, and n.\u00a02.  Arthur's initial complaint proposed a single dose either of pentobarbital or sodium thiopental rather than a three-drug protocol, but the District Court found that those methods were unavailable given the elimination of both drugs from the domestic market.  Id., at 203a-205a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Arthur then moved to amend his complaint to allege the firing squad as an alternative method of execution.  The District Court denied the motion, holding that \"execution by firing squad is not permitted by statute and, therefore, is not a method of execution that could be considered either feasible or readily implemented by Alabama at this time.\"  Id., at 241a.  Because Arthur's claim failed on this ground, the court never considered Arthur's evidence with respect to midazolam, despite later observing that it was \"impressive.\"  Id., at 166a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a separate order, the District Court considered Arthur's as-applied challenge.  Arthur alleged, based on the expert opinion of Dr. Jack Strader, that \"his cardiovascular issues, combined with his age and emotional makeup, create a constitutionally unacceptable risk of pain that will result in a violation of the Eighth Amendment if he is executed under the [midazolam] protocol.\"  Id., at 151a.  Echoing its rationale with respect to Arthur's facial challenge, the District Court found that Arthur failed to prove the existence of a feasible, readily available alternative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court then turned to the question it had avoided in the facial challenge: whether Alabama's lethal-injection protocol created a risk of serious illness or needless suffering.  But because the District Court considered the question as part of Arthur's as-applied challenge, it focused on the protocol as applied to Arthur's personal physical condition.  The court rejected Dr. Strader's opinion that the dose of midazolam required by Alabama's protocol \"will likely induce a rapid and dangerous reduction in blood pressure more quickly than it results in sedation,\" and that during this time gap, Arthur--whom he believed to suffer from heart disease--would suffer a painful heart attack.  Id., at 169a.  Because Dr. Strader's experience was limited to clinical doses of midazolam, which typically range from 2 to 5 mg, the court concluded that he had no basis to extrapolate his experience to non-clinical, lethal doses, such as the 500-mg bolus required by Alabama's lethal-injection protocol.  Id., at 177a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court expressly refused to consider the expert opinions that Arthur proffered as part of his facial challenge, noting that they \"are untested in court, due to Arthur's inability to provide a[n alternative] remedy in his facial, and now as-applied, challenges.\"  Id., at 167a, n.\u00a016.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court therefore concluded that Arthur failed to meet the Glossip standard and entered judgment in favor of the State.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 238a.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  In a 111-page slip opinion issued the day before Arthur's scheduled execution, the court first found that \"Arthur never showed Alabama's current lethal injection protocol, per se or as applied to him, violates the Constitution.\"  840 F.\u00a03d, at 1315.  The court based this finding on Arthur's failure to \"satisfy the first [Glossip] prong as to midazolam\" as part of his as-applied challenge, ibid., and the fact that this Court \"upheld the midazolam-based execution protocol\" in Glossip, 840 F.\u00a03d, at 1315.  Like the District Court, the Eleventh Circuit never considered the evidence Arthur introduced in support of his facial challenge to the protocol.  Then, \"[a]s an alternative and independent ground,\" ibid., the Court of Appeals found that the firing squad is not an available alternative because that method is \"beyond [the Department of Corrections'] statutory authority,\" id., at 1320.  Finally, and as yet another independent ground for denying relief, the court held Arthur's motion regarding the firing squad barred by the doctrine of laches.  Ibid., n.\u00a035.  According to the Eleventh Circuit, the \"known and available\" alternative requirement was made clear in Baze--not Glossip--and because Arthur failed to amend his complaint in 2008 when Baze was decided, his claim was barred by laches.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the day of his scheduled execution, Arthur filed a petition for certiorari and an application to stay his execution.  The Court granted the stay, 580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), but now denies certiorari.\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision below permits a State, by statute, to bar a death-row inmate from vindicating a right guaranteed by the Eighth Amendment.  Under this view, even if a prisoner can prove that the State plans to kill him in an intolerably cruel manner, and even if he can prove that there is a feasible alternative, all a State has to do to execute him through an unconstitutional method is to pass a statute declining to authorize any alternative method.  This cannot be right.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin with, it contradicts the very decisions it purports to follow--Baze and Glossip.  Glossip based its \"known and available alternative\" requirement on the plurality opinion in Baze.  Baze, in turn, states that \"[t]o qualify, the alternative procedure must be feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain.\"  553 U.\u00a0S., at 52 (plurality opinion).  The Court did not mention--or even imply--that a State must authorize the alternative by statute.  To the contrary, Baze held that \"[i]f a State refuses to adopt such an alternative in the face of these documented advantages,\" its \"refusal to change its method can be viewed as 'cruel and unusual' under the Eighth Amendment.\"  Ibid. (emphasis added).  The decision below turns this language on its head, holding that if the State refuses to adopt the alternative legislatively, the inquiry ends.  That is an alarming misreading of Baze.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even more troubling, by conditioning federal constitutional rights on the operation of state statutes, the decision below contravenes basic constitutional principles.  The Constitution is the \"supreme law of the land\"--irrespective of contrary state laws.  Art. VI, cl. 2.  And for more than two centuries it has been axiomatic that this Court--not state courts or legislatures--is the final arbiter of the Federal Constitution.  See Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  Acting within our exclusive \"province and duty\" to \"say what the law is,\" ibid., we have interpreted the Eighth Amendment to entitle prisoners to relief when they succeed in proving that a State's chosen method of execution poses a substantial risk of severe pain and that a constitutional alternative is \"known and available,\" Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 1-2).  The States have no power to override this constitutional guarantee.  While States are free to define and punish crimes, \"state laws respecting crimes, punishments, and criminal procedure are .\u00a0.\u00a0. subject to the overriding provisions of the United States Constitution.\"  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.\u00a0S. 808, 824 (1991).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Equally untenable are the differing interpretations of the Eighth Amendment that would result from the Eleventh Circuit's rule.  Under the Eleventh Circuit's view, whether an inmate who will die in an intolerably cruel manner can obtain relief under Glossip depends not on the Constitution but on vagaries of state law.  The outcome of this case, for instance, would turn on whether Arthur had been sentenced in Oklahoma, where state law expressly permits the firing squad, see Okla. Stat., Tit. 22, \u00a71014 (Supp. 2016), rather than in Alabama, which--according to the Eleventh Circuit3--does not, see Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1.  But since the very beginning of our Nation, we have emphasized the \"necessity of uniformity\" in constitutional interpretation \"throughout the whole United States, upon all subjects within the purview of the constitution.\"  Martin v. Hunter's Lessee, 1 Wheat 304, 347-348 (1816) (emphasis deleted).  Nowhere is the need for uniformity more pressing than the rules governing States' imposition of death.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Eleventh Circuit's alternative holdings are unavailing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the court erroneously concluded that Arthur failed to carry his burden on the first Glossip requirement--proving that Alabama's midazolam-centered protocol poses a substantial risk of severe pain.  The court used the District Court's finding that Arthur failed to meet this prong with respect to his as-applied challenge to hold that Arthur's facial challenge likewise failed.  But it is undisputed that Arthur put forth \"impressive\" evidence to support his facial challenge that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals considered.  This evidence included the expert testimony of Dr. Alan Kaye, chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at Louisiana State University's Health Sciences Center, who found the dose of midazolam prescribed in Alabama's protocol insufficient to \"cure .\u00a0.\u00a0. the fundamental unsuitability of midazolam as the first drug in [Alabama's lethal-injection] protocol.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 302a (emphasis added).  Dr. Kaye concluded that \"the chemical properties of midazolam limit its ability to depress electrical activity in the brain. The lack of another chemical property--analgesia--renders midazolam incapable of maintaining even that limited level of depressed electrical activity under the undiminished pain of the second and third lethal injection drugs.\"  Id., at 311a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The court next read Glossip as categorically \"uph[olding] the midazolam-based execution protocol.\"  840 F.\u00a03d, at 1315.  Glossip did no such thing.  The majority opinion in Glossip concluded that, based on the facts presented in that case, \"[t]he District Court did not commit clear error when it found that midazolam is highly likely to render a person unable to feel pain during an execution.\"  576 U.\u00a0S., at ____ (slip op., at 16).  The opinion made no determination whether midazolam-centered lethal injection represents a constitutional method of execution.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the court's laches finding faults Arthur for failing to act immediately after Baze, which, according to the panel, \"made clear in 2008 .\u00a0.\u00a0. that a petitioner-inmate had the burden to show that a proffered alternative was 'feasible, readily implemented, and in fact significantly reduced a substantial risk of pain.'\u00a0\"  840 F.\u00a03d, at 1320, n.\u00a035 (quoting Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 41).  But the District Court in this case--not to mention at least four Justices of this Court, see Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___-___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 24-27)--did not read Baze as requiring an alternative.  See Record in Arthur v. Myers, No. 2:11-cv-438 (MD Ala.), Doc. 195, p. 11 (\"[T]he court does not accept the State's argument that [a known and available alternative method of execution] is a specific pleading requirement set forth by Baze that must be properly alleged before a case can survive a motion to dismiss\").  Arthur filed a statement within 14 days of our decision in Glossip informing the District Court of his belief that our decision would impact his case, see id., Doc. 245, and moved to amend his complaint a few weeks later, see id., Doc. 256.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, the Eleventh Circuit's opinion rests on quicksand foundations and flouts the Constitution, as well as the Court's decisions in Baze and Glossip.  These errors alone counsel in favor of certiorari.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision below is all the more troubling because it would put an end to an ongoing national conversation--between the legislatures and the courts--around the methods of execution the Constitution tolerates.  The meaning of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments \"is determined not by the standards that prevailed when the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791\" but instead derives from \"\u00a0'the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.'\u00a0\"  Kennedy v. Louisiana, 554 U.\u00a0S. 407, 419 (2008) (quoting Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.\u00a0S. 86, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion)).  Evolving standards have yielded a familiar cycle: States develop a method of execution, which is generally accepted for a time.  Science then reveals that--unknown to the previous generation--the States' chosen method of execution causes unconstitutional levels of suffering.  A new method of execution is devised, and the dialogue continues.  The Eighth Amendment requires this conversation.  States should not be permitted to silence it by statute.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0From the time of the founding until the early 20th century, hanging was the preferred practice.  Gardner, Executions and Indignities--An Eighth Amendment Assessment of Methods of Inflicting Capital Punishment, 39 Ohio St. L.\u00a0 J. 96, 119 (1978).  After several grotesque failures at the gallows--including slow asphyxiation and violent decapitation--revealed the \"crude and imprecise\" nature of the practice, Campbell v. Wood, 511 U.\u00a0S. 1119, 1122 (1994) (Blackmun, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari), States sought to execute condemned prisoners \"\u00a0'in a less barbarous manner'\u00a0\" and settled on electrocution.  See In re Kemmler, 136 U.\u00a0S. 436, 444 (1890).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0New York carried out the world's first electrocution in ghastly fashion,4 leading the New York Times to declare it \"a disgrace to civilization.\"  See Far Worse Than Hanging, N.\u00a0Y. Times, Aug. 7, 1890, p.\u00a01.  Electrocution nonetheless remained the dominant mode of execution for more than a century, until the specter of charred and grossly disfigured bodies proved too much for the public, and the courts, to bear.5  See, e.g., Dawson v. State, 274 Ga. 327, 335, 554 S.\u00a0E. 2d 137, 144 (2001) (\"[W]e hold that death by electrocution, with its specter of excruciating pain and its certainty of cooked brains and blistered bodies, violates the prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The States then tried lethal gas.  Although the gas chamber was initially believed to produce relatively painless death, it ultimately became clear that it exacted \"exquisitely painful\" sensations of \"anxiety, panic, [and] terror,\" leading courts to declare it unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Fierro v. Gomez, 77 F. 3d 301, 308 (CA9 1996) (internal quotation marks omitted).6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, States turned to a \"more humane and palatable\" method of execution: lethal injection.  Denno, 63 Ohio St. L.\u00a0J., at 92.  Texas performed the first lethal injection in 1982 and, impressed with the apparent ease of the process, other States quickly followed suit.  S. Banner, The Death Penalty: An American History 297 (2002).  One prison chaplain marveled: \"\u00a0'It's extremely sanitary.\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  The guy just goes to sleep.  That's all there is to it.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.  What cruel irony that the method that appears most humane may turn out to be our most cruel experiment yet.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Science and experience are now revealing that, at least with respect to midazolam-centered protocols, prisoners executed by lethal injection are suffering horrifying deaths beneath a \"medically sterile aura of peace.\"  Denno, supra, at 66.  Even if we sweep aside the scientific evidence, we should not blind ourselves to the mounting firsthand evidence that midazolam is simply unable to render prisoners insensate to the pain of execution.  The examples abound.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After Ohio administered midazolam during the execution of Dennis McGuire in January 2014, he \"strained against the restraints around his body, and .\u00a0.\u00a0. repeatedly gasped for air, making snorting and choking sounds for about 10 minutes.\"  Johnson, Inmate's Death Called 'Horrific', Columbus Dispatch, Jan. 17, 2014, pp. A1, A10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The scene was much the same during Oklahoma's  execution of Clayton Lockett in April 2014.  After executioners administered midazolam and declared him unconscious, Lockett began to writhe against his restraints, saying, \"[t]his s*** is f***ing with my mind,\" \"something is wrong,\" and \"[t]he drugs aren't working.\"  Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When Arizona executed Joseph Rudolph Wood in July 2014 using a midazolam-based protocol, he \"gulped like a fish on land.\"  Kiefer, Botched Execution, Arizona Dispatch, July 24, 2014, pp. A1, A9.  A witness reported more than 640 gasps as Woods convulsed on the gurney for more than an hour and a half before being declared dead.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, and just over a month after this Court stayed Thomas Arthur's execution, Alabama executed Ronald Bert Smith.  Following the dose of midazolam, Smith \"clenched his fist\" and was \"apparently struggling for breath as he heaved and coughed for about 13 minutes.\"  Berman & Barnes, Alabama Inmate was Heaving, Coughing During Lethal-Injection Execution, Washington Post, Dec. 10, 2016, p. A3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It may well be that as originally designed, lethal injection can be carried out in a humane fashion that comports with the Eighth Amendment.  But our lived experience belies any suggestion that midazolam reliably renders prisoners entirely unconscious to the searing pain of the latter two drugs.  These accounts are especially terrifying considering that each of these men received doses of powerful paralytic agents, which likely masked the full extent of their pain.  Like a hangman's poorly tied noose or a malfunctioning electric chair, midazolam might render our latest method of execution too much for our conscience--and the Constitution--to bear.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As an alternative to death by midazolam, Thomas Arthur has proposed death by firing squad.  Some might find this choice regressive, but the available evidence suggests \"that a competently performed shooting may cause nearly instant death.\"  Denno, Is Electrocution An Unconstitutional Method of Execution? The Engineering of Death Over the Century, 35 Wm. & Mary L. Rev. 551, 688 (1994).  In addition to being near instant, death by shooting may also be comparatively painless.  See Banner, supra, at 203.  And historically, the firing squad has yielded significantly fewer botched executions.  See A. Sarat, Gruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America's Death Penalty, App. A, p. 177 (2014) (calculating that while 7.12% of the 1,054 executions by lethal injection between 1900 and 2010 were \"botched,\" none of the 34 executions by firing squad had been).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Warren famously wrote that \"[t]he basic concept underlying the Eighth Amendment is nothing less than the dignity of man.\"  Trop, 356 U.\u00a0S., at 100 (plurality opinion).  States have designed lethal-injection protocols with a view toward protecting their own dignity, but they should not be permitted to shield the true horror of executions from official and public view.  Condemned prisoners, like Arthur, might find more dignity in an instantaneous death rather than prolonged torture on a medical gurney.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be clear, this is not a matter of permitting inmates to choose the manner of death that best suits their desires.  It is a matter of permitting a death row inmate to make the showing Glossip requires in order to prove that the Constitution demands something less cruel and less unusual than what the State has offered.  Having met the challenge set forth in Glossip, Arthur deserves the opportunity to have his claim fairly reviewed in court.  The Eleventh Circuit denied him this opportunity, and in doing so, thwarted the Court's decision in Glossip, as well as basic constitutional principles.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Twice in recent years, this Court has observed that it \"has never invalidated a State's chosen procedure for carrying out a sentence of death as the infliction of cruel and unusual punishment.\"  Baze, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 48 (plurality opinion); Glossip, 576 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3) (same).  In Glossip, the majority opinion remarked that the Court \"did not retreat\" from this nonintervention strategy even after Louisiana strapped a 17-year-old boy to its electric chair and, having failed to kill him the first time, argued for a second try--which this Court permitted.  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 3-4).  We should not be proud of this history.  Nor should we rely on it to excuse our current inaction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0We examined the constitutionality of lethal injection in Baze v. Rees, 553 U.\u00a0S. 35 (2008).  There, the parties did not dispute that \"proper administration of .\u00a0.\u00a0. sodium thiopental .\u00a0.\u00a0. eliminates any meaningful risk that a prisoner would experience pain\" and results in a humane death.  Id., at 49 (plurality opinion).  The petitioners nonetheless challenged Kentucky's three-drug protocol on the ground that, if prison executioners failed to follow the mandated procedures, an unconstitutional risk of significant pain would result.  Ibid.  A plurality of the Court concluded that \"petitioners ha[d] not carried their burden of showing that the risk of pain from maladministration of a concededly humane lethal injection protocol\" would violate the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishments.  Id., at 41.\nFootnote 2\u00a0 Because \"midazolam is not an analgesic drug, any painful stimulus applied to an inmate will generate and transmit full intensity pain signals to the brain without interference.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert.  309a.  Arthur's expert witness provides \"a rough analogy\":\n\"[\u00a0I\u00a0]f being sedated is like being asleep, analgesia is like wearing earplugs. If two people are sleeping equally deeply, but only one is wearing earplugs, it will be much easier to shout and wake the person who is not wearing earplugs. If two people are sedated to equivalent levels of electrical brain activity, but only one has analgesia, the person sedated without analgesia will be much more easily aroused to consciousness by the application of pain.\"  Ibid.\nFootnote 3\u00a0I question the Eleventh Circuit's conclusion that the statute does not authorize the firing squad as an available means of execution.  In my view, the Alabama statute unambiguously reads as a codification of Glossip.  If either of the specified methods--lethal injection or electrocution--is declared unconstitutional, the statute authorizes the State to execute prisoners by \"any constitutional method of execution.\"  Ala. Code \u00a715-18-82.1(c) (2016) (emphasis added).  The state statute thus permits exactly what the Court required in Glossip--if a condemned prisoner can prove that the lethal-injection protocol presents an unconstitutional risk of needless suffering, he may propose an alternative, constitutional means of execution, which may include the firing squad.  Even assuming, however, that the Eleventh Circuit properly interpreted Alabama's statute, the question remains whether States may legislatively determine what the Eighth Amendment requires or prohibits.  That question is worthy of our review.\nFootnote 4\u00a0New York executed William Kemmler on August 6, 1890.

The current could be heard sharply snapping.  Blood began to appear on the face of the wretch in the chair.

(paragraph break omitted).\nFootnote 5\u00a0After a particularly gruesome electrocution in Florida, this Court granted certiorari on the question whether electrocution creates a constitutionally unacceptable risk of physical suffering in violation of the Eighth Amendment, see Bryan v. Moore, 528 U.\u00a0S. 960 (1999), but later dismissed the writ as improvidently granted in light of an amendment to the State's execution statute that permitted prisoners to choose lethal injection rather than electrocution, see Bryan v.

Ann. \u00a7922.10 (West 2001).\nFootnote 6\u00a0This Court granted certiorari in Fierro, vacated the judgment, and remanded for consideration in light of the California Legislature's adoption of lethal injection as the State's primary method of execution.

LAROE ESTATES, INC.(2017)\nNo. 16-605\nArgued: April 17, 2017Decided: June 5, 2017\n\n\nLand developer Steven Sherman paid $2.7 million to purchase land in the town of Chester (Town) for a housing subdivision.  He also sought the Town's approval of his development plan.  About a decade later, he filed this suit in New York state court, claiming that the Town had obstructed his plans for the subdivision, forcing him to spend around $5.5 million to comply with its demands and driving him to the brink of personal bankruptcy.  Sherman asserted, among other claims, a regulatory takings claim under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The Town removed the case to a Federal District Court, which dismissed the takings claim as unripe.  The Second Circuit reversed that determination and remanded for the case to go forward.  On remand, real estate development company Laroe Estates, Inc. (respondent here), filed a motion to intervene of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2), which requires a court to permit intervention by a litigant that \"claims an interest related to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.\"  Laroe alleged that it had paid Sherman more than $2.5 million in relation to the development project and the subject property, that its resulting equitable interest in the property would be impaired if it could not intervene, and that Sherman would not adequately represent its interest.  Laroe filed, inter alia, an intervenor's complaint asserting a regulatory takings claim that was substantively identical to Sherman's and seeking a judgment awarding Laroe compensation for the taking of Laroe's interest in the property at issue.  The District Court denied Laroe's motion to intervene, concluding that its equitable interest did not confer standing.  The Second Circuit reversed, holding that an intervenor of right is not required to meet Article III's standing requirements.\nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0A litigant seeking to intervene as of right under Rule 24(a)(2) must meet the requirements of Article III standing if the intervenor wishes to pursue relief not requested by a plaintiff.  To establish Article III standing, a plaintiff seeking compensatory relief must have \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___.  The \"\u00a0plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\"  Davis v. Federal Election Comm'n, 554 U.\u00a0S. 724, 734 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same principle applies when there are multiple plaintiffs: At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.  That principle also applies to intervenors of right: For all relief sought, there must be a litigant with standing, whether that litigant joins the lawsuit as a plaintiff, a  coplaintiff, or an intervenor of right.  Thus, at the least, an intervenor of right must demonstrate Article III standing when it seeks additional relief beyond that requested by the plaintiff.  That includes cases in which both the plaintiff and the intervenor seek separate money judgments in their own names.  Pp.\u00a04-6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0The Court of Appeals is to address on remand the question whether Laroe seeks different relief than Sherman.  If Laroe wants only a money judgment of its own running directly against the Town, then it seeks damages different from those sought by Sherman and must establish its own Article III standing in order to intervene.  The record is unclear on that point, and the Court of Appeals did not resolve that ambiguity.

The parties do not dispute--and we hold--that such an intervenor must meet the requirements of Article III if the intervenor wishes to pursue relief not requested by a plaintiff.  In the present case, it is unclear whether the intervenor seeks different relief, and the Court of Appeals did not resolve this threshold issue.  Accordingly, we vacate the judgment and remand for that court to determine whether the intervenor seeks such additional relief.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2001, land developer Steven Sherman paid $2.7 million to purchase nearly 400 acres of land in the town of Chester, New York (Town).  Sherman planned to build a housing subdivision called MareBrook, complete with 385 housing units, a golf course, an onsite restaurant, and other amenities.  Sherman applied for approval of his plan and thus began a \"journey through the Town's ever-changing labyrinth of red tape.\"  Sherman v. Chester, 752 F.\u00a03d 554, 557 (CA2 2014).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2012, Sherman filed this suit against the Town in New York state court.  The suit concerned \"the decade's worth of red tape put in place\" by the Town and its regulatory bodies.  Id., at 558.  According to Sherman, the Town obstructed his plans for the subdivision and forced him to spend around $5.5 million to comply with the Town's demands.  Id., at 558, 560.  All of this, Sherman claimed, left him financially exhausted and on the brink of personal bankruptcy.  Id., at 560.  Sherman brought nine federal- and state-law claims against the Town, including a regulatory takings claim under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  See App. 98-122.  The Town removed the case to a Federal District Court, which dismissed Sherman's takings claim as unripe.  Opinion and Order in No. 1:12-cv-00647 (SDNY), Dkt. 14, p. 25.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the ripeness determination and remanded for the case to go forward.  Chester, supra, at 557.1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On remand, real estate development company Laroe Estates, Inc. (the respondent here) filed a motion to intervene of right under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 24(a)(2).  This Rule requires a court to permit intervention by a litigant that \"claims an interest related to the property or transaction that is the subject of the action, and is so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede the movant's ability to protect its interest, unless existing parties adequately represent that interest.\"  Laroe alleged that in 2003 it had entered into an agreement with Sherman regarding the MareBrook property.  Under this agreement, Laroe was to make $6 million in payments to Sherman, secured by a mortgage on all of the development, and Sherman was to sell Laroe parcels of land within the proposed subdivision when the MareBrook plan was approved.  However, Laroe reserved the right to terminate the entire agreement if Sherman was unable to obtain Town approval for a sufficient number of lots.  While this agreement was in place and Sherman continued his futile quest for regulatory approval, Laroe paid Sherman more than $2.5 million.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2013, TD Bank commenced a foreclosure proceeding on Sherman's property.  In an effort to save the deal, Laroe and Sherman entered into a new agreement.  That agreement provided that the purchase price of the property would be the $2.5 million that Laroe had already advanced Sherman plus any amount Sherman had to pay to settle with TD Bank.  Once the Town approved the plan, Laroe was required to transfer a certain number of lots back to Sherman.  In addition to imposing this transfer obligation, the agreement deemed Laroe to have paid for the land in full.  Laroe was also given the authority to settle the debt Sherman owed TD Bank and to terminate the agreement if the settlement failed.  The settlement did fail, and TD Bank took over the property.  But Laroe never terminated its agreement with Sherman.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In support of its motion to intervene, Laroe argued that, under New York law, it is \"the equitable owner of the Real Property\" at issue in Sherman's suit.  App. 131, 135-139.  Laroe asserted that its status as equitable owner gave it an interest in the MareBrook property; that its interest would be impaired if it could not intervene; and that Sherman \"ha[d] his own agenda\" and consequently could not adequately represent Laroe's interest.  Id., at 143-145.  Along with its other intervention-related pleadings, Laroe filed an intervenor's complaint asserting a regulatory takings claim that was substantively identical to Sherman's.  Laroe's complaint sought, among other things, a \"judgment against [the Town] awarding [Laroe] damages,\" namely, \"compensation for the taking of Laroe's interest in the subject real property.\"  Id., at 162.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court denied Laroe's motion to intervene on the ground that Laroe lacked standing to bring a takings claim \"based on its status as contract vendee to the property.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.  The District Court interpreted Second Circuit precedent--specifically, United States Olympic Comm. v. Intelicense Corp., S.\u00a0A., 737 F.\u00a02d 263, 268 (1984)--to mean that Laroe's equitable interest did not confer standing.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 55a-56a.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals reversed.  828 F.\u00a03d 60, 62 (CA2 2016).  Acknowledging a division among the Courts of Appeals on whether an intervenor of right must meet the requirements of Article III, the Second Circuit sided with the courts that have held that Article III standing is not required.  Id., at 64-65.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Article III of the Constitution limits the exercise of the judicial power to \"Cases\" and \"Controversies.\"  \u00a72, cl. 1. This fundamental limitation preserves the \"tripartite structure\" of our Federal Government, prevents the Federal Judiciary from \"intrud[ing] upon the powers given to the other branches,\" and \"confines the federal courts to a properly judicial role.\"  Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 5-6).  \"If a dispute is not a proper case or controversy, the courts have no business deciding it, or expounding the law in the course of doing so.\"  DaimlerChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 547 U.\u00a0S. 332, 341 (2006).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Standing to sue is a doctrine rooted in the traditional understanding of a case or controversy.\"  Spokeo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6).  \"The law of Article III standing, which is built on separation-of-powers principles, serves to prevent the judicial process from being used to usurp the powers of the political branches.\"  Clapper v. Amnesty Int'l USA, 568 U.\u00a0S. 398, 408 (2013).  Our standing doctrine accomplishes this by requiring plaintiffs to \"alleg[e] such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy as to .\u00a0.\u00a0. justify [the] exercise of the court's remedial powers on [their] behalf.\"  Simon v. Eastern Ky. Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.\u00a0S. 26, 38 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).  To establish Article III standing, the plaintiff seeking compensatory relief must have \"(1) suffered an injury in fact, (2) that is fairly traceable to the challenged conduct of the defendant, and (3) that is likely to be redressed by a favorable judicial decision.\"  Spokeo, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 6).  \"Absent such a showing, exercise of its power by a federal court would be gratuitous and thus inconsistent with the Art.\u00a0III limitation.\"  Simon, supra, at 38.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Our standing decisions make clear that \"\u00a0'standing is not dispensed in gross.'\u00a0\"  Davis v. Federal Election Comm'n, 554 U.\u00a0S. 724, 734 (2008) (quoting Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.\u00a0S. 343, 358, n.\u00a06 (1996); alteration omitted).  To the contrary, \"a plaintiff must demonstrate standing for each claim he seeks to press and for each form of relief that is sought.\"  Davis, supra, at 734 (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g., DaimlerChrysler, supra, at 352 (\"[A] plaintiff must demonstrate standing separately for each form of relief sought\"); Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.\u00a0S. 167, 185 (2000) (same); Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.\u00a0S. 95, 105-106, and n.\u00a07 (1983) (a plaintiff who has standing to seek damages must also demonstrate standing to pursue injunctive relief).  The same principle applies when there are multiple plaintiffs.  At least one plaintiff must have standing to seek each form of relief requested in the complaint.  Both of the parties accept this simple rule.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same principle applies to intervenors of right.  Although the context is different, the rule is the same: For all relief sought, there must be a litigant with standing, whether that litigant joins the lawsuit as a plaintiff, a coplaintiff, or an intervenor of right.  Thus, at the least, an intervenor of right must demonstrate Article III standing when it seeks additional relief beyond that which the plaintiff requests.  This result follows ineluctably from our Article III case law, so it is not surprising that both parties accept it (as does the United States as amicus curiae).  See Brief for Petitioner 13 (arguing that an intervenor must always demonstrate standing); Brief for Respondent 28 (\"[A]n intervenor who .\u00a0.\u00a0. seeks relief beyond that requested by a party with standing must satisfy Article III\"); Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 16  (An intervenor must demonstrate its own standing if  it \"seek[s] damages\" or \"injunctive relief that is broader than or different from the relief sought by the original plaintiff(s)\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, an intervenor of right must have Article III standing in order to pursue relief that is different from that which is sought by a party with standing.  That includes cases in which both the plaintiff and the intervenor seek separate money judgments in their own names.  Cf. General Building Contractors Assn., Inc. v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.\u00a0S. 375, 402, n. 22 (1982) (declining to address the State's standing \"until [it] obtains relief different from that sought by plaintiffs whose standing has not been questioned\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That principle dictates the disposition of this case.  It is unclear whether Laroe seeks the same relief as Sherman or instead seeks different relief, such as a money judgment against the Town in Laroe's own name.  Laroe's complaint--the best evidence of the relief Laroe seeks--requests a judgment awarding damages to Laroe.  App. 162.  Unsurprisingly, Sherman requests something different: specifically, compensation for the taking of his interest in the property.  Id., at 122.  In other words, as Laroe's counsel conceded at oral argument, the complaint plainly seeks separate monetary relief for Laroe directly against the Town.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 43-44.  And, as Laroe's counsel conceded further, if Laroe is \"seeking additional damages in [its] own name,\" \"at that point, an Article III inquiry would be required.\"  Id., at 47.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To be sure, at some points during argument in the Court of Appeals, Laroe made statements that arguably indicated that Laroe is not seeking damages different from those sought by Sherman.  In particular, Laroe's counsel stated that he was \"not saying that Sherman and [Laroe's] damages are not the same damages,\" and insisted that there is \"exactly one fund, and the town doesn't have to do anything except turn over the fund.\"  Tr.\u00a016, 33; see also Reply Brief in No. 15-1086 (CA2), p.\u00a012 (similar).  At other points, however, the same counsel made statements pointing in the opposite direction.  When asked directly whether \"there would be separate awards to you and to the Sherman estate\" if Sherman's suit was successful, Laroe's counsel admitted that he \"ha[d] never contemplated how [damages] ge[t] allocated at the end of the day\" and suggested bifurcated proceedings so that once liability was settled, Laroe and Sherman could \"duke it out\" over damages if necessary.  Tr. 32-35.  And in its Court of Appeals briefing, Laroe argued that it--not Sherman--would be entitled to most of the damages from the takings claim, flagging the allocation issue as one that the District Court would have to resolve.  Brief for Appellant in No. 15-1086 (CA2), p.\u00a032 (\"[T]he trier of fact will have to determine the relative allocation of rights over the fund .\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0.  Specifically, what is the value of Sherman's bare legal title as compared to Laroe's equitable title in the subject property\"); Reply Brief in No. 15-1086, at 15 (\"[M]ost, if not all of the benefits\" of this litigation \"will accrue [to] Laroe\"); see also 828 F.\u00a03d, at 70 (noting that Sherman and Laroe \"may disagree about .\u00a0.\u00a0. the issue of damages were they to prevail\").  Taken together, these representations at best leave it ambiguous whether Laroe is seeking damages for itself or is simply seeking the same damages sought by Sherman.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals did not resolve this ambiguity.  In fact, the section of its opinion concerning standing did not discuss whether Laroe sought different relief than Sherman.  Id., at 64-66.  Elsewhere, in a different context, the court did acknowledge Laroe's statement that it sought \"essentially the same\" damages as Sherman.  Id., at 66.  But the court also found that \"it is unclear from the record whether Laroe believes the Town is directly liable to Sherman or Laroe for the taking.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This confusion needs to be dispelled.  If Laroe wants only a money judgment of its own running directly against the Town, then it seeks damages different from those sought by Sherman and must establish its own Article III standing in order to intervene.  We leave it to the Court of Appeals to address this question on remand.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Sherman died in 2013, and his estate replaced him as the plaintiff.  \nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 21a, n.\u00a02.\nFootnote 2\u00a0We assume for the sake of argument only that Laroe does not have Article III standing.  If resolution of this question becomes necessary on remand, the Court of Appeals will be required to determine whether the District Court's decision was correct.\nFootnote 3\u00a0See Brief for Petitioner 23 (\"If different parties raising a single issue seek different relief, then standing must be shown for each one\"); Brief for Respondent 15 (\"[A] case or controversy as to one claim does not extend the judicial power to different claims or forms of relief\u00a0\").\nFootnote 4\u00a0Before this Court, Laroe's counsel represented that Laroe is not seeking damages of its own and is seeking only to maximize Sherman's recovery.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 43-44.  But in light of the ambiguous record and the lack of a reasoned conclusion on this question from the Court of Appeals, we are not inclined to resolve it in the first instance.  Cutter v.

COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES(2017)\nNo. 15-577\nArgued: April 19, 2017Decided: June 26, 2017\n\n\nThe Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center is a Missouri preschool and daycare center.  Originally established as a nonprofit organization, the Center later merged with Trinity Lutheran Church and now operates under its auspices on church property.  Among the facilities at the Center is a playground, which has a coarse pea gravel surface beneath much of the play equipment.  In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large portion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by participating in Missouri's Scrap Tire Program.  The program, run by the State's Department of Natural Resources, offers reimbursement grants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that install playground surfaces made from recycled tires.  The Department had a strict and express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.  Pursuant to that policy, the Department denied the Center's application.  In a letter rejecting that application, the Department explained that under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance directly to a church.  The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants as part of the 2012 program.  Although the Center ranked fifth out of the 44 applicants, it did not receive a grant because it is a church.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trinity Lutheran sued in Federal District Court, alleging that the Department's failure to approve its application violated the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  The District Court dismissed the suit.  The Free Exercise Clause, the court stated, prohibits the government from outlawing or restricting the exercise of a religious practice, but it generally does not prohibit withholding an affirmative benefit on account of religion.  The District Court likened the case before it to Locke v. Davey, 540 U.\u00a0S. 712, where this Court upheld against a free exercise challenge a State's decision not to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a scholarship program.  The District Court held that the Free Exercise Clause did not require the State to make funds available under the Scrap Tire Program to Trinity Lutheran.  A divided panel of the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The fact that the State could award a scrap tire grant to Trinity Lutheran without running afoul of the Establishment Clause of the Federal Constitution, the court ruled, did not mean that the Free Exercise Clause compelled the State to disregard the broader antiestablishment principle reflected in its own Constitution.\nHeld:\u00a0The Department's policy violated the rights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment by denying the Church an otherwise available public benefit on account of its religious status.  Pp.\u00a06-15.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This Court has repeatedly confirmed that denying a generally available benefit solely on account of religious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion.  Thus, in McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.\u00a0S. 618, the Court struck down a Tennessee statute disqualifying ministers from serving as delegates to the State's constitutional convention.  A plurality recognized that such a law discriminated against McDaniel by denying him a benefit solely because of his \"status as a 'minister.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 627.  In recent years, when rejecting free exercise challenges to neutral laws of general applicability, the Court has been careful to distinguish such laws from those that single out the religious for disfavored treatment.  See, e.g., Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Assn., 485 U.\u00a0S. 439; Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872; and Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.\u00a0S. 520.  It has remained a fundamental principle of this Court's free exercise jurisprudence that laws imposing \"special disabilities on the basis of .\u00a0.\u00a0. religious status\" trigger  the strictest scrutiny.  Id., at 533.  Pp.\u00a06-9.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The Department's policy expressly discriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by disqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their religious character.  Like the disqualification statute in McDaniel, the Department's policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a choice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit program or remain a religious institution.  When the State conditions a benefit in this way, McDaniel says plainly that the State has imposed a penalty on the free exercise of religion that must withstand the most exacting scrutiny.  435 U.\u00a0S., at 626, 628.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department contends that simply declining to allocate to Trinity Lutheran a subsidy the State had no obligation to provide does not meaningfully burden the Church's free exercise rights.  Absent any such burden, the argument continues, the Department is free to follow the State's antiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a church.  But, as even the Department acknowledges, the Free Exercise Clause protects against \"indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.\"  Lyng, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 450.  Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any entitlement to a subsidy.  It is asserting a right to participate in a government benefit program without having to disavow its religious character.  The express discrimination against religious exercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal to allow the Church--solely because it is a church--to compete with secular organizations for a grant.  Pp.\u00a09-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0The Department tries to sidestep this Court's precedents by arguing that this case is instead controlled by Locke v. Davey.  It is not.  In Locke, the State of Washington created a scholarship program to assist high-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education.  Scholarship recipients were free to use state funds at accredited religious and non-religious schools alike, but they could not use the funds to pursue a devotional theology degree.  At the outset, the Court made clear that Locke was not like the cases in which the Court struck down laws requiring individuals to \"choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.\"  540 U.\u00a0S., at 720-721.  Davey was not denied a scholarship because of who he was; he was denied a scholarship because of what he proposed to do.  Here there is no question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant simply because of what it is--a church.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Locke also stated that Washington's restriction on the use of its funds was in keeping with the State's antiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer funds to pay for the training of clergy, an \"essentially religious endeavor,\" id., at 721.  Here, nothing of the sort can be said about a program to use recycled tires to resurface playgrounds.  At any rate, the Court took account of Washington's antiestablishment interest only after determining that the scholarship program did not \"require students to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.\"  Id., at 720-721.  There is no dispute that Trinity Lutheran is put to the choice between being a church and receiving a government benefit.  Pp.\u00a011-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The Department's discriminatory policy does not survive the \"most rigorous\" scrutiny that this Court applies to laws imposing special disabilities on account of religious status.  Lukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 546.  That standard demands a state interest \"of the highest order\" to justify the policy at issue.  McDaniel, 435 U.\u00a0S., at 628 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Yet the Department offers nothing more than Missouri's preference for skating as far as possible from religious establishment concerns.  In the face of the clear infringement on free exercise before the Court, that interest cannot qualify as compelling.  Pp.\u00a014-15.\n788 F.\u00a03d 779, reversed and remanded.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Roberts, C.\u00a0J., delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to footnote 3.

CAROL S. COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURALRESOURCES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[June 26, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to footnote 3.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Missouri Department of Natural Resources offers state grants to help public and private schools, nonprofit daycare centers, and other nonprofit entities purchase rubber playground surfaces made from recycled tires.  Trinity Lutheran Church applied for such a grant for its preschool and daycare center and would have received one, but for the fact that Trinity Lutheran is a church.  The Department had a policy of categorically disqualifying churches and other religious organizations from receiving grants under its playground resurfacing program.  The question presented is whether the Department's policy violated the rights of Trinity Lutheran under the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Trinity Lutheran Church Child Learning Center is a preschool and daycare center open throughout the year to serve working families in Boone County, Missouri, and the surrounding area.  Established as a nonprofit organization in 1980, the Center merged with Trinity Lutheran Church in 1985 and operates under its auspices on church property.  The Center admits students of any religion, and enrollment stands at about 90 children ranging from age two to five.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Center includes a playground that is equipped with the basic playground essentials: slides, swings, jungle gyms, monkey bars, and sandboxes.  Almost the entire surface beneath and surrounding the play equipment is coarse pea gravel.  Youngsters, of course, often fall on the playground or tumble from the equipment.  And when they do, the gravel can be unforgiving.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2012, the Center sought to replace a large portion of the pea gravel with a pour-in-place rubber surface by participating in Missouri's Scrap Tire Program.  Run by the State's Department of Natural Resources to reduce the number of used tires destined for landfills and dump sites, the program offers reimbursement grants to qualifying nonprofit organizations that purchase playground surfaces made from recycled tires.  It is funded through a fee imposed on the sale of new tires in the State.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Due to limited resources, the Department cannot offer grants to all applicants and so awards them on a competitive basis to those scoring highest based on several criteria, such as the poverty level of the population in the surrounding area and the applicant's plan to promote recycling.  When the Center applied, the Department had a strict and express policy of denying grants to any applicant owned or controlled by a church, sect, or other religious entity.  That policy, in the Department's view, was compelled by Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, which provides:\n\"That no money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest, preacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such; and that no preference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against any church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious faith or worship.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its application, the Center disclosed its status as a ministry of Trinity Lutheran Church and specified that the Center's mission was \"to provide a safe, clean, and attractive school facility in conjunction with an educational program structured to allow a child to grow spiritually, physically, socially, and cognitively.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 131a.  After describing the playground and the safety hazards posed by its current surface, the Center detailed the anticipated benefits of the proposed project: increasing access to the playground for all children, including those with disabilities, by providing a surface compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990; providing a safe, long-lasting, and resilient surface under the play areas; and improving Missouri's environment by putting recycled tires to positive use.  The Center also noted that the benefits of a new surface would extend beyond its students to the local community, whose children often use the playground during non-school hours.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Center ranked fifth among the 44 applicants in the 2012 Scrap Tire Program.  But despite its high score, the Center was deemed categorically ineligible to receive a grant.  In a letter rejecting the Center's application, the program director explained that, under Article I, Section 7 of the Missouri Constitution, the Department could not provide financial assistance directly to a church.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department ultimately awarded 14 grants as part of the 2012 program.  Because the Center was operated by Trinity Lutheran Church, it did not receive a grant.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trinity Lutheran sued the Director of the Department in Federal District Court.  The Church alleged that the Department's failure to approve the Center's application, pursuant to its policy of denying grants to religiously affiliated applicants, violates the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.  Trinity Lutheran sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the Department from discriminating against the Church on that basis in future grant applications.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court granted the Department's motion to dismiss.  The Free Exercise Clause, the District Court stated, prohibits the government from outlawing or restricting the exercise of a religious practice; it generally does not prohibit withholding an affirmative benefit on account of religion.  The District Court likened the Department's denial of the scrap tire grant to the situation this Court encountered in Locke v. Davey, 540 U.\u00a0S. 712 (2004).  In that case, we upheld against a free exercise challenge the State of Washington's decision not to fund degrees in devotional theology as part of a state scholarship program.  Finding the present case \"nearly indistinguishable from Locke,\" the District Court held that the Free Exercise Clause did not require the State to make funds available under the Scrap Tire Program to religious institutions like Trinity Lutheran.  Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Pauley, 976 F.\u00a0Supp. 2d 1137, 1151 (WD Mo. 2013).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court recognized that it was \"rather clear\" that Missouri could award a scrap tire grant to Trinity Lutheran without running afoul of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution.  Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Pauley, 788 F.\u00a03d 779, 784 (2015).  But, the Court of Appeals explained, that did not mean the Free Exercise Clause compelled the State to disregard the antiestablishment principle reflected in its own Constitution.  Viewing a monetary grant to a religious institution as a \"\u00a0'hallmark[\u00a0] of an established religion,'\u00a0\" the court concluded that the State could rely on an applicant's religious status to deny its application.  Id., at 785 (quoting Locke, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 722; some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Gruender dissented.  He distinguished Locke on the ground that it concerned the narrow issue of funding for the religious training of clergy, and \"did not leave states with unfettered discretion to exclude the religious from generally available public benefits.\"  788 F.\u00a03d, at 791 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Rehearing en banc was denied by an equally divided court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted certiorari sub\u00a0nom. Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. Pauley, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016), and now reverse.1\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The First Amendment provides, in part, that \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"  The parties agree that the Establishment Clause of that Amendment does not prevent Missouri from including Trinity Lutheran in the Scrap Tire Program.  That does not, however, answer the question under the Free Exercise Clause, because we have recognized that there is \"play in the joints\" between what the Establishment Clause permits and the Free Exercise Clause compels.  Locke, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 718 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Free Exercise Clause \"protect[s] religious observers against unequal treatment\" and subjects to the strictest scrutiny laws that target the religious for \"special disabilities\" based on their \"religious status.\"  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.\u00a0S. 520, 533, 542 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Applying that basic principle, this Court has repeatedly confirmed that denying a generally available benefit solely on account of religious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that can be justified only by a state interest \"of the highest order.\"  McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.\u00a0S. 618, 628 (1978) (plurality opinion) (quoting Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.\u00a0S. 205, 215 (1972)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Everson v. Board of Education of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1947), for example, we upheld against an Establishment Clause challenge a New Jersey law enabling a local school district to reimburse parents for the public transportation costs of sending their children to public and private schools, including parochial schools.  In the course of ruling that the Establishment Clause allowed New Jersey to extend that public benefit to all its citizens regardless of their religious belief, we explained that a State \"cannot hamper its citizens in the free exercise of their own religion.  Consequently, it cannot exclude individual Catholics, Lutherans, Mohammedans, Baptists, Jews, Methodists, Non-believers, Presbyterians, or the members of any other faith, because of their faith, or lack of it, from receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation.\"  Id., at 16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three decades later, in McDaniel v. Paty, the Court struck down under the Free Exercise Clause a Tennessee statute disqualifying ministers from serving as delegates to the State's constitutional convention.  Writing for the plurality, Chief Justice Burger acknowledged that Tennessee had disqualified ministers from serving as legislators since the adoption of its first Constitution in 1796, and that a number of early States had also disqualified ministers from legislative office.  This historical tradition, however, did not change the fact that the statute discriminated against McDaniel by denying him a benefit solely because of his \"status as a 'minister.'\u00a0\"  435 U.\u00a0S., at 627.  McDaniel could not seek to participate in the convention while also maintaining his role as a minister; to pursue the one, he would have to give up the other.  In this way, said Chief Justice Burger, the Tennessee law \"effectively penalizes the free exercise of [McDaniel's] constitutional liberties.\"  Id., at 626 (quoting Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.\u00a0S. 398, 406 (1963); internal quotation marks omitted).  Joined by Justice Marshall in concurrence, Justice Brennan added that \"because the challenged provision requires [McDaniel] to purchase his right to engage in the ministry by sacrificing his candidacy it impairs the free exercise of his religion.\"  McDaniel, 435 U.\u00a0S., at 634.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In recent years, when this Court has rejected free exercise challenges, the laws in question have been neutral and generally applicable without regard to religion.  We have been careful to distinguish such laws from those that single out the religious for disfavored treatment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, in Lyng v. Northwest Indian Cemetery Protective Association, 485 U.\u00a0S. 439 (1988), we held that the Free Exercise Clause did not prohibit the Government from timber harvesting or road construction on a particular tract of federal land, even though the Government's action would obstruct the religious practice of several Native American Tribes that held certain sites on the tract to be sacred.  Accepting that \"[t]he building of a road or the harvesting of timber .\u00a0.\u00a0. would interfere significantly with private persons' ability to pursue spiritual fulfillment according to their own religious beliefs,\" we nonetheless found no free exercise violation, because the affected individuals were not being \"coerced by the Government's action into violating their religious beliefs.\"  Id., at 449.  The Court specifically noted, however, that the Government action did not \"penalize religious activity by denying any person an equal share of the rights, benefits, and privileges enjoyed by other citizens.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Employment Division, Department of Human Resources of Oregon v. Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872 (1990), we rejected a free exercise claim brought by two members of a Native American church denied unemployment benefits because they had violated Oregon's drug laws by ingesting peyote for sacramental purposes.  Along the same lines as our decision in Lyng, we held that the Free Exercise Clause did not entitle the church members to a special dispensation from the general criminal laws on account of their religion.  At the same time, we again made clear that the Free Exercise Clause did guard against the government's imposition of \"special disabilities on the basis of religious views or religious status.\"  494 U.\u00a0S., at 877 (citing McDaniel, 435 U.\u00a0S. 618).2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, in Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hia- leah, we struck down three facially neutral city ordinances that outlawed certain forms of animal slaughter.  Members of the Santeria religion challenged the ordinances under the Free Exercise Clause, alleging that despite their facial neutrality, the ordinances had a discriminatory purpose easy to ferret out: prohibiting sacrificial rituals integral to Santeria but distasteful to local residents.  We agreed.  Before explaining why the challenged ordinances were not, in fact, neutral or generally applicable, the Court recounted the fundamentals of our free exercise jurisprudence.  A law, we said, may not discriminate against \"some or all religious beliefs.\"  508 U.\u00a0S., at 532.  Nor may a law regulate or outlaw conduct because it is religiously motivated.  And, citing McDaniel and Smith, we restated the now-familiar refrain: The Free Exercise Clause protects against laws that \"\u00a0'impose[\u00a0] special disabilities on the basis of .\u00a0.\u00a0. religious status.'\u00a0\"  508 U.\u00a0S., at 533 (quoting Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S., at 877); see also Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.\u00a0S. 793, 828 (2000) (plurality opinion) (noting \"our decisions that have prohibited governments from discriminating in the distribution of public benefits based upon religious status or sincerity\" (citing Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819 (1995); Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.\u00a0S. 384 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.\u00a0S. 263 (1981))).\nIII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department's policy expressly discriminates against otherwise eligible recipients by disqualifying them from a public benefit solely because of their religious character.  If the cases just described make one thing clear, it is that such a policy imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that triggers the most exacting scrutiny.  Lukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 546.  This conclusion is unremarkable in light of our prior decisions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Like the disqualification statute in McDaniel, the Department's policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a choice: It may participate in an otherwise available benefit program or remain a religious institution.  Of course, Trinity Lutheran is free to continue operating as a church, just as McDaniel was free to continue being a minister.  But that freedom comes at the cost of automatic and absolute exclusion from the benefits of a public program for which the Center is otherwise fully qualified.  And when the State conditions a benefit in this way, McDaniel says plainly that the State has punished the free exercise of religion: \"To condition the availability of benefits .\u00a0.\u00a0. upon [a recipient's] willingness to .\u00a0.\u00a0. surrender[\u00a0] his religiously impelled [status] effectively penalizes the free exercise of his constitutional liberties.\"  435 U.\u00a0S., at 626 (plurality opinion) (alterations omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department contends that merely declining to extend funds to Trinity Lutheran does not prohibit the Church from engaging in any religious conduct or otherwise exercising its religious rights.  In this sense, says the Department, its policy is unlike the ordinances struck down in Lukumi, which outlawed rituals central to Santeria.  Here the Department has simply declined to allocate to Trinity Lutheran a subsidy the State had no obligation to provide in the first place.  That decision does not meaningfully burden the Church's free exercise rights.  And absent any such burden, the argument continues, the Department is free to heed the State's antiestablishment objection to providing funds directly to a church.  Brief for Respondent 7-12, 14-16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true the Department has not criminalized the way Trinity Lutheran worships or told the Church that it cannot subscribe to a certain view of the Gospel.  But, as the Department itself acknowledges, the Free Exercise Clause protects against \"indirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of religion, not just outright prohibitions.\"  Lyng, 485 U.\u00a0S., at 450.  As the Court put it more than 50 years ago, \"[i]t is too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege.\"  Sherbert, 374 U.\u00a0S., at 404; see also McDaniel, 435 U.\u00a0S., at 633 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) (The \"proposition--that the law does not interfere with free exercise because it does not directly prohibit religious activity, but merely conditions eligibility for office on its abandonment--is .\u00a0.\u00a0. squarely rejected by precedent\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Trinity Lutheran is not claiming any entitlement to a subsidy.  It instead asserts a right to participate in a government benefit program without having to disavow its religious character.  The \"imposition of such a condition upon even a gratuitous benefit inevitably deter[s] or discourage[s] the exercise of First Amendment rights.\"  Sherbert, 374 U.\u00a0S., at 405.  The express discrimination against religious exercise here is not the denial of a grant, but rather the refusal to allow the Church--solely because it is a church--to compete with secular organizations for a grant.  Cf. Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.\u00a0S. 656, 666 (1993) (\"[T]he 'injury in fact' is the inability to compete on an equal footing in the bidding process, not the loss of a contract\").  Trinity Lutheran is a member of the community too, and the State's decision to exclude it for purposes of this public program must withstand the strictest scrutiny.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Department attempts to get out from under the weight of our precedents by arguing that the free exercise question in this case is instead controlled by our decision in Locke v. Davey.  It is not.  In Locke, the State of Washington created a scholarship program to assist high-achieving students with the costs of postsecondary education.  The scholarships were paid out of the State's general fund, and eligibility was based on criteria such as an applicant's score on college admission tests and family income.  While scholarship recipients were free to use the money at accredited religious and non-religious schools alike, they were not permitted to use the funds to pursue a devotional theology degree--one \"devotional in nature or designed to induce religious faith.\"  540 U.\u00a0S., at 716 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Davey was selected for a scholarship but was denied the funds when he refused to certify that he would not use them toward a devotional degree.  He sued, arguing that the State's refusal to allow its scholarship money to go toward such degrees violated his free exercise rights.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court disagreed.  It began by explaining what was not at issue.  Washington's selective funding program was not comparable to the free exercise violations found in the \"Lukumi line of cases,\" including those striking down laws requiring individuals to \"choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.\"  Id., at 720-721.  At the outset, then, the Court made clear that Locke was not like the case now before us.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Washington's restriction on the use of its scholarship funds was different.  According to the Court, the State had \"merely chosen not to fund a distinct category of instruction.\"  Id., at 721.  Davey was not denied a scholarship because of who he was; he was denied a scholarship because of what he proposed to do--use the funds to prepare for the ministry.  Here there is no question that Trinity Lutheran was denied a grant simply because of what it is--a church.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court in Locke also stated that Washington's choice was in keeping with the State's antiestablishment interest in not using taxpayer funds to pay for the training of clergy; in fact, the Court could \"think of few areas in which a State's antiestablishment interests come more into play.\"  Id., at 722.  The claimant in Locke sought funding for an \"essentially religious endeavor .\u00a0.\u00a0. akin to a religious calling as well as an academic pursuit,\" and opposition to such funding \"to support church leaders\" lay at the historic core of the Religion Clauses.  Id., at 721-722.  Here nothing of the sort can be said about a program to use recycled tires to resurface playgrounds.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Relying on Locke, the Department nonetheless emphasizes Missouri's similar constitutional tradition of not furnishing taxpayer money directly to churches.  Brief for Respondent 15-16.  But Locke took account of Washington's antiestablishment interest only after determining, as noted, that the scholarship program did not \"require students to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit.\"  540 U.\u00a0S., at 720-721 (citing McDaniel, 435 U.\u00a0S. 618).  As the Court put it, Washington's scholarship program went \"a long way toward including religion in its benefits.\"  Locke, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 724.  Students in the program were free to use their scholarships at \"pervasively religious schools.\"  Ibid.  Davey could use his scholarship to pursue a secular degree at one institution while studying devotional theology at another.  Id., at 721, n.\u00a04.  He could also use his scholarship money to attend a religious college and take devotional theology courses there.  Id., at 725.  The only thing he could not do was use the scholarship to pursue a degree in that subject.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case, there is no dispute that Trinity Lutheran is put to the choice between being a church and receiving a government benefit.  The rule is simple: No churches need apply.3\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State in this case expressly requires Trinity Lutheran to renounce its religious character in order to participate in an otherwise generally available public benefit program, for which it is fully qualified.  Our cases make clear that such a condition imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that must be subjected to the \"most rigorous\" scrutiny.  Lukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 546.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under that stringent standard, only a state interest \"of the highest order\" can justify the Department's discriminatory policy.  McDaniel, 435 U.\u00a0S., at 628 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Yet the Department offers nothing more than Missouri's policy preference for skating as far as possible from religious establishment concerns.  Brief for Respondent 15-16.  In the face of the clear infringement on free exercise before us, that interest cannot qualify as compelling.  As we said when considering Missouri's same policy preference on a prior occasion, \"the state interest asserted here--in achieving greater separation of church and State than is already ensured under the Establishment Clause of the Federal Constitution--is limited by the Free Exercise Clause.\"  Widmar, 454 U. S., at 276.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The State has pursued its preferred policy to the point of expressly denying a qualified religious entity a public benefit solely because of its religious character.  Under our precedents, that goes too far. The Department's policy violates the Free Exercise Clause.5\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nearly 200 years ago, a legislator urged the Maryland Assembly to adopt a bill that would end the State's disqualification of Jews from public office:\n\"If, on account of my religious faith, I am subjected to disqualifications, from which others are free, .\u00a0.\u00a0. I cannot but consider myself a persecuted man. .\u00a0.\u00a0. An odious exclusion from any of the benefits common to the rest of my fellow-citizens, is a persecution, differing only in degree, but of a nature equally unjustifiable with that, whose instruments are chains and torture.\"  Speech by H. M. Brackenridge, Dec. Sess. 1818, in H. Brackenridge, W. Worthington, & J. Tyson, Speeches in the House of Delegates of Maryland, 64 (1829).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Missouri Department of Natural Resources has not subjected anyone to chains or torture on account of religion.  And the result of the State's policy is nothing so dramatic as the denial of political office.  The consequence is, in all likelihood, a few extra scraped knees.  But the exclusion of Trinity Lutheran from a public benefit for which it is otherwise qualified, solely because it is a church, is odious to our Constitution all the same, and cannot stand.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., concurring in part\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-577\nTRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC., PETITIONER v. CAROL S.

The Free Exercise Clause, which generally prohibits laws that facially discriminate against religion, compels this conclusion.  See Locke v. Davey, 540 U.\u00a0S. 712, 726-727 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite this prohibition, the Court in Locke permitted a State to \"disfavor .\u00a0.\u00a0. religion\" by imposing what it deemed a \"relatively minor\" burden on religious exercise to advance the State's antiestablishment \"interest in not funding the religious training of clergy.\"  Id., at 720, 722, n.\u00a05, 725.  The Court justified this law based on its view that there is \"\u00a0'play in the joints'\u00a0\" between the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause--that is, that \"there are some state actions permitted by the Establishment Clause but not required by the Free Exercise Clause.\"  Id., at 719.  Accordingly, Locke did not subject the law at issue to any form of heightened scrutiny.  But it also did not suggest that discrimination against religion outside the limited context of support for ministerial training would be similarly exempt from exacting review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court's endorsement in Locke of even a \"mil[d] kind,\" id., at 720, of discrimination against religion remains troubling.  See generally id., at 726-734 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  But because the Court today appropriately construes Locke narrowly, see Part III-B, ante, and because no party has asked us to reconsider it, I join nearly all of the Court's opinion.  I do not, however, join footnote 3, for the reasons expressed by Justice Gorsuch, post, p.\u00a01 (opinion concurring in part). \n\nGorsuch, J., concurring in part\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-577\nTRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC., PETITIONER v. CAROL S. COMER, DIRECTOR, MISSOURI DEPARTMENT OF NATURAL RESOURCES\non writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit\n[June 26, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch, with whom Justice Thomas joins, concurring in part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Missouri's law bars Trinity Lutheran from participating in a public benefits program only because it is a church.  I agree this violates the First Amendment and I am pleased to join nearly all of the Court's opinion.  I offer only two modest qualifications.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Court leaves open the possibility a useful distinction might be drawn between laws that discriminate on the basis of religious status and religious use.  See ante, at 12.  Respectfully, I harbor doubts about the stability of such a line.  Does a religious man say grace before dinner?  Or does a man begin his meal in a religious manner?  Is it a religious group that built the playground?  Or did a group build the playground so it might be used to advance a religious mission?  The distinction blurs in much the same way the line between acts and omissions can blur when stared at too long, leaving us to ask (for example) whether the man who drowns by awaiting the incoming tide does so by act (coming upon the sea) or omission (allowing the sea to come upon him).  See Cruzan v. Director, Mo. Dept. of Health, 497 U.\u00a0S. 261, 296 (1990) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Often enough the same facts can be described both ways.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither do I see why the First Amendment's Free Exercise Clause should care.  After all, that Clause guarantees the free exercise of religion, not just the right to inward belief (or status).  Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872, 877 (1990).  And this Court has long explained that government may not \"devise mechanisms, overt or disguised, designed to persecute or oppress a religion or its practices.\"  Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.\u00a0S. 520, 547 (1993).   Generally the government may not force people to choose between participation in a public program and their right to free exercise of religion.  See Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div., 450 U.\u00a0S. 707, 716 (1981); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1, 16 (1947).  I don't see why it should matter whether we describe that benefit, say, as closed to Lutherans (status) or closed to people who do Lutheran things (use).  It is free exercise either way.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, reliance on the status-use distinction does not suffice for me to distinguish Locke v. Davey, 540 U.\u00a0S. 712 (2004).  See ante, at 12.  In that case, this Court upheld a funding restriction barring a student from using a scholarship to pursue a degree in devotional theology.  But can it really matter whether the restriction in Locke was phrased in terms of use instead of status (for was it a student who wanted a vocational degree in religion? or was it a religious student who wanted the necessary education for his chosen vocation?).  If that case can be correct and distinguished, it seems it might be only because of the opinion's claim of a long tradition against the use of public funds for training of the clergy, a tradition the Court correctly explains has no analogue here.  Ante, at 13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second and for similar reasons, I am unable to join the footnoted observation, ante, at 14, n.\u00a03, that \"[t]his case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing.\"  Of course the footnote is entirely correct, but I worry that some might mistakenly read it to suggest that only \"playground resurfacing\" cases, or only those with some association with children's safety or health, or perhaps some other social good we find sufficiently worthy, are governed by the legal rules recounted in and faithfully applied by the Court's opinion.  Such a reading would be unreasonable for our cases are \"governed by general principles, rather than ad\u00a0hoc improvisations.\"  Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 542 U.\u00a0S. 1, 25 (2004) (Rehnquist, C.\u00a0J., concurring in judgment).  And the general principles here do not permit discrimination against religious exercise--whether on the playground or anywhere else.\n\nBreyer, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-577\nTRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC., PETITIONER v.

But I find relevant, and would emphasize, the particular nature of the \"public benefit\" here at issue.  Cf. ante, at 11 (\"Trinity Lutheran .\u00a0.\u00a0. asserts a right to participate in a government benefit program\"); ante, at 12 (referring to precedent \"striking down laws requiring individuals to choose between their religious beliefs and receiving a government benefit\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); ante, at 10 (referring to Trinity Lutheran's \"automatic and absolute exclusion from the benefits of a public program\"); ante, at 9-10 (the State's policy disqualifies \"otherwise eligible recipients .\u00a0.\u00a0. from a public benefit solely because of their religious character\"); ante, at 6-7 (quoting the statement in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1, 16 (1947), that the State \"cannot exclude\" individuals \"because of their faith\" from \"receiving the benefits of public welfare legislation\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court stated in Everson that \"cutting off church schools from\" such \"general government services as ordinary police and fire protection .\u00a0.\u00a0. is obviously not the purpose of the First Amendment.\"  330 U.\u00a0S., at 17-18.  Here, the State would cut Trinity Lutheran off from participation in a general program designed to secure or to improve the health and safety of children.  I see no significant difference.  The fact that the program at issue ultimately funds only a limited number of projects cannot itself justify a religious distinction.  Nor is there any administrative or other reason to treat church schools differently.  The sole reason advanced that explains the difference is faith.  And it is that last-mentioned fact that calls the Free Exercise Clause into play.  We need not go further.  Public benefits come in many shapes and sizes.  I would leave the application of the Free Exercise Clause to other kinds of public benefits for another day.\n\nSotomayor, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 15-577\nTRINITY LUTHERAN CHURCH OF COLUMBIA, INC., PETITIONER v. CAROL S.

The stakes are higher.  This case is about nothing less than the relationship between religious institutions and the civil government--that is, between church and state.  The Court today profoundly changes that relationship by holding, for the first time, that the Constitution requires the government to provide public funds directly to a church.  Its decision slights both our precedents and our history, and its reasoning weakens this country's longstanding commitment to a separation of church and state beneficial to both.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Founded in 1922, Trinity Lutheran Church (Church) \"operates .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the express purpose of carrying out the commission of .\u00a0.\u00a0. Jesus Christ as directed to His church on earth.\"  Our Story, http:\/\/www.trinity-lcms.org\/story (all internet materials as last visited June 22, 2017).  The Church uses \"preaching, teaching, worship, witness, service, and fellowship according to the Word of God\" to carry out its mission \"to 'make disciples.'\u00a0\"  Mission, http:\/\/www.trinity-lcms.org\/mission (quoting Matthew 28:18-20).  The Church's religious beliefs include its desire to \"associat[e] with the [Trinity Church Child] Learning Center.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 101a.  Located on Church property, the Learning Center provides daycare and preschool for about \"90 children ages two to kindergarten.\"  Id., at 100a.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Learning Center serves as \"a ministry of the Church and incorporates daily religion and developmentally appropriate activities into .\u00a0.\u00a0. [its] program.\"  Id., at 101a.  In this way, \"[t]hrough the Learning Center, the Church teaches a Christian world view to children of members of the Church, as well as children of non-member residents\" of the area.  Ibid.  These activities represent the Church's \"sincere religious belief .\u00a0.\u00a0. to use [the Learning Center] to teach the Gospel to children of its members, as well to bring the Gospel message to non-members.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Learning Center's facilities include a playground, the unlikely source of this dispute.  The Church provides the playground and other \"safe, clean, and attractive\" facilities \"in conjunction with an education program structured to allow a child to grow spiritually, physically, socially, and cognitively.\"  Ibid.  This case began in 2012 when the Church applied for funding to upgrade the playground's pea gravel and grass surface through Missouri's Scrap Tire Program, which provides grants for the purchase and installation of recycled tire material to resurface playgrounds.  The Church sought $20,000 for a $30,580 project to modernize the playground, part of its effort to gain state accreditation for the Learning Center as an early childhood education program.  Missouri denied the Church funding based on Article I, \u00a77, of its State Constitution, which prohibits the use of public funds \"in aid of any church, sect, or denomination of religion.\"\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Properly understood then, this is a case about whether Missouri can decline to fund improvements to the facilities the Church uses to practice and spread its religious views.  This Court has repeatedly warned that funding of exactly this kind--payments from the government to a house of worship--would cross the line drawn by the Establishment Clause.  See, e.g., Walz v. Tax Comm'n of City of New York, 397 U.\u00a0S. 664, 675 (1970); Rosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.\u00a0S. 819, 844 (1995); Mitchell v. Helms, 530 U.\u00a0S. 793, 843-844 (2000) (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  So it is surprising that the Court mentions the Establishment Clause only to note the parties' agreement that it \"does not prevent Missouri from including Trinity Lutheran in the Scrap Tire Program.\"  Ante, at 6.  Constitutional questions are decided by this Court, not the parties' concessions.  The Establishment Clause does not allow Missouri to grant the Church's funding request because the Church uses the Learning Center, including its playground, in conjunction with its religious mission.  The Court's silence on this front signals either its misunderstanding of the facts of this case or a startling departure from our precedents.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The government may not directly fund religious exercise.  See Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1, 16 (1947); Mitchell, 530 U.\u00a0S., at 840 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\"[O]ur decisions provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance religious activities\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Put in doctrinal terms, such funding violates the Establishment Clause because it impermissibly \"advanc[es] .\u00a0.\u00a0. religion.\"1 Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.\u00a0S. 203, 222-223 (1997).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nowhere is this rule more clearly implicated than when funds flow directly from the public treasury to a house of worship.2  A house of worship exists to foster and further religious exercise.  There, a group of people, bound by common religious beliefs, comes together \"to shape its own faith and mission.\"  Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.\u00a0S. 171, 188 (2012).  Within its walls, worshippers gather to practice and reaffirm their faith.  And from its base, the faithful reach out to those not yet convinced of the group's beliefs.  When a government funds a house of worship, it underwrites this religious exercise.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Tilton v. Richardson, 403 U.\u00a0S. 672 (1971), held as much.  The federal program at issue provided construction grants to colleges and universities but prohibited grantees from using the funds to construct facilities \"\u00a0'used for sectarian instruction or as a place for religious worship'\u00a0\" or \"\u00a0'used primarily in connection with any part of the program of a school or department of divinity.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 675 (plurality opinion) (quoting 20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a7751(a)(2) (1964 ed., Supp. V)).  It allowed the Federal Government to recover the grant's value if a grantee violated this prohibition within twenty years of the grant.  See 403 U.\u00a0S., at 675.  The Court unanimously agreed that this time limit on recovery violated the Establishment Clause.  \"[T]he original federal grant w[ould] in part have the effect of advancing religion,\" a plurality explained, if a grantee \"converted [a facility] into a chapel or otherwise used [it] to promote religious interests\" after twenty years.  Id., at 683; see also id., at 692 (Douglas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.\u00a0S. 602, 659-661 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring); id., at 665, n.\u00a01 (opinion of White, J.).  Accordingly, the Court severed the twenty-year limit, ensuring that program funds would be put to secular use and thereby bringing the program in line with the Establishment Clause.  See Tilton, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 683 (plurality opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case is no different.  The Church seeks state funds to improve the Learning Center's facilities, which, by the Church's own avowed description, are used to assist the spiritual growth of the children of its members and to spread the Church's faith to the children of nonmembers.  The Church's playground surface--like a Sunday School room's walls or the sanctuary's pews--are integrated with and integral to its religious mission.  The conclusion that the funding the Church seeks would impermissibly advance religion is inescapable.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0True, this Court has found some direct government funding of religious institutions to be consistent with the Establishment Clause.  But the funding in those cases came with assurances that public funds would not be used for religious activity, despite the religious nature of the institution.  See, e.g., Rosenberger, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 875-876 (Souter, J., dissenting) (chronicling cases).  The Church has not and cannot provide such assurances here.3  See Committee for Public Ed. & Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.\u00a0S. 756, 774 (1973) (\"No attempt is made to restrict payments to those expenditures related to the upkeep of facilities used exclusively for secular purposes, nor do we think it possible within the context of these religion-oriented institutions to impose such restrictions\").  The Church has a religious mission, one that it pursues through the Learning Center.  The playground surface cannot be confined to secular use any more than lumber used to frame the Church's walls, glass stained and used to form its windows, or nails used to build its altar.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court may simply disagree with this account of the facts and think that the Church does not put its playground to religious use.  If so, its mistake is limited to this case.  But if it agrees that the State's funding would further religious activity and sees no Establishment Clause problem, then it must be implicitly applying a rule other than the one agreed to in our precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When the Court last addressed direct funding of religious institutions, in Mitchell, it adhered to the rule that the Establishment Clause prohibits the direct funding of religious activities.  At issue was a federal program that helped state and local agencies lend educational materials to public and private schools, including religious schools.  See 530 U.\u00a0S., at 801-803 (plurality opinion).  The controlling concurrence assured itself that the program would not lead to the public funding of religious activity.  It pointed out that the program allocated secular aid, that it did so \"on the basis of neutral, secular criteria,\" that the aid would not \"supplant non-[program] funds,\" that \"no .\u00a0.\u00a0. funds ever reach the coffers of religious schools,\" that \"evidence of actual diversion is de minimis,\" and that the program had \"adequate safeguards\" to police violations.  Id., at 867 (O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  Those factors, it concluded, were \"sufficient to find that the program .\u00a0.\u00a0. [did] not have the impermissible effect of advancing religion.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A plurality would have instead upheld the program based only on the secular nature of the aid and the program's \"neutrality\" as to the religious or secular nature of the recipient.  See id., at 809-814.  The controlling concurrence rejected that approach.  It viewed the plurality's test--\"secular content aid .\u00a0.\u00a0. distributed on the basis of wholly neutral criteria\"--as constitutionally insufficient.  Id., at 839.  This test, explained the concurrence, ignored whether the public funds subsidize religion, the touchstone of establishment jurisprudence.  See id., at 844 (noting that the plurality's logic would allow funding of \"religious organizations (including churches)\" where \"the participating religious organizations (including churches) .\u00a0.\u00a0. use that aid to support religious indoctrination\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's opinion suggests the Court has made the leap the Mitchell plurality could not.  For if it agrees that the funding here will finance religious activities, then only a rule that considers that fact irrelevant could support a conclusion of constitutionality.  The problems of the \"secular and neutral\" approach have been aired before.  See, e.g., id., at 900-902 (Souter, J., dissenting).  It has no basis in the history to which the Court has repeatedly turned to inform its understanding of the Establishment Clause.  It permits direct subsidies for religious indoctrination, with all the attendant concerns that led to the Establishment Clause.  And it favors certain religious groups, those with a belief system that allows them to compete for public dollars and those well-organized and well-funded enough to do so successfully.4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Such a break with precedent would mark a radical mistake.  The Establishment Clause protects both religion and government from the dangers that result when the two become entwined, \"not by providing every religion with an equal opportunity (say, to secure state funding or to pray in the public schools), but by drawing fairly clear lines of separation between church and state--at least where the heartland of religious belief, such as primary religious [worship], is at issue.\"  Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.\u00a0S. 639, 722-723 (2002) (Breyer, J.,  dissenting).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even assuming the absence of an Establishment Clause violation and proceeding on the Court's preferred front--the Free Exercise Clause--the Court errs.  It claims that the government may not draw lines based on an entity's religious \"status.\"  But we have repeatedly said that it can.  When confronted with government action that draws such a line, we have carefully considered whether the interests embodied in the Religion Clauses justify that line.  The question here is thus whether those interests support the line drawn in Missouri's Article I, \u00a77, separating the State's treasury from those of houses of worship.  They unquestionably do.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Establishment Clause prohibits laws \"respecting an establishment of religion\" and the Free Exercise Clause prohibits laws \"prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\"  U.\u00a0S. Const., Amdt. 1.  \"[I]f expanded to a logical extreme,\" these prohibitions \"would tend to clash with the other.\"  Walz, 397 U.\u00a0S., at 668-669.  Even in the absence of a violation of one of the Religion Clauses, the interaction of government and religion can raise concerns that sound in both Clauses.  For that reason, the government may sometimes act to accommodate those concerns, even when not required to do so by the Free Exercise Clause, without violating the Establishment Clause.  And the government may sometimes act to accommodate those concerns, even when not required to do so by the Establishment Clause, without violating the Free Exercise Clause.  \"[T]here is room for play in the joints productive of a benevolent neutrality which will permit religious exercise to exist without sponsorship and without interference.\"  Id., at 669.  This space between the two Clauses gives government some room to recognize the unique status of religious entities and to single them out on that basis for exclusion from otherwise generally applicable laws.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Invoking this principle, this Court has held that the government may sometimes relieve religious entities from the requirements of government programs.  A State need not, for example, require nonprofit houses of worship to pay property taxes.  It may instead \"spar[e] the exercise of religion from the burden of property taxation levied on private profit institutions\" and spare the government \"the direct confrontations and conflicts that follow in the train of those legal processes\" associated with taxation.  See id., at 673-674.  Nor must a State require nonprofit religious entities to abstain from making employment decisions on the basis of religion.  It may instead avoid imposing on these institutions a \"[f]ear of potential liability [that] might affect the way\" it \"carried out what it understood to be its religious mission\" and on the government the sensitive task of policing compliance.  Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S. 327, 336 (1987); see also id., at 343 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).  But the government may not invoke the space between the Religion Clauses in a manner that \"devolve[s] into an unlawful fostering of religion.\"  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.\u00a0S. 709, 714 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Invoking this same principle, this Court has held that the government may sometimes close off certain government aid programs to religious entities.  The State need not, for example, fund the training of a religious group's leaders, those \"who will preach their beliefs, teach their faith, and carry out their mission,\" Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 196.  It may instead avoid the historic \"antiestablishment interests\" raised by the use of \"taxpayer funds to support church leaders.\"  Locke v. Davey, 540 U.\u00a0S. 712, 722 (2004).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When reviewing a law that, like this one, singles out religious entities for exclusion from its reach, we thus have not myopically focused on the fact that a law singles out religious entities, but on the reasons that it does so.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Missouri has decided that the unique status of houses of worship requires a special rule when it comes to public funds.  Its Constitution reflects that choice and provides:\n\"That no money shall ever be taken from the public treasury, directly or indirectly, in aid of any church, sect, or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest, preacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such; and that no preference shall be given to nor any discrimination made against any church, sect or creed of religion, or any form of religious faith or worship.\"  Art. I, \u00a77.\nMissouri's decision, which has deep roots in our Nation's history, reflects a reasonable and constitutional judgment.\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has consistently looked to history for guidance when applying the Constitution's Religion Clauses.  Those Clauses guard against a return to the past, and so that past properly informs their meaning.  See, e.g., Everson, 330 U.\u00a0S., at 14-15; Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.\u00a0S. 488, 492 (1961).  This case is no different.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Nation's early experience with, and eventual rejection of, established religion--shorthand for \"sponsorship, financial support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious activity,\" Walz, 397 U.\u00a0S., at 668--defies easy summary.  No two States' experiences were the same.  In some a religious establishment never took hold.  See T. Curry, The First Freedoms 19, 72-74, 76-77, 159-160 (1986) (Curry).  In others establishment varied in terms of the sect (or sects) supported, the nature and extent of that support, and the uniformity of that support across the State.  Where establishment did take hold, it lost its grip at different times and at different speeds.  See T. Cobb, The Rise of Religious Liberty in America 510-511 (1970 ed.) (Cobb).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Despite this rich diversity of experience, the story relevant here is one of consistency.  The use of public funds to support core religious institutions can safely be described as a hallmark of the States' early experiences with religious establishment.  Every state establishment saw laws passed to raise public funds and direct them toward houses of worship and ministers.  And as the States all disestablished, one by one, they all undid those laws.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those who fought to end the public funding of religion based their opposition on a powerful set of arguments, all stemming from the basic premise that the practice harmed both civil government and religion.  The civil government, they maintained, could claim no authority over religious belief.  For them, support for religion compelled by the State marked an overstep of authority that would only lead to more.  Equally troubling, it risked divisiveness by giving religions reason to compete for the State's beneficence.  Faith, they believed, was a personal matter, entirely between an individual and his god.  Religion was best served when sects reached out on the basis of their tenets alone, unsullied by outside forces, allowing adherents to come to their faith voluntarily.  Over and over, these arguments gained acceptance and led to the end of state laws exacting payment for the support of religion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Take Virginia.  After the Revolution, Virginia debated and rejected a general religious assessment.  The proposed bill would have allowed taxpayers to direct payments to a Christian church of their choice to support a minister, exempted \"Quakers and Menonists,\" and sent undirected assessments to the public treasury for \"seminaries of learning.\"  A Bill Establishing a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion, reprinted in Everson, 330 U.\u00a0S., at 74 (supplemental appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In opposing this proposal, James Madison authored his famous Memorial and Remonstrance, in which he condemned the bill as hostile to religious freedom.  Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments (1785), in 5 The Founders' Constitution 82-84 (P. Kurland & R. Lerner eds. 1987).  Believing it \"proper to take alarm,\" despite the bill's limits, he protested \"that the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to any other establishment.\"  Id., at 82.  Religion had \"flourished, not only without the support of human laws, but in spite of every opposition from them.\"  Id., at 83.  Compelled support for religion, he argued, would only weaken believers' \"confidence in its innate excellence,\" strengthen others' \"suspicion that its friends are too conscious of its fallacies to trust in its own merits,\" and harm the \"purity and efficacy\" of the supported religion.  Ibid.  He ended by deeming  the bill incompatible with Virginia's guarantee of \"\u00a0'free exercise of .\u00a0.\u00a0. Religion according to the dictates of conscience.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 84.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Madison contributed one influential voice to a larger chorus of petitions opposed to the bill.  Others included \"the religious bodies of Baptists, Presbyterians, and Quakers.\"  T. Buckley, Church and State in Revolutionary Virginia 1776-1787, p. 148 (1977).  Their petitions raised similar points.  See id., at 137-140, 148-149.  Like Madison, many viewed the bill as a step toward a dangerous church-state relationship.  See id., at 151.  These voices against the bill won out, and Virginia soon prohibited religious assessments.  See Virginia Act for Establishing Religious Freedom (Oct. 31, 1785), in 5 The Founders' Constitution 84-85.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This same debate played out in nearby Maryland, with the same result.  In 1784, an assessment bill was proposed that would have allowed taxpayers to direct payments to ministers (of sufficiently large churches) or to the poor.  Non-Christians were exempt.  See Curry 155.  Controversy over the bill \"eclipse[d] in volume of writing and bitterness of invective every other political dispute since the debate over the question of independence.\"  J. Rainbolt, The Struggle To Define \"Religious Liberty\" in Maryland, 1776-85, 17 J. Church & State 443, 449 (1975).  Critics of the bill raised the same themes as those in Virginia: that religion \"needs not the power of rules to establish, but only to protect it\"; that financial support of religion leads toward an establishment; and that laws for such support are \"oppressive.\"  Curry 156, 157 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Copy of Petition [to General Assembly], Maryland Gazette, Mar. 25, 1785, pp.\u00a01, 2, col.1 (\"[W]hy should such as do not desire or make conscience of it, be forced by law\").  When the legislature next met, most representatives \"had been elected by anti-assessment voters,\" and the bill failed.  Curry 157.  In 1810, Maryland revoked the authority to levy religious assessments.  See Md. Const., Amdt. XIII (1776), in 3 Federal and State Constitutions 1705 (F. Thorpe ed. 1909) (Thorpe).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In New England, which took longer to reach this conclusion, Vermont went first.  Its religious assessment laws were accommodating.  A person who was not a member of his town's church was, upon securing a certificate to that effect, exempt.  See L. Levy, The Establishment Clause 50 (1994) (Levy).  Even so, the laws were viewed by many as violating Vermont's constitutional prohibition against involuntary support of religion and guarantee of freedom of conscience.  See, e.g., Address of Council of Censors to the People of Vermont 5-8 (1800) (\"[R]eligion is a concern personally and exclusively operative between the individual and his God\"); Address of Council of Censors [Vermont] 3-7 (Dec. 1806) (the laws' \"evils\" included \"violence done to the feelings of men\" and \"their property,\" \"animosities,\" and \"the dangerous lengths of which it is a foundation for us to go, in both civil and religious usurpation\").  In 1807, Vermont \"repealed all laws concerning taxation for religion.\"  Levy 51.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The rest of New England heard the same arguments and reached the same conclusion.  John Leland's sustained criticism of religious assessments over 20 years helped end the practice in Connecticut.  See, e.g., Esbeck, Dissent and Disestablishment: The Church-State Settlement in the Early American Republic, 2004 B. Y. U. L.\u00a0Rev. 1385, 1498, 1501-1511.  The reasons he offered in urging opposition to the State's laws will by now be familiar.  Religion \"is a matter between God and individuals,\" which does not need, and would only be harmed by, government support.  J. Leland, The Rights of Conscience Inalienable (1791), in The Sacred Rights of Conscience 337-339 (D. Dreisbach & M. Hall eds. 2009).  \"[T]ruth gains honor; and men more firmly believe it,\" when religion is subjected to the \"cool investigation and fair argument\" that freedom of conscience produces.  Id., at 340.  Religious assessments violated that freedom, he argued.  See id., at 342 (\"If these people bind nobody but themselves, who is injured by their religious opinions? But if they bind an individual besides themselves, the bond is fraudulent and ought to be declared illegal\").  Connecticut ended religious assessments first by statute in 1817, then by its State Constitution of 1818.  See Cobb 513.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In New Hampshire, a steady campaign against religious assessments led to a bill that was subjected to \"the scrutiny of the people.\"  C. Kinney, Church & State: The Struggle for Separation in New Hampshire, 1630-1900, p. 101 (1955) (Kinney).  It was nicknamed \"Dr. Whipple's Act\" after its strongest advocate in the State House.  Orford Union Congregational Soc. v. West Congregational Soc. of Orford, 55 N. H. 463, 468-469, n. (1875).  He defended the bill as a means \"to take religion out of politics, to eliminate state support, to insure opportunity to worship with true freedom of conscience, [and] to put all sects and denominations of Christians upon a level.\"  Kinney 103.  The bill became law and provided \"that no person shall be compelled to join or support, or be classed with, or associated to any congregation, church or religious society without his express consent first had and obtained.\"  Act [of July 1, 1819] Regulating Towns and Choice of Town Officers \u00a73, in 1 Laws of the State of New Hampshire Enacted Since June 1, 1815, p. 45 (1824).  Massachusetts held on the longest of all the States, finally ending religious assessments in 1833.  See Cobb 515.6\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The course of this history shows that those who lived under the laws and practices that formed religious establishments made a considered decision that civil government should not fund ministers and their houses of worship.  \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To us, their debates may seem abstract and this history remote.  That is only because we live in a society that has long benefited from decisions made in response to these now centuries-old arguments, a society that those not so fortunate fought hard to build.\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Locke, this Court expressed an understanding of, and respect for, this history.  Locke involved a provision of the State of Washington's Constitution that, like Missouri's nearly identical Article I, \u00a77, barred the use of public funds for houses of worship or ministers.  Consistent with this denial of funds to ministers, the State's college scholarship program did not allow funds to be used for devotional theology degrees.  When asked whether this violated the would-be minister's free exercise rights, the Court invoked the play in the joints principle and answered no.  The Establishment Clause did not require the prohibition because \"the link between government funds and religious training [was] broken by the independent and private choice of [scholarship] recipients.\"  540 U.\u00a0S., at 719; see also supra, n. 2.  Nonetheless, the denial did not violate the Free Exercise Clause because a \"historic and substantial state interest\" supported the constitutional provision.  540 U.\u00a0S., at 725.  The Court could \"think of few areas in which a State's antiestablishment interests come more into play\" than the \"procuring [of] taxpayer funds to support church leaders.\"  Id., at 722.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The same is true of this case, about directing taxpayer funds to houses of worship, see supra, at 2.  Like the use of public dollars for ministers at issue in Locke, turning over public funds to houses of worship implicates serious antiestablishment and free exercise interests.  The history just discussed fully supports this conclusion.  As states disestablished, they repealed laws allowing taxation to support religion because the practice threatened other forms of government support for, involved some government control over, and weakened supporters' control of religion.  Common sense also supports this conclusion.  Recall that a state may not fund religious activities without violating the Establishment Clause.  See Part II-A, supra.  A state can reasonably use status as a \"house of worship\" as a stand-in for \"religious activities.\"  Inside a house of worship, dividing the religious from the secular would require intrusive line-drawing by government, and monitoring those lines would entangle government with the house of worship's activities.  And so while not every activity a house of worship undertakes will be inseparably linked to religious activity, \"the likelihood that many are makes a categorical rule a suitable means to avoid chilling the exercise of religion.\"  Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 345 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).  Finally, and of course, such funding implicates the free exercise rights of taxpayers by denying them the chance to decide for themselves whether and how to fund religion.  If there is any \"\u00a0'room for play in the joints' between\" the Religion Clauses, it is here.  Locke, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 718 (quoting Walz, 397 U.\u00a0S., at 669).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As was true in Locke, a prophylactic rule against the use of public funds for houses of worship is a permissible accommodation of these weighty interests.  The rule has a historical pedigree identical to that of the provision in Locke.  Almost all of the States that ratified the Religion Clauses operated under this rule.  See 540 U.\u00a0S., at 723.  Seven had placed this rule in their State Constitutions.7  Three enforced it by statute or in practice.8  Only one had not yet embraced the rule.9  Today, thirty-eight States have a counterpart to Missouri's Article I, \u00a77.10  The provisions, as a general matter, date back to or before these States' original Constitutions.11  That so many States have for so long drawn a line that prohibits public funding for houses of worship, based on principles rooted in this Nation's understanding of how best to foster religious liberty, supports the conclusion that public funding of houses of worship \"is of a different ilk.\"  Locke, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 723.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And as in Locke, Missouri's Article I, \u00a77, is closely tied to the state interests it protects.  See Locke, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 724 (describing the program at issue as \"go[ing] a long way toward including religion in its benefits\").  A straightforward reading of Article I, \u00a77, prohibits funding only for \"any church, sect, or denomination of religion, or in aid of any priest, preacher, minister or teacher thereof, as such.\"  The Missouri courts have not read the State's Constitution to reach more broadly, to prohibit funding for other religiously affiliated institutions, or more broadly still, to prohibit the funding of religious believers.  See, e.g., Saint Louis Univ. v. Masonic Temple Assn. of St. Louis, 220 S.\u00a0W. 3d 721, 726 (Mo. 2007) (\"The university is not a religious institution simply because it is affiliated with the Jesuits or the Roman Catholic Church\").  The Scrap Tire Program at issue here proves the point.  Missouri will fund a religious organization not \"owned or controlled by a church,\" if its \"mission and activities are secular (separate from religion, not spiritual in) nature\" and the funds \"will be used for secular (separate from religion; not spiritual) purposes rather than for sectarian (denominational, devoted to a sect) purposes.\"  App. to Brief for Petitioner 3a; see also Tr. of Oral Arg. 33-35.  Article I, \u00a77, thus stops Missouri only from funding specific entities, ones that set and enforce religious doctrine for their adherents.  These are the entities that most acutely raise the establishment and free exercise concerns that arise when public funds flow to religion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Missouri has recognized the simple truth that, even absent an Establishment Clause violation, the transfer of public funds to houses of worship raises concerns that sit exactly between the Religion Clauses.  To avoid those concerns, and only those concerns, it has prohibited such funding.  In doing so, it made the same choice made by the earliest States centuries ago and many other States in the years since.  The Constitution permits this choice.\n3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the Court's view, none of this matters.  It focuses on one aspect of Missouri's Article I, \u00a77, to the exclusion of all else: that it denies funding to a house of worship, here the Church, \"simply because of what it [i]s--a church.\"  Ante, at 12.  The Court describes this as a constitutionally impermissible line based on religious \"status\" that requires strict scrutiny.  Its rule is out of step with our precedents in this area, and wrong on its own terms.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Constitution creates specific rules that control how the government may interact with religious entities.  And so of course a government may act based on a religious entity's \"status\" as such.  It is that very status that implicates the interests protected by the Religion Clauses.  Sometimes a religious entity's unique status requires the government to act.  See Hosanna-Tabor, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 188-190.  Other times, it merely permits the government to act.  See Part III-A, supra.  In all cases, the dispositive issue is not whether religious \"status\" matters--it does, or the Religion Clauses would not be at issue--but whether the government must, or may, act on that basis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Start where the Court stays silent.  Its opinion does not acknowledge that our precedents have expressly approved of a government's choice to draw lines based on an entity's religious status.  See Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 339; Walz, 397 U.\u00a0S., at 680; Locke, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 721.  Those cases did not deploy strict scrutiny to create a presumption of unconstitutionality, as the Court does today.  Instead, they asked whether the government had offered a strong enough reason to justify drawing a line based on that status.  See Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 339 (\"[W]e see no justification for applying strict scrutiny\"); Walz, 397 U.\u00a0S., at 679 (rejecting criticisms of a case-by-case approach as giving \"too little weight to the fact that it is an essential part of adjudication to draw distinctions, including fine ones, in the process of interpreting the Constitution\"); Locke, 540 U.\u00a0S., at 725 (balancing the State's interests against the aspiring minister's).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court takes two steps to avoid these precedents.  First, it recasts Locke as a case about a restriction that prohibited the would-be minister from \"us[ing] the funds to prepare for the ministry.\"  Ante, at 12.  A faithful reading of Locke gives it a broader reach.  Locke stands for the reasonable proposition that the government may, but need not, choose not to fund certain religious entities (there, ministers) where doing so raises \"historic and substantial\" establishment and free exercise concerns.  540 U. S., at 725.  Second, it suggests that this case is different because it involves \"discrimination\" in the form of the denial of access to a possible benefit.  Ante, at 11.  But in this area of law, a decision to treat entities differently based on distinctions that the Religion Clauses make relevant does not amount to discrimination.12  To understand why, keep in mind that \"the Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embraces the right to select any religious faith or none at all.\"  Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.\u00a0S. 38, 52-53 (1985).  If the denial of a benefit others may receive is discrimination that violates the Free Exercise Clause, then the accommodations of religious entities we have approved would violate the free exercise rights of nonreligious entities.  We have, with good reason, rejected that idea, see, e.g., Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 338-339, and instead focused on whether the government has provided a good enough reason, based in the values the Religion Clauses protect, for its decision.13\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court offers no real reason for rejecting the balancing approach in our precedents in favor of strict scrutiny, beyond its references to discrimination.  The Court's desire to avoid what it views as discrimination is understandable.  But in this context, the description is particularly inappropriate.  A State's decision not to fund houses of worship does not disfavor religion; rather, it represents a valid choice to remain secular in the face of serious establishment and free exercise concerns.  That does not make the State \"atheistic or antireligious.\"  County of Allegheny v. American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, 492 U.\u00a0S. 573, 610 (1989).  It means only that the State has \"establishe[d] neither atheism nor religion as its official creed.\"  Ibid.  The Court's conclusion \"that the only alternative to governmental support of religion is governmental hostility to it represents a giant step backward in our Religion Clause jurisprudence.\"  Id., at 652, n.\u00a011 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At bottom, the Court creates the following rule today: The government may draw lines on the basis of religious status to grant a benefit to religious persons or entities but it may not draw lines on that basis when doing so would further the interests the Religion Clauses protect in other ways.  Nothing supports this lopsided outcome.  Not the Religion Clauses, as they protect establishment and free exercise interests in the same constitutional breath, neither privileged over the other.  Not precedent, since we have repeatedly explained that the Clauses protect not religion but \"the individual's freedom of conscience,\" Jaffree, 472 U.\u00a0S., at 50--that which allows him to choose religion, reject it, or remain undecided.  And not reason, because as this case shows, the same interests served by lifting government-imposed burdens on certain religious entities may sometimes be equally served by denying government-provided benefits to certain religious entities.  Cf. Walz, 397 U.\u00a0S., at 674 (entanglement); Amos, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 336 (influence on religious activities).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer's concurrence offers a narrower rule that would limit the effects of today's decision, but that rule does not resolve this case.  Justice Breyer, like the Court, thinks that \"denying a generally available benefit solely on account of religious identity imposes a penalty on the free exercise of religion that can be justified only by a state interest of the highest order,\" ante, at 6 (majority opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted).  See ante, at 1-2 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).  Few would disagree with a literal interpretation of this statement.  To fence out religious persons or entities from a truly generally available public benefit--one provided to all, no questions asked, such as police or fire protections--would violate the Free Exercise Clause.  Accord, Rosenberger, 515 U.\u00a0S., at 879, n. 5 (Souter, J., dissenting).  This explains why Missouri does not apply its constitutional provision in that manner.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 35-36.  Nor has it done so here.  The Scrap Tire Program offers not a generally available benefit but a selective benefit for a few recipients each year.  In this context, the comparison to truly generally available benefits is inapt.  Cf. Everson, 330 U.\u00a0S., at 61, n. 56 (Rutledge, J., dissenting) (The Religion Clauses \"forbi[d] support, not protection from interference or destruction\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On top of all of this, the Court's application of its new rule here is mistaken.  In concluding that Missouri's Article I, \u00a77, cannot withstand strict scrutiny, the Court describes Missouri's interest as a mere \"policy preference for skating as far as possible from religious establishment concerns.\"  Ante, at 14.  The constitutional provisions of thirty-nine States--all but invalidated today--the weighty interests they protect, and the history they draw on deserve more than this judicial brush aside.14\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Today's decision discounts centuries of history and jeopardizes the government's ability to remain secular.  Just three years ago, this Court claimed to understand that, in this area of law, to \"sweep away what has so long been settled would create new controversy and begin anew the very divisions along religious lines that the Establishment Clause seeks to prevent.\"  Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8).  It makes clear today that this principle applies only when preference suits.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Religion Clauses of the First Amendment contain a promise from our government and a backstop that disables our government from breaking it.  The Free Exercise Clause extends the promise.  We each retain our inalienable right to \"the free exercise\" of religion, to choose for ourselves whether to believe and how to worship.  And the Establishment Clause erects the backstop.  Government cannot, through the enactment of a \"law respecting an establishment of religion,\" start us down the path to the past, when this right was routinely abridged.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court today dismantles a core protection for religious freedom provided in these Clauses.  It holds not just that a government may support houses of worship with taxpayer funds, but that--at least in this case and perhaps in others, see ante at 14, n. 3--it must do so whenever it decides to create a funding program.  History shows that the Religion Clauses separate the public treasury from religious coffers as one measure to secure the kind of freedom of conscience that benefits both religion and government.  If this separation means anything, it means that the government cannot, or at the very least need not, tax its citizens and turn that money over to houses of worship.  The Court today blinds itself to the outcome this history requires and leads us instead to a place where separation of church and state is a constitutional slogan, not a constitutional commitment.  I dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0In April 2017, the Governor of Missouri announced that he had directed the Department to begin allowing religious organizations to compete for and receive Department grants on the same terms as secular organizations.  That announcement does not moot this case.

Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.\u00a0S. 167, 189 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Department has not carried the \"heavy burden\" of making \"absolutely clear\" that it could not revert to its policy of excluding religious organizations.  Ibid.  The parties agree. See Letter from James R. Layton, Counsel for Respondent, to Scott S. Harris, Clerk of Court (Apr. 18, 2017) (adopting the position of the Missouri Attorney General's Office that \"there is no clearly effective barrier that would prevent the [Department] from reinstating [its] policy in the future\"); Letter from David A. Cortman, Counsel for Petitioner, to Scott S. Harris, Clerk of Court (Apr. 18, 2017) (\"[T]he policy change does nothing to remedy the source of the [Department's] original policy--the Missouri Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 1, \u00a77 of the Missouri Constitution\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0This is not to say that any application of a valid and neutral law of general applicability is necessarily constitutional under the Free Exercise Clause.  Recently, in Hosanna-Tabor Evangelical Lutheran Church and School v. EEOC, 565 U.\u00a0S. 171 (2012), this Court held that the Religion Clauses required a ministerial exception to the neutral prohibition on employment retaliation contained in the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Distinguishing Smith, we explained that while that case concerned government regulation of physical acts, \"[t]he present case, in contrast, concerns government interference with an internal church decision that affects the faith and mission of the church itself.\"  565 U.\u00a0S., at 190.\nFootnote 3\u00a0This case involves express discrimination based on religious identity with respect to playground resurfacing.  We do not address religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.\nFootnote 4\u00a0We have held that \"a law targeting religious beliefs as such is never permissible.\"  Lukumi, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 533; see also McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.\u00a0S. 618, 626 (1978) (plurality opinion).  We do not need to decide whether the condition Missouri imposes in this case falls within the scope of that rule, because it cannot survive strict scrutiny in any event.\nFootnote 5\u00a0Based on this holding, we need not reach the Church's claim that the policy also violates the Equal Protection Clause.\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0Government aid that has the \"purpose\" or \"effect of advancing or inhibiting religion\" violates the Establishment Clause.  Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.\u00a0S. 203, 222-223 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Whether government aid has such an effect turns on whether it \"result[s] in governmental indoctrination,\" \"define[s] its recipients by reference to religion,\" or \"create[s] an excessive entanglement\" between the government and religion.  Id., at 234; see also id., at 235 (same considerations speak to whether the aid can \"reasonably be viewed as an endorsement of religion\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0Because Missouri decides which Scrap Tire Program applicants receive state funding, this case does not implicate a line of decisions about indirect aid programs in which aid reaches religious institutions \"only as a result of the genuine and independent choices of private individuals.\"  Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, 536 U.\u00a0S. 639, 649 (2002).\nFootnote 3\u00a0The Scrap Tire Program requires an applicant to certify, among other things, that its mission and activities are secular and that it will put program funds to only a secular use.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 127a-130a.  From the record, it is unclear whether the Church provided any part of this certification.  Id., at 127a-130a.  In any case, the Church has not offered any such assurances to this Court.\nFootnote 4\u00a0This case highlights the weaknesses of the rule.  The Scrap Tire Program ranks more highly those applicants who agree to generate media exposure for Missouri and its program and who receive the endorsement of local solid waste management entities.  That is, it prefers applicants who agree to advertise that the government has funded it and who seek out the approval of government agencies.  To ignore this result is to ignore the type of state entanglement with, and endorsement of, religion the Establishment Clause guards against.\nFootnote 5\u00a0This Court did not hold that the Religion Clauses applied, through the Fourteenth Amendment, to the States until the 1940's.  See Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.\u00a0S. 296 (1940) (Free Exercise Clause); Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.\u00a0S. 1 (1947) (Establishment Clause).  When the States dismantled their religious establishments, as all had by the 1830's, they did so on their own accord, in response to the lessons taught by their experiences with religious establishments.\nFootnote 6\u00a0To this, some might point out that the Scrap Tire Program at issue here does not impose an assessment specifically for religious entities but rather directs funds raised through a general taxation scheme to the Church.  That distinction makes no difference.  The debates over religious assessment laws focused not on the means of those laws but on their ends: the turning over of public funds to religious entities.  See, e.g., Locke v. Davey, 540 U.\u00a0S. 712, 723 (2004).\nFootnote 7\u00a0See N. J. Const., Art. XVIII (1776), in 5 Thorpe 2597  (\"[N]or shall any person, within this Colony, ever be obliged to pay tithes, taxes, or any other rates, for the purpose of building or repairing any other church or churches, place or places of worship, or for the maintenance of any minister or ministry, contrary to what he believes to be right, or has deliberately or voluntarily engaged himself to perform\"); N.

III (1786), in id., at 3752 (\"[N]o man ought, or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship, or erect, or support any place of worship, or maintain any minister, contrary to the dictates of his conscience\").\nDelaware and New York's Constitutions did not directly address,  but were understood to prohibit, public funding of religion.  See Curry, 76, 162; see also Del. Const., Art. I, \u00a71 (1792) (\"[N]o man shall or ought to be compelled to attend any religious worship, to contribute to the erection or support of any place of worship, or to the maintenance of any ministry, against his own free will and consent\").\nFootnote 8\u00a0See Virginia, Act for Establishing Religious Freedom, in 5 The Founders' Constitution 85 (P.

See ante, at 11 (citing Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville, 508 U.\u00a0S. 656 (1993)).\nFootnote 13\u00a0No surprise then that, despite the Court's protests to the contrary, no case has applied its rigid rule.  McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.\u00a0S. 618 (1978), on which the Court relies most heavily, mentioned \"status\" only to distinguish laws that deprived a person \"of a civil right solely because of their religious beliefs.\"  Id., at 626-627 (plurality opinion).  In Torcaso v. Watkins, 367 U.\u00a0S. 488 (1961), the Court invalidated a law that barred persons who refused to state their belief in God from public office without \"evaluat[ing] the interests assertedly justifying it.\"  McDaniel, 435 U. S., at 626 (plurality opinion).  That approach did not control in McDaniel, which involved a state constitutional provision that barred ministers from serving as legislators, because \"ministerial status\" was defined \"in terms of conduct and activity,\" not \"belief.\"  Id., at 627.  The Court thus asked whether the \"anti-establishment interests\" the State offered were strong enough to justify the denial of a constitutional right--to serve in public office--and concluded that they were not.  Id., at 627-629.  Other references to \"status\" in our cases simply recount McDaniel.  See, e.g., Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah, 508 U.\u00a0S. 520, 533 (1993); Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith, 494 U.\u00a0S. 872, 877 (1990).\nFootnote 14\u00a0In the end, the soundness of today's decision may matter less than what it might enable tomorrow.  The principle it establishes can be manipulated to call for a similar fate for lines drawn on the basis of religious use.  See ante, at 1-3 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part); see also ante, at 1-2 (Thomas, J., concurring in part) (going further and suggesting that lines drawn on the basis of religious status amount to per\u00a0se unconstitutional discrimination on the basis of religious belief\u00a0).  It is enough for today to explain why the Court's decision is wrong.  The error of the concurrences' hoped-for decisions can be left for tomorrow.  See, for now, School Dist. of Abington Township v. Schempp, 374 U.\u00a0S. 203, 226 (1963) (\"While the Free Exercise Clause clearly prohibits the use of state action to deny the rights of free exercise to anyone, it has never meant that a majority could use the machinery of the State to practice its beliefs\").\n\n\n","77":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTRUEHILL  v.

Among other directives, the order suspended entry of foreign nationals from seven countries identified as presenting heightened terrorism risks--Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen--for 90 days.  \u00a73(c).  Executive officials were instructed to review the adequacy of current practices relating to visa adjudications during this 90-day period.  \u00a73(a).  EO-1 also modified refugee policy, suspending the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP) for 120 days and reducing the number of refugees eligible to be admitted to the United States during fiscal year 2017.  \u00a7\u00a75(a), (d).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0EO-1 was immediately challenged in court.  Just a week after the order was issued, a Federal District Court entered a nationwide temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of several of its key provisions.  Washington v. Trump, 2017 WL 462040 (WD Wash., Feb. 3, 2017).  Six days later, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied the Government's emergency motion to stay the order pending appeal.  Washington v. Trump, 847 F. 3d 1151 (2017).  Rather than continue to litigate EO-1, the Government announced that it would revoke the order and issue a new one.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A second order followed on March 6, 2017.  See Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, Exec. Order No. 13780, 82 Fed. Reg. 13209 (EO-2).  EO-2 describes \"conditions in six of the .\u00a0.\u00a0. countries\" as to which EO-1 had suspended entry, stating that these conditions \"demonstrate [that] nationals [of those countries] continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States,\" \u00a71(e), and that \"some of those who have entered the United States through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security,\" \u00a71(h).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having identified these concerns, EO-2 sets out a series of directives patterned on those found in EO-1.  Several are relevant here.  First, EO-2 directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to conduct a global review to determine whether foreign governments provide adequate information about nationals applying for United States visas.  \u00a72(a).  EO-2 directs the Secretary to report his findings to the President within 20 days of the order's \"effective date,\" after which time those nations identified as deficient will be given 50 days to alter their practices.  \u00a7\u00a72(b), (d)-(e).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, EO-2 directs that entry of nationals from six of the seven countries designated in EO-1--Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen--be \"suspended for 90 days from the effective date\" of the order.  \u00a72(c).  EO-2 explains that this pause is necessary to ensure that dangerous individuals do not enter the United States while the Executive is working to establish \"adequate standards .\u00a0.\u00a0. to prevent infiltration by foreign terrorists\"; in addition, suspending entry will \"temporarily reduce investigative burdens on agencies\" during the Secretary's 20-day review.  Ibid.  A separate section provides for case-by-case waivers of the entry bar.  \u00a73(c).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, EO-2 suspends \"decisions on applications for refugee status\" and \"travel of refugees into the United States under the USRAP\" for 120 days following its effective date.  \u00a76(a).  During that period, the Secretary of State is instructed to review the adequacy of USRAP application and adjudication procedures and implement whatever additional procedures are necessary \"to ensure that individuals seeking admission as refugees do not pose a threat\" to national security.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, citing the President's determination that \"the entry of more than 50,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017 would be detrimental to the interests of the United States,\" EO-2 \"suspend[s] any entries in excess of that number\" for this fiscal year.  \u00a76(b).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, \u00a714 of EO-2 establishes the order's effective date: March 16, 2017.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents in these cases filed separate lawsuits challenging EO-2.  As relevant, they argued that the order violates the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because it was motivated not by concerns pertaining to national security, but by animus toward Islam.  They further argued that EO-2 does not comply with certain provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 66 Stat. 187, as amended.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In No. 16-1436, a Federal District Court concluded that respondents were likely to succeed on their Establishment Clause claim with respect to \u00a72(c) of EO-2--the provision temporarily suspending entry from six countries--and entered a nationwide preliminary injunction barring the Government from enforcing \u00a72(c) against any foreign national seeking entry to the United States.  International Refugee Assistance Project v. Trump, ___ F.\u00a0Supp. 3d ___, 2017 WL 1018235 (D Md., Mar. 16, 2017) (IRAP).  The District Court in No. 16-1540--likewise relying on the Establishment Clause--entered a broader preliminary injunction: The court enjoined nationwide enforcement of all of \u00a7\u00a72 and 6.  Hawaii v. Trump, ___ F.\u00a0Supp. 3d ___, 2017 WL 1167383 (D Haw., Mar. 29, 2017) (entering preliminary injunction); ___ F.\u00a0Supp. 3d ___, 2017 WL 1011673 (D Haw., Mar. 15, 2017) (entering temporary restraining order).  In addition to the \u00a72(c) suspension of entry, this injunction covered the \u00a76(a) suspension of refugee admissions, the \u00a76(b) reduction in the refugee cap, and the provisions in \u00a7\u00a72 and 6 pertaining only to internal executive review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These orders, entered before EO-2 went into effect, prevented the Government from initiating enforcement of the challenged provisions.  The Government filed appeals in both cases.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled first.  On May 25, over three dissenting votes, the en banc court issued a decision in IRAP that largely upheld the order enjoining enforcement of \u00a72(c).  857 F.\u00a03d 554.  The majority determined that respondent John Doe #1, a lawful permanent resident whose Iranian wife is seeking entry to the United States, was likely to succeed on the merits of his Establishment Clause claim.  The majority concluded that the primary purpose of \u00a72(c) was religious, in violation of the First Amendment: A reasonable observer familiar with all the circumstances--including the predominantly Muslim character of the designated countries and statements made by President Trump during his Presidential campaign--would conclude that \u00a72(c) was motivated principally by a desire to exclude Muslims from the United States, not by considerations relating to national security.  Having reached this conclusion, the court upheld the preliminary injunction prohibiting enforcement of \u00a72(c) against any foreign national seeking to enter this country.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On June 1, the Government filed a petition for certiorari seeking review of the Fourth Circuit's decision.  It also filed applications seeking stays of both injunctions, including the Hawaii injunction still pending before the Ninth Circuit.  In addition, the Government requested that this Court expedite the certiorari stage briefing.  We accordingly directed respondents to file responses to the stay applications by June 12 and respondents in IRAP to file a brief in opposition to the Government's petition for certiorari by the same day.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents' June 12 filings injected a new issue into the cases.  In IRAP, respondents argued that the suspension of entry in \u00a72(c) would expire on June 14.  Section 2(c), they reasoned, directs that entry \"be suspended for 90 days from the effective date of\" EO-2.  The \"effective date\" of EO-2 was March 16.  \u00a714.  Although courts had enjoined portions of EO-2, they had not altered its effective date, nor so much as mentioned \u00a714.  Thus, even though it had never been enforced, the entry suspension would expire 90 days from March 16: June 14.  At that time, the dispute over \u00a72(c) would become moot.  Brief in Opposition 13-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the same day respondents filed, the Ninth Circuit ruled in Hawaii.  ___ F.\u00a03d ___, 2017 WL 2529640 (June 12, 2017) (\u00a0per curiam).  A unanimous panel held in favor of respondents the State of Hawaii and Dr. Ismail Elshikh, an American citizen and imam whose Syrian mother-in-law is seeking entry to this country.  Rather than rely on the constitutional grounds supporting the District Court's decision, the court held that portions of EO-2 likely exceeded the President's authority under the INA.  On that basis it upheld the injunction as to the \u00a72(c) entry suspension, the \u00a76(a) suspension of refugee admissions, and the \u00a76(b) refugee cap.  The Ninth Circuit, like the Fourth Circuit, concluded that the injunction should bar enforcement of these provisions across the board, because they would violate the INA \"in all applications.\"  Id., at *28.  The court did, however, narrow the injunction so that it would not bar the Government from undertaking the internal executive reviews directed by EO-2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We granted the parties' requests for supplemental briefing addressed to the decision of the Ninth Circuit.  Before those briefs were filed, however, the ground shifted again.  On June 14, evidently in response to the argument that \u00a72(c) was about to expire, President Trump issued a memorandum to Executive Branch officials.  The memorandum declared the effective date of each enjoined provision of EO-2 to be the date on which the injunctions in these cases \"are lifted or stayed with respect to that provision.\"  Presidential Memorandum for the Secretary of State, the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Director of National Intelligence (June 14, 2017).  The memorandum further provided that, to the extent necessary, it \"should be construed to amend the Executive Order.\"  Ibid.  The Government takes the view that, if any mootness problem existed previously, the President's memorandum has cured it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The parties have since completed briefing, with the Government requesting that we construe its supplemental brief in Hawaii as a petition for certiorari.  There is no objection from respondents, and we do so.  Both petitions for certiorari and both stay applications are accordingly ripe for consideration.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government seeks review on several issues.  In IRAP, the Government argues that respondent Doe lacks standing to challenge \u00a72(c).*  The Government also contends that Doe's Establishment Clause claim fails on the merits.  In its view, the Fourth Circuit should not have asked whether \u00a72(c) has a primarily religious purpose.  The court instead should have upheld EO-2 because it rests on the \"facially legitimate and bona fide\" justification of protecting national security.  Kleindienst v. Mandel, 408 U.\u00a0S. 753, 770 (1972).  In addition, the Fourth Circuit erred by focusing on the President's campaign-trail comments to conclude that \u00a72(c)--religiously neutral on its face--nonetheless has a principally religious purpose.  At the very least, the Government argues, the injunction is too broad.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Hawaii, the Government likewise argues that respondents Hawaii and Dr. Elshikh lack standing and that (at a minimum) the injunction should be narrowed.  The Government's principal merits contention pertains to a statutory provision authorizing the President to \"suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens\" to this country \"[w]henever [he] finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens .\u00a0.\u00a0. would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"  8 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71182(f).  The Ninth Circuit held that \"[t]here is no sufficient finding in [EO-2] that the entry of the excluded classes would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.\"  Hawaii, 2017 WL 2529640, at *14.  This, the Government argues, constitutes impermissible judicial second-guessing of the President's judgment on a matter of national security.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to seeking certiorari, the Government asks the Court to stay the injunctions entered below, thereby permitting the enjoined provisions to take effect.  According to the Government, it is likely to suffer irreparable harm unless a stay issues.  Focusing mostly on \u00a72(c), and pointing to the descriptions of conditions in the six designated nations, the Government argues that a 90-day pause on entry is necessary to prevent potentially dangerous individuals from entering the United States while the Executive reviews the adequacy of information provided by foreign governments in connection with visa adjudications.  Additionally, the Government asserts, the temporary bar is needed to reduce the Executive's investigative burdens while this review proceeds.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To begin, we grant both of the Government's petitions for certiorari and consolidate the cases for argument.  The Clerk is directed to set a briefing schedule that will permit the cases to be heard during the first session of October Term 2017.  (The Government has not requested that we expedite consideration of the merits to a greater extent.)  In addition to the issues identified in the petitions, the parties are directed to address the following question: \"Whether the challenges to \u00a72(c) became moot on June 14, 2017.\"\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We now turn to the preliminary injunctions barring enforcement of the \u00a72(c) entry suspension.  We grant the Government's applications to stay the injunctions, to the extent the injunctions prevent enforcement of \u00a72(c) with respect to foreign nationals who lack any bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.  We leave the injunctions entered by the lower courts in place with respect to respondents and those similarly situated, as specified in this opinion.  See infra, at 11-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Crafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of discretion and judgment, often dependent as much on the equities of a given case as the substance of the legal issues it presents.  See Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.\u00a0S. 7, 20, 24 (2008); 11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a72948 (3d ed. 2013).  The purpose of such interim equitable relief is not to conclusively determine the rights of the parties, University of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.\u00a0S. 390, 395 (1981), but to balance the equities as the litigation moves forward.  In awarding a preliminary injunction a court must also \"conside[r] .\u00a0.\u00a0. the overall public interest.\"  Winter, supra, at 26.  In the course of doing so, a court \"need not grant the total relief sought by the applicant but may mold its decree to meet the exigencies of the particular case.\"  Wright, supra, \u00a72947, at 115.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Here, of course, we are not asked to grant a preliminary injunction, but to stay one.  In assessing the lower courts' exercise of equitable discretion, we bring to bear an equitable judgment of our own.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.\u00a0S. 418, 433 (2009).  Before issuing a stay, \"[i]t is ultimately necessary .\u00a0.\u00a0. to balance the equities--to explore the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.\"  Barnes v. E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital Medical & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.\u00a0S. 1301, 1305 (1991) (Scalia, J., in chambers) (internal quotation marks omitted).  This Court may, in its discretion, tailor a stay so that it operates with respect to only \"some portion of the proceeding.\"  Nken, supra, at 428.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The courts below took account of the equities in fashioning interim relief, focusing specifically on the concrete burdens that would fall on Doe, Dr. Elshikh, and Hawaii if \u00a72(c) were enforced.  They reasoned that \u00a72(c) would \"directly affec[t]\" Doe and Dr. Elshikh by delaying entry of their family members to the United States.  IRAP, 857 F.\u00a03d, at 585, n. 11; see Hawaii, 2017 WL 2529640, at *7-*8, *24.  The Ninth Circuit concluded that \u00a72(c) would harm the State by preventing students from the designated nations who had been admitted to the University of Hawaii from entering this country.  These hardships, the courts reasoned, were sufficiently weighty and immediate to outweigh the Government's interest in enforcing \u00a72(c).  Having adopted this view of the equities, the courts approved injunctions that covered not just respondents, but parties similarly situated to them--that is, people or entities in the United States who have relationships with foreign nationals abroad, and whose rights might be affected if those foreign nationals were excluded.  See Mandel, 408 U.\u00a0S., at 763-765 (permitting American plaintiffs to challenge the exclusion of a foreign national on the ground that the exclusion violated their own First Amendment rights).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But the injunctions reach much further than that: They also bar enforcement of \u00a72(c) against foreign nationals abroad who have no connection to the United States at all.  The equities relied on by the lower courts do not balance the same way in that context.  Denying entry to such a foreign national does not burden any American party by reason of that party's relationship with the foreign national.  And the courts below did not conclude that exclusion  in such circumstances would impose any legally relevant hardship on the foreign national himself.  See id., at 762 (\"[A]n unadmitted and nonresident alien .\u00a0.\u00a0. ha[s] no constitutional right of entry to this country\").  So whatever burdens may result from enforcement of \u00a72(c) against a foreign national who lacks any connection to this country, they are, at a minimum, a good deal less concrete than the hardships identified by the courts below.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, the Government's interest in enforcing \u00a72(c), and the Executive's authority to do so, are undoubtedly at their peak when there is no tie between the foreign national and the United States.  Indeed, EO-2 itself distinguishes between foreign nationals who have some connection to this country, and foreign nationals who do not, by establishing a case-by-case waiver system primarily for the benefit of individuals in the former category.  See, e.g., \u00a7\u00a73(c)(i)-(vi).  The interest in preserving national security is \"an urgent objective of the highest order.\"  Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.\u00a0S. 1, 28 (2010).  To prevent the Government from pursuing that objective by enforcing \u00a72(c) against foreign nationals unconnected to the United States would appreciably injure its interests, without alleviating obvious hardship to anyone else.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We accordingly grant the Government's stay applications in part and narrow the scope of the injunctions as to \u00a72(c).  The injunctions remain in place only with respect to parties similarly situated to Doe, Dr. Elshikh, and Hawaii.  In practical terms, this means that \u00a72(c) may not be enforced against foreign nationals who have a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.  All other foreign nationals are subject to the provisions of EO-2.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The facts of these cases illustrate the sort of relationship that qualifies.  For individuals, a close familial relationship is required.  A foreign national who wishes to enter the United States to live with or visit a family member, like Doe's wife or Dr. Elshikh's mother-in-law, clearly has such a relationship.  As for entities, the relationship must be formal, documented, and formed in the ordinary course, rather than for the purpose of evading EO-2.  The students from the designated countries who have been admitted to the University of Hawaii have such a relationship with an American entity.  So too would a worker who accepted an offer of employment from an American company or a lecturer invited to address an American audience.  Not so someone who enters into a relationship simply to avoid \u00a72(c): For example, a nonprofit group devoted to immigration issues may not contact foreign nationals from the designated countries, add them to client lists, and then secure their entry by claiming injury from their exclusion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the June 12 decision of the Ninth Circuit vacating the injunction as to \u00a72(a), the executive review directed by that subsection may proceed promptly, if it is not already underway.  EO-2 instructs the Secretary of Homeland Security to complete this review within 20 days, after which time foreign governments will be given 50 days further to bring their practices into line with the Secretary's directives.  \u00a7\u00a72(a)-(b), (d).  Given the Government's representations in this litigation concerning the resources required to complete the 20-day review, we fully expect that the relief we grant today will permit the Executive to conclude its internal work and provide adequate notice to foreign governments within the 90-day life of \u00a72(c).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Hawaii injunction extends beyond \u00a72(c) to bar enforcement of the \u00a76(a) suspension of refugee admissions and the \u00a76(b) refugee cap.  In our view, the equitable balance struck above applies in this context as well.  An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded.  As to these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the injunction.  But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government's compelling need to provide for the Nation's security.  See supra, at 9-11; Haig v. Agee, 453 U.\u00a0S. 280, 307 (1981).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government's application to stay the injunction with respect to \u00a7\u00a76(a) and (b) is accordingly granted in part.  Section 6(a) may not be enforced against an individual seeking admission as a refugee who can credibly claim a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.  Nor may \u00a76(b); that is, such a person may not be excluded pursuant to \u00a76(b), even if the 50,000-person cap has been reached or exceeded.  As applied to all other individuals, the provisions may take effect.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Accordingly, the petitions for certiorari are granted, and the stay applications are granted in part.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\n\n\nDONALD J.

The decision whether to stay the injunctions is committed to our discretion, ante, at 9-10, but our discretion must be \"guided by sound legal principles,\" Nken v. Holder, 556 U.\u00a0S. 418, 434 (2009) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The two \"most critical\" factors we must consider in deciding whether to grant a stay are \"(1)\u00a0whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that [it] is likely to succeed on the merits\" and \"(2)\u00a0whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Where a party seeks a stay pending certiorari, as here, the applicant satisfies the first factor only if it can show both \"a reasonable probability that certiorari will be granted\" and \"a significant possibility that the judgment below will be reversed.\"  Barnes v. E-Systems, Inc. Group Hospital Medical & Surgical Ins. Plan, 501 U.\u00a0S. 1301, 1302 (1991) (Scalia, J., in chambers).  When we determine that those critical factors are satisfied, we must \"balance the equities\" by \"explor[ing] the relative harms to applicant and respondent, as well as the interests of the public at large.\"  Id., at 1304-1305 (internal quotation marks omitted); cf. Nken, supra, at 435 (noting that the factors of \"assessing the harm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest\" \"merge when the Government is the opposing party\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government has satisfied the standard for issuing a stay pending certiorari.  We have, of course, decided to grant certiorari.  See ante, at 8-9.  And I agree with the Court's implicit conclusion that the Government has made a strong showing that it is likely to succeed on the merits--that is, that the judgments below will be reversed.  The Government has also established that failure to stay the injunctions will cause irreparable harm by interfering with its \"compelling need to provide for the Nation's security.\"  Ante, at 13.  Finally, weighing the Government's interest in preserving national security against the hardships caused to respondents by temporary denials of entry into the country, the balance of the equities favors the Government.  I would thus grant the Government's applications for a stay in their entirety.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Reasonable minds may disagree on where the balance of equities lies as between the Government and respondents in these cases.  It would have been reasonable, perhaps, for the Court to have left the injunctions in place only as to respondents themselves.  But the Court takes the additional step of keeping the injunctions in place with regard to an unidentified, unnamed group of foreign nationals abroad.  No class has been certified, and neither party asks for the scope of relief that the Court today provides.  \"[I]njunctive relief should be no more burdensome to the defendant than necessary to provide complete relief to the plaintiffs\" in the case, Califano v. Yamasaki, 442 U.\u00a0S. 682, 702 (1979) (emphasis added), because a court's role is \"to provide relief\" only \"to claimants .\u00a0.\u00a0. who have suffered, or will imminently suffer, actual harm.\"  Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.\u00a0S. 343, 349 (1996).  In contrast, it is the role of the \"political branches\" to \"shape the institutions of government in such fashion as to comply with the laws and the Constitution.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, I fear that the Court's remedy will prove unworkable.  Today's compromise will burden executive officials with the task of deciding--on peril of contempt--whether individuals from the six affected nations who wish to enter the United States have a sufficient connection to a person or entity in this country.  See ante, at 11-12.  The compromise also will invite a flood of litigation until this case is finally resolved on the merits, as parties and courts struggle to determine what exactly constitutes a \"bona fide relationship,\" who precisely has a \"credible claim\" to that relationship, and whether the claimed relationship was formed \"simply to avoid \u00a72(c)\" of Executive Order No.\u00a013780, ante, at 11, 12.  And litigation of the factual and legal issues that are likely to arise will presumably be directed to the two District Courts whose initial orders in these cases this Court has now--unanimously--found sufficiently questionable to be stayed as to the vast majority of the people potentially affected.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1*\u00a0On June 24, 2017, this Court received a letter from counsel for Doe advising that Doe's wife received an immigrant visa on or about June 22, 2017.  The parties may address the significance of that development at the merits stage.  It does not affect our analysis of the stay issues in these cases.\n\n\n","79":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nTURNER ET AL. v. UNITED STATES(2017)\nNo. 15-1503\nArgued: March 29, 2017Decided: June 22, 2017\n\n\nPetitioners--Timothy Catlett, Russell Overton, Levy Rouse, Kelvin Smith, Charles and Christopher Turner, and Clifton Yarborough--and several others were indicted for the kidnaping, robbery, and murder of Catherine Fuller.  At trial, the Government advanced the theory that Fuller was attacked by a large group of individuals.  Its evidentiary centerpiece consisted of the testimony of Calvin Alston and Harry Bennett, who confessed to participating in a group attack and cooperated with the Government in return for leniency.  Several other Government witnesses corroborated aspects of Alston's and Bennett's testimony.  Melvin Montgomery testified that he was in a park among a group of people, heard someone say they were \"going to get that one,\" saw petitioner Overton pointing to Fuller, and saw several persons, including some petitioners, cross the street in her direction.  Maurice Thomas testified that he saw the attack, identified some petitioners as participants, and later overheard petitioner Catlett say that they \"had to kill her.\"  Carrie Eleby and Linda Jacobs testified that they heard screams coming from an alley where a \"gang of boys\" was beating someone near a garage, approached the group, and saw some petitioners participating in the attack.  Finally, the Government played a videotape of petitioner Yarborough's statement to detectives, describing how he was part of a large group that carried out the attack.  None of the defendants rebutted the prosecution witnesses' claims that Fuller was killed in a group attack.  The seven petitioners were convicted.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Long after their convictions became final, petitioners discovered that the Government had withheld evidence from the defense at the time of trial.  In postconviction proceedings, they argued that seven specific pieces of withheld evidence were both favorable to the defense and material to their guilt under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.\u00a0S. 83.  This evidence included the identity of a man seen running into the alley after the murder and stopping near the garage where Fuller's body had already been found; the statement of a passerby who claimed to hear groans coming from a closed garage; and evidence tending to impeach witnesses Eleby, Jacobs, and Thomas.  The D.\u00a0C. Superior Court rejected petitioners' Brady claims, finding that the withheld evidence was not material.  The D.\u00a0C. Court of Appeals affirmed.\nHeld: The withheld evidence is not material under Brady.  Pp.\u00a09-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The Government does not contest petitioners' claim that the withheld evidence was \"favorable to the defense.\"  Petitioners and the Government, however, do contest the materiality of the undisclosed Brady information.  Such \"evidence is 'material' .\u00a0.\u00a0. when there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Cone v. Bell, 556 U.\u00a0S. 449, 469-470.  \"A 'reasonable probability' of a different result\" is one in which the suppressed evidence \"\u00a0'undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.'\u00a0\"  Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.\u00a0S. 419, 434.  To make that determination, this Court \"evaluate[s]\" the withheld evidence \"in the context of the entire record.\"  United States v. Agurs, 427 U.\u00a0S. 97, 112.  Pp.\u00a09-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Petitioners' main argument is that, had they known about the withheld evidence, they could have challenged the Government's basic group attack theory by raising an alternative theory, namely, that a single perpetrator (or two at most) had attacked Fuller.  Considering the withheld evidence \"in the context of the entire record,\" Agurs, supra, at 112, that evidence is too little, too weak, or too distant from the main evidentiary points to meet Brady's standards.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A group attack was the very cornerstone of the Government's case, and virtually every witness to the crime agreed that Fuller was killed by a large group of perpetrators.  It is not reasonably probable that the withheld evidence could have led to a different result at trial.  Petitioners' problem is that their current alternative theory would have had to persuade the jury that both Alston and Bennett falsely confessed to being active participants in a group attack that never occurred; that Yarborough falsely implicated himself in that group attack and yet gave a highly similar account of how it occurred; that Thomas, an otherwise disinterested witness, wholly fabricated his story; that both Eleby and Jacobs likewise testified to witnessing a group attack that did not occur; and that Montgomery in fact did not see petitioners and others, as a group, identify Fuller as a target and leave together to rob her.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for the undisclosed impeachment evidence, the record shows that it was largely cumulative of impeachment evidence petitioners already had and used at trial.  This is not to suggest that impeachment evidence is immaterial with respect to a witness who has already been impeached with other evidence, see Wearry v. Cain, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___.  But in the context of this trial, with respect to these witnesses, the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence is insufficient to undermine confidence in the jury's verdict, see Smith v. Cain, 565 U.\u00a0S. 73, 75-76.

UNITED STATES\n\n\non writs of certiorari to the district of columbia court of appeals\n[June 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.\u00a0S. 83 (1963), this Court held that the government violates the Constitution's Due Process Clause \"if it withholds evidence that is favorable to the defense and material to the defendant's guilt or punishment.\"  Smith v. Cain, 565 U.\u00a0S. 73, 75 (2012) (emphasis added) (summarizing Brady holding).  In 1985 the seven petitioners in these cases were tried together in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia for the kidnaping, armed robbery, and murder of Catherine Fuller.  Long after petitioners' convictions became final, it emerged that the Government possessed certain evidence that it failed to disclose to the defense.  The only question before us here is whether that withheld evidence was \"material\" under Brady.  The D.\u00a0C. Superior Court, after a 16-day evidentiary hearing, determined that the withheld evidence was not material.  Catlett v. United States, Crim. No. 8617-FEL-84 etc. (Aug. 6, 2012), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1503, pp. 84a, n.\u00a04, 81a-131a.  The D.\u00a0C. Court of Appeals reviewed the record, reached the same conclusion, and affirmed the Superior Court.  116 A. 3d 894 (2015).  After reviewing the record, we reach the same conclusion as did the lower courts.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In these fact-intensive cases, we set out here only a basic description of the record facts along with our reasons for reaching our conclusion.  We refer those who wish more detail to the opinions of the lower courts.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1503, at 81a-131a; 116 A. 3d 894.\nA\nThe Trial\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On March 22, 1985, a grand jury indicted the seven petitioners--Timothy Catlett, Russell Overton, Levy Rouse, Kelvin Smith, Charles Turner, Christopher Turner, and Clifton Yarborough--and several others for the kidnaping, robbery, and murder of Catherine Fuller.  The evidence produced at their joint trial showed that on October 1, 1984, at around 4:30 p.m., Catherine Fuller left her home to go shopping.  At around 6 p.m., William Freeman, a street vendor, found Fuller's body inside an alley garage between Eighth and Ninth Street N. E., just a few blocks from Fuller's home.  See Appendix, infra (showing a map of the area in which the murder was committed).  Fuller had been robbed, severely beaten, and sodomized with an object that caused extensive internal injuries.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government advanced the theory at trial that Fuller had been attacked in the alley by a large group of individuals, including petitioners; codefendants Steve Webb, Alfonso Harris, and Felicia Ruffin; as well as by Calvin Alston and Harry Bennett.  The Government's evidentiary centerpiece consisted of testimony by Alston and Bennett, who confessed to participating in the offense and who cooperated with the Government in return for leniency.  Although the testimony of Alston and Bennett diverged on minor details, it was consistent in stating that, and describing how, Fuller was attacked by a sizable group of individuals, including petitioners and they themselves.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Alston testified that at about 4:10 p.m. on the day of the murder, he arrived in a park located on H Street between Eighth and Ninth Streets.  He said he found a group of people gathered there.  It included petitioners Levy Rouse, Russell Overton, Christopher Turner, Charles Turner, Kelvin Smith, Clifton Yarborough, and Timothy Catlett, as well as several codefendants and others.  Those in the group were talking and singing while Catlett was banging out a beat.  Alston suggested \"getting paid\" by robbing someone.  App. A467.  Catlett, Overton, Rouse, Smith, Charles Turner, Christopher Turner, Yarborough, and several others agreed.  Alston pointed at Catherine Fuller, who was walking on the other side of H Street near the corner of H and Eighth Streets.  Those in the group said they were \"game for getting paid.\"  Id., at A471-A472.  Alston, Rouse, Yarborough, and Charles Turner crossed H Street moving toward Eighth Street and followed Fuller down Eighth Street.  The rest of the group crossed H Street and moved toward Ninth Street.  When Alston's group approached Fuller, Charles Turner shoved her into an alley that runs between Eighth and Ninth Streets.  Charles Turner, Rouse, and Alston began punching Fuller.  They were soon joined by Christopher Turner, Smith, and others.  All of them continued to hit and kick Fuller until she fell to the ground.  Rouse and Charles Turner then carried Fuller to the center of the alley and dropped her in front of a garage located at the point where the alley joins another, perpendicular alley that runs toward I Street.  Someone dragged Fuller into the garage.  Alston, Rouse, Charles Turner, Overton, Yarborough, and Catlett followed.  Others stood outside.  Members of the group tore Fuller's clothes off and struggled over her change purse.  Overton and Charles Turner then held Fuller's legs, and Alston, Catlett, Harris, and Yarborough stood around her while Rouse sodomized her with a foot-long pipe.  Shortly after, the group dispersed and left the alley.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Harry Bennett's testimony was similar.  Bennett also described a group attack.  He said that he had gone to the H Street park, where he saw Rouse, Overton, Christopher Turner, Smith, Catlett, and others gathered.  Alston was talking to the group about \"[g]etting paid\" and said \"let's go get that lady.\" Id., at A368-A370.  At that point Alston, Rouse, Overton, and Webb crossed H Street and approached Fuller, while Catlett, Christopher Turner, Charles Turner, and Harris followed in a separate group.  Bennett added that he himself went to the corner of Eighth and H Streets to watch for police.  He then went into the alley and joined the group in kicking and beating Fuller.  He testified that at least 12 people were there, with some beating Fuller and others watching or picking up her jewelry.  Overton then dragged Fuller into the garage, and Bennett, Rouse, Christopher Turner, Charles Turner, Catlett, Smith, Harris, and Webb followed, as did some \"girls.\"  Id., at A402-A405.  Alston and Steve Webb held Fuller's legs, and Rouse sodomized her with a pole.  The group then dispersed from the garage and alley.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Government presented several other witnesses who corroborated aspects of Alston's and Bennett's testimony, including the fact that Fuller was attacked by a group.  Melvin Montgomery testified that he was in the H Street park on the afternoon of the murder. He saw Overton, Catlett, Rouse, Charles Turner, and others gathered there.  The group was being noisy and singing a song about needing money.  Somebody then said they were \"going to get that one,\" and Montgomery saw that Overton was pointing to a woman standing on the corner of Eighth Street.  Id., at 77-79.  Overton, Catlett, Rouse, Charles Turner, and others crossed H Street.  Some headed toward Eighth Street while others went toward Ninth Street.  Montgomery did not follow them.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maurice Thomas, then 14 years old, testified that he witnessed the attack itself.  Thomas lived in the neighborhood and knew many of the defendants.  As he was walking home, he glanced down the Eighth Street alley and saw a group surrounding Fuller.  Thomas saw Catlett pat Fuller down and then hit her.  He then saw everyone in the group join in hitting her.  Thomas said he knew Catlett, Yarborough, Rouse, Charles Turner, Christopher Turner, and Smith and recognized them in the group.  Thomas heard Fuller calling for help.  He ran home where he found his aunt, who told him not to tell anyone what he saw.  Later that day, Thomas saw Catlett at a corner store, and heard Catlett say to someone that they \"had to kill her\" because \"she spotted someone he was with.\"  Id., at 127-128.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the afternoon of the murder, Carrie Eleby and Linda Jacobs were looking for petitioner Smith, who was Eleby's boyfriend, near the corner of H and Eighth Streets.  They heard screams coming from where a \"gang of boys\" was beating somebody near the garage in the alley.  Id., at A539-A541.  Eleby and Jacobs approached the group.  Eleby recognized Christopher Turner, Smith, Catlett, Rouse, Overton, Alston, and Webb kicking Fuller while Yarborough stood nearby.  Both Eleby and Jacobs testified that they saw Rouse sodomize Fuller with a pole.  Eleby added that Overton held Fuller's legs.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, the Government played a videotape of a recorded statement that Yarborough, one of the petitioners, had given to detectives on December 9, 1984, approximately two months after the murder.  Names were redacted.  The video shows Yarborough describing in detail how he was part of a large group that forced Fuller into the alley, jointly robbed and assaulted her, and dragged her into the garage.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0None of the defendants testified, nor did any of them try, through witnesses or other evidence, to rebut the prosecution witnesses' claim that Fuller was killed in a group attack.  Rather, each petitioner pursued what was essentially a \"not me, maybe them\" defense, namely, that he was not part of the group that attacked Fuller.  Each tried to establish this defense by impeaching witnesses who had placed that particular petitioner at the scene.  Some, for example, provided evidence that Eleby and Jacobs had used PCP the day of Fuller's murder.  Some also tried to establish alibis for the time of Fuller's death.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The jury convicted all seven petitioners, along with codefendant Steve Webb (who subsequently died).  The jury acquitted codefendants Alfonso Harris and Felicia Ruffin.  On direct appeal, the D.\u00a0C. Court of Appeals affirmed petitioners' convictions, though it remanded for resentencing.  545 A.\u00a02d 1202, 1219 (1988).  The trial court resentenced petitioners to the same amount of prison time.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1503, at 82a, n.\u00a02.\nB\nThe Brady Claims\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Beginning in 2010, petitioners pursued postconviction proceedings in which they sought to vacate their convictions or to be granted a new trial.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1503, at 84a, n.\u00a04.  After petitioners' convictions became final, it emerged that the Government possessed certain evidence that it had withheld from the defense at the time of trial.  Petitioners discovered other withheld evidence in their review of the trial prosecutor's case file, which the Government turned over to petitioners in the course of the postconviction proceedings.  Among other postconviction claims, petitioners contended that the withheld evidence was both favorable and material, entitling them to relief under Brady.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The D.\u00a0C. Superior Court considered petitioners' Brady claims as part of a 16-day evidentiary hearing.  It rejected those claims, finding that \"none of the undisclosed information was material.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1503, at 130a.  The D.\u00a0C. Court of Appeals affirmed.  116 A. 3d, at 901.  It similarly concluded that the withheld evidence was not material under Brady.  116 A. 3d, at 913-926.  At issue in those proceedings were the following seven specific pieces of evidence:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. The identity of James McMillan.  Freeman, the vendor who discovered Fuller's body in the alley garage, testified at trial that, while he was waiting for police to arrive, he saw two men run into the alley and stop near the garage for about five minutes before running away when an officer approached.  One of the men had a bulge under his coat.  Early in the trial, codefendant Harris' counsel had requested the identity of the two men to confirm that her client was not one of them.  But the Government refused to disclose the men's identity.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In their postconviction review of the prosecutor's files, petitioners learned that Freeman had identified the two men he saw in the alley as James McMillan and Gerald Merkerson.  McMillan lived in a house which opens in the back onto a connecting alley.  In the weeks following Fuller's murder, but before petitioners' trial, McMillan was arrested for beating and robbing two women in the neighborhood.  Neither attack included a sexual assault.  Separately, petitioners learned that seven years after petitioners' trial, McMillan had robbed, sodomized, and murdered a young woman in an alley.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. The interview with Willie Luchie.  The prosecutor's notes also recorded an undisclosed interview with Willie Luchie, who told the prosecutor that he and three others walked through the alley on their way to an H Street liquor store between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. on the evening of the murder.  As the group walked by the garage, Luchie \"heard several groans\" and \"remembers the doors to the garage being closed.\"  App. 25.  Another person in the group recalled \"hear[ing] some moans,\" while the other two persons did not recall hearing anything unusual.  Id., at 27, 53; id., at A992.  The group continued walking without looking into the garage or otherwise investigating the source of the sounds.  They did not see McMillan or any other person in the alley when they passed through.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. The interviews with Ammie Davis.  Undisclosed notes written by a police officer and the prosecutor refer to two interviews with Ammie Davis, who had been arrested for disorderly conduct a few weeks after Fuller's murder.  Davis initially told a police investigator that she had seen another individual, James Blue, beat Fuller to death in the alley.  Shortly thereafter, she said she only saw Blue grab Fuller and push her into the alley.  Davis also said that a girlfriend, whom she did not name, accompanied her.  She promised to call the investigator with more details, but she did not do so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0About 9 months later (after petitioners were indicted but approximately 11 weeks before their trial), a prosecutor learned of the investigator's notes and interviewed Davis.  The prosecutor's notes state that Davis did not provide any more details, except to say that the girlfriend who accompanied her was nicknamed \"\u00a0'Shorty.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 267-268.  About two months later, which was shortly before petitioners' trial, Blue murdered Davis in an unrelated drug dispute.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the postconviction evidentiary hearing, the prosecutor who interviewed Davis testified that he did not disclose Davis' statement because she acted \"playful\" and \"not serious\" during the interview and he found her to be \"totally incredible.\"  Id., at 269-272.  Additionally, the prosecutor stated that he knew Davis had previously falsely accused Blue of a different murder, and on another occasion had falsely accused a different individual of a different murder.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04. Impeachment of Kaye Porter and Carrie Eleby.  Kaye Porter accompanied Eleby during an initial interview with homicide detectives.  Porter agreed with Eleby that she had also heard Alston state that he was involved in robbing Fuller.  An undisclosed prosecutorial note states that in a later interview with detectives, Porter stated that she did not actually recall hearing Alston's statement and just went along with what Eleby said.  The note also states that Eleby likewise admitted that she had lied about Porter being present during Alston's statement and had asked Porter to support her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05. Impeachment of Carrie Eleby.  A prosecutor's un-disclosed note revealed that Eleby said she had been high on PCP during a January 9, 1985, meeting with investigators.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a06. Impeachment of Linda Jacobs.  An undisclosed note of an interview with Linda Jacobs said that the detective had \"question[ed] her hard,\" and that she had \"vacillated\" about what she saw.  Id., at A1009.  The prosecutor recalled that the detective \"kept raising his voice\" and was \"smacking his hand on the desk\" during the interview.  Id., at A2298-A2299.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07. Impeachment of Maurice Thomas.  An undisclosed note of an interview with Maurice Thomas' aunt stated that she \"does not recall Maurice ever telling her anything such as this.\"  Id., at A1010; see id., at 295-296.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Government does not contest petitioners' claim that the withheld evidence was \"favorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or because it is impeaching.\"  Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.\u00a0S. 263, 281-282 (1999).  Neither does the Government contest petitioners' claim that it \"suppressed\" the evidence, \"either willfully or inadvertently.\"  Id., at 282.  It does, as it must, concede that the Brady rule's \"\u00a0'overriding concern [is] with the justice of the finding of guilt,'\u00a0\" United States v. Bagley, 473 U.\u00a0S. 667, 678 (1985) (quoting United States v. Agurs, 427 U.\u00a0S. 97, 112 (1976)), and that the Government's \"\u00a0'interest .\u00a0.\u00a0. in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, but that justice shall be done,'\u00a0\" Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.\u00a0S. 419, 439 (1995) (quoting Berger v. United States, 295 U.\u00a0S. 78, 88 (1935)).  Consistent with these principles, the Government assured the Court at oral argument that subsequent to petitioners' trial, it has adopted a \"generous policy of discovery\" in criminal cases under which it discloses any \"information that a defendant might wish to use.\"  Tr. of Oral Arg. 47-48.  As we have recognized, and as the Government agrees, ibid., \"[t]his is as it should be.\"  Kyles, supra, at 439 (explaining that a \"\u00a0'prudent prosecutor['s]'\u00a0\" better course is to take care to disclose any evidence favorable to the defendant (quoting Agurs, supra, at 108)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners and the Government, however, do contest the materiality of the undisclosed Brady information.  \"[E]vidence is 'material' within the meaning of Brady when there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Cone v. Bell, 556 U.\u00a0S. 449, 469-470 (2009) (citing Bagley, supra, at 682).  \"A 'reasonable probability' of a different result\" is one in which the suppressed evidence \"\u00a0'undermines confidence in the outcome of the trial.'\u00a0\"  Kyles, supra, at 434 (quoting Bagley, supra, at 678).  In other words, petitioners here are entitled to a new trial only if they \"establis[h] the prejudice necessary to satisfy the 'materiality' inquiry.\"  Strickler, supra, at 282.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consequently, the issue before us here is legally simple but factually complex.  We must examine the trial record, \"evaluat[e]\" the withheld evidence \"in the context of the entire record,\" Agurs, supra, at 112, and determine in light of that examination whether \"there is a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Cone, supra, at 470 (citing Bagley, supra, at 682).  Having done so, we agree with the lower courts that there was no such reasonable probability.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioners' main argument is that, had they known about McMillan's identity and Luchie's statement, they could have challenged the Government's basic theory that Fuller was killed in a group attack.  Petitioners contend that they could have raised an alternative theory, namely, that a single perpetrator (or two at most) had attacked Fuller.  According to petitioners, the groans that Luchie and his companion heard when they walked through the alley between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. suggest that the attack was taking place inside the garage at that moment.  The added facts that the garage was small and that Luchie's group saw no one in the alley could bolster a \"single attacker\" theory.  Freeman's recollection that one garage door was open when he found Fuller's body at around 6 p.m., combined with Luchie's recollection that both doors were shut around 5:30 or 5:45 p.m., could suggest that one or two perpetrators were in the garage when Luchie walked by but left before Freeman arrived.  McMillan's identity as one of the men Freeman saw enter the alley after Freeman discovered Fuller's body would have revealed McMillan's criminal convictions in the months before petitioners' trial.  Petitioners argue that together, this evidence would have permitted the defense to knit together a theory that the group attack did not occur at all--and that it was actually McMillan, alone or with an accomplice, who murdered Fuller.  They add that they could have used the investigators' failure to follow up on Ammie Davis' claim about James Blue, and the various pieces of withheld impeachment evidence, to suggest that an incomplete investigation had ended up accusing the wrong persons.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Considering the withheld evidence \"in the context of the entire record,\" however, Agurs, supra, at 112, we conclude that it is too little, too weak, or too distant from the main evidentiary points to meet Brady's standards.  As petitioners recognize, McMillan's guilt (or that of any other single, or near single, perpetrator) is inconsistent with petitioners' guilt only if there was no group attack.  But a group attack was the very cornerstone of the Government's case.  The witnesses may have differed on minor details, but virtually every witness to the crime itself agreed as to a main theme: that Fuller was killed by a large group of perpetrators.  The evidence at trial was such that, even though petitioners knew that Freeman saw two men enter the alley after he discovered Fuller's body, that one appeared to have a bulky object hidden under his coat, and that both ran when the police arrived, none of the petitioners attempted to mount a defense that implicated those men as alternative perpetrators acting alone.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is it reasonably probable that adding McMillan's identity, and Luchie's ambiguous statement that he heard groans but saw no one, could have led to a different result at trial?  We conclude that it is not.  The problem for petitioners is that their current alternative theory would have had to persuade the jury that both Alston and Bennett falsely confessed to being active participants in a group attack that never occurred; that Yarborough falsely implicated himself in that group attack and, through coordinated effort or coincidence, gave a highly similar account of  how it occurred; that Thomas, a disinterested witness who recognized petitioners when he happened upon the attack and heard Catlett refer to it later that night, wholly fabricated his story; that both Eleby and Jacobs likewise testified to witnessing a group attack that did not occur; and that Montgomery in fact did not see petitioners and others, as a group, identify Fuller as a target and leave the park to rob her.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the undisclosed impeachment evidence, the record shows that it was largely cumulative of impeachment evidence petitioners already had and used at trial.  For example, the jury heard multiple times about Eleby's frequent PCP use, including Eleby's own testimony that she and Jacobs had smoked PCP shortly before they witnessed Fuller's attack.  In this context, it would not have surprised the jury to learn that Eleby used PCP on yet another occasion.  Porter was a minor witness who was also impeached at trial with evidence about changes in her testimony over time, leaving little added significance to the note that she changed her mind about having agreed with Eleby's claims.  The jury was also well aware of Jacobs' vacillation, as she was impeached on the stand with her shifting stories about what she witnessed.  Knowledge that a detective raised his voice during an interview with her would have added little more.  Nor do we see how the note about the statement by Thomas' aunt could have mattered much, given the facts that neither side chose to call the aunt as a witness and that the jury already knew, from Thomas' testimony, that his aunt had told him not to tell anyone what he saw.  As for James Blue, petitioners argue that the investigators' delay in following up on Ammie Davis' statement could have led the jury to doubt the thoroughness of the investigation.  But this likelihood is seriously undercut by notes about Davis' demeanor and lack of detail, and by her prior false accusations that Blue committed a different murder and that yet another person committed yet a different murder.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We of course do not suggest that impeachment evidence is immaterial with respect to a witness who has already been impeached with other evidence.  See Wearry v. Cain, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7-9).  We conclude only that in the context of this trial, with respect to these witnesses, the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence is insufficient to \"\u00a0'undermine confidence'\u00a0\" in the jury's verdict, Smith, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 75-76 (quoting Kyles, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 434; brackets omitted).\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the basis of our review of the record, we agree with the lower courts that there is not a \"reasonable probability\" that the withheld evidence would have changed the outcome of petitioners' trial, id., at 434 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The judgment of the D.\u00a0C.

UNITED STATES\n\n\non writs of certiorari to the district of columbia court of appeals\n[June 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kagan, with whom Justice Ginsburg joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Consider two criminal cases.  In the first, the government accuses ten defendants of acting together to commit a vicious murder and robbery.  At trial, each defendant accepts that the attack occurred almost exactly as the government describes--contending only that he wasn't part of the rampaging group.  The defendants thus undermine each other's arguments at every turn.  In the second case, the government makes the same arguments as before.  But this time, all of the accused adopt a common defense, built around an alternative account of the crime.  Armed with new evidence that someone else perpetrated the murder, the defendants vigorously dispute the government's gang-attack narrative and challenge the credibility of its investigation.  The question this case presents is whether such a unified defense, relying on evidence unavailable in the first scenario, had a \"reason-able probability\" (less than a preponderance) of shifting even one juror's vote.  Cone v. Bell, 556 U.\u00a0S. 449, 452, 470 (2009); see Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.\u00a0S. 419, 434 (1995).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That is the relevant question because the Government here knew about but withheld the evidence of an alternative perpetrator--and so prevented the defendants from coming together to press that theory of the case.  If the Government's non-disclosure was material, in the sense just described, this Court's decision in Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.\u00a0S. 83 (1963), demands a new trial.  The Court today holds it was not material: In light of the evidence the Government offered, the majority argues, the transformed defense stood little chance of persuading a juror to vote to acquit.  That conclusion is not indefensible: The Government put on quite a few witnesses who said that the defendants committed the crime.  But in the end, I think the majority gets the answer in this case wrong.  With the undisclosed evidence, the whole tenor of the trial would have changed.  Rather than relying on a \"not me, maybe them\" defense, ante, at 6, all the defendants would have relentlessly impeached the Government's (thoroughly impeachable) witnesses and offered the jurors a way to view the crime in a different light.  In my view, that could well have flipped one or more jurors--which is all Brady requires.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before explaining that view, I note that the majority and I share some common ground.  We agree on the universe of exculpatory or impeaching evidence suppressed in this case: The majority's description of that evidence, and of the trial held without it, is scrupulously fair.  See ante, at 2-6, 7-9.  We also agree--as does the Government--that such evidence ought to be disclosed to defendants as a matter of course.  See ante, at 10.  Constitutional requirements aside, turning over exculpatory materials is a core responsibility of all prosecutors--whose professional interest and obligation is not to win cases but to ensure justice is done.  See Kyles, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 439.  And finally, we agree on the legal standard by which to assess the materiality of undisclosed evidence for purposes of applying the constitutional rule: Courts are to ask whether there is a \"reasonable probability\" that disclosure of the evidence would have led to a different outcome--i.e., an acquittal or hung jury rather than a conviction.  See ante, at 10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I part ways with the majority in applying that standard to the evidence withheld in this case.  That evidence falls into three basic categories, discussed below.  Taken together, the materials would have recast the trial significantly--so much so as to \"undermine[\u00a0] confidence\" in the guilty verdicts reached in their absence.  Kyles, 514 U.\u00a0S., at 434.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, the Government suppressed information identifying a possible alternative perpetrator.  The defendants knew that, shortly before the police arrived, witnesses had observed two men acting suspiciously near the alleyway garage where Catherine Fuller's body was found.  But they did not know--because the Government never told them--that a witness had identified one of those men as James McMillan.  Equipped with that information, the defendants would have discovered that in the weeks following Fuller's murder, McMillan assaulted and robbed two other women of comparable age in the same neighborhood.  And using that information, the defendants would have united around a common defense.  They would all have pointed their fingers at McMillan (rather than at each other), arguing that he committed Fuller's murder as part of a string of similar crimes.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Government suppressed witness statements suggesting that one or two perpetrators--not a large group--carried out the attack.  Those statements were given by two individuals who walked past the garage around the time of Fuller's death.  They told the police that they heard groans coming from inside the garage; and one remarked that the garage's doors were closed at the time.  Introducing that evidence at trial would have sown doubt about the Government's group-attack narrative, because that many people (as everyone agrees) couldn't have fit inside the small garage.  And the questions thus raised would have further supported the defendants' theory that McMillan (and perhaps an accomplice) had committed the murder.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third and finally, the Government suppressed a raft of evidence discrediting its investigation and impeaching its witnesses.  Undisclosed files, for example, showed that the police took more than nine months to look into a witness's claim that a man named James Blue had murdered Fuller.  Evidence of that kind of negligence could easily have led jurors to wonder about the competence of all the police work done in the case.  Other withheld documents revealed that one of the Government's main witnesses was high on PCP when she met with investigators to identify participants in the crime--and that she also encouraged a friend to lie to the police to support her story.  Using that sort of information, see also ante, at 9, the defendants could have undercut the Government's witnesses--even while presenting their own account of the murder.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In reply to all this, the majority argues that \"none of the [accused] attempted to mount [an alternative-perpetrator] defense\" and that such a defense would have challenged \"the very cornerstone of the Government's case.\"  Ante, at 12.  But that just proves my point.  The defendants didn't offer an alternative-perpetrator defense because the Government prevented them from learning what made it credible: that one of the men seen near the garage had a record of assaulting and robbing middle-aged women, and that witnesses would back up the theory that only one or two individuals had committed the murder.  Moreover, that defense had game-changing potential exactly because it challenged the cornerstone of the Government's case.  Without the withheld evidence, each of the defendants had little choice but to accept the Government's framing of the crime as a group attack--and argue only that he wasn't there.  That meant the defendants often worked at cross-purposes.  In particular, each defendant not identified by a Government witness sought to bolster that witness's credibility, no matter the harm to his co-defendants.  As one defense lawyer remarked after another's supposed cross-examination of a Government witness: \"They've got [an extra] prosecutor[\u00a0] in the courtroom now.\"  Saperstein & Walsh, 10 Defendants Complicate Trial, Washington Post, Nov. 17, 1985, p. A14, col. 1.  Credible alternative-perpetrator evidence would have allowed the defendants to escape this cycle of mutually assured destruction.  By enabling the defendants to jointly attack the Government's \"cornerstone\" theory, the withheld evidence would have reframed the case presented to the jury.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Still, the majority claims, an alternative-perpetrator defense would have had no realistic chance of changing the outcome because the Government had ample evidence of a group attack, including five witnesses who testified that they had participated in it or seen it happen.  See ante, at 12-13.  But the Government's case wasn't nearly the slam-dunk the majority suggests.  No physical evidence tied any of the defendants to the crime--a highly surprising fact if, as the Government claimed, more than ten people carried out a spur-of-the-moment, rampage-like attack in a confined space.  And as even the majority recognizes, the Government's five eyewitnesses had some serious credibility deficits.  See ibid.  Two had been charged as defendants, and agreed to testify only in exchange for favorable plea deals.  See 116 A.\u00a03d 894, 902 (D.\u00a0C. 2015). Two admitted they were high on PCP at the time.  See id., at 903, 911; App. A535-A536, A649. (As noted above, one was also high when she later met with police to identify the culprits.)  One was an eighth-grader whose own aunt contradicted parts of his trial testimony.  See 116 A.\u00a03d, at 903, 911.  Even in the absence of an alternative account of the crime, the jury took more than a week--and many dozens of votes--to reach its final verdict.  Had the defendants offered a unified counter-narrative, based on the withheld evidence, one or more jurors could well have concluded that the Government had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Again, the issue here concerns the difference between two criminal cases.  The Government got the case it most wanted--the one in which the defendants, each in an effort to save himself, formed something of a circular firing squad.  And the Government avoided the case it most feared--the one in which the defendants acted jointly to show that a man known to assault women like Fuller committed her murder.  The difference between the two cases lay in the Government's files--evidence of obvious relevance that prosecutors nonetheless chose to suppress.  I think it could have mattered to the trial's outcome.  For that reason, I respectfully dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1Together with No. 15-1504, Overton v.

The IRA thus allows the Secretary to take state land and strip the State of almost all sovereign power over it.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2008, the Secretary invoked the IRA to take into trust more than 13,000 acres of land in upstate New York for the Oneida Nation of New York, an Indian Tribe that descended from one of the Iroquois nations.  841 F.\u00a03d 556, 564 (CA2 2016).  Petitioners, a local government and several interested citizens from upstate New York, ask us to decide whether this use of the IRA is a constitutional exercise of Congress' power under the Indian Commerce Clause \"[t]o regulate Commerce .\u00a0.\u00a0. with the Indian Tribes,\" Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78, cl. 3.  I would grant the petitions for writs of certiorari to reconsider our Indian Commerce Clause precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Those precedents have acquiesced in Congress' assertion of a \"plenary power to legislate in the field of Indian affairs.\"  Cotton Petroleum Corp. v. New Mexico, 490 U.\u00a0S. 163, 192 (1989).  But \"neither the text nor the original understanding of the [Indian Commerce] Clause supports Congress' claim to such 'plenary' power.\"  Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl, 570 U.\u00a0S. 637, ___ (2013) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4); see United States v. Lara, 541 U.\u00a0S. 193, 224 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); Puerto Rico v.

Bryant, 579 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 3-4).  Instead, as I have previously explained, the Clause extends only to \"regulat[ing] trade with Indian tribes--that is, Indians who had not been incorporated into the body-politic of any State.\"  Adoptive Couple, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Understood this way, the Indian Commerce Clause does not appear to give Congress the power to authorize the taking of land into trust under the IRA.  Even assuming that land transactions are \"Commerce\" within the scope of the Clause, but see Natelson, The Original Understanding of the Indian Commerce Clause, 85 Denver U. L.\u00a0Rev. 201, 214-215, and n. 94 (2007), many applications of the IRA do not involve trade of any kind.  The IRA permits the Secretary to take into trust land that an Indian tribe already owns.  See 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75108 (authorizing the Secretary to take into trust land acquired through \"relinquishment,\" \"gift,\" or \"assignment\"); 25 CFR \u00a7151.3 (providing that the Secretary may take land into trust \"[w]hen the tribe already owns an interest in the land\"); \u00a7151.4 (providing that the Secretary may take into trust \"[u]nrestricted land owned by an individual Indian or a tribe\").  And in cases like these, where the tribe already owns the land, neither money nor property changes hands.  Instead, title is slightly modified by adding \"the United States in trust for\" in front of the name of \"the Indian tribe or individual Indian\" who owns the land.  See 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75108.  This arrangement does not affect the Indian tribe's beneficial ownership of the property, and it does not afford the United States any meaningful property rights.  See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 997-998, 1057-1058 (2012); Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L.\u00a0Rev. 1069, 1093-1094, and n. 152 (2004).  In short, because no exchange takes place, these trust arrangements do not resemble \"\u00a0'trade with Indians.'\u00a0\"  Adoptive Couple, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Natelson, supra, at 215-216).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying our precedents, the Second Circuit concluded that the Indian Commerce Clause empowered the Federal Government to take into trust the land at issue here.  In so doing, it showed how far our precedents interpreting the Indian Commerce Clause have strayed from the original understanding, and how much Congress' power has grown as a result.  Asserting plenary power, Congress authorized the Secretary to take 13,000 acres of New York and to declare it sovereign Oneida territory.  It did so even though the land had been under New York's sovereign control for more than two centuries.  City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.\u00a0Y., 544 U.\u00a0S. 197, 203, 221 (2005).  And it did so even though restoring tribal sovereignty over the land would \"\u00a0'seriously burde[n] the administration of state and local governments' and would adversely affect landowners neighboring the tribal patches.\"  Id., at 220 (quoting Hagen v. Utah, 510 U.\u00a0S. 399, 421 (1994)); see also 841 F.\u00a03d, at 564.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under our precedents, Congress has thus obtained the power to take any state land and strip the State of almost all sovereign power over it \"for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\"  25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75108.  This means Congress could reduce a State to near nonexistence by taking all land within its borders and declaring it sovereign Indian territory.  It is highly implausible that the Founders understood the Indian Commerce Clause, which was virtually unopposed at the founding, as giving Congress the power to destroy the States' territorial integrity.  See Adoptive Couple, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9).  Indeed, they would have been shocked to find such a power lurking in a Clause they understood to give Congress the limited authority \"to regulate trade with Indian tribes living beyond state borders.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When our precedents permit such an absurd result, something has gone seriously awry.  It is time to fix our error.

Instead, as I have previously explained, the Clause extends only to \"regulat[ing] trade with Indian tribes--that is, Indians who had not been incorporated into the body-politic of any State.\"  Adoptive Couple, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Understood this way, the Indian Commerce Clause does not appear to give Congress the power to authorize the taking of land into trust under the IRA.  Even assuming that land transactions are \"Commerce\" within the scope of the Clause, but see Natelson, The Original Understanding of the Indian Commerce Clause, 85 Denver U. L.\u00a0Rev. 201, 214-215, and n. 94 (2007), many applications of the IRA do not involve trade of any kind.  The IRA permits the Secretary to take into trust land that an Indian tribe already owns.  See 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75108 (authorizing the Secretary to take into trust land acquired through \"relinquishment,\" \"gift,\" or \"assignment\"); 25 CFR \u00a7151.3 (providing that the Secretary may take land into trust \"[w]hen the tribe already owns an interest in the land\"); \u00a7151.4 (providing that the Secretary may take into trust \"[u]nrestricted land owned by an individual Indian or a tribe\").  And in cases like these, where the tribe already owns the land, neither money nor property changes hands.  Instead, title is slightly modified by adding \"the United States in trust for\" in front of the name of \"the Indian tribe or individual Indian\" who owns the land.  See 25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75108.  This arrangement does not affect the Indian tribe's beneficial ownership of the property, and it does not afford the United States any meaningful property rights.  See F. Cohen, Handbook of Federal Indian Law 997-998, 1057-1058 (2012); Prakash, Against Tribal Fungibility, 89 Cornell L.\u00a0Rev. 1069, 1093-1094, and n. 152 (2004).  In short, because no exchange takes place, these trust arrangements do not resemble \"\u00a0'trade with Indians.'\u00a0\"  Adoptive Couple, supra, at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (quoting Natelson, supra, at 215-216).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Applying our precedents, the Second Circuit concluded that the Indian Commerce Clause empowered the Federal Government to take into trust the land at issue here.  In so doing, it showed how far our precedents interpreting the Indian Commerce Clause have strayed from the original understanding, and how much Congress' power has grown as a result.  Asserting plenary power, Congress authorized the Secretary to take 13,000 acres of New York and to declare it sovereign Oneida territory.  It did so even though the land had been under New York's sovereign control for more than two centuries.  City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.\u00a0Y., 544 U.\u00a0S. 197, 203, 221 (2005).  And it did so even though restoring tribal sovereignty over the land would \"\u00a0'seriously burde[n] the administration of state and local governments' and would adversely affect landowners neighboring the tribal patches.\"  Id., at 220 (quoting Hagen v. Utah, 510 U.\u00a0S. 399, 421 (1994)); see also 841 F.\u00a03d, at 564.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under our precedents, Congress has thus obtained the power to take any state land and strip the State of almost all sovereign power over it \"for the purpose of providing land for Indians.\"  25 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a75108.  This means Congress could reduce a State to near nonexistence by taking all land within its borders and declaring it sovereign Indian territory.  It is highly implausible that the Founders understood the Indian Commerce Clause, which was virtually unopposed at the founding, as giving Congress the power to destroy the States' territorial integrity.  See Adoptive Couple, 570 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 9).  Indeed, they would have been shocked to find such a power lurking in a Clause they understood to give Congress the limited authority \"to regulate trade with Indian tribes living beyond state borders.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When our precedents permit such an absurd result, something has gone seriously awry.  It is time to fix our error.  We should have granted certiorari to reexamine our Indian Commerce Clause precedents, instead of standing idly by as Congress, the Executive, and the lower courts stray further and further from the Constitution.  I respectfully dissent from the denials of certiorari.\n\n\n\n","81":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nVIRGINIA, ET AL.  v.  DENNIS LEBLANC(2017)\nNo. 16-1177\nArgued: Decided: June 12, 2017\n\n\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Per Curiam.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a state prisoner is eligible for federal habeas relief if the underlying state court merits ruling was \"contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law\" as determined by this Court.  28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254(d)(1).  In this case, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that this demanding standard was met by a Virginia court's application of Graham v. Florida, 560 U.\u00a0S. 48 (2010).  The question presented is whether the Court of Appeals erred in concluding that the state court's ruling involved an unreasonable application of this Court's holding.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On July 6, 1999, respondent Dennis LeBlanc raped a 62-year-old woman.  He was 16 at the time.  In 2003, a state trial court sentenced him to life in prison for his crimes.  In the 1990's, Virginia had, for felony offenders, abolished parole that followed a traditional framework.  See Va. Code Ann. \u00a753.1-165.1 (2013).  As a form of replacement, Virginia enacted its so-called \"geriatric release\" program, which allows older inmates to receive conditional release under some circumstances.  LeBlanc v. Mathena, 841 F.\u00a03d 256, 261 (CA4 2016) (citing Va. Code Ann. \u00a753.1-40.01).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seven years after respondent was sentenced, this Court decided Graham v. Florida.  Graham established that the Eighth Amendment prohibits juvenile offenders convicted of nonhomicide offenses from being sentenced to life without parole.  While a \"State is not required to guarantee eventual freedom to a juvenile offender convicted of a nonhomicide crime,\" the Court held, it must \"give defendants like Graham some meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\"  540 U.\u00a0S., at 75.  The Court in Graham left it to the States, \"in the first instance, to explore the means and mechanisms for compliance\" with the Graham rule.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondent later filed a motion in state trial court--the Virginia Beach Circuit Court--seeking to vacate his sentence in light of Graham.  The trial court denied the motion.  In so doing, it relied on the Supreme Court of Virginia's decision in Angel v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 248, 704 S.\u00a0E. 2d 386 (2011).  The Angel court held that Virginia's geriatric release program satisfies Graham's requirement of parole for juvenile offenders.  The statute establishing the program provides:\n\"Any person serving a sentence imposed upon a conviction for a felony offense .\u00a0.\u00a0. (i) who has reached the age of sixty-five or older and who has served at least five years of the sentence imposed or (ii) who has reached the age of sixty or older and who has served at least ten years of the sentence imposed may petition the Parole Board for conditional release.\"  \u00a753.1-40.01.\nThe Angel court explained that \"[t]he regulations for conditional release under this statute provide that if the prisoner meets the qualifications for consideration contained in the statute, the factors used in the normal parole consideration process apply to conditional release decisions under this statute.\"  281 Va., at 275, 704 S. E. 2d, at 402.  The geriatric release program thus complied with Graham, the Angel court held, because it provided \"the meaningful opportunity to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation required by the Eighth Amendment.\"  281 Va., at 275, 704 S.\u00a0E. 2d, at 402 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Virginia Supreme Court, in reviewing the trial court's ruling in the instant case, summarily denied respondent's requests for appeal and for rehearing.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2012, respondent filed a federal habeas petition in the Eastern District of Virginia pursuant to 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72254.  A Magistrate Judge recommended dismissing the petition, but the District Court disagreed and granted the writ.  The District Court explained that \"there is no possibility that fairminded jurists could disagree that the state court's decision conflicts wit[h] the dictates of Graham.\"  LeBlanc v. Mathena, 2015 WL 4042175, *18 (July 1, 2015).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the state trial court's ruling was an unreasonable application of Graham.  841 F.\u00a03d, at 259-260.  In the panel majority's view, Virginia's geriatric release program did not provide a meaningful opportunity for juvenile nonhomicide offenders to obtain release based on demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judge Niemeyer dissented.  He criticized the majority for \"fail[ing] to respect, in any meaningful way, the deference Congress requires federal courts to give state court decisions on postconviction review.\"  Id., at 275.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Commonwealth of Virginia petitioned for certiorari.  The petition is now granted, and the judgment is reversed: The Virginia trial court did not unreasonably apply the Graham rule.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In order for a state court's decision to be an unreason-able application of this Court's case law, the ruling must be \"objectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error will not suffice.\"  Woods v. Donald, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In other words, a litigant must \"show that the state court's ruling .\u00a0.\u00a0. was so lacking in justification that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  This is \"meant to be\" a difficult standard to meet.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 102 (2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit erred by failing to accord the state court's decision the deference owed under AEDPA.  Graham did not decide that a geriatric release program like Virginia's failed to satisfy the Eighth Amendment because that question was not presented.  And it was not objectively unreasonable for the state court to conclude that, because the geriatric release program employed normal parole factors, it satisfied Graham's requirement that juveniles convicted of a nonhomicide crime have a meaningful opportunity to receive parole.  The geriatric release program instructs Virginia's Parole Board to consider factors like the \"individual's history .\u00a0.\u00a0. and the individual's conduct .\u00a0.\u00a0. during incarceration,\" as well as the prisoner's \"inter-personal relationships with staff and inmates\" and \"[c]hanges in attitude toward self and others.\"  See 841 F.\u00a03d, at 280-281 (Niemeyer, J., dissenting) (citing Virginia Parole Board Policy Manual 2-4 (Oct. 2006)).  Consideration of these factors could allow the Parole Board to order a former juvenile offender's conditional release in light of his or her \"demonstrated maturity and rehabilitation.\"  Graham, 560 U.\u00a0S., at 75. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The state court thus did not diverge so far from Graham's dictates as to make it \"so obvious that .\u00a0.\u00a0. there could be no 'fairminded disagreement'\u00a0\" about whether the state court's ruling conflicts with this Court's case law.  White v. Woodall, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 11).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Perhaps the logical next step from\" Graham would be to hold that a geriatric release program does not satisfy the Eighth Amendment, but \"perhaps not.\"  572 U.\u00a0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11).  \"[T]here are reasonable arguments on both sides.\"  Id., at ___-___ (slip op., at 11-12).  With respect to petitioners, these include the arguments discussed above.  Supra, at 4.  With regards to respondent, these include the contentions that the Parole Board's substantial discretion to deny geriatric release deprives juvenile nonhomicide offenders a meaningful opportunity to seek parole and that juveniles cannot seek geriatric release until they have spent at least four decades in prison.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These arguments cannot be resolved on federal habeas review.  Because this case arises \"only in th[at] narrow context,\" the Court \"express[es] no view on the merits of the underlying\" Eighth Amendment claim.  Woods, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor does the Court \"suggest or imply that the underlying issue, if presented on direct review, would be insubstantial.\"  Marshall v. Rodgers, 569 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (per curiam) (slip op., at 7); accord, Woodall, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 5).  The Court today holds only that the Virginia trial court's ruling, resting on the Virginia Supreme Court's earlier ruling in Angel, was not objectively unreasonable in light of this Court's current case law.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A proper respect for AEDPA's high bar for habeas relief avoids unnecessarily \"disturb[ing] the State's significant interest in repose for concluded litigation, den[ying] soci-ety the right to punish some admitted offenders, and in-trud[ing] on state sovereignty to a degree matched by few exercises of federal judicial authority.\"  Harrington, supra, at 103 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The federalism interest implicated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this case, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit's holding created the potential for significant discord in the Virginia sentencing process.  Before today, Virginia courts were permitted to impose--and required to affirm--a sentence like respondent's, while federal courts presented with the same fact pattern were required to grant habeas relief.  Reversing the Court of Appeals' decision in this case--rather than waiting until a more substantial split of authority develops--spares Virginia courts from having to confront this legal quagmire.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, the petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nVIRGINIA, et\u00a0al. v.

See ante, at 2.  I join the Court's judgment on the understanding that the Virginia Supreme Court, in Angel v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 248, 704 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d 386 (2011), interpreted Virginia law to require the parole board to provide such a meaningful opportunity under the geriatric release program.  See id., at 275, 704 S.\u00a0E.\u00a02d, at 402 (\"the factors used in the normal parole consideration process apply to conditional release decisions under this statute\").  In other words, contrary to the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of Virginia law, the parole board may not deny a juvenile offender geriatric release \"for any reason whatsoever,\" 841 F.\u00a03d 256, 269 (2016) (emphasis in original); instead, the board, when evaluating a juvenile offender for geriatric release, must consider the normal parole factors, including rehabilitation and maturity.

Before today, Virginia courts were permitted to impose--and required to affirm--a sentence like respondent's, while federal courts presented with the same fact pattern were required to grant habeas relief.  Reversing the Court of Appeals' decision in this case--rather than waiting until a more substantial split of authority develops--spares Virginia courts from having to confront this legal quagmire.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, the petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nGinsburg, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nVIRGINIA, et\u00a0al. v.

MENON(2017)\nNo. 16-254\nArgued: March 22, 2017Decided: May 22, 2017\n\n\nPetitioner Water Splash sued respondent Menon, a former employee, in a Texas state court, alleging that she had begun working for a competitor while still employed by Water Splash.  Because Menon resided in Canada, Water Splash obtained permission to effect service by mail.  After Menon declined to answer or otherwise enter an appearance, the trial court issued a default judgment for Water Splash.  That court subsequently denied Menon's motion to set aside the judgment on the ground that she had not been properly served.  On appeal, Menon argued that service by mail does not comport with the requirements of the Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters (Hague Service Convention), which seeks to simplify, standardize, and generally improve the process of serving documents abroad, specifying certain approved methods of service and preempting \"inconsistent methods of service\" wherever it applies, Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S. 694, 699.  The Texas Court of Appeals agreed with Menon, holding that the Convention prohibited service of process by mail.  Article 10, the provision at issue, consists of Articles 10(b) and 10(c), which plainly address permissible methods of \"service,\" and Article 10(a), which provides that the Convention will not interfere with \"the freedom to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad,\" but does not expressly refer to \"service.\"  \nHeld:\u00a0The Hague Service Convention does not prohibit service of process by mail.  Pp.\u00a04-12. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This Court begins its analysis by looking to the treaty's text and the context in which its words are used.  See Schlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 699.  The key word in Article 10(a)--\"send\"--is a broad term, and there is no apparent reason why it would exclude the transmission of documents for the purpose of service.  The structure of the Convention strongly counsels against such an exclusion.  The Convention's preamble and Article 1 limit the scope of the Convention to service of documents abroad, and its full title includes the phrase \"Service Abroad.\"  This Court has also held that the scope of the Convention is limited to service of documents.  Id., at 701.  It would thus be quite strange if Article 10(a)--apparently alone among the Convention's provisions--concerned something other than service of documents.  Indeed, such a reading would render Article 10(a) superfluous.  Article 10's function is to ensure that, generally, the Convention \"shall not interfere\" with the activities described in 10(a), 10(b), and 10(c).  But since Article 1 already \"eliminates [the] possibility\" that the Convention would apply to any communications that \"do not culminate in service,\" id., at 701, in order for Article 10(a) to do any work, it must pertain to sending documents for the purposes of service.  Menon's attempt to avoid this superfluity problem by suggesting that Article 10(a) applies not to service of process but only to the service of \"post-answer judicial documents\" lacks any plausible textual footing in Article 10.  If the drafters wished to limit Article 10(a) to a particular subset of documents, they could have said so--as they did, e.g., in Article 15, which refers to \"a writ of summons or an equivalent document.\"  Instead, Article 10(a) uses the term \"judicial documents\"--the same term featured in 10(b) and 10(c).  And the ordinary meaning of the word \"send\" is broad enough to cover the transmission of any judicial documents.  Accordingly, the text and structure of the Convention indicate that Article 10(a) encompasses service by mail.  Pp.\u00a04-6.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The main counterargument--that Article 10(a)'s phrase \"send judicial documents\" should mean something different than the phrase \"effect service of judicial documents\" in Article 10(b) and Article 10(c)--is unpersuasive.  First, it must contend with the compelling structural considerations strongly suggesting that Article 10(a) pertains to service of documents.  Second, reading the word \"send\" as a broad concept that includes, but is not limited to, service is probably more plausible than interpreting the word to exclude service, and it does not create the same superfluity problem.  Third, the French version of the Convention, which is \"equally authentic\" to the English version, Schlunk, supra, at 699, uses the word \"adresser,\" which has consistently been understood to mean service or notice.  At best, Menon's argument creates an ambiguity as to Article 10(a)'s meaning.  The Court thus turns to additional tools of treaty interpretation, which comfortably resolve any lingering ambiguity in Water Splash's favor.  Pp.\u00a07-8.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(c)\u00a0Three extratextual sources are especially helpful in ascertaining Article 10(a)'s meaning.  First, the Convention's drafting history strongly suggests that the drafters understood that service by postal channels was permissible.  Second, in the half-century since the Convention was adopted, the Executive Branch has consistently maintained that the Hague Service Convention allows service by mail.  Finally, other signatories to the Convention have consistently adopted Water Splash's view.  Pp.\u00a08-12.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(d)\u00a0The fact that Article 10(a) encompasses service by mail does not mean that it affirmatively authorizes such service.  Rather, service by mail is permissible if the receiving state has not objected to service by mail and if such service is authorized under otherwise-applicable law.  Because the Court of Appeals concluded that the Convention prohibited service by mail, it did not consider whether Texas law authorizes the methods of service used by Water Splash.  That and any other remaining issues are left to be considered on remand to the extent they are properly preserved.

No. 6638.  The purpose of that multilateral treaty is to simplify, standardize, and generally improve the process of serving documents abroad.  Preamble, ibid.; see Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft v. Schlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S. 694, 698 (1988).  To that end, the Hague Service Convention specifies certain approved methods of service and \"pre-empts inconsistent methods of service\" wherever it applies.  Id., at 699.  Today we address a question that has divided the lower courts: whether the Convention prohibits service by mail.  We hold that it does not.\nI\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner Water Splash is a corporation that produces aquatic playground systems.  Respondent Menon is a former employee of Water Splash.  In 2013, Water Splash sued Menon in state court in Texas, alleging that she had begun working for a competitor while still employed by Water Splash.  472 S.\u00a0W.\u00a03d 28, 30 (Tex. App. 2015).  Water Splash asserted several causes of action, including unfair competition, conversion, and tortious interference with business relations.  Because Menon resided in Canada, Water Splash sought and obtained permission to effect service by mail.  Ibid.  After Menon declined to answer or otherwise enter an appearance, the trial court issued a default judgment in favor of Water Splash.  Menon moved to set aside the judgment on the ground that she had not been properly served, but the trial court denied the motion.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Menon appealed, arguing that service by mail does not \"comport with the requirements of the Hague Service Convention.\"  Ibid.  The Texas Court of Appeals majority sided with Menon and held that the Convention prohibits service of process by mail.  Id., at 32.  Justice Christopher dissented.  Id., at 34.  The Court of Appeals declined to review the matter en banc, App. 95-96, and the Texas Supreme Court denied discretionary review, id., at 97-98.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The disagreement between the panel majority and Justice Christopher tracks a broader conflict among courts as to whether the Convention permits service through postal channels.  Compare, e.g., Bankston v. Toyota Motor Corp., 889 F.\u00a02d 172, 173-174 (CA8 1989) (holding that the Convention prohibits service by mail), and Nuovo Pignone, SpA v. Storman Asia M\/V, 310 F.\u00a03d 374, 385 (CA5 2002) (same), with, e.g., Brockmeyer v. May, 383 F.\u00a03d 798, 802 (CA9 2004) (holding that the Convention allows service by mail), and Ackermann v. Levine, 788 F.\u00a02d 830, 838-840 (CA2 1986) (same).  We granted certiorari to resolve that conflict.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The \"primary innovation\" of the Hague Service Convention--set out in Articles 2-7--is that it \"requires each state to establish a central authority to receive requests for service of documents from other countries.\"  Schlunk, supra, at 698.  When a central authority receives an appropriate request, it must serve the documents or arrange for their service, Art. 5, and then provide a certificate of service, Art. 6.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Submitting a request to a central authority is not, however, the only method of service approved by the Convention.  For example, Article 8 permits service through diplomatic and consular agents; Article 11 provides that any two states can agree to methods of service not otherwise specified in the Convention; and Article 19 clarifies that the Convention does not preempt any internal laws of its signatories that permit service from abroad via methods not otherwise allowed by the Convention.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At issue in this case is Article 10 of the Convention, the English text of which reads as follows:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"Provided the State of destination does not object, the present Convention shall not interfere with--\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(a) the freedom to send judicial documents, by postal channels, directly to persons abroad,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(b) the freedom of judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of origin to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of destination,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"(c) the freedom of any person interested in a judicial proceeding to effect service of judicial documents directly through the judicial officers, officials or other competent persons of the State of destination.\"  20 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0T., at 363.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Articles 10(b) and 10(c), by their plain terms, address additional methods of service that are permitted by the Convention (unless the receiving state objects).  By contrast, Article 10(a) does not expressly refer to \"service.\"  The question in this case is whether, despite this textual difference, the Article 10(a) phrase \"send judicial documents\" encompasses sending documents for the purposes of service.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In interpreting treaties, \"we begin with the text of the treaty and the context in which the written words are used.\"  Schlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 699 (internal quotation marks omitted).  For present purposes, the key word in Article 10(a) is \"send.\"  This is a broad term,1 and there is no apparent reason why it would exclude the transmission of documents for a particular purpose (namely, service).  Moreover, the structure of the Hague Service Convention strongly counsels against such a reading.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The key structural point is that the scope of the Convention is limited to service of documents.  Several elements of the Convention indicate as much.  First, the preamble states that the Convention is intended \"to ensure that judicial and extrajudicial documents to be served abroad shall be brought to the notice of the addressee in sufficient time.\"  (Emphasis added.)  And Article 1 defines the Convention's scope by stating that the Convention \"shall apply in all cases, in civil or commercial matters, where there is occasion to transmit a judicial or extrajudicial document for service abroad.\"  (Emphasis added.)  Even the Convention's full title reflects that the Convention concerns \"Service Abroad.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have also held as much.  Schlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 701 (stating that the Convention \"applies only to documents transmitted for service abroad\").  As we explained, a preliminary draft of Article 1 was criticized \"because it suggested that the Convention could apply to transmissions abroad that do not culminate in service.\"  Ibid.  The final version of Article 1, however, \"eliminates this possibility.\"  Ibid.  The wording of Article 1 makes clear that the Convention \"applies only when there is both transmission of a document from the requesting state to the receiving state, and service upon the person for whom it is intended.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the text of the Convention reveals, and we have explicitly held, that the scope of the Convention is limited to service of documents.  In light of that, it would be quite strange if Article 10(a)--apparently alone among the Convention's provisions--concerned something other than service of documents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, under that reading, Article 10(a) would be superfluous.  The function of Article 10 is to ensure that, absent objection from the receiving state, the Convention \"shall not interfere\" with the activities described in 10(a), 10(b) and 10(c).  But Article 1 already \"eliminates [the] possibility\" that the Convention would apply to any communications that \"do not culminate in service,\" id., at 701, so it is hard to imagine how the Convention could interfere with any non-service communications.  Accordingly, in order for Article 10(a) to do any work, it must pertain to sending documents for the purposes of service.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Menon attempts to avoid this superfluity problem by suggesting that Article 10(a) does refer to serving documents--but only some documents.  Specifically, she makes a distinction between two categories of service.  According to Menon, Article 10(a) does not apply to service of process (which we have defined as \"a formal delivery of documents that is legally sufficient to charge the defendant with notice of a pending action,\" id., at 700)).  But Article 10(a) does apply, Menon suggests, to the service of \"post-answer judicial documents\" (that is, any additional documents which may have to be served later in the litigation).  Brief for Respondent 30-31.  The problem with this argument is that it lacks any plausible textual footing in Article 10.2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the drafters wished to limit Article 10(a) to a particular subset of documents, they presumably would have said so--as they did, for example, in Article 15, which refers to \"a writ of summons or an equivalent document.\"  Instead, Article 10(a) uses the term \"judicial documents\"--the same term that is featured in 10(b) and 10(c).  Accordingly, the notion that Article 10(a) governs a different set of documents than 10(b) or 10(c) is hard to fathom.  And it certainly derives no support from the use of the word \"send,\" whose ordinary meaning is broad enough to cover the transmission of any judicial documents (including litigation-initiating documents).  Nothing about the word \"send\" suggests that Article 10(a) is narrower than 10(b) and 10(c), let alone that Article 10(a) is somehow limited to \"post-answer\" documents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately, Menon wishes to read the phrase \"send judicial documents\" as \"serve a subset of judicial documents.\"  That is an entirely atextual reading, and Menon offers no sustained argument in support of it.  Therefore, the only way to escape the conclusion that Article 10(a) includes service of process is to assert that it does not cover service of documents at all--and, as shown above, that reading is structurally implausible and renders Article 10(a) superfluous.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The text and structure of the Hague Service Convention, then, strongly suggest that Article 10(a) pertains to service of documents.  The only significant counterargument is that, unlike many other provisions in the Convention, Article 10(a) does not include the word \"service\" or any of its variants.  The Article 10(a) phrase \"send judicial documents,\" the argument goes, should mean something different than the phrase \"effect service of judicial documents\" in the other two subparts of Article 10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This argument does not win the day for several reasons.  First, it must contend with the compelling structural considerations discussed above.  See Air France v. Saks, 470 U.\u00a0S. 392, 397 (1985) (treaty interpretation must take account of the \"context in which the written words are used\"); cf. University of Tex. Southwestern Medical Center v. Nassar, 570 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 13) (\"Just as Congress' choice of words is presumed to be deliberate, so too are its structural choices\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the argument fails on its own terms.  Assume for a second that the word \"send\" must mean something other than \"serve.\"  That would not imply that Article 10(a) must exclude service.  Instead, \"send[ing]\" could be a broader concept that includes service but is not limited to it.  That reading of the word \"send\" is probably more plausible than interpreting it to exclude service, and it does not create the same superfluity problem.3\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, it must be remembered that the French version of the Convention is \"equally authentic\" to the English version.  Schlunk, 486 U.\u00a0S., at 699.  Menon does not seriously engage with the Convention's French text.  But the word \"adresser\"--the French counterpart to the word \"send\" in Article 10(a)--\"has been consistently interpreted as meaning service or notice.\"  Hague Conference on Private Int'l Law, Practical Handbook on the Operation of the Service Convention \u00b6279, p. 91 (4th ed. 2016).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the most that could possibly be said for this argument is that it creates an ambiguity as to Article 10(a)'s meaning.  And when a treaty provision is ambiguous, the Court \"may look beyond the written words to the history of the treaty, the negotiations, and the practical construction adopted by the parties.\"  Schlunk, supra, at 700 (internal quotation marks omitted).  As discussed below, these traditional tools of treaty interpretation comfortably resolve any lingering ambiguity in Water Splash's favor.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Three extratextual sources are especially helpful in ascertaining Article 10(a)'s meaning: the Convention's drafting history, the views of the Executive, and the views of other signatories.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Drafting history has often been used in treaty interpretation.  See Medell\u00edn v. Texas, 552 U.\u00a0S. 491, 507 (2008); Saks, supra, at 400; see also Schlunk, supra, at 700 (analyzing the negotiating history of the Hague Service Convention).  Here, the Convention's drafting history strongly suggests that Article 10(a) allows service through postal channels.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Philip W. Amram was the member of the United States delegation who was most closely involved in the drafting of the Convention.  See S. Exec. Rep. No. 6, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 5 (App.) (1967) (S. Exec. Rep.) (statement of State Department Deputy Legal Adviser Richard D. Kearney).  A few months before the Convention was signed, he published an article describing and summarizing it.  In that article, he stated that \"Article 10 permits direct service by mail .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless [the receiving] state objects to such service.\"  The Proposed International Convention on the Service of Documents Abroad, 51 A.\u00a0B.\u00a0A.\u00a0J. 650, 653 (1965).4\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Along similar lines, the Rapporteur's report on a draft version of Article 10--which did not materially differ from the final version--stated that the \"provision of paragraph 1 also permits service .\u00a0.\u00a0. by telegram\" and that the drafters \"did not accept the proposal that postal channels be limited to registered mail.\"  1 Ristau \u00a74-3-5(a), at 149.  In other words, it was clearly understood that service by postal channels was permissible, and the only question was whether it should be limited to registered mail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court also gives \"great weight\" to \"the Executive Branch's interpretation of a treaty.\"  Abbott v. Abbott, 560 U.\u00a0S. 1, 15 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).  In the half century since the Convention was adopted, the Executive has consistently maintained that the Hague Service Convention allows service by mail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When President Johnson transmitted the Convention to the Senate for its advice and consent, he included a report by Secretary of State Dean Rusk.  That report stated that \"Article 10 permits direct service by mail .\u00a0.\u00a0. unless [the receiving] state objects to such service.\"  Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters: Message From the President of the United States, S. Exec. Doc. C, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1967).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1989, the Eighth Circuit issued Bankston, the first Federal Court of Appeals decision holding that the Hague Service Convention prohibits service by mail.  889 F.\u00a02d, at 174.  The State Department expressed its disagreement with Bankston in a letter addressed to the Administrative Office of the U.\u00a0S. Courts and the National Center for State Courts.  See Notice of Other Documents (1), United States Department of State Opinion Regarding the Bankston Case and Service by Mail to Japan Under the Hague Service Convention, 30 I.\u00a0L.\u00a0M. 260, 260-261 (1991) (excerpts of Mar. 14, 1990, letter).  The letter stated that \"Bankston is incorrect to the extent that it suggests that the Hague Convention does not permit as a method of service of process the sending of a copy of a summons and complaint by registered mail to a defendant in a foreign country.\"  Id., at 261.  The State Department takes the same position on its website.5\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, this Court has given \"considerable weight\" to the views of other parties to a treaty.

Montoya Alvarez, 572 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 9) (noting the importance of \"read[ing] the treaty in a manner consistent with the shared expectations of the contracting parties\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And other signatories to the Convention have consistently adopted Water Splash's view.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Multiple foreign courts have held that the Hague Service Convention allows for service by mail.6  In addition, several of the Convention's signatories have either objected, or declined to object, to service by mail under Article  10, thereby acknowledging that Article 10 encompasses service by mail.7  Finally, several Special Commissions--comprising numerous contracting States--have expressly stated that the Convention does not prohibit service by mail.8  By contrast, Menon identifies no evidence that any signatory has ever rejected Water Splash's view.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, the traditional tools of treaty interpretation unmistakably demonstrate that Article 10(a) encompasses service by mail.  To be clear, this does not mean that the Convention affirmatively authorizes service by mail.  Article 10(a) simply provides that, as long as the receiving state does not object, the Convention does not \"interfere with .\u00a0.\u00a0. the freedom\" to serve documents through postal channels.  In other words, in cases governed by the Hague Service Convention, service by mail is permissible if two conditions are met: first, the receiving state has not objected to service by mail; and second, service by mail is authorized under otherwise-applicable law.  See Brockmeyer, 383 F.\u00a03d, at 803-804.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the Court of Appeals concluded that the Convention prohibited service by mail outright, it had no occasion to consider whether Texas law authorizes the methods of service used by Water Splash.  We leave that question, and any other remaining issues, to be considered on remand to the extent they are properly preserved.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and we remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1\u00a0See Black's Law Dictionary 1568 (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"send,\" in part, as \"[t]o cause to be moved or conveyed from a present location to another place; esp., to deposit (a writing or notice) in the mail\").\nFootnote 2\u00a0The argument also assumes that the scope of the Convention is not limited to service of process (otherwise, Article 10(a) would be superfluous even under Menon's reading).  Schlunk can be read to suggest that this assumption is wrong.  486 U.\u00a0S., at 700-701; see 1 B. Ristau, International Judicial Assistance \u00a74-1-4(2), p. 112 (1990 rev. ed.) (Ristau) (stating that the English term \"service\" in the Convention \"means the formal delivery of a legal document to the addressee in such a manner as to legally charge him with notice of the institution of a legal proceeding\").  For the purposes of this discussion, we will assume, arguendo, that Menon's assumption is correct.\nFootnote 3\u00a0Another plausible explanation for the distinct terminology of Article 10(a) is that it is the only provision in the Convention that specifically contemplates direct service, without the use of an intermediary.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13 (\"[I]n contrast to Article 10(a), all other methods of service identified in the Convention require the affirmative engagement of an intermediary to effect 'service'\u00a0\").  The use of the word \"send\" may simply have been intended to reflect that distinction.\nFootnote 4\u00a0Two years later, Amram testified to the same effect before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

MASSSACHUSETTS(2017)\nNo. 16-240\nArgued: April 19, 2017Decided: June 22, 2017\n\n\nWhen petitioner was tried in a Massachusetts trial court, the courtroom could not accommodate all the potential jurors.  As a result, for two days of jury selection, an officer of the court excluded from the courtroom any member of the public who was not a potential juror, including petitioner's mother and her minister.  Defense counsel neither objected to the closure at trial nor raised the issue on direct review.  Petitioner was convicted of murder and a related charge.  Five years later, he filed a motion for a new trial in state court, arguing, as relevant here, that his attorney had provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the courtroom closure.  The trial court ruled that he was not entitled to relief.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed in relevant part.  Although it recognized that the violation of the right to public trial was a structural error, it rejected petitioner's ineffective-assistance claim because he had not shown prejudice.  \nHeld:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0In the context of a public-trial violation during jury selection, where the error is neither preserved nor raised on direct review but is raised later via an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, the defendant must demonstrate prejudice to secure a new trial.  Pp.\u00a05-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0This case requires an examination of the proper application of the doctrines of structural error and ineffective assistance of counsel.  They are intertwined, because the reasons an error is deemed structural may influence the proper standard used to evaluate an ineffective-assistance claim premised on the failure to object to that error.  Pp.\u00a05-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1)\u00a0Generally, a constitutional error that \"did not contribute to the verdict obtained\" is deemed harmless, which means the defendant is not entitled to reversal.  Chapman v. California, 386 U.\u00a0S. 18, 24.  However, a structural error, which \"affect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds,\" Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.\u00a0S. 279, 310, defies harmless error analysis, id., at 309.  Thus, when a structural error is objected to and then raised on direct review, the defendant is entitled to relief without any inquiry into harm.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There appear to be at least three broad rationales for finding an error to be structural.  One is when the right at issue does not protect the defendant from erroneous conviction but instead protects some other interest--like the defendant's right to conduct his own defense--where harm is irrelevant to the basis underlying the right.  See United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.\u00a0S. 140, 149, n.\u00a04.  Another is when the error's effects are simply too hard to measure--e.g., when a defendant is denied the right to select his or her own attorney--making it almost impossible for the government to show that the error was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Chapman, supra, at 24.  Finally, some errors always result in fundamental unfairness, e.g., when an indigent defendant is denied an attorney, see Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.\u00a0S. 335, 343-345.  For purposes of this case, a critical point is that an error can count as structural even if it does not lead to fundamental unfairness in every case.  See Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 149, n.\u00a04.  Pp.\u00a05-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2)\u00a0While a public-trial violation counts as structural error, it does not always lead to fundamental unfairness.  This Court's opinions teach that courtroom closure is to be avoided, but that there are some circumstances when it is justified.  See Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.\u00a0S. 39; Presley v. Georgia, 558 U.\u00a0S. 209, 215-216.  The fact that the public-trial right is subject to exceptions suggests that not every public-trial violation results in fundamental unfairness.  Indeed, the Court has said that a public-trial violation is structural because of the \"difficulty of assessing the effect of the error.\"  Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 149, n.\u00a04.  The public-trial right also furthers interests other than protecting the defendant against unjust conviction, including the rights of the press and of the public at large.  See, e.g., Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty., 464 U.\u00a0S. 501, 508-510.  Thus, an unlawful closure could take place and yet the trial will still be fundamentally fair from the defendant's standpoint.  Pp.\u00a07-10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b) The proper remedy for addressing the violation of the right to a public trial depends on when the objection was raised.  If an objection is made at trial and the issue is raised on direct appeal, the defendant generally is entitled to \"automatic reversal\" regardless of the error's actual \"effect on the outcome.\"  Neder v. United States, 527 U.\u00a0S. 1, 7.  If, however, the defendant does not preserve a structural error on direct review but raises it later in the context of an ineffective-assistance claim, the defendant generally bears the burden to show deficient performance and that the attorney's error \"prejudiced the defense.\"  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, 687.  To demonstrate prejudice in most cases, the defendant must show \"a reasonable probability that .\u00a0.\u00a0 . the result of the proceeding would have been different\" but for attorney error.  Id., at 694.  For the analytical purposes of this case, the Court will assume, as petitioner has requested, that even if there is no showing of a reasonable probability of a different outcome, relief still must be granted if the defendant shows that attorney errors rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Not every public-trial violation will lead to a fundamentally unfair trial.  And the failure to object to that violation does not always deprive the defendant of a reasonable probability of a different outcome.  Thus, a defendant raising a public-trial violation via an ineffective-assistance claim must show either a reasonable probability of a different outcome in his or her case or, as assumed here, that the particular violation was so serious as to render the trial fundamentally unfair.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither this reasoning nor the holding here calls into question the Court's precedents deeming certain errors structural and requiring reversal because of fundamental unfairness, see Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 278-279; Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.\u00a0S. 510, 535; Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 261-264, or those granting automatic relief to defendants who prevailed on claims of race or gender discrimination in jury selection, e.g., Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.\u00a0S. 79, 100.  The errors in each of these cases were preserved and then raised on direct appeal.  The reason for placing the burden on the petitioner here, however, derives both from the nature of the error and the difference between a public-trial violation preserved and then raised on direct review and a public-trial violation raised as an ineffective-assistance claim.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a defendant objects to a courtroom closure, the trial court can either order the courtroom opened or explain the reasons for keeping it closed, but when a defendant first raises the closure in an ineffective-assistance claim, the trial court has no chance to cure the violation.  The costs and uncertainties of a new trial are also greater because more time will have elapsed in most cases.  And the finality interest is more at risk.  See Strickland, supra, at 693-694.  These differences justify a different standard for evaluating a structural error depending on whether it is raised on direct review or in an ineffective-assistance claim.  Pp.\u00a010-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Because petitioner has not shown a reasonable probability of a different outcome but for counsel's failure to object or that counsel's shortcomings led to a fundamentally unfair trial, he is not entitled to a new trial.  Although potential jurors might have behaved differently had petitioner's family or the public been present, petitioner has offered no evidence suggesting a reasonable probability of a different outcome but for counsel's failure to object.  He has also failed to demonstrate fundamental unfairness.  His mother and her minister were indeed excluded during jury selection.  But his trial was not conducted in secret or in a remote place; closure was limited to the jury voir\u00a0dire; the courtroom remained open during the evidentiary phase of the trial; the closure decision apparently was made by court officers, not the judge; venire members who did not become jurors observed the proceedings; and the record of the proceedings indicates no basis for concern, other than the closure itself.  There was no showing, furthermore, that the potential harms flowing from a courtroom closure came to pass in this case, e.g., misbehavior by the prosecutor, judge, or any other party.  Thus, even though this case comes here on the assumption that the closure was a Sixth Amendment violation, the violation here did not pervade the whole trial or lead to basic unfairness.  Pp.\u00a014-16.\n474 Mass. 787, 54 N.\u00a0E. 3d 495, affirmed.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Kennedy, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Roberts, C.\u00a0J., and Thomas, Ginsburg, Sotomayor, and Gorsuch, JJ., joined.

MASSACHUSETTS\non writ of certiorari to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts\n[June 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During petitioner's trial on state criminal charges, the courtroom was occupied by potential jurors and closed to the public for two days of the jury selection process.  Defense counsel neither objected to the closure at trial nor raised the issue on direct review.  And the case comes to the Court on the assumption that, in failing to object, defense counsel provided ineffective assistance.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the direct review context, the underlying constitutional violation--the courtroom closure--has been treated by this Court as a structural error, i.e., an error entitling the defendant to automatic reversal without any inquiry into prejudice.  The question is whether invalidation of the conviction is required here as well, or if the prejudice inquiry is altered when the structural error is raised in the context of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 2003, a 15-year-old boy was shot and killed in Boston.  A witness saw a young man fleeing the scene of the crime and saw him pull out a pistol.  A baseball hat fell off of his head.  The police recovered the hat, which featured a distinctive airbrushed Detroit Tigers logo on either side.  The hat's distinctive markings linked it to 16-year-old Kentel Weaver.  He is the petitioner here.  DNA obtained from the hat matched petitioner's DNA.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks after the crime, the police went to petitioner's house to question him.  He admitted losing his hat around the time of the shooting but denied being involved.  Petitioner's mother was not so sure.  Later, she questioned petitioner herself.  She asked whether he had been at the scene of the shooting, and he said he had been there.  But when she asked if he was the shooter, or if he knew who the shooter was, petitioner put his head down and said nothing.  Believing his response to be an admission of guilt, she insisted that petitioner go to the police station to confess.  He did.  Petitioner was indicted in Massachusetts state court for first-degree murder and the unlicensed possession of a handgun.  He pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The pool of potential jury members was large, some 60 to 100 people. The assigned courtroom could accommodate only 50 or 60 in the courtroom seating.  As a result, the trial judge brought all potential jurors into the courtroom so that he could introduce the case and ask certain preliminary questions of the entire venire panel.  Many of the potential jurors did not have seats and had to stand in the courtroom.  After the preliminary questions, the potential jurors who had been standing were moved outside the courtroom to wait during the individual questioning of the other potential jurors.  The judge acknowledged that the hallway was not \"the most comfortable place to wait\" and thanked the potential jurors for their patience.  2 Tr. II-103 (Apr. 10, 2006).  The judge noted that there was simply not space in the courtroom for everybody.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As all of the seats in the courtroom were occupied by the venire panel, an officer of the court excluded from the courtroom any member of the public who was not a potential juror.  So when petitioner's mother and her minister came to the courtroom to observe the two days of jury selection, they were turned away.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0All this occurred before the Court's decision in Presley v. Georgia, 558 U.\u00a0S. 209 (2010) (per curiam).  Presley made it clear that the public-trial right extends to jury selection as well as to other portions of the trial.  Id., at 213-215.  Before Presley, Massachusetts courts would often close courtrooms to the public during jury selection, in particular during murder trials.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In this case petitioner's mother told defense counsel about the closure at some point during jury selection.  But counsel \"believed that a courtroom closure for [\u00a0jury selection] was constitutional.\"  Crim. No. 2003-11293 (Super. Ct. Mass., Feb. 22, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. 49a.  As a result, he \"did not discuss the matter\" with petitioner, or tell him \"that his right to a public trial included the [\u00a0jury voir\u00a0dire],\" or object to the closure.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0During the ensuing trial, the government presented strong evidence of petitioner's guilt.  Its case consisted of the incriminating details outlined above, including petitioner's confession to the police.  The jury convicted petitioner on both counts.  The court sentenced him to life in prison on the murder charge and to about a year in prison on the gun-possession charge.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Five years later, petitioner filed a motion for a new trial in Massachusetts state court.  As relevant here, he argued that his attorney had provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the courtroom closure.  After an evidentiary hearing, the trial court recognized a violation of the right to a public trial based on the following findings: The courtroom had been closed; the closure was neither de minimis nor trivial; the closure was unjustified; and the closure was full rather than partial (meaning that all members of the public, rather than only some of them, had been excluded from the courtroom).  The trial court further determined that defense counsel failed to object because of \"serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention.\"  Id., at 63a (quoting Massachusetts v. Chleikh, 82 Mass. App. 718, 722, 978 N.\u00a0E. 2d 96, 100 (2012)).  On the other hand, petitioner had not \"offered any evidence or legal argument establishing prejudice.\"  App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a.  For that reason, the court held that petitioner was not entitled to relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Petitioner appealed the denial of the motion for a new trial to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.  The court consolidated that appeal with petitioner's direct appeal.  As noted, there had been no objection to the closure at trial; and the issue was not raised in the direct appeal.  The Supreme Judicial Court then affirmed in relevant part.  Although it recognized that \"[a] violation of the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial constitutes structural error,\" the court stated that petitioner had \"failed to show that trial counsel's conduct caused prejudice warranting a new trial.\"  474 Mass. 787, 814, 54 N.\u00a0E. 3d 495, 520 (2016).  On this reasoning, the court rejected petitioner's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is disagreement among the Federal Courts of Appeals and some state courts of last resort about whether a defendant must demonstrate prejudice in a case like this one--in which a structural error is neither preserved nor raised on direct review but is raised later via a claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.  Some courts have held that, when a defendant shows that his attorney unreasonably failed to object to a structural error, the defendant is entitled to a new trial without further inquiry.  See, e.g., Johnson v. Sherry, 586 F.\u00a03d 439, 447 (CA6 2009); Owens v. United States, 483 F.\u00a03d 48, 64-65 (CA1 2007); Littlejohn v. United States, 73 A.\u00a03d 1034, 1043-1044 (D.\u00a0C. 2013); State v. Lamere, 327 Mont. 115, 125, 112 P.\u00a03d 1005, 1013 (2005).  Other courts have held that the defendant is entitled to relief only if he or she can show prejudice.  See, e.g., Purvis v. Crosby, 451 F.\u00a03d 734, 738 (CA11 2006); United States v. Gomez, 705 F.\u00a03d 68, 79-80 (CA2 2013); Reid v. State, 286 Ga. 484, 487, 690 S.\u00a0E. 2d 177, 180-181 (2010).  This Court granted certiorari to resolve that disagreement.  580\u00a0U.\u00a0S. ___ (2017).  The Court does so specifically and only in the context of trial counsel's failure to object to the closure of the courtroom during jury selection.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case requires a discussion, and the proper application, of two doctrines: structural error and ineffective assistance of counsel.  The two doctrines are intertwined; for the reasons an error is deemed structural may influence the proper standard used to evaluate an ineffective-assistance claim premised on the failure to object to that error.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The concept of structural error can be discussed first.  In Chapman v. California, 386 U.\u00a0S. 18 (1967), this Court \"adopted the general rule that a constitutional error does not automatically require reversal of a conviction.\"  Ari- zona v. Fulminante, 499 U.\u00a0S. 279, 306 (1991) (citing Chap- man, supra).  If the government can show \"beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not  contribute to the verdict obtained,\" the Court held, then the error is deemed harmless and the defendant is not entitled to reversal.  Id., at 24.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court recognized, however, that some errors should not be deemed harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  Id., at 23, n. 8.  These errors came to be known as structural errors.  See Fulminante, 499 U.\u00a0S., at 309-310.  The purpose of the structural error doctrine is to ensure insistence on certain basic, constitutional guarantees that should define the framework of any criminal trial.  Thus, the defining feature of a structural error is that it \"affect[s] the framework within which the trial proceeds,\" rather than being \"simply an error in the trial process itself.\"  Id., at 310.  For the same reason, a structural error \"def[ies] analysis by harmless error standards.\"  Id., at 309 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The precise reason why a particular error is not amenable to that kind of analysis--and thus the precise reason why the Court has deemed it structural--varies in a significant way from error to error.  There appear to be at least three broad rationales.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0First, an error has been deemed structural in some instances if the right at issue is not designed to protect the defendant from erroneous conviction but instead protects some other interest.  This is true of the defendant's right to conduct his own defense, which, when exercised, \"usually increases the likelihood of a trial outcome unfavorable to the defendant.\"  McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.\u00a0S. 168, 177, n.\u00a08 (1984).  That right is based on the fundamental legal principle that a defendant must be allowed to make his own choices about the proper way to protect his own liberty.  See Faretta v. California, 422 U.\u00a0S. 806, 834 (1975).  Because harm is irrelevant to the basis underlying the right, the Court has deemed a violation of that right structural error.  See United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.\u00a0S. 140, 149, n.\u00a04 (2006).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, an error has been deemed structural if the effects of the error are simply too hard to measure.  For example, when a defendant is denied the right to select his or her own attorney, the precise \"effect of the violation cannot be ascertained.\"  Ibid. (quoting Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.\u00a0S. 254, 263 (1986)).  Because the government will, as a result, find it almost impossible to show that the error was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt,\" Chapman, supra, at 24, the efficiency costs of letting the government try to make the showing are unjustified.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, an error has been deemed structural if the error always results in fundamental unfairness.  For example, if an indigent defendant is denied an attorney or if the judge fails to give a reasonable-doubt instruction, the resulting trial is always a fundamentally unfair one.  See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.\u00a0S. 335, 343-345 (1963) (right to an attorney); Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.\u00a0S. 275, 279  (1993) (right to a reasonable-doubt instruction).  It therefore would be futile for the government to try to show harmlessness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These categories are not rigid.  In a particular case, more than one of these rationales may be part of the explanation for why an error is deemed to be structural.  See e.g., id., at 280-282.  For these purposes, however, one point is critical: An error can count as structural even if the error does not lead to fundamental unfairness in every case.  See Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 149, n.\u00a04 (rejecting as \"inconsistent with the reasoning of our precedents\" the idea that structural errors \"always or necessarily render a trial fundamentally unfair and unreliable\" (emphasis deleted)).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As noted above, a violation of the right to a public trial is a structural error.  See supra, at 1, 4.  It is relevant to determine why that is so.  In particular, the question is whether a public-trial violation counts as structural because it always leads to fundamental unfairness or for some other reason.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.\u00a0S. 39 (1984), the state court prohibited the public from viewing a weeklong suppression hearing out of concern for the privacy of persons other than those on trial.  See id., at 41-43.  Although it recognized that there would be instances where closure was justified, this Court noted that \"such circumstances will be rare\" and that the closure in question was unjustified.  Id., at 45, 48.  Still, the Court did not order a new trial.  Id., at 49-50.  Instead it ordered a new suppression hearing that was open to the public.  Id., at 50.  If the same evidence was found admissible in that renewed pretrial proceeding, the Court held, no new trial as to guilt would be necessary.  Ibid.  This was despite the structural aspect of the violation.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some 25 years after the Waller decision, the Court issued its per curiam ruling in Presley v. Georgia.  558 U.\u00a0S. 209.  In that case, as here, the courtroom was closed to the public during jury voir\u00a0dire.  Id., at 210.  Unlike here, however, there was a trial objection to the closure, and the issue was raised on direct appeal.  Id., at 210-211. On review of the State Supreme Court's decision allowing the closure, this Court expressed concern that the state court's reasoning would allow the courtroom to be closed during jury selection \"whenever the trial judge decides, for whatever reason, that he or she would prefer to fill the courtroom with potential jurors rather than spectators.\"  Id., at 215 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although the Court expressly noted that courtroom closure may be ordered in some circumstances, the Court also stated that it was \"still incumbent upon\" the trial court \"to consider all reasonable alternatives to closure.\"  Id., at 215-216.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These opinions teach that courtroom closure is to be avoided, but that there are some circumstances when it is justified.  The problems that may be encountered by trial courts in deciding whether some closures are necessary, or even in deciding which members of the public should be admitted when seats are scarce, are difficult ones.  For example, there are often preliminary instructions that a judge may want to give to the venire as a whole, rather than repeating those instructions (perhaps with unintentional differences) to several groups of potential jurors.  On the other hand, various constituencies of the public--the family of the accused, the family of the victim, members of the press, and other persons--all have their own interests in observing the selection of jurors.  How best to manage these problems is not a topic discussed at length in any decision or commentary the Court has found.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0So although the public-trial right is structural, it is subject to exceptions.  See Simonson, The Criminal Court Audience in a Post-Trial World, 127 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 2173, 2219-2222 (2014) (discussing situations in which a trial court may order a courtroom closure).  Though these cases should be rare, a judge may deprive a defendant of his right to an open courtroom by making proper factual findings in support of the decision to do so.  See Waller, supra, at 45.  The fact that the public-trial right is subject to these exceptions suggests that not every public-trial violation results in fundamental unfairness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A public-trial violation can occur, moreover, as it did in Presley, simply because the trial court omits to make the proper findings before closing the courtroom, even if those findings might have been fully supported by the evidence.  See 558 U.\u00a0S., at 215.  It would be unconvincing to deem a trial fundamentally unfair just because a judge omitted to announce factual findings before making an otherwise valid decision to order the courtroom temporarily closed.  As a result, it would be likewise unconvincing if the Court had said that a public-trial violation always leads to a fundamentally unfair trial.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the Court has not said that a public-trial violation renders a trial fundamentally unfair in every case.  In the two cases in which the Court has discussed the reasons for classifying a public-trial violation as structural error, the Court has said that a public-trial violation is structural for a different reason: because of the \"difficulty of assessing the effect of the error.\"  Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 149, n.\u00a04; see also Waller, supra, at 49, n.\u00a09.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The public-trial right also protects some interests that do not belong to the defendant.  After all, the right to an open courtroom protects the rights of the public at large, and the press, as well as the rights of the accused.  See, e.g., Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court of Cal., Riverside Cty., 464 U.\u00a0S. 501, 508-510 (1984); Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.\u00a0S. 555, 572-573 (1980).  So one other factor leading to the classification of structural error is that the public-trial right furthers interests other than protecting the defendant against unjust conviction.  These precepts confirm the conclusion the Court now reaches that, while the public-trial right is important for fundamental reasons, in some cases an unlawful closure might take place and yet the trial still will be fundamentally fair from the defendant's standpoint.\nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court now turns to the proper remedy for addressing the violation of a structural right, and in particular the right to a public trial.  Despite its name, the term \"structural error\" carries with it no talismanic significance as a doctrinal matter.  It means only that the government is not entitled to deprive the defendant of a new trial by showing that the error was \"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  Chapman, 386 U.\u00a0S., at 24.  Thus, in the case of a structural error where there is an objection at trial and the issue is raised on direct appeal, the defendant generally is entitled to \"automatic reversal\" regardless of the error's actual \"effect on the outcome.\"  Neder v. United States, 527 U.\u00a0S. 1, 7 (1999).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question then becomes what showing is necessary when the defendant does not preserve a structural error on direct review but raises it later in the context of an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  To obtain relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, the defendant as a general rule bears the burden to meet two standards.  First, the defendant must show deficient performance--that the attorney's error was \"so serious that counsel was not functioning as the 'counsel' guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment.\"  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, 687 (1984).  Second, the defendant must show that the attorney's error \"prejudiced the defense.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The prejudice showing is in most cases a necessary part of a Strickland claim.  The reason is that a defendant has a right to effective representation, not a right to an attorney who performs his duties \"mistake-free.\"  Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.\u00a0S., at 147.  As a rule, therefore, a \"violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective representation is not 'complete' until the defendant is prejudiced.\"  Ibid. (emphasis deleted); see also Premo v. Moore, 562 U.\u00a0S. 115, 128 (2011); Lockhart v. Fretwell, 506 U.\u00a0S. 364, 370 (1993).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That said, the concept of prejudice is defined in different ways depending on the context in which it appears.  In the ordinary Strickland case, prejudice means \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 694.  But the Strickland Court cautioned that the prejudice inquiry is not meant to be applied in a \"mechanical\" fashion.  Id., at 696.  For when a court is evaluating an ineffective-assistance claim, the ultimate inquiry must concentrate on \"the fundamental fairness of the proceeding.\"  Ibid.  Petitioner therefore argues that under a proper interpretation of Strickland, even if there is no showing of a reasonable probability of a different outcome, relief still must be granted if the convicted person shows that attorney errors rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.  For the analytical purposes of this case, the Court will assume that petitioner's interpretation of Strickland is the correct one.  In light of the Court's ultimate holding, however, the Court need not decide that question here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As explained above, not every public-trial violation will in fact lead to a fundamentally unfair trial.  See supra, at 10.  Nor can it be said that the failure to object to a public-trial violation always deprives the defendant of a reasonable probability of a different outcome.  Thus, when a defendant raises a public-trial violation via an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, Strickland prejudice is not shown automatically.  Instead, the burden is on the defendant to show either a reasonable probability of a different outcome in his or her case or, as the Court has assumed for these purposes, see supra, at 11, to show that the particular public-trial violation was so serious as to render his or her trial fundamentally unfair.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Neither the reasoning nor the holding here calls into question the Court's precedents determining that certain errors are deemed structural and require reversal because they cause fundamental unfairness, either to the defendant in the specific case or by pervasive undermining of the systemic requirements of a fair and open judicial process.  See Murray, A Contextual Approach to Harmless Error Review, 130 Harv. L.\u00a0Rev. 1791, 1813, 1822 (2017) (noting that the \"eclectic normative objectives of criminal procedure\" go beyond protecting a defendant from erroneous conviction and include ensuring \"\u00a0'that the administration of justice should reasonably appear to be disinterested'\u00a0\" (quoting Liljeberg v. Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.\u00a0S. 847, 869-870 (1988))).  Those precedents include Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.\u00a0S., at 278-279 (failure to give a reasonable-doubt instruction); Tumey v. Ohio, 273 U.\u00a0S. 510, 535 (1927) (biased judge); and Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.\u00a0S., at 261-264 (exclusion of grand jurors on the basis of race).  See Neder, supra, at 8 (describing each of these errors as structural).  This Court, in addition, has granted automatic relief to defendants who prevailed on claims alleging race or gender discrimination in the selection of the petit jury, see Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.\u00a0S. 79, 100 (1986); J. E. B. v. Alabama ex rel. T. B., 511 U.\u00a0S. 127, 145-146 (1994), though the Court has yet to label those errors structural in express terms, see, e.g., Neder, supra, at 8.  The errors in those cases necessitated automatic reversal after they were preserved and then raised on direct appeal.  And this opinion does not address whether the result should be any different if the errors were raised instead in an ineffective-assistance claim on collateral review.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The reason for placing the burden on the petitioner in this case, however, derives both from the nature of the error, see supra, at 11-12, and the difference between a public-trial violation preserved and then raised on direct review and a public-trial violation raised as an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  As explained above, when a defendant objects to a courtroom closure, the trial court can either order the courtroom opened or explain the reasons for keeping it closed.  See supra, at 8-9.  When a defendant first raises the closure in an ineffective-assistance claim, however, the trial court is deprived of the chance to cure the violation either by opening the courtroom or by explaining the reasons for closure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, when state or federal courts adjudicate errors objected to during trial and then raised on direct review, the systemic costs of remedying the error are diminished to some extent.  That is because, if a new trial is ordered on direct review, there may be a reasonable chance that not too much time will have elapsed for witness memories still to be accurate and physical evidence not to be lost.  There are also advantages of direct judicial supervision.  Reviewing courts, in the regular course of the appellate process, can give instruction to the trial courts in a familiar context that allows for elaboration of the relevant principles based on review of an adequate record.  For instance, in this case, the factors and circumstances that might justify a temporary closure are best considered in the regular appellate process and not in the context of a later proceeding, with its added time delays.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim is raised in postconviction proceedings, the costs and uncertainties of a new trial are greater because more time will have elapsed in most cases.  The finality interest is more at risk, see Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 693-694 (noting the \"profound importance of finality in criminal proceedings\"), and direct review often has given at least one opportunity for an appellate review of trial proceedings.  These differences justify a different standard for evaluating a structural error depending on whether it is raised on direct review or raised instead in a claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, \"[a]n ineffective-assistance claim can function as a way to escape rules of waiver and forfeiture and raise issues not presented at trial,\" thus undermining the finality of jury verdicts.  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\u00a0S. 86, 105 (2011).  For this reason, the rules governing ineffective-assistance claims \"must be applied with scrupulous care.\"  Premo, 562 U.\u00a0S., at 122.\nIV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The final inquiry concerns the ineffective-assistance claim in this case.  Although the case comes on the assumption that petitioner has shown deficient performance by counsel, he has not shown prejudice in the ordinary sense, i.e., a reasonable probability that the jury would not have convicted him if his attorney had objected to the closure.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is of course possible that potential jurors might have behaved differently if petitioner's family had been present.  And it is true that the presence of the public might have had some bearing on juror reaction.  But here petitioner offered no \"evidence or legal argument establishing prejudice\" in the sense of a reasonable probability of a different outcome but for counsel's failure to object.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 64a; see Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 694.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In other circumstances a different result might obtain.  If, for instance, defense counsel errs in failing to object when the government's main witness testifies in secret, then the defendant might be able to show prejudice with little more detail.  See ibid.  Even in those circumstances, however, the burden would remain on the defendant to make the prejudice showing, id., at 694, 696, because a public-trial violation does not always lead to a fundamentally unfair trial, see supra, at 10.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of the above assumption that prejudice can be shown by a demonstration of fundamental unfairness, see supra, at 11, the remaining question is whether petitioner has shown that counsel's failure to object rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.  See Strickland, supra, at 696.  The Court concludes that petitioner has not made the showing.  Although petitioner's mother and her minister were indeed excluded from the courtroom for two days during jury selection, petitioner's trial was not conducted in secret or in a remote place.  Cf. In re Oliver, 333 U.\u00a0S. 257, 269, n.\u00a022 (1948).  The closure was limited to the jury voir\u00a0dire; the courtroom remained open during the evidentiary phase of the trial; the closure decision apparently was made by court officers rather than the judge; there were many members of the venire who did not become jurors but who did observe the proceedings; and there was a record made of the proceedings that does not indicate any basis for concern, other than the closure itself.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There has been no showing, furthermore, that the potential harms flowing from a courtroom closure came to pass in this case.  For example, there is no suggestion that any juror lied during voir\u00a0dire; no suggestion of misbehavior by the prosecutor, judge, or any other party; and no suggestion that any of the participants failed to approach their duties with the neutrality and serious purpose that our system demands.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that this case comes here on the assumption that the closure was a Sixth Amendment violation.  And it must be recognized that open trials ensure respect for the justice system and allow the press and the public to judge the proceedings that occur in our Nation's courts.  Even so, the violation here did not pervade the whole trial or lead to basic unfairness.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In sum, petitioner has not shown a reasonable probability of a different outcome but for counsel's failure to object, and he has not shown that counsel's shortcomings led to a fundamentally unfair trial.  He is not entitled to a new trial.\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the criminal justice system, the constant, indeed unending, duty of the judiciary is to seek and to find the proper balance between the necessity for fair and just trials and the importance of finality of judgments.  When a structural error is preserved and raised on direct review, the balance is in the defendant's favor, and a new trial generally will be granted as a matter of right.  When a structural error is raised in the context of an ineffective-assistance claim, however, finality concerns are far more pronounced.  For this reason, and in light of the other circumstances present in this case, petitioner must show prejudice in order to obtain a new trial.  As explained above, he has not made the required showing.  The judgment of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court is affirmed.\nIt is so ordered.\n\nThomas, J., concurring\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-240\nKENTEL MYRONE WEAVER, PETITIONER v. MASSACHUSETTS\non writ of certiorari to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts\n[June 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Thomas, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I write separately with two observations about the scope of the Court's holding.  First, this case comes to us on the parties' \"assumption[s]\" that the closure of the courtroom during jury selection \"was a Sixth Amendment violation\" and that \"defense counsel provided ineffective assistance\" by \"failing to object\" to it.  Ante, at 1, 15.  The Court previously held in a per curiam opinion--issued without the benefit of merits briefing or argument--that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends to jury selection.  See Presley v. Georgia, 558 U.\u00a0S. 209, 213 (2010); id., at 216 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  I have some doubts about whether that holding is consistent with the original understanding of the right to a public trial, and I would be open to reconsidering it in a case in which we are asked to do so.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the Court \"assume[s],\" for the \"analytical purposes of this case,\" that a defendant may establish prejudice under Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668 (1984), by demonstrating that his attorney's error led to a fundamentally unfair trial.  Ante, at 11.  According to Strickland, a defendant may establish prejudice by showing \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different\"; by showing an \"[a]ctual or constructive denial of the assistance of counsel altogether\"; or by showing that counsel labored under \"an actual conflict of interest.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 692-694.  Strickland did not hold, as the Court assumes, that a defendant may establish prejudice by showing that his counsel's errors \"rendered the trial fundamentally unfair.\"  Ante, at 11.  Because the Court concludes that the closure during petitioner's jury selection did not lead to fundamental unfairness in any event, ante, at 15-16, no part of the discussion about fundamental unfairness, see ante, at 11-15, is necessary to its result.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of these observations, I do not read the opinion of the Court to preclude the approach set forth in Justice Alito's opinion, which correctly applies our precedents.\n\nAlito, J., concurring in judgment\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-240\nKENTEL MYRONE WEAVER, PETITIONER v. MASSACHUSETTS\non writ of certiorari to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts\n[June 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Alito, with whom Justice Gorsuch joins, concurring in the judgment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case calls for a straightforward application of the familiar standard for evaluating ineffective assistance of counsel claims.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, 687 (1984).  Weaver cannot meet that standard, and therefore his claim must be rejected.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Sixth Amendment protects a criminal defendant's right \"to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\"  That right is violated when (1) \"counsel's performance was deficient\" in the relevant sense of the term and (2) \"the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\"  Strickland, supra, at 687.  The prejudice requirement--which is the one at issue in this case--\"arises from the very nature\" of the right to effective representation: Counsel simply \"cannot be 'ineffective' unless his mistakes have harmed the defense (or, at least, unless it is reasonably likely that they have).\"  United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.\u00a0S. 140, 147 (2006).  In other words, \"a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to effective representation is not 'complete' until the defendant is prejudiced.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Strickland's definition of prejudice is based on the reli-ability of the underlying proceeding.  \"The benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel's conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result.\"  466 U.\u00a0S., at 686 (emphasis added); see United States v. Cronic, 466 U.\u00a0S. 648, 658 (1984).  This is so because \"[t]he purpose of the Sixth Amendment guarantee of counsel is to ensure that a defendant has the assistance necessary to justify reliance on the outcome of the proceeding.\"  Strickland, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 691-692.  Accordingly, an attorney's error \"does not warrant setting aside the judgment of a criminal proceeding if the error had no effect on the judgment.\"  Id., at 691.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weaver makes much of the Strickland Court's statement that \"the ultimate focus of inquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding.\"  Id., at 696.  But the very next sentence clarifies what the Court had in mind, namely, the reliability of the proceeding.  In that sentence, the Court explains that the proper concern--\"[i]n every case\"--is \"whether, despite the strong presumption of reliability, the result of the particular proceeding is unreliable.\"  Ibid.  In other words, the focus on reliability is consistent throughout the Strickland opinion.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To show that a counsel's error rendered a legal proceeding unreliable, a defendant ordinarily must demonstrate \"a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"  Id., at 694.  In a challenge to a conviction, such as the one in this case, this means that the defendant must show \"a reasonable probability that, absent the errors, the factfinder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.\"  Id., at 695.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has relieved defendants of the obligation to make this affirmative showing in only a very narrow set of cases in which the accused has effectively been denied counsel altogether: These include the actual or constructive denial of counsel, state interference with counsel's assistance, or counsel that labors under actual conflicts of interest.  Id., at 692; Cronic, 466 U.\u00a0S., at 658-660.  Prejudice can be presumed with respect to these errors because they are \"so likely to prejudice the accused that the cost of litigating their effect in a particular case is unjustified.\"  Id., at 658; see Strickland, supra, at 692; Mickens v. Taylor, 535 U.\u00a0S. 162, 175 (2002).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In short, there are two ways of meeting the Strickland prejudice requirement.  A defendant must demonstrate either that the error at issue was prejudicial or that it belongs to the narrow class of attorney errors that are tantamount to a denial of counsel, for which an individualized showing of prejudice is unnecessary.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Weaver attempts to escape this framework by stressing that the deprivation of the right to a public trial has been described as a \"structural\" error, but this is irrelevant under Strickland.  The concept of \"structural error\" comes into play when it is established that an error occurred at the trial level and it must be decided whether the error was harmless.  See Neder v. United States, 527 U.\u00a0S. 1, 7 (1999); Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.\u00a0S. 279, 309-310 (1991).  The prejudice prong of Strickland is entirely different.  It does not ask whether an error was harmless but whether there was an error at all, for unless counsel's deficient performance prejudiced the defense, there was no Sixth Amendment violation in the first place.  See Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 150 (even where an attorney's deficient performance \"pervades the entire trial,\" \"we do not allow reversal of a conviction for that reason without a showing of prejudice\" because \"the requirement of showing prejudice in ineffectiveness claims stems from the very definition of the right at issue\").  Weaver's theory conflicts with Strickland because it implies that an attorney's error can be prejudicial even if it \"had no effect,\" or only \"some conceivable effect,\" on the outcome of his trial.  Strickland, supra, at 691, 693.  That is precisely what Strickland rules out.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To sum up, in order to obtain relief under Strickland, Weaver must show that the result of his trial was unreli-able.  He could do so by demonstrating a reasonable likelihood that his counsel's error affected the verdict.  Alternatively, he could establish that the error falls within the very short list of errors for which prejudice is presumed.  Weaver has not attempted to make either argument, so his claim must be rejected.  I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts on that ground.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNo. 16-240\nKENTEL MYRONE WEAVER, PETITIONER v. MASSACHUSETTS\non writ of certiorari to the supreme judicial court of massachusetts\n[June 22, 2017]\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Breyer, with whom Justice Kagan joins, dissenting.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court notes that Strickland's \"prejudice inquiry is not meant to be applied in a 'mechanical' fashion,\" ante, at 11 (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.\u00a0S. 668, 696 (1984)), and I agree.  But, in my view, it follows from this principle that a defendant who shows that his attorney's constitutionally deficient performance produced a structural error should not face the additional--and often insurmountable--Strickland hurdle of demonstrating that the error changed the outcome of his proceeding.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In its harmless-error cases, this Court has \"divided constitutional errors into two classes\": trial errors and structural errors.  United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, 548 U.\u00a0S. 140, 148 (2006).  Trial errors are discrete mistakes that \"occu[r] during the presentation of the case to the jury.\"  Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U.\u00a0S. 279, 307 (1991).  Structural errors, on the other hand, \"affec[t] the framework within which the trial proceeds.\"  Id., at 310.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court has recognized that structural errors' distinctive attributes make them \"defy analysis by 'harmless-error' standards.\"  Id., at 309.  It has therefore categorically exempted structural errors from the case-by-case harmlessness review to which trial errors are subjected.  Our precedent does not try to parse which structural errors are the truly egregious ones.  It simply views all structural errors as \"intrinsically harmful\" and holds that any structural error warrants \"automatic reversal\" on direct appeal \"without regard to [its] effect on the outcome\" of a trial.  Neder v. United States, 527 U.\u00a0S. 1, 7 (1999).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority here does not take this approach.  It assumes that some structural errors--those that \"lead to fundamental unfairness\"--but not others, can warrant relief without a showing of actual prejudice under Strickland.  Ante, at 7, 11-12.  While I agree that a showing of fundamental unfairness is sufficient to satisfy Strickland, I would not try to draw this distinction.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if some structural errors do not create fundamental unfairness, all structural errors nonetheless have features that make them \"defy analysis by 'harmless-error' standards.\"  Fulminante, supra, at 309.  This is why all structural errors--not just the \"fundamental unfairness\" ones--are exempt from harmlessness inquiry and warrant automatic reversal on direct review.  Those same features mean that all structural errors defy an actual-prejudice analysis under Strickland.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For instance, the majority concludes that some errors--such as the public-trial error at issue in this case--have been labeled \"structural\" because they have effects that \"are simply too hard to measure.\"  Ante, at 6; see, e.g., Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.\u00a0S. 275, 281-282 (1993) (explaining that structural errors have \"consequences that are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate\").  But how could any error whose effects are inherently indeterminate prove susceptible to actual-prejudice analysis under Strickland?  Just as the \"difficulty of assessing the effect\" of such an error would turn harmless-error analysis into \"a speculative inquiry into what might have occurred in an alternate universe,\" Gonzalez-Lopez, supra, at 149, n.\u00a04, 150, so too would it undermine a defendant's ability to make an actual-prejudice showing to establish an  ineffective-assistance claim.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The problem is evident with regard to public-trial violations.  This Court has recognized that \"the benefits of a public trial are frequently intangible, difficult to prove, or a matter of chance.\"  Waller v. Georgia, 467 U.\u00a0S. 39, 49, n.\u00a09 (1984).  As a result, \"a requirement that prejudice be shown 'would in most cases deprive [the defendant] of the [public-trial] guarantee, for it would be difficult to envisage a case in which he would have evidence available of specific injury.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting United States ex\u00a0rel. Bennett v. Rundle, 419 F.\u00a02d 599, 608 (CA3 1969) (en banc)) (alteration in original).  In order to establish actual prejudice from an attorney's failure to object to a public-trial violation, a defendant would face the nearly impossible burden of establishing how his trial might have gone differently had it been open to the public.  See ibid. (\"\u00a0'[D]emonstration of prejudice in this kind of case is a practical impossibility .\u00a0.\u00a0.'\u00a0\" (quoting State v. Sheppard, 182 Conn. 412, 418, 438 A.\u00a02d 125, 128 (1980))).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I do not see how we can read Strickland as requiring defendants to prove what this Court has held cannot be proved.  If courts do not presume prejudice when counsel's deficient performance leads to a structural error, then defendants may well be unable to obtain relief for incompetence that deprived them \"of basic protections without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence.\"  Neder, supra, at 8-9 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This would be precisely the sort of \"mechanical\" application that Strickland tells us to avoid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, we should not require defendants to take on a task that is normally impossible to perform.  Nor would I give lower courts the unenviably complex job of deciphering which structural errors really undermine fundamental fairness and which do not--that game is not worth the candle.  I would simply say that just as structural errors are categorically insusceptible to harmless-error analysis on direct review, so too are they categorically insusceptible to actual-prejudice analysis in Strickland claims.  A showing that an attorney's constitutionally deficient performance produced a structural error should consequently be enough to entitle a defendant to relief.  I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n","84":"\n\nUnited States Supreme Court\nZIGLAR v. ABBASI ET AL.(2017)\nNo. 15-1358\nArgued: January 18, 2017Decided: June 19, 2017\n\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, the Federal Government ordered hundreds of illegal aliens to be taken into custody and held pending a determination whether a particular detainee had connections to terrorism.  Respondents, six men of Arab or South Asian descent, were detained for periods of three to six months in a federal facility in Brooklyn.  After their release, they were removed from the United States.  They then filed this putative class action against petitioners, two groups of federal officials.  The first group consisted of former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Robert Mueller, and former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner James Ziglar (Executive Officials).  The second group consisted of the facility's warden and assistant warden Dennis Hasty and James Sherman (Wardens).  Respondents sought damages for constitutional violations under the implied cause of action theory adopted in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388, alleging that petitioners detained them in harsh pretrial conditions for a punitive purpose, in violation of the Fifth Amendment; that petitioners did so because of their actual or apparent race, religion, or national origin, in violation of the Fifth Amendment; that the Wardens subjected them to punitive strip searches, in violation of the Fourth and Fifth Amendments; and that the Wardens knowingly allowed the guards to abuse them, in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  Respondents also brought a claim under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71985(3), which forbids certain conspiracies to violate equal protection rights.  The District Court dismissed the claims against the Executive Officials but allowed the claims against the Wardens to go forward.  The Second Circuit affirmed in most respects as to the Wardens but reversed as to the Executive Officials, reinstating respondents' claims.  \nHeld:\u00a0The judgment is reversed in part and vacated and remanded in part.\n789 F.\u00a03d 218, reversed in part and vacated and remanded in part.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Kennedy delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Part IV-B, concluding:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.\u00a0The limited reach of the Bivens action informs the decision whether an implied damages remedy should be recognized here.  Pp.\u00a06-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0In 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983, Congress provided a specific damages remedy for plaintiffs whose constitutional rights were violated by state officials, but Congress provided no corresponding remedy for constitutional violations by agents of the Federal Government.  In 1971, and against this background, this Court recognized in Bivens an implied damages action to compensate persons injured by federal officers who violated the Fourth Amendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizures.  In the following decade, the Court allowed Bivens-type remedies twice more, in a Fifth Amendment gender-discrimination case, Davis v. Passman, 442 U.\u00a0S. 228, and in an Eighth Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause case, Carlson v. Green, 446 U.\u00a0S. 14.  These are the only cases in which the Court has approved of an implied damages remedy under the Constitution itself.  Pp.\u00a06-7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Bivens, Davis, and Carlson were decided at a time when the prevailing law assumed that a proper judicial function was to \"provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective\" a statute's purpose.  J.\u00a0I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.\u00a0S. 426, 433.  The Court has since adopted a far more cautious course, clarifying that, when deciding whether to recognize an implied cause of action, the \"determinative\" question is one of statutory intent.  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.\u00a0S. 275, 286.  If a statute does not evince Congress' intent \"to create the private right of action asserted,\" Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.\u00a0S. 560, 568, no such action will be created through judicial mandate.  Similar caution must be exercised with respect to damages actions implied to enforce the Constitution itself.  Bivens is well-settled law in its own context, but expanding the Bivens remedy is now considered a \"disfavored\" judicial activity.  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S. 662, 675.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a party seeks to assert an implied cause of action under the Constitution, separation-of-powers principles should be central to the analysis.  The question is whether Congress or the courts should decide to authorize a damages suit.  Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.\u00a0S. 367, 380.  Most often it will be Congress, for Bivens will not be extended to a new context if there are \"\u00a0'special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.'\u00a0\"  Carlson, supra, at 18.  If there are sound reasons to think Congress might doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages remedy as part of the system for enforcing the law and correcting a wrong, courts must refrain from creating that kind of remedy.  An alternative remedial structure may also limit the Judiciary's power to infer a new Bivens cause of action.  Pp.\u00a08-14.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02.\u00a0Considering the relevant special factors here, a Bivens-type remedy should not be extended to the claims challenging the confinement conditions imposed on respondents pursuant to the formal policy adopted by the Executive Officials in the wake of the September 11 attacks.  These \"detention policy claims\" include the allegations that petitioners violated respondents' due process and equal protection rights by holding them in restrictive conditions of confinement, and the allegations that the Wardens violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by subjecting respondents to frequent strip searches.  The detention policy claims do not include the guard-abuse claim against Warden Hasty.  Pp.\u00a014-23. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0The proper test for determining whether a claim arises in a new Bivens context is as follows.  If the case is different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases decided by this Court, then the context is new.  Meaningful differences may include, e.g., the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at issue; the extent of judicial guidance for the official conduct; the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; or the presence of potential special factors not considered in previous Bivens cases.  Respondents' detention policy claims bear little resemblance to the three Bivens claims the Court has approved in previous cases.  The Second Circuit thus should have held that this was a new Bivens context and then performed a special factors analysis before allowing this damages suit to proceed.  Pp.\u00a015-17.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0The special factors here indicate that Congress, not the courts, should decide whether a damages action should be allowed.  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With regard to the Executive Officials, a Bivens action is not \"a proper vehicle for altering an entity's policy,\" Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S. 61, 74, and is not designed to hold officers responsible for acts of their subordinates, see Iqbal, supra, at 676.  Even an action confined to the Executive Officers' own discrete conduct would call into question the formulation and implementation of a high-level executive policy, and the burdens of that litigation could prevent officials from properly discharging their duties, see Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U.\u00a0S. 367, 382.  The litigation process might also implicate the discussion and deliberations that led to the formation of the particular policy, requiring courts to interfere with sensitive Executive Branch functions.  See Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.\u00a0S. 681, 701.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other special factors counsel against extending Bivens to cover the detention policy claims against any of the petitioners.  Because those claims challenge major elements of the Government's response to the September 11 attacks, they necessarily require an inquiry into national-security issues.  National-security policy, however, is the prerogative of Congress and the President, and courts are \"reluctant to intrude upon\" that authority absent congressional authorization.  Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.\u00a0S. 518, 530.  Thus, Congress' failure to provide a damages remedy might be more than mere oversight, and its silence might be more than \"inadvertent.\"  Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.\u00a0S. 412, 423.  That silence is also relevant and telling here, where Congress has had nearly 16 years to extend \"the kind of remedies [sought by] respondents,\" id., at 426, but has not done so.  Respondents also may have had available \"\u00a0'other alternative forms of judicial relief,'\u00a0\" Minneci v. Pollard, 565 U.\u00a0S. 118, 124, including injunctions and habeas petitions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proper balance in situations like this, between deterring constitutional violations and freeing high officials to make the lawful decisions necessary to protect the Nation in times of great peril, is one for the Congress to undertake, not the Judiciary.  The Second Circuit thus erred in allowing respondents' detention policy claims to proceed under Bivens.  Pp.\u00a017-23.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03.\u00a0The Second Circuit also erred in allowing the prisoner abuse claim against Warden Hasty to go forward without conducting the required special factors analysis.  Respondents' prisoner abuse allegations against Warden Hasty state a plausible ground to find a constitutional violation should a Bivens remedy be implied.  But the first question is whether the claim arises in a new Bivens context.  This claim has significant parallels to Carlson, which extended Bivens to cover a failure to provide medical care to a prisoner, but this claim nevertheless seeks to extend Carlson to a new context.  The constitutional right is different here: Carlson was predicated on the Eighth Amendment while this claim was predicated on the Fifth.  The judicial guidance available to this warden with respect to his supervisory duties was less developed.  There might have been alternative remedies available.  And Congress did not provide a standalone damages remedy against federal jailers when it enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act some 15 years after Carlson.  Given this Court's expressed caution about extending the Bivens remedy, this context must be regarded as a new one.  Pp.\u00a023-26.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.\u00a0Petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to respondents' claims under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71985(3).  Pp.\u00a026-32.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(a)\u00a0Assuming that respondents' allegations are true and well pleaded, the question is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners' position would have known the alleged conduct was an unlawful conspiracy.  The qualified-immunity inquiry turns on the \"objective legal reasonableness\" of the official's acts, Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.\u00a0S. 800, 819, \"assessed in light of the legal rules that were 'clearly established' at the time [the action] was taken,\" Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.\u00a0S. 635, 639.  If it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that the alleged conduct \"was unlawful in the situation he confronted,\" Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.\u00a0S. 194, 202, the defendant officer is not entitled to qualified immunity.  But if a reasonable officer might not have known that the conduct was unlawful, then the officer is entitled to qualified immunity.  Pp.\u00a027-29.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(b)\u00a0Here, reasonable officials in petitioners' positions would not have known with sufficient certainty that \u00a71985(3) prohibited their joint consultations and the resulting policies.  There are two reasons.    First, the conspiracy is alleged to have been among officers in the same Department of the Federal Government.  And there is no clearly established law on the issue whether agents of the same executive department are distinct enough to \"conspire\" with one another within the meaning of 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71985(3).  Second, open discussion among federal officers should be encouraged to help those officials reach consensus on department policies, so there is a reasonable argument that \u00a71985(3) liability should not extend to cases like this one.  As these considerations indicate, the question whether federal officials can be said to \"conspire\" in these kinds of situations is sufficiently open that the officials in this suit would not have known that \u00a71985(3) applied to their discussions and actions.  It follows that reasonable officers in petitioners' positions would not have known with any certainty that the alleged agreements were forbidden by that statute.

Pending a determination whether a particular detainee had connections to terrorism, the custody, under harsh conditions to be described, continued.  In many instances custody lasted for days and weeks, then stretching into months.  Later, some of the aliens who had been detained filed suit, leading to the cases now before the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complaint named as defendants three high executive officers in the Department of Justice and two of the wardens at the facility where the detainees had been held.  Most of the claims, alleging various constitutional violations, sought damages under the implied cause of action theory adopted by this Court in Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971).  Another claim in the complaint was based upon the statutory cause of action authorized and created by Congress under Rev. Stat. \u00a71980, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71985(3).  This statutory cause of action allows damages to persons injured by conspiracies to deprive them of the equal protection of the laws.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The suit was commenced in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  After this Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S. 662 (2009), a fourth amended complaint was filed; and that is the complaint to be considered here.  Motions to dismiss the fourth amended complaint were denied as to some defendants and granted as to others.  These rulings were the subject of interlocutory appeals to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  Over a dissenting opinion by Judge Raggi with respect to the decision of the three-judge panel--and a second unsigned dissent from the court's declining to rehear the suit en banc, joined by Judge Raggi and five other judges--the Court of Appeals ruled that the complaint was sufficient for the action to proceed against the named officials who are now before us.  See Turkmen v. Hasty, 789 F.\u00a03d 218 (2015) (panel decision); Turkmen v. Hasty, 808 F.\u00a03d 197 (2015) (en banc decision).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court granted certiorari to consider these rulings.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).  The officials who must defend the suit on the merits, under the ruling of the Court of Appeals, are the petitioners here.  The former detainees who seek relief under the fourth amended complaint are the respondents.  The various claims and theories advanced for recovery, and the grounds asserted for their dismissal as insufficient as a matter of law, will be addressed in turn.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the present procedural posture of the suit, the Court accepts as true the facts alleged in the complaint. See Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 678.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the weeks following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks--the worst in American history--the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) received more than 96,000 tips from members of the public.  See id., at 667.  Some tips were based on well-grounded suspicion of terrorist activity, but many others may have been based on fear of Arabs and Muslims.  FBI agents \"questioned more than 1,000 people with suspected links to the [September 11] attacks in particular or to terrorism in general.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0While investigating the tips--including the less substantiated ones--the FBI encountered many aliens who were present in this country without legal authorization.  As a result, more than 700 individuals were arrested and detained on immigration charges.  Ibid.  If the FBI designated an alien as not being \"of interest\" to the investigation, then he or she was processed according to normal procedures.  In other words the alien was treated just as if, for example, he or she had been arrested at the border after an illegal entry.  If, however, the FBI designated an alien as \"of interest\" to the investigation, or if it had doubts about the proper designation in a particular case, the alien was detained subject to a \"hold-until-cleared policy.\"  The aliens were held without bail.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents were among some 84 aliens who were subject to the hold-until-cleared policy and detained at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York.  They were held in the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit (or Unit) of the MDC.  The complaint includes these allegations: Conditions in the Unit were harsh.  Pursuant to official Bureau of Prisons policy, detainees were held in \"\u00a0'tiny cells for over 23 hours a day.'\u00a0\"  789 F.\u00a03d, at 228.  Lights in the cells were left on 24 hours.  Detainees had little opportunity for exercise or recreation.  They were forbidden to keep anything in their cells, even basic hygiene products such as soap or a toothbrush.  When removed from the cells for any reason, they were shackled and escorted by four guards.  They were denied access to most forms of communication with the outside world.  And they were strip searched often--any time they were moved, as well as at random in their cells.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some of the harsh conditions in the Unit were not imposed pursuant to official policy.  According to the complaint, prison guards engaged in a pattern of \"physical and verbal abuse.\"  Ibid.  Guards allegedly slammed detainees into walls; twisted their arms, wrists, and fingers; broke their bones; referred to them as terrorists; threatened them with violence; subjected them to humiliating sexual comments; and insulted their religion.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents are six men of Arab or South Asian descent.  Five are Muslims.  Each was illegally in this country, arrested during the course of the September 11 investigation, and detained in the Administrative Maximum Special Housing Unit for periods ranging from three to eight months.  After being released respondents were removed from the United States.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents then sued on their own behalf, and on behalf of a putative class, seeking compensatory and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs.  Respondents, it seems fair to conclude from the arguments presented, acknowledge that in the ordinary course aliens who are present in the United States without legal authorization can be detained for some period of time.  But here the challenge is to the conditions of their confinement and the reasons or motives for imposing those conditions.  The gravamen of their claims was that the Government had no reason to suspect them of any connection to terrorism, and thus had no legitimate reason to hold them for so long in these harsh conditions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As relevant here, respondents sued two groups of federal officials in their official capacities.  The first group consisted of former Attorney General John Ashcroft, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, and former Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner James Ziglar.  This opinion refers to these three petitioners as the \"Executive Officials.\"  The other petitioners named in the complaint were the MDC's warden, Dennis Hasty, and associate warden, James Sherman.  This opinion refers to these two petitioners as the \"Wardens.\"\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Seeking to invoke the Court's decision in Bivens, respondents brought four claims under the Constitution itself.  First, respondents alleged that petitioners detained them in harsh pretrial conditions for a punitive purpose, in violation of the substantive due process component of the Fifth Amendment.  Second, respondents alleged that petitioners detained them in harsh conditions because of their actual or apparent race, religion, or national origin, in violation of the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.  Third, respondents alleged that the Wardens subjected them to punitive strip searches unrelated to any legitimate penological interest, in violation of the Fourth Amendment and the substantive due process component of the Fifth Amendment.  Fourth, respondents alleged that the Wardens knowingly allowed the guards to abuse respondents, in violation of the substantive due process component of the Fifth Amendment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Respondents also brought a claim under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71985(3), which forbids certain conspiracies to violate equal protection rights.  Respondents alleged that petitioners conspired with one another to hold respondents in harsh conditions because of their actual or apparent race, religion, or national origin.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The District Court dismissed the claims against the Executive Officials but allowed the claims against the Wardens to go forward.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in most respects as to the Wardens, though it held that the prisoner abuse claim against Sherman (the associate warden) should have been dismissed.  789 F.\u00a03d, at 264-265.  As to the Executive Officials, however, the Court of Appeals reversed, reinstating respondents' claims.  Ibid.  As noted above, Judge Raggi dissented.  She would have held that only the prisoner abuse claim against Hasty should go forward.  Id., at 295, n. 41, 302 (opinion concurring in part in judgment and dissenting in part).  The Court of Appeals declined to rehear the suit en banc, 808 F.\u00a03d, at 197; and, again as noted above, Judge Raggi joined a second dissent along with five other judges, id., at 198.  This Court granted certiorari.  580 U.\u00a0S. ___ (2016).\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first question to be discussed is whether petitioners can be sued for damages under Bivens and the ensuing cases in this Court defining the reach and the limits of that precedent.  \nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1871, Congress passed a statute that was later codified at Rev. Stat. \u00a71979, 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983.  It entitles an injured person to money damages if a state official violates his or her constitutional rights.  Congress did not create an analogous statute for federal officials.  Indeed, in the 100 years leading up to Bivens, Congress did not provide a specific damages remedy for plaintiffs whose constitutional rights were violated by agents of the Federal Government.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In 1971, and against this background, this Court decided Bivens.  The Court held that, even absent statutory authorization, it would enforce a damages remedy to compensate persons injured by federal officers who violated the prohibition against unreasonable search and seizures.  See 403 U.\u00a0S., at 397.  The Court acknowledged that the Fourth Amendment does not provide for money damages \"in so many words.\"  Id., at 396.  The Court noted, however, that Congress had not foreclosed a damages remedy in \"explicit\" terms and that no \"special factors\" suggested that the Judiciary should \"hesitat[e]\" in the face of congressional silence.  Id., at 396-397.  The Court, accordingly, held that it could authorize a remedy under general principles of federal jurisdiction.  See id., at 392 (citing Bell v. Hood, 327 U.\u00a0S. 678, 684 (1946)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the decade that followed, the Court recognized what has come to be called an implied cause of action in two cases involving other constitutional violations.  In Davis v. Passman, 442 U.\u00a0S. 228 (1979), an administrative assistant sued a Congressman for firing her because she was a woman.  The Court held that the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause gave her a damages remedy for gender discrimination.  Id., at 248-249.  And in Carlson v. Green, 446 U.\u00a0S. 14 (1980), a prisoner's estate sued federal jailers for failing to treat the prisoner's asthma.  The Court held that the Eighth Amendment Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause gave him a damages remedy for failure to provide adequate medical treatment.  See id., at 19.  These three cases--Bivens, Davis, and Carlson--represent the only instances in which the Court has approved of an implied damages remedy under the Constitution itself.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To understand Bivens and the two other cases implying a damages remedy under the Constitution, it is necessary to understand the prevailing law when they were decided.  In the mid-20th century, the Court followed a different approach to recognizing implied causes of action than it follows now.  During this \"ancien regime,\" Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.\u00a0S. 275, 287 (2001), the Court assumed it to be a proper judicial function to \"provide such remedies as are necessary to make effective\" a statute's purpose, J.\u00a0I. Case Co. v. Borak, 377 U.\u00a0S. 426, 433 (1964).  Thus, as a routine matter with respect to statutes, the Court would imply causes of action not explicit in the statutory text itself.  See, e.g., id., at 430-432; Allen v. State Bd. of Elections, 393 U.\u00a0S. 544, 557 (1969); Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, Inc., 396 U.\u00a0S. 229, 239 (1969) (\"The existence of a statutory right implies the existence of all necessary and appropriate remedies\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These statutory decisions were in place when Bivens recognized an implied cause of action to remedy a constitutional violation.  Against that background, the Bivens decision held that courts must \"adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief\" when \"federally protected rights have been invaded.\"  403 U.\u00a0S., at 392 (quoting Bell, supra, at 678); see also 403 U.\u00a0S., at 402 (Harlan, J., concurring) (discussing cases recognizing implied causes of action under federal statutes).  In light of this interpretive framework, there was a possibility that \"the Court would keep expanding Bivens until it became the substantial equivalent of 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983.\"  Kent, Are Damages Different?: Bivens and National Security, 87 S.\u00a0Cal. L.\u00a0Rev. 1123, 1139-1140 (2014).\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Later, the arguments for recognizing implied causes of action for damages began to lose their force.  In cases decided after Bivens, and after the statutory implied cause-of-action cases that Bivens itself relied upon, the Court adopted a far more cautious course before finding implied causes of action.  In two principal cases under other statutes, it declined to find an implied cause of action.  See Piper v. Chris-Craft Industries, Inc., 430 U.\u00a0S. 1, 42, 45-46 (1977); Cort v. Ash, 422 U.\u00a0S. 66, 68-69 (1975).  Later, in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.\u00a0S. 677 (1979), the Court did allow an implied cause of action; but it cautioned that, where Congress \"intends private litigants to have a cause of action,\" the \"far better course\" is for Congress to confer that remedy in explicit terms.  Id., at 717.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Following this expressed caution, the Court clarified in a series of cases that, when deciding whether to recognize an implied cause of action, the \"determinative\" question is one of statutory intent.  Sandoval, 532 U.\u00a0S., at 286.  If the statute itself does not \"displa[y] an intent\" to create \"a private remedy,\" then \"a cause of action does not exist and courts may not create one, no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how compatible with the statute.\"  Id., at 286-287; see also Transamerica Mortgage Advisors, Inc. v. Lewis, 444 U.\u00a0S. 11, 15-16, 23-24 (1979); Karahalios v. Federal Employees, 489 U.\u00a0S. 527, 536-537 (1989).  The Court held that the judicial task was instead \"limited solely to determining whether Congress intended to create the private right of action asserted.\"  Touche Ross & Co. v. Redington, 442 U.\u00a0S. 560, 568 (1979).  If the statute does not itself so provide, a private cause of action will not be created through judicial mandate.  See Transamerica, supra, at 24.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The decision to recognize an implied cause of action under a statute involves somewhat different considerations than when the question is whether to recognize an implied cause of action to enforce a provision of the Constitution itself.  When Congress enacts a statute, there are specific procedures and times for considering its terms and the proper means for its enforcement.  It is logical, then, to assume that Congress will be explicit if it intends to create a private cause of action.  With respect to the Constitution, however, there is no single, specific congressional action to consider and interpret.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even so, it is a significant step under separation-of-powers principles for a court to determine that it has the authority, under the judicial power, to create and enforce a cause of action for damages against federal officials in order to remedy a constitutional violation.  When determining whether traditional equitable powers suffice to give necessary constitutional protection--or whether, in addition, a damages remedy is necessary--there are a number of economic and governmental concerns to consider.  Claims against federal officials often create substantial costs, in the form of defense and indemnification.  Congress, then, has a substantial responsibility to determine whether, and the extent to which, monetary and other liabilities should be imposed upon individual officers and employees of the Federal Government.  In addition, the time and administrative costs attendant upon intrusions resulting from the discovery and trial process are significant factors to be considered.  In an analogous context, Congress, it is fair to assume, weighed those concerns in deciding not to substitute the Government as defendant in suits seeking damages for constitutional violations.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72679(b)(2)(A) (providing that certain provisions of the Federal Tort Claims Act do not apply to any claim against a federal employee \"which is brought for a violation of the Constitution\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these and other reasons, the Court's expressed caution as to implied causes of actions under congressional statutes led to similar caution with respect to actions in the Bivens context, where the action is implied to enforce the Constitution itself.  Indeed, in light of the changes to the Court's general approach to recognizing implied damages remedies, it is possible that the analysis in the Court's three Bivens cases might have been different if they were decided today.  To be sure, no congressional enactment has disapproved of these decisions.  And it must be understood that this opinion is not intended to cast doubt on the continued force, or even the necessity, of Bivens in the search-and-seizure context in which it arose.  Bivens does vindicate the Constitution by allowing some redress for injuries, and it provides instruction and guidance to federal law enforcement officers going forward.  The settled law of Bivens in this common and recurrent sphere of law enforcement, and the undoubted reliance upon it as a fixed principle in the law, are powerful reasons to retain it in that sphere.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given the notable change in the Court's approach to recognizing implied causes of action, however, the Court has made clear that expanding the Bivens remedy is now a \"disfavored\" judicial activity.  Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 675.  This is in accord with the Court's observation that it has \"consistently refused to extend Bivens to any new context or new category of defendants.\"  Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S. 61, 68 (2001).  Indeed, the Court has refused to do so for the past 30 years.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For example, the Court declined to create an implied damages remedy in the following cases: a First Amendment suit against a federal employer, Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.\u00a0S. 367, 390 (1983); a race-discrimination suit against military officers, Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.\u00a0S. 296, 297, 304-305 (1983); a substantive due process suit against military officers, United States v. Stanley, 483 U.\u00a0S. 669, 671-672, 683-684 (1987); a procedural due process suit against Social Security officials, Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.\u00a0S. 412, 414 (1988); a procedural due process suit against a federal agency for wrongful termination, FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.\u00a0S. 471, 473-474 (1994); an Eighth Amendment suit against a private prison operator, Malesko, supra, at 63; a due process suit against officials from the Bureau of Land Management, Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.\u00a0S. 537, 547-548, 562 (2007); and an Eighth Amendment suit against prison guards at a private prison, Minneci v. Pollard, 565 U.\u00a0S. 118, 120 (2012).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0When a party seeks to assert an implied cause of action under the Constitution itself, just as when a party seeks to assert an implied cause of action under a federal statute, separation-of-powers principles are or should be central to the analysis.  The question is \"who should decide\" whether to provide for a damages remedy, Congress or the courts?  Bush, 462 U.\u00a0S., at 380.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The answer most often will be Congress.  When an issue \"\u00a0'involves a host of considerations that must be weighed and appraised,'\u00a0\" it should be committed to \"\u00a0'those who write the laws'\u00a0\" rather than \"\u00a0'those who interpret them.'\u00a0\"  Ibid. (quoting United States v. Gilman, 347 U.\u00a0S. 507, 512-513 (1954)).  In most instances, the Court's precedents now instruct, the Legislature is in the better position to consider if \"\u00a0'the public interest would be served'\u00a0\" by imposing a \"\u00a0'new substantive legal liability.'\u00a0\"  Schweiker, supra, at 426-427 (quoting Bush, supra, at 390).  As a result, the Court has urged \"caution\" before \"extending Bivens remedies into any new context.\"  Malesko, supra, at 74.  The Court's precedents now make clear that a Bivens remedy will not be available if there are \"\u00a0'special factors counselling hesitation in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.'\u00a0\"  Carlson, 446 U.\u00a0S., at 18 (quoting Bivens, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 396).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This Court has not defined the phrase \"special factors counselling hesitation.\"  The necessary inference, though, is that the inquiry must concentrate on whether the Judiciary is well suited, absent congressional action or instruction, to consider and weigh the costs and benefits of allowing a damages action to proceed.  Thus, to be a \"special factor counselling hesitation,\" a factor must cause a court to hesitate before answering that question in the affirmative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not necessarily a judicial function to establish whole categories of cases in which federal officers must defend against personal liability claims in the complex sphere of litigation, with all of its burdens on some and benefits to others.  It is true that, if equitable remedies prove insufficient, a damages remedy might be necessary to redress past harm and deter future violations.  Yet the decision to recognize a damages remedy requires an assessment of its impact on governmental operations systemwide.  Those matters include the burdens on Government employees who are sued personally, as well as the projected costs and consequences to the Government itself when the tort and monetary liability mechanisms of the legal system are used to bring about the proper formulation and implementation of public policies.  These and other considerations may make it less probable that Congress would want the Judiciary to entertain a damages suit in a given case.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes there will be doubt because the case arises in a context in which Congress has designed its regulatory authority in a guarded way, making it less likely that Congress would want the Judiciary to interfere.  See Chappell, supra, at 302 (military); Stanley, supra, at 679 (same); Meyer, supra, at 486 (public purse); Wilkie, supra, at 561-562 (federal land).  And sometimes there will be doubt because some other feature of a case--difficult to predict in advance--causes a court to pause before acting without express congressional authorization.  In sum, if there are sound reasons to think Congress might doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages remedy as part of the system for enforcing the law and correcting a wrong, the courts must refrain from creating the remedy in order to respect the role of Congress in determining the nature and extent of federal-court jurisdiction under Article III.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In a related way, if there is an alternative remedial structure present in a certain case, that alone may limit the power of the Judiciary to infer a new Bivens cause of action.  For if Congress has created \"any alternative, existing process for protecting the [injured party's] interest\" that itself may \"amoun[t] to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.\"  Wilkie, supra, at 550; see also Bush, supra, at 385-388 (recognizing that civil-service regulations provided alternative means for relief); Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 73-74 (recognizing that state tort law provided alternative means for relief); Minneci, supra, at 127-130 (same).  \nIII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is appropriate now to turn first to the Bivens claims challenging the conditions of confinement imposed on respondents pursuant to the formal policy adopted by the Executive Officials in the wake of the September 11 attacks.  The Court will refer to these claims as the \"detention policy claims.\"  The detention policy claims allege that petitioners violated respondents' due process and equal protection rights by holding them in restrictive conditions of confinement; the claims further allege that the Wardens violated the Fourth and Fifth Amendments by subjecting respondents to frequent strip searches.  The term \"detention policy claims\" does not include respondents' claim alleging that Warden Hasty allowed guards to abuse the detainees.  That claim will be considered separately, and further, below.  At this point, the question is whether, having considered the relevant special factors in the whole context of the detention policy claims, the Court should extend a Bivens-type remedy to those claims.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Before allowing respondents' detention policy claims to proceed under Bivens, the Court of Appeals did not perform any special factors analysis at all.  789 F.\u00a03d, at 237.  The reason, it said, was that the special factors analysis is necessary only if a plaintiff asks for a Bivens remedy in a new context.  789 F.\u00a03d, at 234.  And in the Court of Appeals' view, the context here was not new.  Id., at 235.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0To determine whether the Bivens context was novel, the Court of Appeals employed a two-part test.  First, it asked whether the asserted constitutional right was at issue in a previous Bivens case.  789 F.\u00a03d, at 234. Second, it asked whether the mechanism of injury was the same mechanism of injury in a previous Bivens case.  789 F.\u00a03d, at 234.  Under the Court of Appeals' approach, if the answer to both questions is \"yes,\" then the context is not new and no special factors analysis is required.  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That approach is inconsistent with the analysis in Malesko.  Before the Court decided that case, it had approved a Bivens action under the Eighth Amendment against federal prison officials for failure to provide medical treatment.  See Carlson, 446 U.\u00a0S., at 16, n. 1, 18-19.  In Malesko, the plaintiff sought relief against a private prison operator in almost parallel circumstances.  534 U.\u00a0S., at 64.  In both cases, the right at issue was the same: the Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  And in both cases, the mechanism of injury was the same: failure to provide adequate medical treatment.  Thus, if the approach followed by the Court of Appeals is the correct one, this Court should have held that the cases arose in the same context, obviating any need for a special factors inquiry.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0That, however, was not the controlling analytic framework in Malesko.  Even though the right and the mechanism of injury were the same as they were in Carlson, the Court held that the contexts were different.  534 U.\u00a0S., at 70, and n.\u00a04.  The Court explained that special factors counseled hesitation and that the Bivens remedy was therefore unavailable.  534 U.\u00a0S., at 74.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For similar reasons, the holding of the Court of Appeals in the instant suit is inconsistent with this Court's analytic framework in Chappell.  In Davis, decided before the Court's cautionary instructions with respect to Bivens suits, see supra, at 11-12, the Court had held that an employment-discrimination claim against a Congressman could proceed as a Bivens-type action.  Davis, 442 U.\u00a0S., at 230-231.  In Chappell, however, the cautionary rules were applicable; and, as a result, a similar discrimination suit against military officers was not allowed to proceed.  It is the Chappell framework that now controls; and, under it, the Court of Appeals erred by holding that this suit did not present a new Bivens context.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The proper test for determining whether a case presents a new Bivens context is as follows.  If the case is different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases decided by this Court, then the context is new.  Without endeavoring to create an exhaustive list of differences that are meaningful enough to make a given context a new one, some examples might prove instructive.  A case might differ in a meaningful way because of the rank of the officers involved; the constitutional right at issue; the generality or specificity of the official action; the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating; the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; or the presence of potential special factors that previous Bivens cases did not consider.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In the present suit, respondents' detention policy claims challenge the confinement conditions imposed on illegal aliens pursuant to a high-level executive policy created in the wake of a major terrorist attack on American soil.  Those claims bear little resemblance to the three Bivens claims the Court has approved in the past: a claim against FBI agents for handcuffing a man in his own home without a warrant; a claim against a Congressman for firing his female secretary; and a claim against prison officials for failure to treat an inmate's asthma.  See Bivens, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388; Davis, 442 U.\u00a0S. 228; Chappell, 462 U.\u00a0S. 296.  The Court of Appeals therefore should have held that this was a new Bivens context.  Had it done so, it would have recognized that a special factors analysis was required before allowing this damages suit to proceed.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After considering the special factors necessarily implicated by the detention policy claims, the Court now holds that those factors show that whether a damages action should be allowed is a decision for the Congress to make, not the courts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to the claims against the Executive Officials, it must be noted that a Bivens action is not \"a proper vehicle for altering an entity's policy.\"  Malesko, supra, at 74.  Furthermore, a Bivens claim is brought against the individual official for his or her own acts, not the acts of others.  \"The purpose of Bivens is to deter the officer.\"  Meyer, 510 U.\u00a0S., at 485.  Bivens is not designed to hold officers responsible for acts of their subordinates.  See Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 676 (\"Government officials may not be held liable for the unconstitutional conduct of their subordinates under a theory of respondeat superior\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even if the action is confined to the conduct of a particular Executive Officer in a discrete instance, these claims would call into question the formulation and implementation of a general policy.  This, in turn, would necessarily require inquiry and discovery into the whole course of the discussions and deliberations that led to the policies and governmental acts being challenged.  These consequences counsel against allowing a Bivens action against the Executive Officials, for the burden and demand of litigation might well prevent them--or, to be more precise, future officials like them--from devoting the time and effort required for the proper discharge of their duties.  See Cheney v. United States Dist. Court for D. C., 542 U.\u00a0S. 367, 382 (2004) (noting \"the paramount necessity of protecting the Executive Branch from vexatious litigation that might distract it from the energetic performance of its constitutional duties\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A closely related problem, as just noted, is that the discovery and litigation process would either border upon or directly implicate the discussion and deliberations that led to the formation of the policy in question.  See Federal Open Market Comm. v. Merrill, 443 U.\u00a0S. 340, 360 (1979) (noting that disclosure of Executive Branch documents \"could inhibit the free flow of advice, including analysis, reports, and expression of opinion within an agency\").  Allowing a damages suit in this context, or in a like context in other circumstances, would require courts to interfere in an intrusive way with sensitive functions of the Executive Branch.  See Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.\u00a0S. 681, 701 (1997) (recognizing that \"\u00a0'[e]ven when a branch does not arrogate power to itself .\u00a0.\u00a0. the separation-of-powers doctrine requires that a branch not impair another in the performance of its constitutional duties'\u00a0\" (quoting Loving v. United States, 517 U.\u00a0S. 748, 757 (1996))).  These considerations also counsel against allowing a damages claim to proceed against the Executive Officials.  See Cheney, supra, at 385 (noting that \"special considerations control\" when a case implicates \"the Executive Branch's interests in maintaining the autonomy of its office and safeguarding the confidentiality of its communications\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to this special factor, which applies to the claims against the Executive Officials, there are three other special factors that apply as well to the detention policy claims against all of the petitioners.  First, respondents' detention policy claims challenge more than standard \"law enforcement operations.\"  United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.\u00a0S. 259, 273 (1990).  They challenge as well major elements of the Government's whole response to the September 11 attacks, thus of necessity requiring an inquiry into sensitive issues of national security.  Were this inquiry to be allowed in a private suit for damages, the Bivens action would assume dimensions far greater than those present in Bivens itself, or in either of its two follow-on cases, or indeed in any putative Bivens case yet to come before the Court.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0National-security policy is the prerogative of the Congress and President.  See U.\u00a0S. Const., Art.\u00a0I, \u00a78; Art.\u00a0II, \u00a71, \u00a72.  Judicial inquiry into the national-security realm raises \"concerns for the separation of powers in trenching on matters committed to the other branches.\"  Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.\u00a0S. 403, 417 (2002).  These concerns are even more pronounced when the judicial inquiry comes in the context of a claim seeking money damages rather than a claim seeking injunctive or other equitable relief.  The risk of personal damages liability is more likely to cause an official to second-guess difficult but necessary decisions concerning national-security policy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For these and other reasons, courts have shown deference to what the Executive Branch \"has determined .\u00a0.\u00a0. is 'essential to national security.'\u00a0\"  Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., 555 U.\u00a0S. 7, 24, 26 (2008).  Indeed, \"courts traditionally have been reluctant to intrude upon the authority of the Executive in military and national security affairs\" unless \"Congress specifically has provided otherwise.\"  Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.\u00a0S. 518, 530 (1988).  Congress has not provided otherwise here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There are limitations, of course, on the power of the Executive under Article II of the Constitution and in the powers authorized by congressional enactments, even with respect to matters of national security.  See, e.g., Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.\u00a0S. 507, 527, 532-537 (2004) (plurality opinion) (\"Whatever power the United States Constitution envisions for the Executive . . . in times of conflict, it most assuredly envisions a role for all three branches when individual liberties are at stake\"); Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.\u00a0S. 723, 798 (2008) (\"Liberty and security can be reconciled; and in our system they are reconciled within the framework of the law\").  And national-security concerns must not become a talisman used to ward off inconvenient claims--a \"label\" used to \"cover a multitude of sins.\"  Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.\u00a0S. 511, 523 (1985).  This \"\u00a0'danger of abuse'\u00a0\" is even more heightened given \"\u00a0'the difficulty of defining'\u00a0\" the \"\u00a0'security interest'\u00a0\" in domestic cases.  Ibid. (quoting United States v. United States Dist. Court for Eastern Dist. of Mich., 407 U.\u00a0S. 297, 313-314 (1972)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even so, the question is only whether \"congressionally uninvited intrusion\" is \"inappropriate\" action for the Judiciary to take.  Stanley, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 683.  The factors discussed above all suggest that Congress' failure to provide a damages remedy might be more than mere oversight, and that congressional silence might be more than \"inadvertent.\"  Schweiker, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 423.  This possibility counsels hesitation \"in the absence of affirmative action by Congress.\"  Bivens, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 396.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, in any inquiry respecting the likely or probable intent of Congress, the silence of Congress is relevant; and here that silence is telling.  In the almost 16 years since September 11, the Federal Government's responses to that terrorist attack have been well documented.  Congressional interest has been \"frequent and intense,\" Schweiker, supra, at 425, and some of that interest has been directed to the conditions of confinement at issue here.  Indeed, at Congress' behest, the Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General compiled a 300-page report documenting the conditions in the MDC in great detail.  See 789 F.\u00a03d, at 279 (opinion of Raggi, J.) (noting that the USA PATRIOT Act required \"the Department's Inspector General to review and report semi-annually to Congress on any identified abuses of civil rights and civil liberties in fighting terrorism\").  Nevertheless, \"[a]t no point did Congress choose to extend to any person the kind of remedies that respondents seek in this lawsuit.\"  Schweiker, 487 U.\u00a0S., at 426.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This silence is notable because it is likely that high-level policies will attract the attention of Congress.  Thus, when Congress fails to provide a damages remedy in circumstances like these, it is much more difficult to believe that \"congressional inaction\" was \"inadvertent.\"  Id., at 423.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is of central importance, too, that this is not a case like Bivens or Davis in which \"it is damages or nothing.\"  Bivens, supra, at 410 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment); Davis, 442 U.\u00a0S., at 245.  Unlike the plaintiffs in those cases, respondents do not challenge individual instances of discrimination or law enforcement overreach, which due to their very nature are difficult to address except by way of damages actions after the fact.  Respondents instead challenge large-scale policy decisions concerning the conditions of confinement imposed on hundreds of prisoners.  To address those kinds of decisions, detainees may seek injunctive relief.  And in addition to that, we have left open the question whether they might be able to challenge their confinement conditions via a petition for a writ of habeas corpus.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.\u00a0S. 520, 526, n. 6 (1979) (\"[W]e leave to another day the question of the propriety of using a writ of habeas corpus to obtain review of the conditions of confinement\"); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.\u00a0S. 475, 499 (1973) (\"When a prisoner is put under additional and unconstitutional restraints during his lawful custody, it is arguable that habeas corpus will lie to remove the restraints making custody illegal\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Indeed, the habeas remedy, if necessity required its use, would have provided a faster and more direct route to relief than a suit for money damages.  A successful habeas petition would have required officials to place respondents in less-restrictive conditions immediately; yet this damages suit remains unresolved some 15 years later.  (As in Bell and Preiser, the Court need not determine the scope or availability of the habeas corpus remedy, a question that is not before the Court and has not been briefed or argued.)  In sum, respondents had available to them \"\u00a0'other alternative forms of judicial relief.'\u00a0\"  Minneci, 565 U.\u00a0S., at 124.  And when alternative methods of relief are available, a Bivens remedy usually is not.  See Bush, 462 U.\u00a0S., at 386-388; Schweiker, supra, at 425-426; Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 73-74; Minneci, supra, at 125-126.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There is a persisting concern, of course, that absent a Bivens remedy there will be insufficient deterrence to prevent officers from violating the Constitution.  In circumstances like those presented here, however, the stakes on both sides of the argument are far higher than in past cases the Court has considered.  If Bivens liability were to be imposed, high officers who face personal liability for damages might refrain from taking urgent and lawful action in a time of crisis.  And, as already noted, the costs and difficulties of later litigation might intrude upon and interfere with the proper exercise of their office.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0On the other side of the balance, the very fact that some executive actions have the sweeping potential to affect the liberty of so many is a reason to consider proper means to impose restraint and to provide some redress from injury.  There is therefore a balance to be struck, in situations like this one, between deterring constitutional violations and freeing high officials to make the lawful decisions necessary to protect the Nation in times of great peril.  Cf. Stanley, supra, at 681 (noting that the special-factors analysis in that case turned on \"how much occasional, unintended impairment of military discipline one is willing to tolerate\").  The proper balance is one for the Congress, not the Judiciary, to undertake.  For all of these reasons, the Court of Appeals erred by allowing respondents' detention policy claims to proceed under Bivens.\nIV\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0One of respondents' claims under Bivens requires a different analysis: the prisoner abuse claim against the MDC's warden, Dennis Hasty.  The allegation is that Warden Hasty violated the Fifth Amendment by allowing prison guards to abuse respondents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The warden argues, as an initial matter, that the complaint does not \"\u00a0'state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'\u00a0\" Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 678 (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.\u00a0S. 544, 570 (2007)).  Applying its precedents, the Court of Appeals held that the substantive standard for the sufficiency of the claim is whether the warden showed \"deliberate indifference\" to prisoner abuse.  789 F.\u00a03d, at 249-250.  The parties appear to agree on this standard, and, for purposes of this case, the Court assumes it to be correct.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The complaint alleges that guards routinely abused respondents; that the warden encouraged the abuse by referring to respondents as \"terrorists\"; that he prevented respondents from using normal grievance procedures; that he stayed away from the Unit to avoid seeing the abuse; that he was made aware of the abuse via \"inmate complaints, staff complaints, hunger strikes, and suicide attempts\"; that he ignored other \"direct evidence of [the] abuse, including logs and other official [records]\"; that he took no action \"to rectify or address the situation\"; and that the abuse resulted in the injuries described above, see supra, at 4.  These allegations--assumed here to be true, subject to proof at a later stage--plausibly show the warden's deliberate indifference to the abuse.  Consistent with the opinion of every judge in this case to have considered the question, including the dissenters in the Court of Appeals, the Court concludes that the prisoner abuse allegations against Warden Hasty state a plausible ground to find a constitutional violation if a Bivens remedy is to be implied.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Warden Hasty argues, however, that Bivens ought not to be extended to this instance of alleged prisoner abuse.  As noted above, the first question a court must ask in a case like this one is whether the claim arises in a new Bivens context, i.e., whether \"the case is different in a meaningful way from previous Bivens cases decided by this Court.\"  Supra, at 16.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that this case has significant parallels to one of the Court's previous Bivens cases, Carlson v. Green, 446 U.\u00a0S. 14. There, the Court did allow a Bivens claim for prisoner mistreatment--specifically, for failure to provide medical care.  And the allegations of injury here are just as compelling as those at issue in Carlson.  This is especially true given that the complaint alleges serious violations of Bureau of Prisons policy.  See 28 CFR \u00a7552.20 (2016) (providing that prison staff may use force \"only as a last alternative after all other reasonable efforts to resolve a situation have failed\" and that staff may \"use only that amount of force necessary to [ensure prison safety and security]\"); \u00a7552.22(j) (\"All incidents involving the use of force .\u00a0.\u00a0. must be carefully documented\"); \u00a7542.11 (requiring the warden to investigate certain complaints of inmate abuse).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Yet even a modest extension is still an extension.  And this case does seek to extend Carlson to a new context.  As noted above, a case can present a new context for Bivens purposes if it implicates a different constitutional right; if judicial precedents provide a less meaningful guide for official conduct; or if there are potential special factors that were not considered in previous Bivens cases.  See supra, at 13.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The constitutional right is different here, since Carlson was predicated on the Eighth Amendment and this claim is predicated on the Fifth.  See 446 U.\u00a0S., at 16.  And the judicial guidance available to this warden, with respect to his supervisory duties, was less developed.  The Court has long made clear the standard for claims alleging failure to provide medical treatment to a prisoner--\"deliberate indifference to serious medical needs.\"  Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.\u00a0S. 97, 104 (1976).  The standard for a claim alleging that a warden allowed guards to abuse pre-trial detainees is less clear under the Court's precedents.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This case also has certain features that were not considered in the Court's previous Bivens cases and that might discourage a court from authorizing a Bivens remedy.  As noted above, the existence of alternative remedies usually precludes a court from authorizing a Bivens action.  Supra, at 14.  And there might have been alternative remedies available here, for example, a writ of habeas corpus, Wolfish, 441 U.\u00a0S., at 526, n.\u00a06; an injunction requiring the warden to bring his prison into compliance with the regulations discussed above; or some other form of equitable relief.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, legislative action suggesting that Congress does not want a damages remedy is itself a factor counseling hesitation.  See supra, at 14.  Some 15 years after Carlson was decided, Congress passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which made comprehensive changes to the way prisoner abuse claims must be brought in federal court.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e.  So it seems clear that Congress had specific occasion to consider the matter of prisoner abuse and to consider the proper way to remedy those wrongs.  This Court has said in dicta that the Act's exhaustion provisions would apply to Bivens suits.  See Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.\u00a0S. 516, 524 (2002).  But the Act itself does not provide for a standalone damages remedy against federal jailers.  It could be argued that this suggests Congress chose not to extend the Carlson damages remedy to cases involving other types of prisoner mistreatment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The differences between this claim and the one in Carlson are perhaps small, at least in practical terms.  Given this Court's expressed caution about extending the Bivens remedy, however, the new-context inquiry is easily satisfied.  Some differences, of course, will be so trivial that they will not suffice to create a new Bivens context.  But here the differences identified above are at the very least meaningful ones.  Thus, before allowing this claim to proceed under Bivens, the Court of Appeals should have performed a special factors analysis.  It should have analyzed whether there were alternative remedies available or other \"sound reasons to think Congress might doubt the efficacy or necessity of a damages remedy\" in a suit like this one.  Supra, at 15.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Although the Court could perform that analysis in the first instance, the briefs have concentrated almost all of their efforts elsewhere.  Given the absence of a comprehensive presentation by the parties, and the fact that the Court of Appeals did not conduct the analysis, the Court declines to perform the special factors analysis itself.  The better course is to vacate the judgment below, allowing the Court of Appeals or the District Court to do so on remand.\nV\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One issue remains to be addressed: the claim that petitioners are subject to liability for civil conspiracy under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71985(3).  Unlike the prisoner abuse claim just discussed, this claim implicates the activities of all the petitioners--the Executive Officials as well as the Wardens--in creating the conditions of confinement at issue here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The civil-conspiracy prohibition contained in \u00a71985(3) was enacted as a significant part of the civil rights legislation passed in the aftermath of the Civil War.  See Carpenters v. Scott, 463 U.\u00a0S. 825, 834-837 (1983) (detailing the legislative history of \u00a71985(3)); Griffin v. Breckenridge, 403 U.\u00a0S. 88, 99-101 (1971) (same); Great American Fed. Sav. & Loan Assn. v. Novotny, 442 U.\u00a0S. 366, 379 (1979) (Powell, J., concurring) (describing \u00a71985(3) as a \"Civil War Era remedial statute\").  The statute imposes liability on two or more persons who \"conspire .\u00a0.\u00a0. for the purpose of depriving .\u00a0.\u00a0. any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws.\"  \u00a71985(3).  In the instant suit, respondents allege that petitioners violated the statute by \"agreeing to implement a policy\" under which respondents would be detained in harsh conditions \"because of their race, religion, ethnicity, and national origin.\"  Assuming these allegations to be true and well pleaded, the question is whether petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The qualified immunity rule seeks a proper balance between two competing interests.  On one hand, damages suits \"may offer the only realistic avenue for vindication of constitutional guarantees.\"  Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.\u00a0S. 800, 814 (1982).  \"On the other hand, permitting damages suits against government officials can entail substantial social costs, including the risk that fear of personal monetary liability and harassing litigation will unduly inhibit officials in the discharge of their duties.\"  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.\u00a0S. 635, 638 (1987).  As one means to accommodate these two objectives, the Court has held that Government officials are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to \"discretionary functions\" performed in their official capacities.  Ibid.  The doctrine of qualified immunity gives officials \"breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions.\"  Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. 731, 743 (2011).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's cases provide additional instruction to define and implement that immunity.  Whether qualified immunity can be invoked turns on the \"objective legal reasonableness\" of the official's acts.  Harlow, supra, at 819.  And reasonableness of official action, in turn, must be \"assessed in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time [the action] was taken.\"  Anderson, supra, at 639 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Mitchell, 472 U.\u00a0S., at 528.  This requirement--that an official loses qualified immunity only for violating clearly established law--protects officials accused of violating \"extremely abstract rights.\"  Anderson, supra, at 639.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Fourth Amendment provides an example of how qualified immunity functions with respect to abstract rights.  By its plain terms, the Amendment forbids unreasonable searches and seizures, yet it may be difficult for an officer to know whether a search or seizure will be deemed reasonable given the precise situation encountered.  See Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.\u00a0S. 194, 205 (2001) (\"It is sometimes difficult for an officer to determine how the relevant legal doctrine, here excessive force, will apply to the factual situation the officer confronts\").  For this reason, \"[t]he dispositive question is 'whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.'\u00a0\"  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (per curiam) (slip op., at 5) (quoting Ashcroft, supra, at 742).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 It is not necessary, of course, that \"the very action in question has previously been held unlawful.\"  Anderson, supra, at 640.  That is, an officer might lose qualified immunity even if there is no reported case \"directly on point.\"  Ashcroft, supra, at 741.  But \"in the light of pre-existing law,\" the unlawfulness of the officer's conduct \"must be apparent.\"  Anderson, supra, at 640. To subject officers to any broader liability would be to \"disrupt the balance that our cases strike between the interests in vindication of citizens' constitutional rights and in public officials' effective performance of their duties.\"  Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.\u00a0S. 183, 195 (1984).  For then, both as a practical and legal matter, it would be difficult for officials \"reasonably [to] anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages.\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In light of these concerns, the Court has held that qualified immunity protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\"  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.\u00a0S. 335, 341 (1986).  To determine whether a given officer falls into either of those two categories, a court must ask whether it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that the alleged conduct \"was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\"  Saucier, supra, at 202.  If so, then the defendant officer must have been either incompetent or else a knowing violator of the law, and thus not entitled to qualified immunity.  If not, however--i.e., if a reasonable officer might not have known for certain that the conduct was unlawful--then the officer is immune from liability.\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Under these principles, it must be concluded that reasonable officials in petitioners' positions would not have known, and could not have predicted, that \u00a71985(3) prohibited their joint consultations and the resulting policies that caused the injuries alleged.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At least two aspects of the complaint indicate that petitioners' potential liability for this statutory offense would not have been known or anticipated by reasonable officials in their position.  First, the conspiracy recited in the complaint is alleged to have been between or among officers in the same branch of the Government (the Executive Branch) and in the same Department (the Department of Justice).  Second, the discussions were the preface to, and the outline of, a general and far-reaching policy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As to the fact that these officers were in the same Department, an analogous principle discussed in the context of antitrust law is instructive.  The Court's precedent indicates that there is no unlawful conspiracy when officers within a single corporate entity consult among themselves and then adopt a policy for the entity.  See Copperweld Corp v. Independence Tube Corp., 467 U.\u00a0S. 752, 769-771 (1984).  Under this principle--sometimes called the intracorporate-conspiracy doctrine--an agreement between or among agents of the same legal entity, when the agents act in their official capacities, is not an unlawful conspiracy.  Ibid.  The rule is derived from the nature of the conspiracy prohibition.  Conspiracy requires an agreement--and in particular an agreement to do an unlawful act--between or among two or more separate persons.  When two agents of the same legal entity make an agreement in the course of their official duties, however, as a practical and legal matter their acts are attributed to their principal.  And it then follows that there has not been an agreement between two or more separate people.  See id., at 771 (analogizing to \"a multiple team of horses drawing a vehicle under the control of a single driver\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  To be sure, this Court has not given its approval to this doctrine in the specific context of \u00a71985(3).  See Great American, 442 U.\u00a0S., at 372, n. 11. There is a division in the courts of appeals, moreover, respecting the validity or correctness of the intracorporate-conspiracy doctrine with reference to \u00a71985 conspiracies.  See Hull v. Shuck, 501 U.\u00a0S. 1261, 1261-1262 (1991) (White, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari) (discussing the Circuit split); Bowie v. Maddox, 642 F. 3d 1122, 1130-1131 (CADC 2011) (detailing a longstanding split about whether the intracorporate-conspiracy doctrine applies to civil rights conspiracies).  Nothing in this opinion should be interpreted as either approving or disapproving the intracorporate-conspiracy doctrine's application in the context of an alleged \u00a71985(3) violation.  The Court might determine, in some later case, that different considerations apply to a conspiracy respecting equal protection guarantees, as distinct from a conspiracy in the antitrust context.  Yet the fact that the courts are divided as to whether or not a \u00a71985(3) conspiracy can arise from official discussions between or among agents of the same entity demonstrates that the law on the point is not well established.  When the courts are divided on an issue so central to the cause of action alleged, a reasonable official lacks the notice required before imposing liability.  See Wilson v. Layne, 526 U.\u00a0S. 603, 618 (1999) (noting that it would be \"unfair\" to subject officers to damages liability when even \"judges .\u00a0.\u00a0. disagree\"); Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.\u00a0S. 658, 669-670 (2012) (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In addition to the concern that agents of the same legal entity are not distinct enough to conspire with one another, there are other sound reasons to conclude that conver-sations and agreements between and among federal officials in the same Department should not be the subject of a private cause of action for damages under \u00a71985(3).  To state a claim under \u00a71985(3), a plaintiff must first show that the defendants conspired--that is, reached an agreement--with one another.  See Carpenters, 463 U.\u00a0S., at 828 (stating that the elements of a \u00a71985(3) claim include \"a conspiracy\").  Thus, a \u00a71985(3) claim against federal officials by necessity implicates the substance of their official discussions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As indicated above with respect to other claims in this suit, open discussion among federal officers is to be encouraged, so that they can reach consensus on the policies a department of the Federal Government should pursue.  See supra, at 17-18.  Close and frequent consultations to facilitate the adoption and implementation of policies are essential to the orderly conduct of governmental affairs.  Were those discussions, and the resulting policies, to be the basis for private suits seeking damages against the officials as individuals, the result would be to chill the interchange and discourse that is necessary for the adoption and implementation of governmental policies.  See Cheney, 542 U.\u00a0S., at 383 (discussing the need for confidential communications among Executive Branch officials); Merrill, 443 U.\u00a0S., at 360 (same).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These considerations suggest that officials employed by the same governmental department do not conspire when they speak to one another and work together in their official capacities.  Whether that contention should prevail need not be decided here.  It suffices to say that the question is sufficiently open so that the officials in this suit could not be certain that \u00a71985(3) was applicable to their discussions and actions.  Thus, the law respondents seek to invoke cannot be clearly established.  It follows that reasonable officers in petitioners' positions would not have known with any certainty that the alleged agreements were forbidden by law.  See Saucier, 533 U.\u00a0S., at 202.  Petitioners are entitled to qualified immunity with respect to the claims under 42 U. S. C. \u00a71985(3).\n*\u2003\u2003*\u2003\u2003*\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If the facts alleged in the complaint are true, then what happened to respondents in the days following September 11 was tragic.  Nothing in this opinion should be read to condone the treatment to which they contend they were subjected.  The question before the Court, however, is not whether petitioners' alleged conduct was proper, nor whether it gave decent respect to respondents' dignity and well-being, nor whether it was in keeping with the idea of the rule of law that must inspire us even in times of crisis.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Instead, the question with respect to the Bivens claims is whether to allow an action for money damages in the absence of congressional authorization.  For the reasons given above, the Court answers that question in the negative as to the detention policy claims.  As to the prisoner abuse claim, because the briefs have not concentrated on that issue, the Court remands to allow the Court of Appeals to consider the claim in light of the Bivens analysis set forth above.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The question with respect to the \u00a71985(3) claim is whether a reasonable officer in petitioners' position would have known the alleged conduct was an unlawful conspiracy.  For the reasons given above, the Court answers that question, too, in the negative.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed as to all of the claims except the prisoner abuse claim against Warden Hasty.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to that claim is vacated, and that case is remanded for further proceedings.\nIt is so ordered.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Justice Sotomayor, Justice Kagan, and Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.\n\nOpinion of Thomas, J.\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNos. 15-1358, 15-1359 and 15-1363\nJAMES W.

I write separately to express my view on the Court's decision to remand some of respondents' claims under Bivens v. Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971), and my concerns about our qualified immunity precedents.\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect to respondents' Bivens claims, I join the opinion of the Court to the extent it reverses the Second Circuit's ruling.  The Court correctly applies our precedents to hold that Bivens does not supply a cause of action against petitioners for most of the alleged Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations.  It also correctly recognizes that respondents' claims against petitioner Dennis Hasty seek to extend Bivens to a new context.  See ante, at 24.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I concur in the judgment of the Court vacating the Court of Appeals' judgment with regard to claims against Hasty.  Ante, at 29.  I have previously noted that \"\u00a0'Bivens is a relic of the heady days in which this Court assumed common-law powers to create causes of action.'\u00a0\"  Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.\u00a0S. 537, 568 (2007) (concurring opinion) (quoting Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S. 61, 75 (2001) (Scalia, J., concurring)).  I have thus declined to \"extend Bivens even [where] its reasoning logically applied,\" thereby limiting \"Bivens and its progeny .\u00a0.\u00a0. to the precise circumstances that they involved.\"  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  This would, in most cases, mean a reversal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals is in order.  However, in order for there to be a controlling judgment in this suit, I concur in the judgment vacating and remanding the claims against petitioner Hasty as that disposition is closest to my preferred approach.\nII\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As for respondents' claims under 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71985(3), I join Part V of the Court's opinion, which holds that respondents are entitled to qualified immunity.  The Court correctly applies our precedents, which no party has asked us to reconsider.  I write separately, however, to note my growing concern with our qualified immunity jurisprudence.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Civil Rights Act of 1871, of which \u00a71985(3) and the more frequently litigated \u00a71983 were originally a part, established causes of action for plaintiffs to seek money damages from Government officers who violated federal law.  See \u00a7\u00a71, 2, 17 Stat. 13.  Although the Act made no mention of defenses or immunities, \"we have read it in harmony with general principles of tort immunities and defenses rather than in derogation of them.\"  Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.\u00a0S. 335, 339 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We have done so because \"[c]ertain immunities were so well established in 1871 .\u00a0.\u00a0. that 'we presume that Congress would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish' them.\"  Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.\u00a0S. 259, 268 (1993); accord, Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.\u00a0S. 325, 330 (1983).  Immunity is thus available under the statute if it was \"historically accorded the relevant official\" in an analogous situation \"at common law,\" Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.\u00a0S. 409, 421 (1976), unless the statute provides some reason to think that Congress did not preserve the defense, see Tower v. Glover, 467 U.\u00a0S. 914, 920 (1984).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In some contexts, we have conducted the common-law inquiry that the statute requires.  See Wyatt v. Cole, 504 U.\u00a0S. 158, 170 (1992) (Kennedy, J., concurring).  For example, we have concluded that legislators and judges are absolutely immune from liability under \u00a71983 for their official acts because that immunity was well established at common law in 1871.  See Tenney v. Brandhove, 341 U.\u00a0S. 367, 372-376 (1951) (legislators); Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.\u00a0S. 547, 553-555 (1967) (judges).  We have similarly looked to the common law in holding that a prosecutor is immune from suits relating to the \"judicial phase of the criminal process,\" Imbler, supra, at 430; Burns v. Reed, 500 U.\u00a0S. 478, 489-492 (1991); but see Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U.\u00a0S. 118, 131-134 (1997) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., concurring) (arguing that the Court in Imbler misunderstood 1871 common-law rules), although not from suits relating to the prosecutor's advice to police officers, Burns, supra, at 493.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In developing immunity doctrine for other executive officers, we also started off by applying common-law rules.  In Pierson, we held that police officers are not absolutely immune from a \u00a71983 claim arising from an arrest made pursuant to an unconstitutional statute because the common law never granted arresting officers that sort of immunity.  386 U.\u00a0S., at 555.  Rather, we concluded that police officers could assert \"the defense of good faith and probable cause\" against the claim for an unconstitutional arrest because that defense was available against the analogous torts of \"false arrest and imprisonment\" at common law.  Id., at 557.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In further elaborating the doctrine of qualified immunity for executive officials, however, we have diverged from the historical inquiry mandated by the statute.  See Wyatt, supra, at 170 (Kennedy, J., concurring); accord, Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.\u00a0S. 574, 611 (1998) (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas, J., dissenting).  In the decisions following Pierson, we have \"completely reformulated qualified immunity along principles not at all embodied in the common law.\"  Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.\u00a0S. 635, 645 (1987) (discussing Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.\u00a0S. 800 (1982)).  Instead of asking whether the common law in 1871 would have accorded immunity to an officer for a tort analogous to the plaintiff's claim under \u00a71983, we instead grant immunity to any officer whose conduct \"does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"  Mullenix v. Luna, 577 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (\u00a0per cu- riam) (slip op., at 4-5) (internal quotation marks omitted); Taylor v. Barkes, 575 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 4) (a Government official is liable under the 1871 Act only if \"\u00a0'existing precedent .\u00a0.\u00a0. placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate'\u00a0\" (quoting Ashcroft v. al-Kidd, 563 U.\u00a0S. 731, 741 (2011))).  We apply this \"clearly established\" standard \"across the board\" and without regard to \"the precise nature of the various officials' duties or the precise character of the particular rights alleged to have been violated.\" Anderson, supra, at 641-643 (internal quotation marks omitted).1  We have not attempted to locate that standard in the common law as it existed in 1871, however, and some evidence supports the conclusion that common-law immunity as it existed in 1871 looked quite different from our current doctrine.  See generally Baude, Is Qualified Immunity Unlawful? 106 Cal. L.\u00a0Rev. (forthcoming 2018) (manuscript, at 7-17), online at https:\/\/papers.ssrn.com\/abstract=2896508 (as last visited June 15, 2017).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because our analysis is no longer grounded in the common-law backdrop against which Congress enacted the 1871 Act, we are no longer engaged in \"interpret[ing] the intent of Congress in enacting\" the Act.  Malley, supra, at 342; see Burns, supra, at 493.  Our qualified immunity precedents instead represent precisely the sort of \"freewheeling policy choice[s]\" that we have previously disclaimed the power to make.  Rehberg v. Paulk, 566 U.\u00a0S. 356, 363 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Tower, supra, at 922-923 (\"We do not have a license to establish immunities from\" suits brought under the Act \"in the interests of what we judge to be sound public policy\").  We have acknowledged, in fact, that the \"clearly established\" standard is designed to \"protec[t] the balance between vindication of constitutional rights and government officials' effective performance of their duties.\"  Reichle v. Howards, 566 U.\u00a0S. 658, 664 (2012) (internal quotation marks omitted); Harlow, supra, at 807 (explaining that \"the recognition of a qualified immunity defense .\u00a0.\u00a0. reflected an attempt to balance competing values\").  The Constitution assigns this kind of balancing to Congress, not the Courts.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In today's decision, we continue down the path our precedents have marked.  We ask \"whether it would have been clear to a reasonable officer that the alleged conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted,\" ante, at 29 (internal quotation marks omitted), rather than whether officers in petitioners' positions would have been accorded immunity at common law in 1871 from claims analogous to respondents'.  Even if we ultimately reach a conclusion consistent with the common-law rules prevailing in 1871, it is mere fortuity.  Until we shift the focus of our inquiry to whether immunity existed at common law, we will continue to substitute our own policy preferences for the mandates of Congress.  In an appropriate case, we should reconsider our qualified immunity jurisprudence.\n\nBreyer, J., dissenting\n\u2002582 U.\u00a0S. ____ (2017)\nNos. 15-1358, 15-1359 and 15-1363\nJAMES W.

Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents, 403 U.\u00a0S. 388 (1971), this Court held that the Fourth Amendment provides a damages remedy for those whom federal officials have injured as a result of an unconstitutional search or seizure.  In Davis v. Passman, 442 U.\u00a0S. 228 (1979), the Court held that the Fifth Amendment provides a damages remedy to an individual dismissed by her employer (a Member of Congress) on the basis of her sex in violation of the equal protection component of that Amendment's Due Process Clause.  And in Carlson v. Green, 446 U.\u00a0S. 14 (1980), the Court held that the Eighth Amendment provides a damages remedy to a prisoner who died as a result of prison official's deliberate indifference to his medical needs, in violation of the Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is by now well established that federal law provides damages actions at least in similar contexts, where claims of constitutional violation arise.  Congress has ratified Bivens actions, plaintiffs frequently bring them, courts accept them, and scholars defend their importance.  See J. Pfander, Constitutional Torts and the War on Terror (2017) (canvassing the history of Bivens and cataloguing cases).  Moreover, the courts, in order to avoid deterring federal officials from properly performing their work, have developed safeguards for defendants, including the requirement that plaintiffs plead \"plausible\" claims, Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S. 662, 679 (2009), as well as the defense of \"qualified immunity,\" which frees federal officials from both threat of liability and involvement in the lawsuit, unless the plaintiffs establish that officials have violated \"\u00a0'clearly established .\u00a0.\u00a0. constitutional rights,'\u00a0\" id., at 672 (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.\u00a0S. 800, 818 (1982)).  \"[This] Court has been reluctant to extend Bivens liability 'to any new context or new category of defendants.'\u00a0\"  Iqbal, supra, at 675 (quoting Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S. 61, 68 (2001)).  But the Court has made clear that it would not narrow Bivens' existing scope.  See FDIC v. Meyer, 510 U.\u00a0S. 471, 485 (1994) (guarding against \"the evisceration of the Bivens remedy\" so that its \"deterrent effects .\u00a0.\u00a0. would [not] be lost\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs before us today seek damages for unconstitutional conditions of confinement.  They alleged that federal officials slammed them against walls, shackled them, exposed them to nonstop lighting, lack of hygiene, and the like, all based upon invidious discrimination and without penological justification.  See ante, at 4-5.  In my view, these claims are well-pleaded, state violations of clearly established law, and fall within the scope of longstanding Bivens law.  For those reasons, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.  I shall discuss at some length what I believe is the most important point of disagreement.  The Court, in my view, is wrong to hold that permitting a constitutional tort action here would \"extend\" Bivens, applying it in a new context.  To the contrary, I fear that the Court's holding would significantly shrink the existing Bivens contexts, diminishing the compensatory remedy constitutional tort law now offers to harmed individuals.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I shall explain why I believe this suit falls well within the scope of traditional constitutional tort law and why I cannot agree with the Court's arguments to the contrary.  I recognize, and write separately about, the strongest of the Court's arguments, namely, the fact that plaintiffs' claims concern detention that took place soon after a serious attack on the United States and some of them concern actions of high-level Government officials.  While these facts may affect the substantive constitutional  questions (e.g., were any of the conditions \"legitimate\"?) or the scope of the qualified-immunity defense, they do not extinguish the Bivens action itself.  If I may paraphrase Justice Harlan, concurring in Bivens: In wartime as well as in peacetime, \"it is important, in a civilized society, that the judicial branch of the Nation's government stand ready to afford a remedy\" \"for the most flagrant and patently unjustified,\" unconstitutional \"abuses of official power.\"  403 U.\u00a0S., at 410-411 (opinion concurring in judgment); cf. Boumediene v. Bush, 553 U.\u00a0S. 723, 798 (2008).\nI\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority opinion well summarizes the particular claims that the plaintiffs make in this suit.  All concern the conditions of their confinement, which began soon after the September 11, 2001, attacks and \"lasted for days and weeks, then stretching into months.\"  Ante, at 1.  At some point, the plaintiffs allege, all the defendants knew that they had nothing to do with the September 11 attacks but continued to detain them anyway in harsh conditions.  Official Government policy, both before and after the defendants became aware of the plaintiffs' innocence, led to the plaintiffs being held in \"tiny cells for over 23 hours a day\" with lights continuously left on, \"shackled\" when moved, often \"strip searched,\" and \"denied access to most forms of communication with the outside world.\"  Ante, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The defendants detained the plaintiffs in these conditions on the basis of their race or religion and without justification.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, the prison wardens were aware of, but deliberately indifferent to, certain unofficial activities of prison guards involving a pattern of \"physical and verbal abuse,\" such as \"slam[ming] detainees into walls; twist[ing] their arms, wrists, and fingers; [breaking] their bones;\" and subjecting them to verbal taunts.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The plaintiffs' complaint alleges that all the defendants--high-level Department of Justice officials and prison wardens alike--were directly responsible for the official confinement policy, which, in some or all of the aspects mentioned, violated the due process and equal protection components of the Fifth Amendment.  The complaint adds that, insofar as the prison wardens were deliberately indifferent to the unofficial conduct of the guards, they violated the Fourth and the Fifth Amendments.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would hold that the complaint properly alleges constitutional torts, i.e., Bivens actions for damages.\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court's holdings in Bivens, Carlson, and Davis rest upon four basic legal considerations.  First, the Bivens Court referred to longstanding Supreme Court precedent stating or suggesting that the Constitution provides federal courts with considerable legal authority to use traditional remedies to right constitutional wrongs.  That precedent begins with Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), which effectively placed upon those who would deny the existence of an effective legal remedy the burden of showing why their case was special.  Chief Justice John Marshall wrote for the Court that\n\"[t]he very essence of civil liberty [lies] in the right of every individual to claim the protection of the laws, whenever he receives an injury.\"  Id., at 163.\nThe Chief Justice referred to Blackstone's Commentaries stating that there\n\"\u00a0'is a general and indisputable rule, that where there is a legal right, there is also a legal remedy .\u00a0.\u00a0. [and that] it is a settled and invariable principle in the laws of England, that every right, when withheld, must have a remedy, and every injury its proper redress.'\u00a0\"  1 Cranch, at 163.\nThe Chief Justice then wrote:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"The government of the United States has been emphatically termed a government of laws, and not of men.  It will [not] deserve this high appellation, if the laws furnish no remedy for the violation of a vested legal right.\"  Ibid.\nHe concluded for the Court that there must be something \"peculiar\" (i.e., special) about a case that warrants \"exclu[ding] the injured party from legal redress .\u00a0.\u00a0. [and placing it within] that class of cases which come under the description of damnum absque injuria--a loss without an injury.\"  Id., at 163-164; but cf. id., at 164 (placing \"political\" questions in the latter, special category).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Much later, in Bell v. Hood, 327 U.\u00a0S. 678, 684 (1946), the Court wrote that,\n\"where federally protected rights have been invaded, it has been the rule from the beginning that courts will be alert to adjust their remedies so as to grant the necessary relief.\"\nSee also Bivens, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 392 (citing opinions of Justices Cardozo and Holmes to similar effect).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bivens Court reiterated these principles and confirmed that the appropriate remedial \"adjust[ment]\" in the case before it was an award of money damages, the \"remedial mechanism normally available in the federal courts.\"  Id., at 392, 397.  Justice Harlan agreed, adding that, since Congress' \"general\" statutory \"grant of jurisdiction\" authorized courts to grant equitable relief in cases arising under federal jurisdiction, courts likewise had the authority to award damages--the \"traditional remedy at law\"--in order to \"vindicate the interests of the individual\" protected by the Bill of Rights.  Id., at 405-407 (opinion concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, our cases have recognized that Congress' silence on the subject indicates a willingness to leave this matter to the courts.  In Bivens, the Court noted, as an argument favoring its conclusion, the absence of an \"explicit congressional declaration that persons injured by a federal officer's violation of the Fourth Amendment may not recover money damages from the agents.\"  Id., at 397.  Similarly, in Davis v. Passman, the Court stressed that there was \"no evidence .\u00a0.\u00a0. that Congress meant .\u00a0.\u00a0. to foreclose\" a damages remedy.  442 U.\u00a0S., at 247.  In Carlson, the Court went further, observing that not only was there no sign \"that Congress meant to pre-empt a Bivens remedy,\" but there was also \"clear\" evidence that Congress intended to preserve it.  446 U.\u00a0S., at 19-20.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, our Bivens cases acknowledge that a constitutional tort may not lie when \"special factors counse[l] hesitation\" and when Congress has provided an adequate alternative remedy.  446 U.\u00a0S., at 18-19.  The relevant special factors in those cases included whether the court was faced \"with a question of 'federal fiscal policy,'\u00a0\" Bivens, supra, at 396, or a risk of \"deluging federal courts with claims,\" Davis, supra, at 248 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Carlson acknowledged an additional factor--that damages suits \"might inhibit [federal officials'] efforts to perform their official duties\"--but concluded that \"the qualified immunity accorded [federal officials] under [existing law] provides adequate protection.\"  446 U.\u00a0S., at 19.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Fourth, as the Court recognized later in Carlson, a Bivens remedy was needed to cure what would, without it, amount to a constitutional anomaly.  Long before this Court incorporated many of the Bill of Rights' guarantees against the States, see Amar, The Bill of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, 101 Yale L.\u00a0J. 1193 (1992), federal civil rights statutes afforded a damages remedy to any person whom a state official deprived of a federal constitutional right, see 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71983; Monroe v. Pape, 365 U.\u00a0S. 167, 171-187 (1961) (describing this history).  But federal statutory law did not provide a damages remedy to a person whom a federal official had deprived of that same right, even though the Bill of Rights was at the time of the founding primarily aimed at constraining the Federal Government.  Thus, a person harmed by an unconstitutional search or seizure might sue a city mayor, a state legislator, or even a Governor.  But that person could not sue a federal agent, a national legislator, or a Justice Department official for an identical offense.  \"[Our] 'constitutional design,'\u00a0\" the Court wrote, \"would be stood on its head if federal officials did not face at least the same liability as state officials guilty of the same constitutional transgression.\"  Carlson, supra, at 22 (quoting Butz v. Economou, 438 U.\u00a0S. 478, 504 (1978)).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Bivens Court also recognized that the Court had previously inferred damages remedies caused by violations of certain federal statutes that themselves did not explicitly authorize damages remedies.  403 U.\u00a0S., at 395-396.  At the same time, Bivens, Davis, and Carlson treat the courts' power to derive a damages remedy from a constitutional provision not as included within a power to find a statute-based damages remedy but as flowing from those statutory cases a fortiori.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As the majority opinion points out, this Court in more recent years has indicated that \"expanding the Bivens remedy is now a 'disfavored' judicial activity.\"  Ante, at 11 (quoting Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 675; emphasis added).  Thus, it has held that the remedy is not available in the context of suits against military officers, see Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.\u00a0S. 296, 298-300 (1983); United States v. Stanley, 483 U.\u00a0S. 669, 683-684 (1987); in the context of suits against privately operated prisons and their employees, see Minneci v. Pollard, 565 U.\u00a0S. 118, 120 (2012); Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 70-73; in the context of suits seeking to vindicate procedural, rather than substantive, constitutional protections, see Schweiker v. Chilicky, 487 U.\u00a0S. 412, 423 (1988); and in the context of suits seeking to vindicate two quite different forms of important substantive protection, one involving free speech, see Bush v. Lucas, 462 U.\u00a0S. 367, 368 (1983), and the other involving protection of land rights, see Wilkie v. Robbins, 551 U.\u00a0S. 537, 551 (2007).  Each of these cases involved a context that differed from that of Bivens, Davis, and Carlson with respect to the kind of defendant, the basic nature of the right, or the kind of harm suffered.  That is to say, as we have explicitly stated, these cases were \"fundamentally different from anything recognized in Bivens or subsequent cases.\"  Malesko, supra, at 70 (emphasis added).  In each of them, the plaintiffs were asking the Court to \"\u00a0'authoriz[e] a new kind of federal litigation.'\u00a0\"  Wilkie, supra, at 550 (emphasis added).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thus the Court, as the majority opinion says, repeatedly wrote that it was not \"expanding\" the scope of the Bivens remedy.  Ante, at 11.  But the Court nowhere suggested that it would narrow Bivens' existing scope.  In fact, to diminish any ambiguity about its holdings, the Court set out a framework for determining whether a claim of constitutional violation calls for a Bivens remedy.  See Wilkie, supra, at 549-550.  At Step One, the court must determine whether the case before it arises in a \"new context,\" that is, whether it involves a \"new category of defendants,\" Malesko, supra, at 68, or (presumably) a significantly different kind of constitutional harm, such as a purely procedural harm, a harm to speech, or a harm caused to physical property.  If the context is new, then the court proceeds to Step Two and asks \"whether any alternative, existing process for protecting the interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.\"  Wilkie, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 550.  If there is none, then the court proceeds to Step Three and asks whether there are \"\u00a0'any special factors counselling hesitation before authorizing a new kind of federal litigation.'\u00a0\"  Ibid.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Precedent makes this framework applicable here. I would apply it.  And, doing so, I cannot get past Step One.  This suit, it seems to me, arises in a context similar to those in which this Court has previously permitted Bivens actions.\nB\n1\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The context here is not \"new,\" Wilkie, supra, at 550, or \"fundamentally different\" than our previous Bivens cases, Malesko, supra, at 70.  First, the plaintiffs are civilians, not members of the military.  They are not citizens, but the Constitution protects noncitizens against serious mistreatment, as it protects citizens.  See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.\u00a0S. 259, 271 (1990) (\"[A]liens receive constitutional protections when they have come within the territory of the United States and developed substantial connections with this country\").  Some or all of the plaintiffs here may have been illegally present in the United States.  But that fact cannot justify physical mistreatment.  Nor does anyone claim that that fact deprives them of a Bivens right available to other persons, citizens and noncitizens alike.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Second, the defendants are Government officials.  They are not members of the military or private persons.  Two are prison wardens.  Three others are high-ranking Department of Justice officials.  Prison wardens have been defendants in Bivens actions, as have other high-level Government officials.  One of the defendants in Carlson was the Director of the Bureau of Prisons; the defendant in Davis was a Member of Congress.  We have also held that the Attorney General of the United States is not entitled to absolute immunity in a damages suit arising out of his actions related to national security.  See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.\u00a0S. 511, 520 (1985).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Third, from a Bivens perspective, the injuries that the plaintiffs claim they suffered are familiar ones.  They focus upon the conditions of confinement.  The plaintiffs say that they were unnecessarily shackled, confined in small unhygienic cells, subjected to continuous lighting (presumably preventing sleep), unnecessarily and frequently strip searched, slammed against walls, injured physically, and subject to verbal abuse.  They allege that they suffered these harms because of their race or religion, the defendants having either turned a blind eye to what was happening or themselves introduced policies that they knew would lead to these harms even though the defendants knew the plaintiffs had no connections to terrorism.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0These claimed harms are similar to, or even worse than, the harms the plaintiffs suffered in Bivens (unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment), Davis (unlawful discrimination in violation of the Fifth Amendment), and Carlson (deliberate indifference to medical need in violation of the Eighth Amendment).\u00a0 Indeed, we have said that, \"[i]f a federal prisoner in a [Bureau of Prisons] facility alleges a constitutional deprivation, he may bring a Bivens claim against the offending individual officer, subject to the defense of qualified immunity.\"  Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 72; see also Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.\u00a0S. 825, 832 (1994) (Bivens case about prisoner abuse).  The claims in this suit would seem to fill the Bivens' bill.  See Sell v. United States, 539 U.\u00a0S. 166, 193 (2003) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\"[A] [Bivens] action .\u00a0.\u00a0. is available to federal pretrial detainees challenging the conditions of their confinement\").\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is true that the plaintiffs bring their \"deliberate indifference\" claim against Warden Hasty under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, not the Eighth Amendment's Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause, as in Carlson.  But that is because the latter applies to convicted criminals while the former applies to pretrial and immigration detainees.  Where the harm is the same, where this Court has held that both the Fifth and Eighth Amendments give rise to Bivens' remedies, and where the only difference in constitutional scope consists of a circumstance (the absence of a conviction) that makes the violation here worse, it cannot be maintained that the difference between the use of the two Amendments is \"fundamental.\"  See City of Revere v. Massachusetts Gen. Hospital, 463 U.\u00a0S. 239, 244 (1983) (\"due process rights\" of an unconvicted person \"are at least as great as the Eighth Amendment protections available to a convicted prisoner\"); Kingsley v. Hendrickson, 576 U.\u00a0S. ___, ___-___ (2015) (slip op., at 10-11) (\"pretrial detainees (unlike convicted prisoners) cannot be punished at all\"); Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.\u00a0S. 678, 721 (2001) (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (detention \"incident to removal .\u00a0.\u00a0. cannot be justified as punishment nor can the confinement or its conditions be designed in order to punish\").  See also Bistrian v. Levi, 696 F.\u00a03d 352, 372 (CA3 2012) (permitting Bivens action brought by detainee in administrative segregation); Thomas v. Ashcroft, 470 F.\u00a03d 491, 493, 496-497 (CA2 2006) (detainee alleging failure to provide adequate medical care); Magluta v. Samples, 375 F.\u00a03d 1269, 1271, 1275-1276 (CA11 2004) (detainee in solitary confinement); Papa v. United States, 281 F.\u00a03d 1004, 1010-1011 (CA9 2002) (due process claims arising from death of immigration detainee); Loe v. Armistead, 582 F.\u00a02d 1291, 1293-1296 (CA4 1978) (detainee's claim of deliberate indifference to medical need).  If an arrestee can bring a claim of excessive force (Bivens itself), and a convicted prisoner can bring a claim for denying medical care (Carlson), someone who has neither been charged nor convicted with a crime should also be able to challenge abuse that causes him to need medical care. \n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor has Congress suggested that it wants to withdraw a damages remedy in circumstances like these.  By its express terms, the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PLRA) does not apply to immigration detainees.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71997e(h) (\"[T]he term 'prisoner' means any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law .\u00a0.\u00a0. \"); see also Agyeman v. INS, 296 F.\u00a03d 871, 886 (CA9 2002) (\"[W]e hold that an alien detained by the INS pending deportation is not a 'prisoner' within the meaning of the PLRA\"); LaFontant v. INS, 135 F.\u00a03d 158, 165 (CADC 1998) (same); Ojo v. INS, 106 F.\u00a03d 680, 683 (CA5 1997) (same).  And, in fact, there is strong evidence that Congress assumed that Bivens remedies would be available to prisoners when it enacted the PLRA--e.g., Congress continued to permit prisoners to recover for physical injuries, the typical kinds of Bivens injuries.  See 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71346(b)(2); Pfander, Constitutional Torts, at 105-106.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If there were any lingering doubt that the claim against Warden Hasty arises in a familiar Bivens context, the Court has made clear that conditions-of-confinement claims and medical-care claims are subject to the same substantive standard.  See Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.\u00a0S. 1, 8 (1992) (\"[Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.\u00a0S. 294, 303 (1991)] extended the deliberate indifference standard applied to Eighth Amendment claims involving medical care to claims about conditions of confinement\").  Indeed, the Court made this very point in a Bivens case alleging that prison wardens were deliberately indifferent to an inmate's safety.  See Farmer, supra, at 830, 834.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I recognize that the Court finds a significant difference in the fact that the confinement here arose soon after a national-security emergency, namely, the September 11 attacks.  The short answer to this argument, in respect to at least some of the claimed harms, is that some plaintiffs continued to suffer those harms up to eight months after the September 11 attacks took place and after the defendants knew the plaintiffs had no connection to terrorism.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1359, p.\u00a0280a.  But because I believe the Court's argument here is its strongest, I will consider it at greater length below.  See Part III-C, infra.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Because the context here is not new, I would allow the plaintiffs' constitutional claims to proceed.  The plaintiffs have adequately alleged that the defendants were personally involved in imposing the conditions of confinement and did so with knowledge that the plaintiffs bore no ties to terrorism, thus satisfying Iqbal's pleading standard.  See 556 U.\u00a0S., at 679 (claims must be \"plausible\"); see also id., at 699-700 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  And because it is clearly established that it is unconstitutional to subject detainees to punitive conditions of confinement and to target them based solely on their race, religion, or national origin, the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on the constitutional claims.  See Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.\u00a0S. 520, 535-539, and n.\u00a020 (1979); Davis, 442 U.\u00a0S., at 236 (\"It is equally clear .\u00a0.\u00a0. that the Fifth Amendment confers on petitioner a constitutional right to be free from illegal discrimination\").  (Similarly, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals with respect to the plaintiffs' statutory claim, namely, that the defendants conspired to deprive the plaintiffs of equal protection of the laws in violation of 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a71985(3).  See Turkmen v. Hasty, 789 F.\u00a03d 218, 262-264 (CA2 2015).  I agree with the Court of Appeals that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.  See ibid.)\n2\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Even were I wrong and were the context here \"fundamentally different,\" Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 70, the plaintiffs' claims would nonetheless survive Step Two and Step Three of the Court's framework for determining whether Bivens applies, see supra, at 9.  Step Two consists of asking whether \"any alternative, existing process for protecting the interest amounts to a convincing reason for the Judicial Branch to refrain from providing a new and freestanding remedy in damages.\"  Wilkie, 551 U.\u00a0S., at 550. I can find no such \"alternative, existing process\" here.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court does not claim that the PLRA provides plaintiffs with a remedy.  Ante, at 25-26.  Rather, it says that the plaintiffs may have \"had available to them\" relief in the form of a prospective injunction or an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Ante, at 22.  Neither a prospective injunction nor a writ of habeas corpus, however, will normally provide plaintiffs with redress for harms they have already suffered.  And here plaintiffs make a strong claim that neither was available to them--at least not for a considerable time.  Some of the plaintiffs allege that for two or three months they were subject to a \"communications blackout\"; that the prison \"staff did not permit them visitors, legal or social telephone calls, or mail\"; that their families and attorneys did not know where they were being held; that they could not receive visits from their attorneys; that subsequently their lawyers could call them only once a week; and that some or all of the defendants \"interfered with the detainees' effective access to legal counsel.\"  Office of Inspector General (OIG) Report, App. 223, 293, 251, 391; see App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15-1359, at\u00a0253a (incorporating the OIG report into the complaint).  These claims make it virtually impossible to say that here there is an \"elaborate, comprehensive\" alternative remedial scheme similar to schemes that, in the past, we have found block the application of Bivens to new contexts.  Bush, 462 U.\u00a0S., at 385.  If these allegations  are proved, then in this suit, it is \"damages or nothing.\"  Bivens, 403 U.\u00a0S., at 410 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There being no \"alternative, existing process\" that provides a \"convincing reason\" for not applying Bivens, we must proceed to Step Three.  Wilkie, supra, at 550.  Doing so, I can find no \"special factors [that] counse[l] hesitation before authorizing\" this Bivens action.  551 U.\u00a0S., at 550.  I turn to this matter next.\nII\nA\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Court describes two general considerations that it believes argue against an \"extension\" of Bivens.  First, the majority opinion points out that the Court is now far less likely than at the time it decided Bivens to imply a cause of action for damages from a statute that does not explicitly provide for a damages claim.  See ante, at 8-9.  Second,  it finds the \"silence\" of Congress \"notable\" in that Congress, though likely aware of the \"high-level policies\" involved in this suit, did not \"choose to extend to any person the kind of remedies\" that the plaintiffs here \"seek.\"  Ante, at 20-21 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I doubt the strength of these two general considerations.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The first consideration, in my view, is not relevant.  I concede that the majority and concurring opinions in Bivens looked in part for support to the fact that the Court had implied damages remedies from statutes silent on the subject.  See 403 U.\u00a0S., at 397; id., at 402-403 (Harlan, J., concurring in judgment).  But that was not the main argument favoring the Court's conclusion.  Rather, the Court drew far stronger support from the need for such a remedy when measured against a common-law and constitutional history of allowing traditional legal remedies where necessary.  Id., at 392, 396-397.  The Court believed such a remedy was necessary to make effective the Constitution's protection of certain basic individual rights.  See id., at 392; id., at 407 (opinion of Harlan, J.).  Similarly, as the Court later explained, a damages remedy against federal officials prevented the serious legal anomaly I previously mentioned.  Its existence made basic constitutional protections of the individual against Federal Government abuse (the Bill of Rights' pre-Civil War objective) as effective as protections against abuse by state officials (the post-Civil War, post selective-incorporation objective).  See supra, at 7.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Nor is the second circumstance--congressional silence--relevant in the manner that the majority opinion describes.  The Court initially saw that silence as indicating an absence of congressional hostility to the Court's exercise of its traditional remedy-inferring powers.  See Bivens, supra, at 397; Davis, 442 U.\u00a0S., at 246-247.  Congress' subsequent silence contains strong signs that it accepted Bivens actions as part of the law.  After all, Congress rejected a proposal that would have eliminated Bivens by substituting the U.\u00a0S. Government as a defendant in suits against federal officers that raised constitutional claims.  See Pfander, Constitutional Torts, at 102.  Later, Congress expressly immunized federal employees acting in the course of their official duties from tort claims except those premised on violations of the Constitution.  See Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988, commonly known as the Westfall Act, 28 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72679(b)(2)(A).  We stated that it is consequently \"crystal clear that Congress views [the Federal Tort Claims Act] and Bivens as [providing] parallel, complementary causes of action.\"  Carlson, 446 U.\u00a0S., at 20; see Malesko, 534 U.\u00a0S., at 68 (similar).  Congress has even assumed the existence of a Bivens remedy in suits brought by noncitizen detainees suspected of terrorism.  See 42 U.\u00a0S.\u00a0C. \u00a72000dd-1 (granting qualified immunity--but  not absolute immunity--to military and civilian federal officials who are sued by alien detainees suspected of terrorism).\nB\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The majority opinion also sets forth a more specific list of factors that it says bear on \"whether a case presents a new Bivens context.\"  Ante, at 16.  In the Court's view, a \"case might differ\" from Bivens \"in a meaningful way because of [1] the rank of the officers involved; [2] the constitutional right at issue; [3] the generality or specificity of the individual action; [4] the extent of judicial guidance as to how an officer should respond to the problem or emergency to be confronted; [5] the statutory or other legal mandate under which the officer was operating; [6] the risk of disruptive intrusion by the Judiciary into the functioning of other branches; [7] or the presence of potential special factors that previous Bivens cases did not consider.\"  Ante, at 16.  In my view, these factors do not make a \"meaningful difference\" at Step One of the Bivens framework.  Some of them are better cast as \"special factors\" relevant to Step Three.  But, as I see it, none should normally foreclose a Bivens action and none is determinative here.  Consider them one by one:\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1) The rank of the officers.  I can understand why an officer's rank might bear on whether he violated the Constitution, because, for example, a plaintiff might need to show the officer was willfully blind to a harm caused by lower ranking officers or that the officer had actual knowledge of the misconduct.  And I can understand that rank might relate to the existence of a legal defense, such as qualified, or even absolute, immunity.  But if--and I recognize that this is often a very big if--a plaintiff proves a clear constitutional violation, say, of the Fourth Amendment, and he shows that the defendant does not possess any form of immunity or other defense, then why should he not have a damages remedy for harm suffered?  What does rank have to do with that question, namely, the Bivens question?  Why should the law treat differently a high-level official and the local constable where each has similarly violated the Constitution and where neither can successfully assert immunity or any other defense?\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2) The constitutional right at issue.  I agree that this factor can make a difference, but only when the substance of the right is distinct.  See, e.g., Wilkie, 551 U.\u00a0S. 537 (land rights).  But, for reasons I have already pointed out, there is no relevant difference between the rights at issue here and the rights at issue in our previous Bivens cases, namely, the rights to be free of unreasonable searches, invidious discrimination, and physical abuse in federal custody.  See supra, at 10-11.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(3) The generality or specificity of the individual action.  I should think that it is not the \"generality or specificity\" of an official action but rather the nature of the official action that matters.  Bivens should apply to some generally applicable actions, such as actions taken deliberately to jail a large group of known-innocent people.  And it should not apply to some highly specific actions, depending upon the nature of those actions.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(4) The extent of judicial guidance.  This factor may be relevant to the existence of a constitutional violation or a qualified-immunity defense.  Where judicial guidance is lacking, it is more likely that a constitutional violation is not clearly established.  See Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.\u00a0S. 635, 640 (1987) (Officials are protected by qualified immunity unless \"[t]he contours of the right [are] sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right\").  But I do not see how, assuming the violation is clear, the presence or absence of \"judicial guidance\" is relevant to the existence of a damages remedy.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(5) The statutory (or other) legal mandate under which the officer was operating.  This factor too may prove relevant to the question whether a constitutional violation exists or is clearly established.  But, again, assuming that it is, I do not understand why this factor is relevant to the existence of a damages remedy.  See Stanley, 483 U.\u00a0S., at 684 (the question of immunity is \"analytically distinct\" from the question whether a Bivens action should lie).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(6) Risk of disruptive judicial intrusion.  All damages actions risk disrupting to some degree future decisionmaking by members of the Executive or Legislative Branches.  Where this Court has authorized Bivens actions, it has found that disruption tolerable, and it has explained why disruption is, from a constitutional perspective, desirable.  See Davis, 442 U.\u00a0S., at 242 (Unless constitutional rights \"are to become merely precatory, .\u00a0.\u00a0. litigants who allege that their own constitutional rights have been violated, and who at the same time have no effective means other than the judiciary to enforce these rights, must be able to invoke the existing jurisdiction of the courts for .\u00a0.\u00a0. protection\"); Malesko, supra, at 70 (\"The purpose of Bivens is to deter individual federal officers from committing constitutional violations\").  Insofar as the Court means this consideration to provide a reason why there should be no Bivens action where a Government employee acts in time of security need, I shall discuss the matter next, in Part C.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(7) Other potential special factors.  Since I am not certain what these other \"potential factors\" are and, since the Court does not specify their nature, I would not, and the Court cannot, consider them in differentiating this suit from our previous Bivens cases or as militating against recognizing a Bivens action here.\nC\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0In my view, the Court's strongest argument is that Bivens should not apply to policy-related actions taken in times of national-security need, for example, during war or national-security emergency.  As the Court correctly points out, the Constitution grants primary power to protect the Nation's security to the Executive and Legislative Branches, not to the Judiciary.  But the Constitution also delegates to the Judiciary the duty to protect an individual's fundamental constitutional rights.  Hence when protection of those rights and a determination of security needs conflict, the Court has a role to play.  The Court most recently made this clear in cases arising out of the detention of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay.  Justice O'Connor wrote that \"a state of war is not a blank check.\"  Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.\u00a0S. 507, 536 (2004) (plurality opinion).  In Boumediene, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 732-733, the Court reinforced that point, holding that noncitizens detained as enemy combatants were entitled to challenge their detention through a writ of habeas corpus, notwithstanding the national-security concerns at stake.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We have not, however, answered the specific question the Court places at issue here: Should Bivens actions continue to exist in respect to policy-related actions taken in time of war or national emergency?  In my view, they should.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, a Bivens action comes accompanied by many legal safeguards designed to prevent the courts from interfering with Executive and Legislative Branch activity reasonably believed to be necessary to protect national security.  In Justice Jackson's well-known words, the Constitution is not \"a suicide pact.\"  Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.\u00a0S. 1, 37 (1949) (dissenting opinion).  The Constitution itself takes account of public necessity.  Thus, for example, the Fourth Amendment does not forbid all Government searches and seizures; it forbids only those that are \"unreasonable.\"  Ordinarily, it requires that a police officer obtain a search warrant before entering an apartment, but should the officer observe a woman being dragged against her will into that apartment, he should, and will, act at once.  The Fourth Amendment makes allowances for such \"exigent circumstances.\"  Brigham City v. Stuart, 547 U.\u00a0S. 398, 401 (2006) (warrantless entry justified to forestall imminent injury).  Similarly, the Fifth Amendment bars only conditions of confinement that are not \"reasonably related to a legitimate governmental objective.\"  Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.\u00a0S., at 539.  What is unreasonable and illegitimate in time of peace may be reasonable and legitimate in time of war.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Moreover, Bivens comes accompanied with a qualified-immunity defense.  Federal officials will face suit only if they have violated a constitutional right that was \"clearly established\" at the time they acted.  Harlow, 457 U.\u00a0S., at 818.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Further, in order to prevent the very presence of a Bivens lawsuit from interfering with the work of a Government official, this Court has held that a complaint must state a claim for relief that is \"plausible.\"  Iqbal, 556 U.\u00a0S., at 679.  \"[C]onclusory\" statements and \"[t]hreadbare\" allegations will not suffice.  Id., at 678.  And the Court has protected high-level officials in particular by requiring that plaintiffs plead that an official was personally involved in the unconstitutional conduct; an official cannot be vicariously liable for another's misdeeds.  Id., at 676.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Finally, where such a claim is filed, courts can, and should, tailor discovery orders so that they do not unnecessarily or improperly interfere with the official's work.  The Second Circuit has emphasized the \"need to vindicate the purpose of the qualified immunity defense by dismissing non-meritorious claims against public officials at an early stage of litigation.\"  Iqbal v. Hasty, 490 F.\u00a03d 143, 158 (2007).  Where some of the defendants are \"current or former senior officials of the Government, against whom broad-ranging allegations of knowledge and personal involvement are easily made, a district court\" not only \"may, but 'must exercise its discretion in a way that protects the substance of the qualified immunity defense .\u00a0.\u00a0. so that'\u00a0\" those officials \"\u00a0'are not subjected to unnecessary and burdensome discovery or trial proceedings.'\u00a0\"  Id., at 158-159.  The court can make \"all such discovery subject to prior court approval.\"  Id., at 158.  It can \"structure .\u00a0.\u00a0. limited discovery by examining written responses to interrogatories and requests to admit before authorizing depositions, and by deferring discovery directed to high-level officials until discovery of front-line officials has been completed and has demonstrated the need for discovery higher up the ranks.\"  Ibid.  In a word, a trial court can and should so structure the proceedings with full recognition that qualified immunity amounts to immunity from suit as well as immunity from liability.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Given these safeguards against undue interference by the Judiciary in times of war or national-security emergency, the Court's abolition, or limitation of, Bivens actions goes too far.  If you are cold, put on a sweater, perhaps an overcoat, perhaps also turn up the heat, but do not set fire to the house.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, there may well be a particular need for Bivens remedies when security-related Government actions are at issue.  History tells us of far too many instances where the Executive or Legislative Branch took actions during time of war that, on later examination, turned out unnecessarily and unreasonably to have deprived American citizens of basic constitutional rights.  We have read about the Alien and Sedition Acts, the thousands of civilians imprisoned during the Civil War, and the suppression of civil liberties during World War I.  See W. Rehnquist, All the Laws but One: Civil Liberties in Wartime 209-210, 49-50, 173-180, 183 (1998); see also Ex\u00a0parte Milligan, 4 Wall. 2 (1866) (decided after the Civil War was over).  The pages of the U.\u00a0S. Reports themselves recite this Court's refusal to set aside the Government's World War II action removing more than 70,000 American citizens of Japanese origin from their west coast homes and interning them in camps, see Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.\u00a0S. 214 (1944)--an action that at least some officials knew at the time was unnecessary, see id., at 233-242 (Murphy, J., dissenting); P. Irons, Justice at War 202-204, 288 (1983).  President Franklin Roosevelt's Attorney General, perhaps exaggerating, once said that \"[t]he Constitution has not greatly bothered any wartime President.\"  Rehnquist, supra, at 191.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Can we, in respect to actions taken during those periods, rely exclusively, as the Court seems to suggest, upon injunctive remedies or writs of habeas corpus, their retail equivalent?  Complaints seeking that kind of relief typically come during the emergency itself, when emotions are strong, when courts may have too little or inaccurate information, and when courts may well prove particularly reluctant to interfere with even the least well-founded Executive Branch activity.  That reluctance may itself set an unfortunate precedent, which, as Justice Jackson pointed out, can \"li[e] about like a loaded weapon\" awaiting discharge in another case.  Korematsu, supra, at 246 (dissenting opinion).\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A damages action, however, is typically brought after the emergency is over, after emotions have cooled, and at a time when more factual information is available.  In such circumstances, courts have more time to exercise such judicial virtues as calm reflection and dispassionate application of the law to the facts.  We have applied the Constitution to actions taken during periods of war and national-security emergency.  See Boumediene, 553 U.\u00a0S., at 732-733; Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, 542 U.\u00a0S. 507; cf. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.\u00a0S. 579 (1952).  I should think that the wisdom of permitting courts to consider Bivens actions, later granting monetary compensation to those wronged at the time, would follow a\u00a0fortiori.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0As is well known, Lord Atkins, a British judge, wrote in the midst of World War II that \"amid the clash of arms, the laws are not silent.  They may be changed, but they speak the same language in war as in peace.\"  Liversidge v. Anderson, [1942] A. C. 206 (H. L. 1941) 244.  The Court, in my view, should say the same of this Bivens action.\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With respect, I dissent.\n\nFOOTNOTES\nFootnote 1Together with No. 15-1359, Ashcroft, Former Attorney General, et\u00a0al. v.
